https://openalex.org/W2083783640,"FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ), which acts in parallel with the meristem-identity gene LEAFY ( LFY ) to induce flowering of Arabidopsis , was isolated by activation tagging. Like LFY , FT acts partially downstream of CONSTANS ( CO ), which promotes flowering in response to long days. Unlike many other floral regulators, the deduced sequence of the FT protein does not suggest that it directly controls transcription or transcript processing. Instead, it is similar to the sequence of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), an inhibitor of flowering that also shares sequence similarity with membrane-associated mammalian proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053990388,"Flowering in Arabidopsis is promoted via several interacting pathways. A photoperiod-dependent pathway relays signals from photoreceptors to a transcription factor gene, CONSTANS (CO), which activates downstream meristem identity genes such as LEAFY (LFY). FT, together with LFY, promotes flowering and is positively regulated by CO. Loss of FT causes delay in flowering, whereas overexpression of FT results in precocious flowering independent of CO or photoperiod. FT acts in part downstream of CO and mediates signals for flowering in an antagonistic manner with its homologous gene, TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1)."
https://openalex.org/W2171190856,"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare, rapidly fatal, autosomal recessive immune disorder characterized by uncontrolled activation of T cells and macrophages and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. Linkage analyses indicate that FHL is genetically heterogeneous and linked to 9q21.3-22, 10q21-22, or another as yet undefined locus. Sequencing of the coding regions of the perforin gene of eight unrelated 10q21-22–linked FHL patients revealed homozygous nonsense mutations in four patients and missense mutations in the other four patients. Cultured lymphocytes from patients had defective cytotoxic activity, and immunostaining revealed little or no perforin in the granules. Thus, defects in perforin are responsible for 10q21-22–linked FHL. Perforin-based effector systems are, therefore, involved not only in the lysis of abnormal cells but also in the down-regulation of cellular immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2074994056,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) has been shown to inhibit chemotaxis of a variety of cells, in some cases through intracellular actions, while in others through receptor-mediated effects. Surprisingly, we found that low concentrations of SPP (10–100 nm) increased chemotaxis of HEK293 cells overexpressing the G protein-coupled SPP receptor EDG-1. In agreement with previous findings in human breast cancer cells (Wang, F., Nohara, K., Olivera, O., Thompson, E. W., and Spiegel, S. (1999) Exp. Cell Res. 247, 17–28), SPP, at micromolar concentrations, inhibited chemotaxis of both vector- and EDG-1-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Nanomolar concentrations of SPP also induced a marked increase in chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), which express the SPP receptors EDG-1 and EDG-3, while higher concentrations of SPP were less effective. Treatment with pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Gi-coupled receptors, blocked SPP-induced chemotaxis. Checkerboard analysis indicated that SPP stimulates both chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Taken together, these data suggest that SPP stimulates cell migration by binding to EDG-1. Similar to SPP, sphinganine 1-phosphate (dihydro-SPP), which also binds to this family of SPP receptors, enhanced chemotaxis; whereas, another structurally related lysophospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid, did not compete with SPP for binding nor did it have significant effects on chemotaxis of endothelial cells. Furthermore, SPP increased proliferation of HUVEC and BAEC in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. SPP and dihydro-SPP also stimulated tube formation of BAEC grown on collagen gels (in vitro angiogenesis), and potentiated tube formation induced by basic fibroblast growth factor. Pertussis toxin treatment blocked SPP-, but not bFGF-stimulated in vitro angiogenesis. Our results suggest that SPP may play a role in angiogenesis through binding to endothelial cell Gi-coupled SPP receptors.

In agreement, low concentrations of SPP activate Giprotein-gated inward rectifying K+ channels only when applied at the extracellular face of atrial myocytes (16van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D.

Several reports have demonstrated that SPP inhibits cell motility. SPP inhibited chemotactic motility of mouse melanoma B16, mouse fibroblast BALB/3T3 clone A31, and several tumor cell lines at nanomolar concentrations (17Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, SPP immobilized on glass beads markedly inhibited melanoma cell motility. However, pertussis toxin treatment did not block the effect of SPP, suggesting that in these cells SPP acts through a cell surface receptor, independently of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (20Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10751-10759Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, SPP inhibits chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells only at high (micromolar) concentrations, acting independently of EDG-1 (21Wang F. Nohara K. Olivera O. Thompson E.W. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have recently identified SPP as a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor, endothelial differentiation gene-1 (EDG-1) (22Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). EDG-1 binds SPP with remarkable specificity and high affinity (K D = 8 nm) (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22Lee M.-J.

Binding of SPP to EDG-1 resulted in inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (both Gi-mediated), but did not mobilize calcium from internal stores (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J.

J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, Okamoto et al. (12Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) found that in HEL cells overexpressing EDG-1, binding of SPP induced calcium mobilization (12Okamoto H.

Two other related G protein-coupled receptors, EDG-3 and EDG-5, have recently been shown to bind SPP with similar high affinity (14Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T.

Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughling S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In agreement, overexpression of EDG-3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells led to phospholipase C activation and calcium mobilization induced by SPP, which was significantly inhibited by pertussis toxin (26Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Osada M. Murata N. Kuwabara A. Watanabe T. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, low concentrations of SPP mobilize calcium from internal sources in BAEC in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner without activation of phospholipase C (27Meyer zu Heringdrof D. van Koppen C.J. Windorfer B. Himmel H.M. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 397-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of novel, unidentified signaling pathways in SPP-induced release of intracellular calcium. Although the biological functions of the EDG family of GPCR are not completely understood, the EDG-1 transcript was originally cloned as an immediate-early gene induced during differentiation of HUVEC, cells of the vessel wall accessible to platelet-derived ligands, into capillary-like tubules (28Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, SPP signaling in HEK293 cells overexpressing EDG-1 leads, by a Rho-dependent mechanism, to formation of a network of cell-cell aggregates resembling the network formation of differentiated endothelial cells and P-cadherin expression (22Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Because SPP is stored and released from activated platelets and serum concentrations of SPP are estimated to be approximately 0.5 μm (29Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), about 60 times greater than the K D for binding to EDG-1, we suggested that SPP might play an important role in angiogenesis acting through EDG-1 (22Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis, the process of new vessel formation from pre-existing ones, or neovascularization, is a critical event for a variety of physiological processes, such as wound healing, embryonic development, corpus luteum formation, and menstruation. However, angiogenesis can be activated in response to tissue damage and is important in certain pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and cardiovascular diseases (30Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). Conversely, in states of inadequate tissue perfusion, such as myocardial or limb ischemia, enhanced angiogenesis is essential and beneficial (31Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell migration and formation of new capillary tubes are required events in the angiogenic response. In this study, we investigated the potential role of SPP in angiogenesis by examining regulation of endothelial cell motility, proliferation, and tube formation through SPP receptors. IMEM, penicillin/streptomycin,l-glutamine, amphotericin B, fetal calf serum, and fetal bovine serum were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). Medium 199 was from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Calf serum was from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO), and Matrigel, bFGF, endothelial cell growth supplement, and rat tail type I collagen were from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). SPP, dihydro-SPP, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 1-Oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (LPA) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AB). The Diff-Quik kits were from Sigma. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (55 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, ATCC CRL-1573) and HEK293-EDG-1 cells, kindly provided by Drs. Menq-Jer Lee and Timothy Hla, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, with 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate for HEK293-EDG-1, as described previously (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). BAEC were kindly provided by Dr. Luyuan Li and maintained in IMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 1 ng/ml bFGF. HUVECs were isolated as previously reported (32Zukowska-Grojec Z. Karwatowska-Prokopczuk E. Rose W. Rone J. Movafagh S. Ji H. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Kleinman H.K. Grouzmann E. Grant D.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and grown in medium 199 supplemented with gentamycin, 2 mmglutamine, 500 units/dl sodium heparin, 2.5 mg/dl amphotericin B, and 2 mg/dl endothelial cell growth supplement. HUVEC or BAEC were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm deoxypyridoxine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and removed from dishes by scraping. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in binding buffer containing 4 mg/ml BSA. 105 cells were incubated with 0.2 nm[32P]SPP, synthesized enzymatically using recombinant sphingosine kinase (33Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) as described previously (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), in 0.2 ml of binding buffer plus 4 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 1000-fold excess unlabeled SPP or other lipid competitors, added as 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA complexes. Cells were then pelleted at 8,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, washed twice with binding buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, resuspended in binding buffer without BSA and bound [32P]SPP quantitated by scintillation counting. The phosphatase and protease inhibitors were included in the binding assays as a precaution against the possibility that cells which may have been damaged during scraping might leak phosphatases or proteases which could cleave SPP or EDG receptors, respectively. In addition, it has been proposed that cell surface lipid phosphatases which can cleave exogenous SPP exist (34Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, identical specific binding of [32P]SPP was obtained in the absence of the protease and phosphatase inhibitors. It should be pointed out that SPP is not metabolized during the binding assay. When [32P]SPP was incubated in the absence or presence of endothelial cells under the same conditions as the binding assay, no decrease in the amount of [32P]SPP was detected by TLC nor did any additional bands appear. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of EDG-1 was amplified with the Gene Amp RNA-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) using RNA isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) and digested with RNase-free DNase I (RQ-1, Promega). The primers (Life Technologies) used for PCR amplification were 5′-GATATCATCGTCCGGCATTAC and 5′-ACCCTTCCCAGTGCATTGTTC for EDG-1 (28Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 5′-CACTCAGCAATGTACCTGTTCC and 5′-AACACCCAGTACGATGGTGAC forEDG-5 (35Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 50 s. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide. Chemotactic migration of cells in response to a gradient of SPP was measured in a modified Boyden chamber as described previously (21Wang F. Nohara K. Olivera O. Thompson E.W. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, polycarbonate filters (5 μm for BAEC and 8 μm for HUVEC) were coated with gelatin (0.1%) overnight. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with serum-free IMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and were added to the upper wells (24-multiwell Boyden microchambers) at 1 × 105 cells per well; the lower wells contained SPP diluted in serum-free IMEM containing 0.1% BSA. After 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab and the cells which traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik. The number of migratory cells per membrane was enumerated using a microscope with a ×20 objective. Each data point is the average number of cells in four random fields, each counted twice. Each determination represents the average ± S.D. of three individual wells. Checkerboard assays were carried out as described above except that various dilutions of SPP in fatty acid-free BSA were placed in the top and/or bottom wells of the Boyden chamber. In most of the experiments, unless indicated otherwise, cells were serum starved for 2 h prior to the assays. Cells were seeded at an initial density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Confluent BAEC were growth arrested in culture media without bFGF for 48 h and then treated for 24 h with SPP or bFGF. Since the sensitivity of BAEC to stimulation by bFGF and SPP decreased with passage number, all experiments were carried out with cells at less than passage 12. Confluent HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with different concentration of SPP in medium 199 containing 1% FCS and 1000 units/dl heparin for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added 8 h before termination of the assay, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured as described (38Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values are the means of triplicate determinations and standard deviations were routinely less than 10% of the mean. Three-dimensional collagen gel plates (24 well) were prepared by addition of 0.5 ml of a chilled solution of 0.7 mg/ml rat tail type I collagen in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to neutral pH with NaHCO3. After formation of the collagen gel (about 1–2 mm thickness), BAEC were seeded at 50,000 cells/well. At 80% confluency, culture medium was changed to media without bFGF and incubation was continued for 48 h, by which time the cells formed a monolayer on the gel. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of bFGF or SPP as indicated. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C for 48 h and then fixed with cold methanol. The gels were then soaked in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol (1:1) and transferred onto glass slides. The extent of tube-like structures that formed in the gel was measured as total length per field using computer-assisted imaging with a Hamamatsu C2400 video camera and a Zeiss Axioscope microscope to quantitate the extent of tube formation. Three culture wells were used for each sample, and three microscopic fields were examined for each well. Thus, each experimental point represents results from examination of nine microscopic fields. SPP was previously shown to inhibit chemotaxis of mouse melanoma cells by binding to a putative cell surface receptor (20Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10751-10759Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since we have recently identified EDG-1 as a receptor for SPP (22Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the involvement of EDG-1 in SPP-regulated cell motility. Human embryonic kidney 293 fibroblasts stably expressing EDG-1 (HEK293-EDG-1) were selected for these studies since they have high levels of specific SPP binding, whereas SPP binding is nearly undetectable to parental and vector transfected cells (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, low concentrations of SPP (10–100 nm) did not inhibit, but rather enhanced chemotaxis of HEK293-EDG-1cells by 1.5–1.9-fold, while chemotaxis of vector-transfected cells was not altered by these concentrations of SPP (Fig. 1 A). The concentrations of SPP which stimulate chemotaxis of HEK293-EDG-1 cells are in the same range as the measured affinity of EDG-1 for SPP (K D = 8 nm) (22Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and correlate closely with binding and inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These results suggest that low concentrations of SPP may increase chemotaxis by binding to EDG-1. Higher concentration of SPP (1–10 μm), as previously reported in human breast cancer cells (21Wang F. Nohara K. Olivera O. Thompson E.W. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), inhibited, rather than stimulated, chemotaxis of both vector and EDG-1-transfected cells. In contrast to undetectable levels of EDG-1 mRNA in parental and vector transfected HEK293 cells (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P.

Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, a low level of EDG-3 mRNA andEDG-5 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR in these cells (Fig. 2 A). Similar to our previous results (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), both unlabeled SPP and dihydro-SPP effectively competed with [32P]SPP for binding to EDG-1 (data not shown), whereas, LPA and SPC were completely ineffective (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, LPA, even at concentrations as high as 10 μm, and for prolonged incubations, had no significant effect on SPP binding to HEK293-EDG-1 cells. Previously, it has been demonstrated that human endothelial cells express high levels of EDG-1 mRNA (28Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to examine whether the other SPP receptors, EDG-3 and EDG-5 (24Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.

Windorfer B. Himmel H.M. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 397-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies, RT-PCR analysis clearly demonstrated anEDG-1 PCR amplification product of about 1300 base pairs, in agreement with the predicted size (1284 base pairs), in HUVEC and BAEC (Fig. 2, B and C). HUVEC and BAEC also apparently expressed somewhat lower levels of EDG-3 and barely detectable EDG-5 mRNA. It should be noted that the bovine SPP receptor cDNAs have not yet been cloned and sequenced; however, our PCR primers were designed to cover highly conserved regions. Restriction analysis of the HUVEC RT-PCR products yielded fragments of the expected sizes confirming their identity (data not shown). The entire open reading frame of each of the three SPP receptors is encoded within a single exon (40Zhang G. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J.

https://openalex.org/W2083251014,"The inhibition of growth hormone (GH) signaling by five members of the GH-inducible suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS/CIS) family was investigated in transfected COS cells. Complete inhibition of GH activation of the signal transducer STAT5b and STAT5b-dependent transcriptional activity was observed upon expression of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, while partial inhibition (CIS, SOCS-2) or no inhibition (SOCS-6) was seen with other SOCS/CIS family members. SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS each strongly inhibited the GH receptor (GHR)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at low levels of transfected JAK2; however, only SOCS-1 strongly inhibited the GHR-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at higher JAK2 levels. To probe for interactions with GHR, in vitrobinding assays were carried out using glutathioneS-transferase-GHR fusion proteins containing variable lengths of GHR's COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. CIS and SOCS-2 bound to fusions containing as few as 80 COOH-terminal GHR residues, provided the fusion protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated. By contrast, SOCS-3 binding required tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR membrane-proximal sequences, SOCS-1 binding was tyrosine phosphorylation-independent, and SOCS-6 did not bind the GHR fusion proteins at all. Mutation of GHR's membrane-proximal tyrosine residues 333 and 338 to phenylalanine suppressed the inhibition by SOCS-3, but not by CIS, of GH signaling to STAT5b. SOCS/CIS proteins can thus inhibit GH signaling to STAT5b by three distinct mechanisms, distinguished by their molecular targets within the GHR-JAK2 signaling complex, as exemplified by SOCS-1 (direct JAK2 kinase inhibition), SOCS-3 (inhibition of JAK2 signaling via membrane-proximal GHR tyrosines 333 and 338), and CIS and SOCS-2 (inhibition via membrane-distal tyrosine(s))."

In evaluating patients with absent B cells, a male with a homozygous splice defect in the cytoplasmic adapter protein BLNK (B cell linker protein) was identified. Although this patient had normal numbers of pro-B cells, he had no pre-B cells or mature B cells, indicating that BLNK plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition. The immune system and overall growth and development were otherwise normal in this patient, suggesting that BLNK function is highly specific."

The p42/p44 MAP kinases, also named extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), function in a signaling cascade from the plasma membrane to the nucleus that controls cell cycle progression and differentiation and, furthermore, plays a key role in oncogenic transformation (1Cobb M.H.

Mitogens such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) trigger the MAP kinase cascade through activation of Ras via recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. Protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester can also trigger the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, but the mechanism is distinct from that initiated by cell-surface receptors and presumably involves decreased Ras-GAP activity (4Downward J.

Raf then phosphorylates and thereby activates the cytosolic MAP kinase kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn activate the p42/p44 MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Whereas Ras-Raf interaction takes place at the plasma membrane, it remains unclear where MEK activation occurs, at the membrane or in the cytoplasm.

Receptor endocytosis is regulated by dynamin, a 100 kDa GTPase that is targeted to clathrin-coated pits where it oligomerizes around the neck of budding vesicles (reviewed in Ref. 20Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), although its precise mode of action remains to be elucidated (Refs. 21Yang W.

Dynamin with a point mutation in the nucleotide-binding site (K44A) interferes with the function of endogenous dynamin by blocking vesicle internalization before membrane scission occurs (23Damke H.

Neuman M.C. Coscia C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 56-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we and others recently identified endogenous dynamin as a component in the pathway that links LPA and β-adrenergic receptors to MAP kinase activation (24Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the notion that dynamin-regulated internalization of activated receptors is obligatory for MAP kinase activation (16Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4749-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Yet, the emerging picture is far from clear. For example, endocytosis-defective mutant EGF receptors show enhanced rather than reduced mitogenicity (26Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas an endocytosis-defective Gq-coupled muscarinic receptor can still activate MAP kinase in an identical manner to wild-type receptor (27Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, there is no direct evidence that internalization of the activated receptor itself is necessary for MAP kinase activation; in principle, dynamin-controlled endocytosis might regulate any step along the route from cell-surface receptor to MAP kinase. Here we have examined the role of dynamin in activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway by EGF, LPA, and phorbol ester. In particular, we address the question of where dynamin acts in the pathway from activated receptor to MAP kinase. We show that dynamin function is essential for MAP kinase activation by activated MEK, but not for activation of Ras, Raf, or MEK, in response to all agonists tested. We conclude that dynamin-regulated endocytosis of activated MEK, rather than activated receptors, is critical for MAP kinase activation. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were cDNA transfected using the DEAE method as described previously (28Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was as high as 70–80%. The pMT2-dynamin-1 (WT and K44A) constructs were generated by ligating the respective cDNAs (from Dr. A. Van der Bliek, UCLA School of Medicine, CA) into pMT2 using Kpn/Xba. The HA-tagged dynamin-2 cDNAs (from Dr. S. Schmid, The Scripps Research Institute, CA) were cloned into pcDNA3 usingEcoRI/XbaI. Plasmids pMT2-Myc-ERK2 and pMT2-Gα12(QL) have been described before (28Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H.

After stimulation with either LPA (1 μM), EGF (5 ng/ml), or TPA (200 nm), cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and were subsequently lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2). After clearance (14,000 rpm, 10 min), the lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose and either normal mouse serum as a control, a specific monoclonal antiserum against the HA-tag (12CA5), or anti-Raf (R19120; Transduction Labs). After 1 h of tumbling at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and were subsequently run out on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked in 5% milk and were probed with primary antibodies against MAPK (rabbit polyclonal against ERK1 and ERK2, no. 600; generated by Dr. P. Hordijk, Central Laboratory for Blood Transfusion, The Netherlands), MEK1 and MEK2 (no. C18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) MEK, HA-tag (12CA5), phospho-ERK1/2 (no. 9101; Biolabs), phospho-MEK1/2 (no. 9121; Biolabs), dynamin-1 and -2 (no. D25520; Transduction Labs), or against dynamin-2 specifically (no. D27120; Transduction Labs). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO. Signals were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were stimulated and washed as described above. Ras activation was assayed as described (30van Dijk M.C. Postma F. Hilkmann H. Jalink K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The lysates were incubated with 20 μg of GST-Raf(RBD) (expression construct provided by Dr. J. Bos, Laboratory for Physiological Chemistry, The Netherlands) and were washed three times in lysis buffer. The amount of Ras pulled-down was then assessed by Western blotting using anti-Ras antibody (no. R02120; Transduction Labs). In all pull-down experiments, the lysates were pre-cleared using GST. Analysis of Ras binding to GST alone was performed in each assay but was not detected, indicating that Ras binds to GST-RBD in an RBD- and stimulus-dependent manner. The activity of transfected Myc-tagged ERK2 was assessed by anti-Myc (9E10) immunoprecipitation and a subsequent in vitro kinase reaction as described previously (28Kranenburg O. Verlaan I.

Expression of Myc-ERK2 and co-transfected K44A-dynamin-1 or WT-dynamin-2 was assessed by Western blotting of total lysates. The activity of Raf was tested by immunoprecipitation using antibody R19120 (Transduction Labs) and a subsequent in vitro kinase assay as described (31van Dijk M.C. Hilkmann H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In all kinase assays, pre-clears were performed with either normal mouse serum (and rabbit anti-mouse) or normal rabbit serum in combination with protein A-Sepharose. In vitro kinase assays on control immunoprecipitates showed only negligible kinase activity (results not shown). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and, after overnight culture in serum-free medium, were stimulated with either EGF or TPA for 5 min. After stimulation, cells were fixed immediately in ice-cold PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde (10 min). After permeabilization in PBS containing 0.1% TX-100 (2 min), cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (30 min). Coverslips were then incubated with the primary phospho-MEK polyclonal antibody for 1 h and, subsequently, with the secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO, 30 min). The coverslips were then washed and mounted in vectashield to prevent photobleaching. Samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy. After agonist stimulation, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and subsequently scraped in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The cells were then sonicated with 60 1-s pulses. Undisrupted cells were cleared by a short spin (2 min at 3000 rpm; Eppendorf table centrifuge). The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant contains cytosol, whereas the pellet (p100 fraction) contains membranes and cytoskeletal structures. We set out to examine the role of dynamin in MAP kinase activation using monkey kidney COS-7 cells. In these cells, the Ras-MAP kinase cascade is strongly activated by three distinct agonists: (i) EGF which signals via its tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB-1; (ii) LPA, the prototypic G protein-coupled receptor ligand that activates Ras through Gi (32van Corven E.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); and (iii) PKC-activating phorbol ester TPA, which activates Ras in a Sos-independent manner (5Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that EGF, LPA, and TPA induce a 10- to 20-fold increase in MAP kinase (ERK2) activity, as measured by immunoprecipitation of transfected Myc-ERK2 and subsequent in vitro kinase assays. Essentially similar results were obtained in blotting assays using an antibody against active endogenous MAP kinase (see below). Expression of dominant-negative dynamin-K44A (using either the dynamin-1 or dynamin-2 isoform; see below) results in almost complete inhibition of MAP kinase activity induced by both EGF and LPA (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, dynamin-K44A also inhibits MAP kinase activation in response to TPA which bypasses cell-surface receptors. We considered the formal possibility that TPA might signal through ‘transactivation' of a receptor tyrosine kinase (35Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 36Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23110-23117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This possibility is ruled out, however, because the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein abrogates EGF- and LPA-induced activation of both Ras and MAP kinase (28Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) without affecting the responses to TPA (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor amino-(methylphenyl)-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-pyrimidine (PP1; 10 μM) abolished EGF- and LPA-induced, but not TPA-induced, MAP kinase activation (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of dynamin-K44A on MAP kinase activation is not simply attributable to impaired receptor internalization. The above findings suggest that dynamin is required either at the level of Ras-GTP accumulation or at a step downstream of activated Ras, or both. We therefore tested the effect of dynamin-K44A on activation of Ras, Raf, and MEK. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of dynamin-K44A has no effect on agonist-induced Ras activation. In control experiments, Ras activation is markedly reduced after expression of activated Gα12 subunits, which bind to and thereby activate Ras-GAP (37Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We next tested whether dynamin-K44A may interfere with the activation of Raf-1, MEK or MAP kinase. Fig. 4 A shows that activation of Raf-1 by either EGF or TPA, as measured in an in vitrokinase reaction, is not affected by expression of dynamin-K44A. The same lysates were analyzed for the presence of activated MEK and MAP kinase using phospho-specific antibodies against the activated kinases. Fig. 4 A shows that dynamin-K44A inhibits MAP kinase activation without affecting MEK activation. In contrast, overexpression of WT-dynamin-1 does not abrogate MAP kinase activation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of dynamin-K44A is because of interference with endogenous dynamin activity, rather than to any nonspecific effect caused by dynamin overexpression (Fig. 4 B). Instead, it is seen that overexpression of WT-dynamin-1 potentiates the activation of both endogenous and transfected MAP kinase (Fig. 4 B), without affecting MEK activation (Fig. 4 B, right panel). These results indicate that the activation of MAP kinase by MEK, rather than any upstream event, is regulated by dynamin. Mammalian cells express three closely related dynamin isoforms: dynamin-1 is exclusively found in neuronal cells, dynamin-2 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas dynamin-3 is predominantly expressed in testis (38Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 39van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of dynamin-2 and dynamin-1 on the regulation of MAP kinase activation. As with dynamin-1-K44A, we find that dynamin-2-K44A inhibits MAP kinase activation but not MEK activation by EGF. In addition, overexpression of WT dynamin-2 (like dynamin-1) potentiates MAP kinase activation in response to receptor stimulation (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the actions of dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 in regulating the MAP kinase activation pathway are indistinguishable. The above data strongly suggest that dynamin-regulated endocytosis of activated MEK from the plasma membrane is required for MAP kinase activation. Whereas activated MAP kinase can translocate to the nucleus, activated MEK remains in the cytoplasm (6Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar,7Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We analyzed the subcellular distribution of endogenous activated MEK by immunofluorescence, using an antibody against phosphorylated MEK. In nonstimulated cells, only a faint, diffuse staining was observed. After stimulation with EGF or TPA, however, activated MEK is detected both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 5 A). Although the endocytic nature of these vesicles remains to be confirmed, the results provide support for the notion that activated MEK is internalized from the plasma membrane following stimulation of cells with either receptor ligands or phorbol ester. Consistent with this, subcellular fractionation reveals that, whereas the total MEK pool is largely cytosolic, activated MEK is recovered in the particulate fraction consisting of membranes and cytoskeleton, but not in the cytosol (Fig. 5 B). These experiments also reveal that only a relatively small fraction of total MEK is activated after agonist stimulation, presumably the pool that is localized to the plasma membrane. A number of reports have suggested that activation of MAP kinase by receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors requires their internalization. However, the mechanism whereby receptor endocytosis may contribute to MAP kinase activation has remained elusive to date, although it has recently been suggested that the endocytosis-dependent step may be localized downstream of an activated Ras-Raf complex (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We have shown here that dynamin controls the MAP kinase cascade at the level of MEK-induced MAP kinase activation, with no apparent role for dynamin-regulated receptor internalization. This conclusion is based on several findings. First, dynamin-K44A inhibits MAP kinase activation in response not only to receptor agonists (EGF, LPA) but, importantly, also to phorbol ester which bypasses cell-surface receptors. Hence, there is no need to invoke a role for receptor internalization to explain the inhibitory action of dynamin-K44A on MAP kinase activation. Second, dynamin-K44A has no effect on activation of the upstream components in the cascade, notably Ras, Raf, and MEK. Third, activated MEK is detected at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, even though the majority of the total MEK pool is cytosolic, as revealed by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies."

We have shown previously that Smad3 is required for the growth inhibitory activity of TGF-β, whereas overexpression of Smads is not sufficient to activate the expression of p21 in HaCaT cells. These data suggest that an additional signaling pathway may be involved in stimulating p21 in HaCaT cells. Given the recent finding that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can cause p21 induction and arrest cells, we examined the involvement of this pathway for p21 and p15 induction by TGF-β. We found that TGF-β can regulate the MAPK pathway, leading to the increased transactivation ability of transcription factor Elk. Constitutively active components in the MAPK pathway activate p21 expression, and inhibitors or dominant negative constructs for the MAPK pathway significantly decrease p21 induction by TGF-β. Both constitutively active MEK and inhibitors for MEK have no effect on Smad activity, including DNA binding, localization, and interaction with coactivator p300/CBP. These findings suggest that the MAPK pathway may be an independent pathway that is involved in p21 and p15 induction by TGF-β.

Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholarand 2Hu P.P.-C. Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, growth inhibition is thought to depend on the ability of TGF-β1 to increase synthesis of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p15. Increased p21 leads to an increase in its association with cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 and a decrease in cyclin-CDK complex activity. Increased p15 expression leads to an increase in association and sequestration of CDK4 and CDK6 from the regulatory cyclin partners. On the cell membrane, TGF-β ligand binds to the type II receptor, which recruits the type I receptor into the complex. The type I receptor is phosphorylated by the type II receptor kinase and, when activated, phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, allowing them to heteromerize with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad3 can bind to DNA with the consensus sequence GTCTAGAC that is found in the promoters of many TGF-β-regulated genes (3Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W.

Smad3 is also required for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition because murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Smad3 have lost their ability to become growth inhibited by TGF-β (13Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Smads are required for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest, the mechanism underlying their action is still unknown. In HaCaT cells, TGF-β induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p15 correlates with both Smad nuclear translocation as well as growth arrest, but when Smad3 and Smad4 are overexpressed, they are unable to activate p21 and p15 transcription. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 is sufficient to activate transcription of plasminogen activator inhibitor (14Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), which contains Smad-binding elements in its promoter region (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

This suggests that even though Smads may be required for growth inhibition by TGF-β, they are not sufficient to drive the transcription of p21 and p15, indicating that other pathways may also be needed for the transcriptional induction of p21 and p15 upon TGF-β treatment. Contrary to their role as the mediators of many mitogens, the MAPKs have been recently implicated in cellular growth arrest and senescence. Overexpression of Raf leads to growth arrest by impinging directly on the cell cycle through increasing p21 expression, leading to its association and concomitant inhibition of CDKs (16Lloyd A.C. Obermuller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In addition, altering the cellular ratio of existing Ras and Rho proteins can also lead to stimulation of p21 (18Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). TGF-β can also increase GTP-bound Ras, and activate MAPK pathway in other cell types (19Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway can induce transcription of p21, in this study we asked whether this pathway was involved in the ability of TGF-β to stimulate p21 and p15 expression. Here, we show that overexpression of constitutively active forms of different components in the MAPK cascade can substitute for the ability of TGF-β to stimulate p15 and p21 reporter activity. Stable lines overexpressing a constitutively active form of MEK, MEK Q56P (20Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), also have increased expression of p21. Furthermore, inhibitors of this pathway prevent TGF-β induction of p21 and reduce TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in parental HaCaT cells. In contrast, TGF-β activation of Smad signaling is not affected by these inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that the MAPK pathway is involved in p21 up-regulation by TGF-β. The human p21 and p15 minimal promoter constructs, p21P93S and p15P113S, have been described previously (21Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol.

GAL4-Sp1 and GAL4-Sp3 full-length, GAL4-Sp1, and Sp3 B domain constructs have been were described previously (22Li J.M. Datto M.B. Shen X. Hu P.P. Yu Y. Wang X.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GAL4-Elk, Ras 17A, Raf-N4, Raf-CAAX, MEK S218/222D, Rac 17N, cdc42 17N, MKK4/SEK-1, and SEK-AL constructs were the generous gift of Dr. Channing Der. The MEK Q56P pBABE-puro construct was the generous gift of Dr. Scott Lowe. HaCaT cells were the gift of Dr. Baukamp and Dr. Fusenig. HaCaT were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc) in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For luciferase assays, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity in the lysates were assayed by integrating total light emission over 30 s using a Berthold luminometer. The luciferase activities were normalized based on the amount of expressed β-galactosidase activity expressed from co-transfected pCMV-β-galactosidase. Cells were lysed in universal lysis buffer (ULB) as described previously (10Shen X. Hu P.P.-C. Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.-F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts of each sample were resolved on a 12% acrylamide-0.5% bisacrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies used were: anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-19), p15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20), anti-Smad-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-2), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad). Western blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to two copies of the Smad3-binding consensus element (GTCTAGAC) were synthesized. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and nuclear extracts preparation were performed as described previously (8Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E. Frederick J. Datto M. Liberati N. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The MEK Q56P DNA construct inserted into the retroviral vector pBABE puro was a generous gift from Scott Lowe. Amphotrophic pBabe-puro-MEK Q56P retrovirus was then created using standard techniques (23Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). A control retrovirus was also generated. HaCaT cells were infected with the retroviruses and grown 10% fetal bovine serum α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.6 μg/ml puromycin for (pBabe-puro-MEK Q56P) or 300 μg/ml hygromycin (control) for several days. Cells were plated on coverslips and grown overnight. The next day, cells were treated with TGF-β for 30 min, fixed in paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Slips were then incubated in primary (anti-Smad-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-2) and secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C with frequent washes. Slips were then mounted and photographs taken on a Zeiss confocal microscope. Approximately 200 μg of proteins from cells lysed in ULB were incubated with protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and α-Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for immunoprecipitation experiments or glutathione-Sepharose bound GST-p300C (20 μg) for GST pull-down experiments. Binding reactions were for 2 h at 4 °C with continual rotation. The beads were collected and washed three times (3 min/wash) with ULB. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Activation of the MAPK pathway leads to phosphorylation of transcription factor substrates such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and c-Myc and subsequently increases their transactivation potential (reviewed in Refs. 24Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar and 25Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Elk-1 appears to be a good substrate for ERK1/2 in vitro, and its phosphorylation kinetics correlate with MAPK activation. To investigate whether MAPK pathway is activated upon TGF-β treatment, a GAL4-protein fused to Elk-1 and a reporter containing five concatemerized GAL4 sites (5× GAL4) in its promoter were transfected into HaCaT cell. As shown in Fig. 1, TGF-β treatment of transfected cells leads to increased luciferase expression from the 5× GAL4 reporter. This result suggests that TGF-β is potentially able to regulate and activate the MAPK pathway in HaCaT cells. Although overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 was not sufficient to induce p21 reporter activity, the recent discovery that activation of the Ras pathway could stimulate p21 expression prompted us to test this observation in HaCaT cells, our model system for studying TGF-β signaling. To ascertain whether the MAPK pathway was sufficient to induce p21 reporter activity, we overexpressed a constitutively activated form of MEK (S218/222E) in HaCaT cells and treated the transfected cells with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 2 A, overexpression of the activated MEK1 not only dramatically increases basal p21 and p15 reporter activity in the absence of TGF-β but also almost completely substitutes for the TGF-β effect, suggesting that TGF-β signaling may overlap with this pathway to stimulate p21 transcription. Because the responsive element in the p21 promoter has been mapped to a GC-rich, Sp1-binding element (21Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and GAL4-Sp1 but not GAL4-Sp3 (22Li J.M. Datto M.B. Shen X. Hu P.P. Yu Y. Wang X.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) can mediate TGF-β-dependent transcription when using the 5× GAL4 reporter, we tested whether MEK could stimulate GAL4-Sp1 or GAL4-Sp3-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 B, GAL4-Sp1 but not GAL4-Sp3 mediated transcription activation with expression of the constitutively active MEK (S218/222E). This response parallels the effect of TGF-β. To determine whether overexpression of other members of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway were also able to sufficiently induce p15 and p21 promoter activities, we performed similar experiments with a constitutively membrane-bound form of Raf (Raf-CAAX) and Ras (Ras61L). For both p21 and GAL4-Sp1-dependent transcription, the constitutively active form of Raf activated transcription robustly (Fig. 2). Ras61L also activated transcription from p21 promoter, although the effect was not as strong as that of Raf-CAAX (data not shown). This difference in the ability of Ras and Raf-1 mutants to activate the p21 promoter may be the result of a difference in either the expression levels of those proteins or their intrinsic activity. In contrast, overexpression of MKK4/SEK1 and MKK4 dominant negatives (SEKAL) did not influence basal or TGF-β-dependent p21 reporter activity (Fig. 2). To determine whether overexpression of MEK could increase endogenous expression of p21, we used a retroviral construct containing a MEK point mutant Q56P that is constitutively active (20Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Stable mass populations of infected human fibroblasts with this retrovirus after selection with puromycin express higher levels of p21 (20Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in our stable mass populations of HaCaT cells with an increase in endogenous p21 protein levels (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, although the p21 levels are highly abundant in these cells, they remain viable and appear to divide as rapidly as parental HaCaT cells. However, morphologically, these cells are larger, and there seems to be an increase in extracellular matrix deposition (data not shown). Recent reports suggest that TGF-β and other ligands such as epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor can induce Smad-2 phosphorylation, translocation, and nuclear function through the MAPKs (26de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Others suggest that activation of the MAPKs can lead to a Smad phosphorylation event that prevents its nuclear localization (27Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). With our MEK Q56P-infected HaCaT cells, we were able to investigate whether constitutively active MEK could affect Smad signaling and therefore to determine whether the MAPK pathway lay upstream of Smad signaling or could cross-talk and inhibit Smad function. We found that HaCaT cells infected with MEK Q56P behave normally in regard to Smad activity. Upon TGF-β treatment, an inducible complex is still observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the Smad-binding element as a probe (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the overexpression of MEK Q56P in those cells does not influence the ability of Smads to translocate into the nucleus upon TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether TGF-β could exert growth inhibitory effect on those cells, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated during a 2-h period was measured after 18 h TGF-β treatment. With Smad signaling not affected by MEK Q56P overexpression, it is not surprising that TGF-β can still potently inhibit the proliferation of those cells (Fig. 3 D). To determine whether the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade was required for the ability of TGF-β to induce p21, p15, as well as GAL4-Sp1-mediated transcription, dominant negative Ras (Ras 17A) or Raf (Raf-N4) were co-expressed in HaCaT cells with the p21 minimal promoter reporter (p21P93S), the p15 minimal promoter reporter (p15P113S), or GAL4-Sp1B with the 5× GAL4 minimal reporter and treated with TGF-β for 20–24 h. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the ability of TGF-β to stimulate p21 and p15 promoters was abrogated by co-expression of the dominant negative Ras. Raf-1 dominant negative has a similar effect on the p15 promoter, but to p21 promoter the effect is not as dramatic as that of the Ras dominant negative (Fig. 4 A). Again, this difference in the ability of Ras and Raf-1 dominant negative mutants to block the TGF-β-mediated induction of those promoters may be the result of a difference in either the expression levels of those proteins or their intrinsic activity. Nevertheless, these results suggest that both Ras and Raf are potentially required for TGF-β to stimulate promoter activities of p15 and p21. As controls, the same experiments were performed with a Cdc42 17N dominant negative as well as a Rac 17N dominant negative; in both cases the ability of TGF-β to induce the p21 reporter was not affected (Fig. 4 B). This is similar to a previously reported study where a dominant negative Ras (17N) can block the ability of TGF-β3 to induce p27 and p21 in epithelial cells (28Yue J. Buard A. Mulder K.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether MEK was required for TGF-β to stimulate the expression of endogenous p21 and p15. A new MEK inhibitor, U0126 (Promega), was recently developed and found to be more potent than the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, at specifically blocking MEK and ERK activity, without affecting the activity of other ERK family members, p38 and JNK. The availability of this compound allowed us to test the in vivo significance of MEK activity in TGF-β stimulation of p21 and p15 expression. Cells were treated with U0126 at concentrations of 10 or 70 μm for 30 min before treatment with TGF-β for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the ability of TGF-β to induce p21 and p15 protein expression was dramatically reduced in the presence of the inhibitor. In contrast, CDK2 levels and basal levels of p21 and p15 remain relatively unchanged. Other specific experimental controls were performed. The ability of Smad3 to bind to Smad4 upon TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4 E) and the ability of Smad3 to bind to GST-p300C (Fig. 4 E) were not affected by incubation with 70 μm U0126, strongly implying that a nonspecific blockage of TGF-β type I receptor kinase activity does not occur at the concentration of 70 μm for the inhibitor U0126. In addition, basal phospho-p38 levels do not change with incubation of 70 μm U0126 (data not shown), suggesting that this inhibitor acts as a specific MEK/MAPK inhibitor. To determine the consequences of the inability of TGF-β to induce p21 and p15 expression, we measured the ability of TGF-β to cause growth inhibition in the presence of the inhibitor using [3H]thymidine labeling. Exponentially growing cells were treated with TGF-β in the presence of increasing concentrations of U0126 for 18 h and pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for the final 2 h. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the ability of TGF-β to inhibit growth is reduced with increasing concentrations of U0126. In addition, the cells treated with U0126 do not develop the morphological changes normally associated with TGF-β treatment (data not shown). Our results and those of others suggest that Ras activation may be a part of the TGF-β signaling pathway required for p21 induction. The molecular link between Ras activation and the TGF-β receptor complex, however, remains unknown. Because one mechanism for the activation of Ras by many mitogenic signals often involves the activation of tyrosine kinases, we explored this possibility by using herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity (29Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the ability of TGF-β to increase p21 protein expression is significantly reduced upon incubation of HaCaT cells with 1 μm herbimycin A, suggesting that a tyrosine kinase may be involved in mediating the TGF-β signal. A paradigm is emerging whereby multiple signals use the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling cascade to induce p21 and cause growth arrest. In mammalian cells, signals such as TGF-β, myogenesis, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, high levels of extracellular calcium, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, the mycotoxin fumonsin B1, UV radiation, and the geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 (21Datto M.B.

A. 1995; 17710: 19244-28491Google Scholar) have all been shown to induce p21 expression as well as growth arrest. In addition, most of these signals appear to signal through Sp1- and Sp3-binding response elements in the p21 promoter. Activation of the MAPK pathway could be a common pathway these signals may utilize to stimulate p21 expression. Interestingly, in budding yeast an analogous situation occurs during pheromone-induced response, where a MAPK-like (STE 20, STE11, STE 7, Fus3/Kss1) pathway is activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor STE12, a subsequent increase in transcription of Far1, the yeast equivalent of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and cell cycle arrest (37Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Like STE12, phosphorylation of Sp1 by the MAPKs may be one mechanism by which transcription of p21 is increased in these cells. TGF-β can activate different MAPK members to stimulate transcriptional events. In a recent report by Hocevar et al.(38Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TGF-β was shown to stimulate JNK activity to increase fibronectin synthesis in a Smad4-independent manner. Increases in SAPK/JNK activity have been reported elsewhere (39Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), as have increases in ERK (40Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar, 41Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Lett. 1997; 117: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the available phospho-specific antibodies for JNK, p38, and ERK and performed time-dependent Western blots to ascertain which MAPK family member is regulated by TGF-β in our system. Although GAL4-Elk-mediated transcription is indeed increased upon TGF-β treatment, in HaCaT cells these three MAPK family members do not appear to be significantly regulated by TGF-β (data not shown). This result suggests that some other MAPK-like family proteins may be regulated by TGF-β. Although TGF-β-activated kinase, a MAPK kinase kinase homolog responsive to TGF-β, is one such candidate (42Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), expression of a dominant negative of TGF-β-activated kinase does not block the ability of TGF-β to stimulate p21 expression (data not shown). It is intriguing to speculate on how TGF-β turns on the MAPK pathway. Multiple signals can activate MAPK signaling through different pathways. In tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, upon addition of ligand such as platelet-derived growth factor, the receptor protein tyrosine kinase is autophosphorylated and recruits adaptor molecules such as Grb2 and SOS. SOS can, in turn, associate with Ras and which results in Ras becoming GTP-bound. In budding yeast, the serpentine receptors become activated during mating, causing dissociation of Gα from Gβγ, which can then activate a MAPK-like (STE 20, STE11, STE 7, Fus3/Kss1) cascade (37Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The ability of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, to prevent TGF-β induction of p21 suggests that a tyrosine kinase activity is required for its effect. Although specific tyrosine residues on the TGF-β type II receptor may be phosphorylated (Tyr259, Tyr336, and Tyr424) (reviewed in Ref. 43Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar), it remains to be discovered whether these residues contribute to TGF-β signaling function. Smad proteins play a pivotal role in TGF-β signaling pathway, and here we show that MAPK pathway is also essential for p21 induction by TGF-β. How Smads functionally relate to the MAPK pathway and potentiate growth arrest activity for TGF-β is still unclear. Previous experiments suggest that Smads are required for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest but on the other hand, overexpression of Smads may not be sufficient for the p21 induction. Our data indicate that the MAPK pathway does not function upstream of Smads because cells stably overexpressing constitutively activated MEK Q56P do not show an effect on TGF-β-induced Smad localization or DNA binding. Therefore, the MAPK pathway could be a distinct, parallel pathway from Smad signaling. Alternatively, it could play a role as a downstream effector of Smad signaling, although if the latter scenario is the case, at least another signal input in addition to Smads is probably needed to activate the MAPK/p21 pathway. In certain cells, this other signal may already be constitutively activated, as is likely the case in hepatic cells where overexpressed Smads alone can stimulate p21 promoter activity (44Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because in HaCaT cells activation of the MAPK pathway alone, but not Smad3/Smad4 overexpression, is sufficient to stimulate p21 expression and in hepatic cells overexpression of Smads alone can also stimulate p21, it is more likely that the MAPK pathway acts downstream of Smads. It is possible that Smad3 can also act as a required intermediate cytoplasmic protein, in addition to its role in the nucleus that mediates the association between the TGF-β receptors and Ras. In supporting this possibility, a recent report showed that Smad3 may associate with other novel cytoplasmic adaptor proteins such as SARA to modulate appropriate TGF-β signaling (45Tsukazaki T.

The damaged DNA binding function of DDB requires both DDB1 (p125, 127 kDa) and DDB2 (p48, 48 kDa) gene products, which are believed to be subunits of DDB (2Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F.

However, microinjection of purified DDB complements the repair deficiencies in XP-E cells lacking the damaged-DNA binding activity of DDB (8Keeney S. Eker A.P. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that DDB functions as a repair protein in the context of chromatin structure and that it alters chromatin conformation to enhance repair at the damaged sites (4Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Otrin V.R. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results also suggest that damaged DNA recognition function of DDB is downstream of p53. Induced expression of p53 causes an increase in the expression of p48 mRNA (9Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Moreover, p48 mRNA expression is increased upon DNA damage in p53 +/+ cells, but not in p53 −/− cells. Two mutants, 2RO and 82TO, have been characterized from XP-E patients. These mutants harbor single amino acid substitutions, R273H (2RO) and K244E (82TO), in the WD motif of p48 (DDB2 gene product) (10Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These mutant p48 proteins are impaired in their ability to cooperate with the p125 subunit in damaged DNA binding assays (4Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell.

DDB associates with the C-terminal activation domain of E2F1 and cooperates with E2F1 to stimulate transcription from an E2F1-regulated promoter (13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of DDB can overcome retinoblastoma inhibition of the E2F1-activated transcription (13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The transcriptional function depends upon both p48 and p125 subunits. The mutants 2RO and 82TO exhibit a deficiency in their transcriptional function (11Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The p125 subunit of DDB has been shown to associate with several viral and cellular proteins. For example, p125 has been shown to bind the hepatitis B virus X protein, which is a potent activator of transcription (14Lee T.H. Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p125 also interacts with the V proteins encoded by paramyxovirus SV5, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus, and measles virus (15Lin G.Y. Paterson R.G. Richardson C.D. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1998; 249: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A recent study indicated an interaction between p125 and the C-terminal cytosolic region of the Alzheimer's precursor protein (16Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S.

While the significance of many of these interactions is yet to be determined, the functional interaction between DDB and E2F1 suggests a role for DDB in the cell cycle. CUL-4A is a member of the cullin family of proteins that are believed to be regulators of the cell cycle (17Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Hedgecock E.M.

The members of the cullin family possess extensive sequence homology among each other and, therefore, are believed to have similar biochemical function (17Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.-W.

CUL-1, the most well characterized cullin, was shown to be involved in cell cycle exit in Caenorhabditis elegans (17Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The yeast homologue of CUL-1, cdc53, has been shown to be involved in proteolysis of the cell cycle inhibitor Sic1p and the G1 cyclins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (19Feldman R.M.R.

It has been proposed that CUL-1 and the other members of the cullin family function as E3 ligases, which are involved in selecting specific targets for ubiquitination (21Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This notion is consistent with the observation that the cullins associate with other proteins involved in the ubiquitination of target proteins (21Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Targets for the human cullins are not known. It has been shown that CUL-1 associates with the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin A through an interaction with SKP1 (22Michel J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 439-445Google Scholar). Here, we show that CUL-4A remains endogenously associated with DDB, suggesting the possibility that CUL-4A targets DDB or a DDB-associated protein involved in cell cycle regulation or DNA repair. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2. Spinner cultures of HeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium containing 5% calf serum. Plasmids used in this study have been described previously (11Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DNA transfection was performed by the calcium-phosphate precipitation procedure as described previously (13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were carried out following previously described procedures (11Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For large scale immunopurification of DDB-binding proteins, 5–30 plates (10 cm) of U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing T7 epitope-tagged p48 proteins. Cells were harvested after 36 h of removal of the DNA precipitates. The harvested cells were lysed by suspending and incubating in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further cleared by filtration through 0.22 μ low protein binding filters. Agarose-linked T7 antibody, which was further cross-linked as described in Hayes et al. (13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was used to immunopurify the DDB-binding proteins. Trypsin digestion of gel bands containing DDB-binding proteins were performed in Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). The sequence analyses of the tryptic peptides were carried out in the same facility by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. A chemically synthesized peptide, with the sequence ERDKDNPNQYHYVA, corresponding to human CUL-4A was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The conjugate was used for rabbit immunization and antiserum production. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared following the procedure of Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). The heparin-agarose fractionation was carried out essentially following a previously described procedure (13Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One milligram of sonicated salmon sperm DNA or sonicated salmon sperm DNA that was irradiated with 2 J/cm square of UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) was linked to 4 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B following the procedure of Kadonagaet al. (24Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Columns containing 0.8 ml of the affinity beads were used for chromatography of the heparin-agarose-purified DDB. The columns were equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1m KCl. The heparin-agarose fraction was dialyzed against an excess of buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl for 4 h. The dialyzed material was incubated with 5 μg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and then applied three times onto the affinity columns. After loading, the columns were washed with 4 ml of buffer A containing 0.1m KCl followed by elution with buffer A containing 0.3m KCl (3.2 ml) and 0.7 m KCl (3.2 ml). In an attempt to understand the function of DDB, we looked for cellular proteins that interact with the p48 subunit of DDB. Plasmids expressing T7 epitope-tagged p48 or the naturally occurring mutants of p48 (82TO and 2RO) were transfected into U2OS cells. The extracts of the transfected or mock-transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody against T7 that is covalently linked to Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. We detected several polypeptides co-immunoprecipitating with the T7 antibody from the extracts of cells expressing the T7-p48 proteins, but not from the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1). The bands migrating just below the 55-kDa marker corresponded to the wild-type or the mutant p48 proteins, as they were the only bands recognized by the T7 antibody in Western blots (not shown). The band migrating slightly above the 116-kDa marker corresponded to p125, as that was the only band detected by the p125 antibody in Western blot (not shown). As expected, the p48 transgene product co-immunoprecipitated p125, and the pattern of p125 co-precipitation with the wild-type and the mutant p48 was consistent with our previous observation in showing that the mutant 2RO failed to bind p125 (11Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There were several polypeptides of molecular mass ranging between 55 and 70 kDa specifically co-immunoprecipitated with DDB from transfected cells (Fig. 1). These polypeptides were co-immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with both wild-type and mutant p48. Interestingly, a polypeptide of about 80–85 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated specifically with the wild-type p48 and 82TO, but not with 2RO (marked with anarrow, Fig. 1). The overall band intensity in the lane for 82TO was low, but a darker stain did detect the 80–85-kDa polypeptide in that lane (not shown). To identify the polypeptides, the gel bands from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel were excised and were subjected to tryptic digestion and sequence analyses. We focused on the 80–85-kDa polypeptide because of its specificity. The sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA) by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC tandem mass spectrometry on a Finigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Four of the tryptic peptides obtained from the 80–85-kDa polypeptide corresponded to CUL-4A, whereas three others corresponded to both CUL-4A and CUL-4B (Fig. 2). CUL-4A and CUL-4B are extremely homologous (about 88% identical) (21Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar); therefore, it is very likely that the 80–85-kDa polypeptide co-immunoprecipitating with DDB is CUL-4A. However, the possibility that both CUL-4A and CUL-4B co-immunoprecipitated with DDB cannot be ruled out. The interaction between DDB and CUL-4A is interesting because of the following reasons. First, a naturally occurring mutant of DDB, 2RO, failed to associate with CUL-4A. The patient harboring the 2RO mutation developed skin cancer at an early age of 14 (25de Weerd-Kastelein E.A. Keijzer W. Bootsma D. Mutat. Res. 1974; 22: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, CUL-4A was shown to be amplified and up-regulated in breast cancers (26Chen L.-C. Manjeshwar S. Lu Y. Moore D. Ljung B.-M. Kuo W.-L Dairkee S.H. Wernick M. Colins C. Smith H.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3677-3683PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to confirm the interaction by biochemical and immunochemical methods. A peptide antiserum specific for CUL-4A was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antiserum specifically recognized an 80–85-kDa polypeptide in Western blots of crude extracts (data not shown). This CUL-4A-specific antiserum was employed to detect co-immunoprecipitation of CUL-4A with DDB. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the T7 epitope-tagged p48 proteins. The transfected cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation by using an agarose-linked monoclonal antibody against the T7 epitope. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis. The blot was cut into two pieces across the molecular mass region of 68 kDa. (CUL-4A is about 80–85 kDa and p48 migrates as a 42-kDa band.) The upper part of the blot was probed with the CUL-4A antibody and the lower part with T7 antibody. The T7 antibody detected the expression of the p48 transgene products. The wild-type and the two mutants, 82TO and 2RO, were expressed at approximately similar levels (Fig. 3). Consistent with the experiment in Fig. 1, both wild-type and 82TO co-immunoprecipitated CUL-4A, whereas 2RO failed to co-immunoprecipitate CUL-4A (Fig. 3, upper panel). This result also confirmed the observation that DDB associates with CUL-4A. The interaction with CUL-4A could be an artifact of overexpression of the DDB proteins. For example, CUL-4A might target only misfolded DDB for proteolysis. Therefore, we investigated to ascertain an interaction between the endogenous gene products. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were fractionated to see whether CUL-4A co-purifies with DDB. HeLa nuclear extracts were first fractionated by heparin-agarose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, extracts were applied onto the column at 0.1 m KCl. After loading, the column was successively washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer containing 0.1m KCl and 0.25 m KCl. The column was finally eluted with a linear gradient (10 bed volumes) of KCl from 0.25 to 0.75m. The column fractions were analyzed for the DDB proteins and CUL-4A by Western blot assays. The blots were cut across the molecular mass regions of 98 and 68 kDa to obtain three pieces, which were separately probed with antibodies for p125, p48, and CUL-4A. We made two significant observations in this experiment. First, CUL-4A co-purified with p48 as well as p125, the subunits of DDB (Fig. 4 A). Second, p125 appears to be much more abundant than p48 in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 A). It is possible that p125 has a longer half-life. On the other hand, it might be indicative of additional functions of p125 that do not involve p48. In any event, a clear peak of p125 co-migrated with p48 and CUL-4A in the gradient fractions (Fig. 4 A), which is congruent with the notion that the endogenous CUL-4A and DDB remain associated. To further investigate the co-purification of CUL-4A with DDB, we employed an affinity column specific for UV-damaged DNA-binding proteins. DDB was shown to possess high affinity for UV-damaged DNA, and it was purified using UV-damaged DNA affinity column (1Hwang B.J. Chu G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The heparin-agarose fractions containing the two DDB polypeptides and CUL-4A were pooled and dialyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dialyzed material (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The material was then divided in two parts, and approximately equal amounts of the material were loaded onto affinity columns containing either double-stranded DNA-Sepharose or UV-damaged DNA-Sepharose. The material containing the salmon sperm DNA was loaded by gravity flow. The flow-through materials were collected as 0.1 m KCl eluate. After an extensive wash with buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, the columns were successively eluted with 4 bed volumes of buffers containing 0.3 m KCl and 0.7 m KCl. Aliquots of each of the three fractions (0.1m KCl, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.7 m KCl) were analyzed by Western blot, as in the previous experiment. The three pieces of the blot were probed with three different antibodies specific for p125, p48, and CUL-4A. Clearly, a significant part of CUL-4A co-purified with DDB and eluted by high salt from the UV-damaged DNA column (Fig. 4 B). This result is consistent with the notion that in HeLa cell nuclear extract CUL-4A remains tightly bound to DDB and that CUL-4A binds to functionally active molecules of DDB. During this analysis, we consistently observed a 170-kDa band, marked by anasterisk, recognized by the p125 antibody co-purifying with p125. It is possible that this polypeptide corresponds to a p125-related protein that binds to UV-damaged DNA. This 170-kDa band might also represent a modified form of p125. Results presented here suggest that CUL-4A has a high affinity for DDB in mammalian cells, and a significant part of CUL-4A remains associated with DDB in HeLa nuclear extracts. CUL-4A is mainly a nuclear protein, as only a small part (about 20%) is detected in the cytosolic extracts (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 4, greater than 50% of CUL-4A co-purified with DDB through a damaged DNA affinity column, suggesting that DDB is one of the primary targets of CUL-4A. CUL-4A has been shown to be amplified and up-regulated in breast cancers (26Chen L.-C. Manjeshwar S. Lu Y. Moore D. Ljung B.-M. Kuo W.-L Dairkee S.H. Wernick M. Colins C. Smith H.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3677-3683PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, it is interesting that it targets DDB that has also been implicated in tumorigenesis. For example, a mutation in the p48 gene that leads to an inactivation of DDB function correlates with the development of skin cancer (25de Weerd-Kastelein E.A. Keijzer W. Bootsma D. Mutat. Res. 1974; 22: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on its homology with other cullins, CUL-4A is believed to be an E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination of target proteins (21Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). (However, a direct evidence that CUL-4A possesses ubiquitin-ligase activity is yet to be seen.) It is possible that a key function of CUL-4A is to target DDB for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In this scenario, a high level of CUL-4A expression (as in many breast cancers) would efficiently reduce the cellular levels of the DDB, accomplishing a result similar to that observed in DDB mutation. DDB may not be the ubiquitination target of CUL-4A. For example, CUL-1, which is believed to be involved in ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin A, interacts with cyclin A indirectly through SKP1 (22Michel J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 439-445Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that CUL-4A targets a DDB-associated protein such as E2F1. It has been shown that E2F1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (27Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, proteins that associate with DDB in its DNA repair pathway may also be targets of CUL-4A. We speculate that loss of DDB or loss of other components in the pathway of DDB function would have similar effect. Surprisingly, we observed that a complex of CUL-4A and DDB could bind UV-damaged DNA. DDB has a high affinity for UV-damaged DNA and is believed to be involved in DNA damage recognition (5Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Microinjection of DDB in repair-deficient XP-E cells can complement the deficiency, implying a role of DDB in DNA repair (9Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The fact that CUL-4A remains associated with DDB and is able to interact with DDB bound to damaged DNA suggests a possible role for CUL-4A in DNA damage recognition. Mdm2, which is an E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination of p53, also possesses a transcriptional activity (28Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 29Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was shown to have a transcriptional repression domain, which when tethered to a promoter can inhibit transcription (30Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus an E3 ligase can have dual function. In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether CUL-4A also possesses a role in damaged DNA recognition and repair."

FASEB J. 1987; 46: 133-138Google Scholar). The biological half-life of TXA2 is approximately 30 s in in vitro models. Thus, TXA2 acts as a paracrine/autocrine factor with potent effects on the vasculature including the initiation of platelet degranulation and aggregation, vasoconstriction, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and perturbation of endothelial cells (EC) (1Ogletree M.L. FASEB J. 1987; 46: 133-138Google Scholar, 2Pakala R. Benedict C.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of these effects of TXA2 are mediated through interaction with cell surface receptors that are members of the G-protein-linked, seven-transmembrane domain receptor family (1Ogletree M.L. FASEB J. 1987; 46: 133-138Google Scholar). Thus far two TXA2 receptor (TP) isoforms have been cloned (TP-α and -β) (3Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 4Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These isoforms vary in the length of their cytoplasmic tails and arise via alternate splicing of a single gene, with TP-α the result of a retained intron (4Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The downstream signaling pathways of the two TP isoforms differ in their modulation of adenylate cyclase, with TP-α increasing cAMP accumulation and TP-β inhibiting cAMP accumulation (5Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Expression and desensitization following prolonged agonist stimulation of the two receptor isoforms are also regulated differently; prolonged stimulation induces the expression of the TP-β, but not the TP-α, isoform, and the signaling pathway responsible for TP-β desensitization is much more sensitive to protein kinase C activation than is that of TP-α (7Yukawa M. Yokota R. Eberhardt R.T. von Andrian L. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). While expression of TP in the vasculature is widespread, little is known of the physiological effects of TXA2 on endothelial cell growth or migration. Such effects might be expected to be of considerable clinical relevance; conditions in which TXA2synthesis is elevated, such as myocardial ischemia, unstable angina pectoris, and diabetes (1Ogletree M.L. FASEB J. 1987; 46: 133-138Google Scholar, 8Fitzgerald D.J. Roy L. Catella F. FitzGerald G.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 9Hirsh P.D. Hillis L.D.

Med. 1981; 304: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), are also those in which angiogenesis or vessel growth and generation of collateral circulation are important. Thus, we have investigated the effects of TP stimulation on the migration and tube forming capabilities of endothelial cells. We report here that activation of the TXA2 receptor by a potent and stable ligand (IBOP) inhibits the formation of vascular networks by HECin vitro in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. A TXA2 mimetic also inhibits endothelial cell migration in a denudation-injury model. Based on experiments measuring gap junction function and expression, we suggest that at least one mechanism by which both the antimigratory and antiangiogenic effects of TP stimulation occur is via the inhibition of intercellular communication. Sterile plasticware was from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Tissue culture materials and reagents, excluding pooled human serum (Gemini Bio-Products Inc., Calabasas, CA), were from Life Technologies, Inc. The thromboxane A2 mimetic IBOP and the TP blocker SQ29548 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Type 2 collagenase was obtained from Worthington, and dispase was from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Human endothelial cells (HEC) were isolated from umbilical veins as previously reported (10Ashton A.W. Dawes J. Chesterman C.N. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 101-112Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Culture medium consisted of M199, containing 20% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 5% (v/v) pooled human serum with 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were plated onto plates precoated with 0.02% (w/v) gelatin with a medium change after 24 h and every 2 days thereafter until confluent. Primary cultures of HEC were harvested by incubation with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, and the cells were collected and cell number was determined using a dual threshold cell counter (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). Cells were plated at the concentrations described. The spontaneous formation of capillary-like structures by HEC on a basement membrane matrix preparation (Matrigel, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) was used to assess angiogenic potential. Twelve-well plates were coated with matrix gel (10 mg/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEC were seeded on coated plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The medium was supplemented with the agents outlined, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Tube formation was observed and photographed over the 24-h period using a solid state TV camera (COHU Electronics, CA) attached to an inverted phase contrast microscope. Images were captured using a video graphics system (Sony Electronics; monitor model PVM97, printer model UP890MD). The degree of tube formation was assessed by counting the number of tubes contained in two random fields from each well. The migration assay used was a monolayer denudation assay as described by Tang et al. (11Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22811-28704Google Scholar). Confluent endothelial cells were wounded by scraping with a 2–200-μl pipette tip, denuding a strip of the monolayer 300 μm in diameter. Variation in the wound diameter within experiments was approximately 5%. Cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated with serum-containing medium supplemented with the agents as indicated. Control cultures were exposed to medium alone. The rate of wound closure was observed and photographed over a 24-h period as for the tube forming assay. The progression of cell migration was quantitated by calculation of the denuded area using the Scion image program (version 1.61, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). For cell proliferation experiments, HEC were plated into gelatin-coated 12-well plates at 1.3 × 104cells/cm2 and allowed to attach for 48 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in medium with or without 50 nm IBOP. Cells were counted every day for 3 days, and the amount of proliferation was compared. For cell cycle analysis, cells were plated into gelatin-coated 12-well plates at 1.3 × 104 cells/cm2 incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS twice and synchronized by incubation in low serum for 24 h. Cells were either incubated in fresh medium alone or supplemented with 50 nm IBOP for 24 h. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the method of Giaretti and Nusse (48Giaretti W. Nusse M. . 1994; 41: 389-400Google Scholar). Confluent IBOP-treated and untreated HEC were washed twice with PBS, and the cells were detached using 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Cells on matrix gel were isolated by incubation with dispase. Cells were suspended in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-B) for 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, antibodies to the integrins αvβ3 or αvβ5 (5 μg/ml, clone LM609 or P1F6; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were added with negative controls stained with preimmune mouse serum. Cells were incubated with antibodies for 90 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS-B before incubation with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 in PBS-B) for 60 min. Analysis of integrin surface expression was performed on a flow cytometer using an argon ion laser (λex 488 nm). For staining of cellular F-actin, confluent HEC were treated with 50 nmIBOP for 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol in PBS for 6 h at −20 °C. Cells were washed twice again and incubated with 0.1 mg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 20 min. For tubulin staining, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8), and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Staining of α-tubulin used a monoclonal primary antibody (1:100; clone B-5-1-2) and a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both incubations were for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Stained cells were washed with PBS and mounted in PBS/glycerol (1:1). HEC stained for F-actin and α-tubulin were viewed using λex 510–560-nm and λem 590-nm filters. For staining of Cx43, treated HEC were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and rendered permeable by incubation with 0.1% TX-100 in PBS for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS-B and blocked with 3% preimmune goat serum in PBS-B for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with the Chemicon monoclonal anti-Cx43 antibody used for Western blotting (1:1000 in PBS-B) for 1 h. Staining was detected with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 krypton/argon laser scanning confocal microscope linked to a Nikon Eclipse 200 microscope, using a 60× N.A. 1.4 planapo infinity-corrected objective lens. Controls were imaged to assure no background fluorescence and no cross-fluorescence between the FITC channel and the Cy3 channel. The degree of coupling in HEC monolayers was determined by quantification of the spread of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow following the microinjection into one cell in a microscope field. Confluent HEC monolayers, untreated or treated for 24 h with 50 nmIBOP, were rinsed three times with PBS and injected with a solution of Lucifer yellow (5% (w/v) in 150 mm LiCl) through drawn glass capillaries, using brief overcompensation of the capacitance neutralization circuit of a WP Instruments electrometer (New Haven, CT). Cells were photographed 10 min after injection using FITC epi-illumination and excitation filters. Visual inspection of images and quantitation of the cells containing dye was used to assess coupling. Recordings of junctional conductance were obtained from freshly dissociated, paired HEC on glass coverslips using the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique (12Moreno A.P. Rook M.B. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at room temperature in bathing solution containing 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 4 mm KCl, 5 mm dextrose, 2 mmpyruvate, and 1 mm BaCl2, pH 7.2. Each cell in the pair was voltage-clamped with heat-polished patch pipettes (3–7 Mω) filled with internal solution 130 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, 3 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.2)). Seals to cell surfaces were achieved with suction and were monitored by recording currents while simultaneously applying, through both electrodes, 20-ms, 4-mV pulses at 10 Hz. During suction, the current from the pipette was measured in the track mode of the voltage clamp system (model 1-C; Axon Instruments, Inc.). Primary cultures of HEC were plated at 5 × 105 cells/plate onto confocal imaging dishes (Glass Bottom Microwells; MatTek Corp.) coated with gelatin. After achieving confluence, HEC were wounded and incubated for up to 24 h with the agents of interest. For the calcium imaging experiments, HEC were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 10 μm of the Ca2+ indicator Indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes) and rinsed three times with Tyrode's solution (137.0 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 24.0 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mmNaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The alteration in intracellular Ca2+ and the propagation of the Ca2+ waves were induced by focal mechanical stimulation of a single cell with a glass pipette (1–2-μm outer diameter) and measured as the ratio of Indo-1 fluorescence intensity emitted at two wavelengths (390–440 and 440 nm) imaged with a Nikon RCM8000 real time confocal microscope equipped with UV laser, excitation at 351 nm, small pinhole, and Nikon × 40 UV-corrected water immersion objective (numerical appeture 1.15, working distance 0.2 mm). Ratio images were continuously acquired at 1 Hz after background and shading correction and were saved as the average of 32 image pairs. The images were further analyzed during playback using Polygon-Star Software (Nikon) that averages the number of pixels (gray level) within the region of interest (circular spots placed on top of each cell, radii of 4.2 μm containing ∼130 pixels) as function of elapsed time. The efficacy of Ca2+ wave communication was measured as the number of responding cells per total number of cells in the confocal field. The velocity of Ca2+wave propagation between HEC was calculated from the distance between the mechanically stimulated cell and neighboring cells divided by the latencies to half-maximal response (peak fluorescence) determined from sigmoidal curve fitting using Microcal Origin 4.1 software. The wave amplitude was measured as the ratio between the peak maximal increase and basal Indo-1 fluorescence, and the efficacy of Ca2+wave communication was measured as the number of responding cells per total number of cells in the confocal field. All determinations of Ca2+ wave propagation were measured from HEC cultures untreated and treated for 2, 8, 16, and 24 h with IBOP (50 nm), 24 h with SQ29548 (5 μm), and both agents together (24 h). Cells were grown to confluence and treated for up to 24 h with 50 nm IBOP. For the last 2 h of the incubation period, the phosphatase inhibitors sodium vanadate (1 mm) and okadaic acid (1 μm) were included. For Western blotting, monolayers were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution, lysed in 200 ml of hot (85 °C) SDS gel-loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8), and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Samples were boiled for 10 min, sonicated briefly, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of the retained supernatants was determined using the BCA assay system (Pierce). Aliquots of samples (10 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using 12% acrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by Western blotting. Membranes were preincubated with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-human connexin 43 antibody (1:1000; Chemicon). Detection utilized a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) and chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). For the analysis of the phosphorylation state of the Cx43 protein, cells were grown to confluence and treated for up to 24 h with 50 nm IBOP. For the last 2 h of the incubation period, the phosphatase inhibitors sodium vanadate (1 mm) and okadaic acid (1 μm) were included. Cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and incubated in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mCi of H3PO4, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) on ice for 20 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Labeled Cx43 was immunoprecipitated by incubation with protein G-agarose beads, coated with saturating amounts of Cx43 monoclonal antibody, overnight at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were boiled in SDS-loading buffer and separated on 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were dried down and exposed to autoradiographic film for the appropriate amount of time. Statistical analysis of pooled data was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. HEC on matrix gel undergo alignment into cords within 2 h, which establishes the pattern for further tube formation. This is shown by the stability in the number of tubes per field in control cultures (Fig. 1 E). By 6 h, tube formation had begun, and by 12 h virtually all cells had fused into continuous tubes, with stabilization and refinement progressing up until 24 h (Fig. 1 B). Generation of tubes by HEC was reduced by the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (Fig. 1 C). IBOP (50 nm) reduced to 43 ± 14% of controls the alignment of HEC into cordlike structures at 2 h (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 E). By 16 h, IBOP-treated cultures contained only 15 ± 12% of the number of tubes in untreated wells (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 1,C and E). HEC incubated with the TP blocker SQ29548 alone formed a number of tubes per field similar to that formed by untreated cells (Fig. 1 E), and the simultaneous addition of SQ29548 prevented the effect of the TXA2 mimetic at each time point (p ≤ 0.05 compared with IBOP alone) (Fig. 1, D and E). The inactive hydrolytic product of TXA2, TXB2, did not influence tube formation by HEC, nor did the prostaglandin PGE2 (data not shown). IBOP was a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitor of tube formation by HEC (Fig. 2,A and B, respectively). Vascular tube formation was significantly depressed by IBOP concentrations higher than 25 nm (p ≤ 0.01), with maximal inhibition (40 ± 20% of control) at IBOP concentrations of 50 nm or more (p ≤ 0.01). Another TXA2 mimetic, U46619, also inhibited tube formation in a concentration-dependent manner. U46619 inhibited HEC tube formation with an IC50 of 100 nm(p ≤ 0.05), with maximal inhibition by U46619 at concentrations above 400 nm, at which tube formation was reduced to 17 ± 5.4% of control (p ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 2 A). IBOP also prevented formation of tubes if added to cultures already in the process of tube formation (Fig. 2 B). Inclusion of IBOP (50 nm) in the medium as late as 18 h after the initiation of tube formation significantly reduced the eventual number of tubes at 24 h (70 ± 21%,p ≤ 0.001). IBOP was most effective at periods greater than 18 h, with the number of tubes suppressed to 40 ± 21% of control (p ≤ 0.0001). Thus, TP activation was found to exert a potent inhibitory effect on in vitro tube formation. Tube formation in three-dimensional cultures is dependent on the migration of cells after plating. The inhibition of tube formation by IBOP and U46619 suggested that TXA2 mimetics might also inhibit HEC migration. We used a denudation injury model to assess the impact of IBOP on endothelial cell migration. Confluent, scrape-wounded HEC monolayers were incubated with either IBOP (50 nm) or U46619 (400 nm), and the rate of closure was observed over the following 24 h. Untreated cultures migrated into the denuded area, recovering the exposed surface and reducing the uncovered area to 27 ± 16.5% of the original area (Fig. 3, B and E). IBOP (50 nm) significantly inhibited migration of HEC into the denuded area (Fig. 3 C), with inhibition detectable 6 h after initial wounding (p ≤ 0.05). Wound closure was inhibited by 58.4 ± 8.1% at 24 h (p ≤ 0.05). The TP agonist U46619 (400 nm) also inhibited endothelial cell migration with kinetics similar to IBOP with closure of the wound inhibited by 71.7 ± 14.1% after 24 h of treatment (p ≤ 0.005) (data not shown). TP blockade by SQ29548 did not affect HEC migration into the wounded area; however, the migration of IBOP-treated HEC was restored by inclusion of 5 μm SQ29548 (p ≤ 0.05 versusIBOP alone) for longer than 12 h (Fig. 3, D andE). The inactive metabolite of TXA2, TXB2, did not affect HEC migration. Among the factors important in the regulation of migration and angiogenesis are the expression of cell surface integrins, cellular proliferation, and architecture of the cytoskeleton (14Romer L.H. McLean N. Turner C.E. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Banerjee D.K. Puerto Rico Health Sci.

Pathol. 1990; 18: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of IBOP stimulation on endothelial cell proliferation using growth curves and cell cycle kinetics. Cells grown on gelatin-coated 12-well plates in medium alone increased cell number over 3 days with cell number 172 ± 9.5% of the plating density by day 3. IBOP treatment (50 nm) increased cell number to 174 ± 5.7% of the original plating density in the same period, which was not significantly different from control (data not shown). When examining cell cycle kinetics, we found that unstimulated and IBOP-treated HEC progressed through the cell cycle at comparable rates (data not shown). IBOP did not retard cell cycle progression, nor did it inhibit HEC proliferation; thus, the inhibition of HEC tube formation and migration was unlikely to be a result of inhibition of cell proliferation. We examined the expression of the integrin complexes αvβ3 and αvβ5on cells from two- and three-dimensional cultures to determine if the effect of IBOP on migration and tube formation was mediated through decreased expression of those integrin receptors (Fig. 4, A and B). Untreated cells from two-dimensional cultures showed a 3- and 5-fold increase in their mean fluorescence intensity for αvβ3 and αvβ5, respectively, over cells stained with preimmune serum. Cells from three-dimensional matrix gel cultures expressed both αvβ3 and αvβ5integrin complexes similarly to HEC in two-dimensional cultures (data not shown). IBOP (50 nm) did not influence the surface expression of either αvβ3 or αvβ5 in HEC from either culture model. Thus, the effect of IBOP on HEC migration and tube formation was not mediated through decreased integrin expression of those two integrin receptors. To determine the effects of IBOP on the HEC cytoskeleton, immunofluorescent staining of the cytoskeletal components F-actin and α-tubulin was performed. Staining for cytoskeletal architecture showed extensive stress fiber formation in HEC that was in a random orientation throughout the monolayer (Fig. 4 C). Stress fibers in migrating cells at the wound edge were ordered with the orientation parallel to the direction of cell migration (data not shown). Incubation with the TXA2 mimetic IBOP did not decrease stress fiber formation or alter the arrangement of F-actin within the monolayer (Fig. 4 D), nor did it prevent the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at the wound edge. The pattern of α-tubulin staining in control cells was cytoplasmic and radial (Fig. 4 E) with no apparent alterations in the morphology in migrating cells. Cells exposed to IBOP (50 nm) maintained the same morphology of α-tubulin as did the control cultures (Fig. 4 F). Thus, gross alterations to the cytoskeletal morphology were not responsible for mediating the inhibitory effects of IBOP on HEC migration. The degree of cell-cell communication is an important factor affecting the migration of endothelial cells and other cell types (18Fulton B.P. Perspect. Dev.

Migrating endothelial cells up-regulate gap junction-mediated intercellular communication maximally at 24 h (19Pepper M.S. Spray D.C. Chanson M. Montesano R. Orci L. Meda P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3027-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the time point at which the antimigratory activity of IBOP is most evident. We advanced the hypothesis that ligand binding to the TXA2 receptor inhibits migration and tube formation by interfering with intercellular communication. Junctional communication in HEC monolayers was studied by microinjection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow into cells, and the extent of dye diffusion was determined. After injection into untreated cells, Lucifer yellow diffused to an average of 5.5 ± 0.7 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Treatment for 24 h with the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (50 nm) reduced the diffusion of Lucifer yellow to 2.4 ± 0.5 cells (p ≤ 0.05), a reduction in coupling of 64% (Fig. 5, A and C). To examine the electrical properties of IBOP-treated cells directly, pairs of freshly dissociated cells were voltage-clamped, and recordings of junctional conductance were made (Fig. 5 D). Treatment of HEC with 50 nmIBOP (24 h) reduced the conductance between cell pairs to 1.9 ± 1 microsiemens, an 85% reduction of conductance in comparison with controls (13 ± 5.8 microsiemens, p < 0.05). Further characterization of the effects of TXA2 receptor agonists on gap junction-mediated intercellular communication employed real time confocal microscopy to examine the propagation of Ca2+ waves through endothelial cell monolayers. Confluent HEC monolayers were treated with 5"
https://openalex.org/W2036817760,"Chemokine receptors serve as portals of entry for certain intracellular pathogens, most notably human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Myxoma virus is a member of the poxvirus family that induces a lethal systemic disease in rabbits, but no poxvirus receptor has ever been defined. Rodent fibroblasts (3T3) that cannot be infected with myxoma virus could be made fully permissive for myxoma virus infection by expression of any one of several human chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR4. Conversely, infection of 3T3-CCR5 cells can be inhibited by RANTES, anti-CCR5 polyclonal antibody, or herbimycin A but not by monoclonal antibodies that block HIV-1 infection or by pertussis toxin. These findings suggest that poxviruses, like HIV, are able to use chemokine receptors to infect specific cell subtypes, notably migratory leukocytes, but that their mechanisms of receptor interactions are distinct."

It participates in the formation of homo- or heterodimeric complexes that specifically bind to DNA sequences called activating protein 1 (AP-1) sites.

In addition, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to many stimuli (for review see Ref. 2Karin K. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar) modulate both activity and stability of the transcription factor. In most cells, the constitutive c-Jun levels are very low because of its short half-life. Phosphorylation at the N-terminal activation domain including Ser-63 and Ser-73 leads to a reduced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Jun (3Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z.

Increased c-Jun levels contribute to elevated AP-11 transcriptional activity by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other transcription factors such as Fos. The AP-1 factor c-Jun is involved in important functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (2Karin K. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Prior to this communication mitogen- and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) have been described as the only enzymes phosphorylating c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73 in vivo. The JNKs are constitutively inactive. They are components of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. In response to many stimuli such as PMA, JNKs are activated by phosphorylation via MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, which are in turn phosphorylated by numerous MAP kinase kinase kinases (for review see Ref. 5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Although there are a few reports on JNK-independent c-Jun/AP-1 activation (e.g. Ref. 6Huang C.

In contrast to JNK, the isolated COP9 signalosome modifies only full-length c-Jun, whereas JNK phosphorylates N-terminal c-Jun fragments such as the Δc-Jun-(1–79) and Δc-Jun-(1–226) (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome kinase has not yet been identified. Because none of the COP9 signalosome subunits contain a recognizable kinase domain, we refer to it as an associated kinase activity. Data presented here demonstrate that COP9 signalosome-directed phosphorylation of c-Jun results in the stabilization of the transcription factor in vivo accompanied by an elevated AP-1 activity. COP9 signalosome was isolated from human red blood cells as described previously (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed with His-tagged full-length c-Jun as substrate (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). His-tagged full-length c-Jun, His-tagged Δc-Jun-(1–226), and His-tagged signalosome subunit 5 (Sgn5) were produced inEscherichia coli from pQE expression vectors and isolated using the Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid purification kit (Qiagen). The complete Sgn2 cDNA has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBankTM Accession number AF084260. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 4 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded in tissue culture plates for 48 h prior to infection. 16 h before infection, the medium was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transactivating activity of AP-1 was measured at 50–70% confluence by cotransfection of a luciferase expression plasmid containing three repeats of the AP-1 binding site and other expression constructs using cationic liposomes (DAC-30, Eurogentec, Sart Tilman, Belgium). Expression constructs Sgn5, Sgn2, and Δc-Jun-(1–226) were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) expressing a N-terminal Flag-tagged sequence. 16 h after transfection cells were either treated with 40 nm PMA (Sigma) or left untreated. Luciferase assays were performed 3–4 h after treatment as recommended by the manufacturer‘s instructions (Promega). The results were recorded on a Wallac 409 counter (Berthold-Wallac). Representative results from more than three independent experiments are shown as fold induction or percentage induction compared with the control. Activities varied <10% between transfection experiments. To analyze the kinase activities of JNK and p38, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 4 μm aprotinin. For immunoprecipitation, RIPA buffer-lysed cells were disrupted and incubated with anti-JNK1 (sc-474, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p38 (sc-535, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Immunocomplexes were recovered and washed, and immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro kinase reactions using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as substrate for JNK and 1 μg of GST-ATF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for p38. The samples were separated in SDS-PAGE and dried, and substrate phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Equal amounts of each sample were used for immunoblot analysis to indicate equivalent protein amounts in all lanes as described previously (14Naumann M. Rudel T. Wieland B. Bartsch C. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For separation in 10–30% glycerol gradients 16 h after transfection, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer as described above. Lysate from approximately 1 × 107 cells was subjected to density gradient centrifugation (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins from fractions 6–15 were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and Western blots using anti-Flag antibody (Stratagen) were developed according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Sgn3 (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) antibodies. Estimation of the amounts of Flag-tagged Sgn2 incorporated into cellular COP9 signalosome and of endogeneous COP9 signalosome was performed using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). It has been shown that c-Jun interacts via amino acids 31–57 with Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) (15Claret F.-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), recently identified as Sgn5 of the COP9 signalosome (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To test whether COP9 signalosome-associated kinase phosphorylation of full-length c-Jun is dependent on Sgn5-c-Jun interaction, we performed in vitrocompetition assays with Δc-Jun-(1–226). As mentioned above, Δc-Jun-(1–226) is not phosphorylated by COP9 signalosome but should bind to Sgn5. Fig. 1 shows that increasing amounts of Δc-Jun-(1–226) added to constant amounts of full-length c-Jun inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation by purified COP9 signalosome. 2.4 μg of Δc-Jun-(1–226) corresponding to a molar excess of approximately 3:1 are almost sufficient for complete inhibition of full-length c-Jun modification. Moreover, Fig. 1 also demonstrates that phosphorylation of full-length c-Jun by COP9 signalosome can be inhibited by recombinant Sgn5, which competes with the complex for the substrate. These data show that COP9 signalosome-directed c-Jun phosphorylation is dependent on binding to the integrated Sgn5 subunit. It has been suggested that COP9 signalosome might preferentially phosphorylate c-Jun dimers (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) formed by the interaction of C termini. Therefore, one can imagine a scenario in which one molecule of a c-Jun homodimer binds to Sgn5 in the COP9 signalosome complex, whereas its partner is phosphorylated by the associated kinase. To verify these in vitro data under cellular conditions we had to find a way to increase intracellular COP9 signalosome activity that could be measured by elevated AP-1 activity. Therefore, the impact of COP9 signalosome subunit 2 (Sgn2) and Sgn5 overexpression in HeLa cells on AP-1 activity was tested by transient transfections in a luciferase reporter assay. As seen in Fig. 2, Sgn2 overexpression stimulates AP-1 activity significantly more than PMA, a well known stimulator of the JNK pathway. Sgn2 overexpression exerts a dose-dependent effect on AP-1 activity, reducing it at large amounts of transfected cDNA. In contrast, Sgn5 overexpression does not affect AP-1 activity. Although this is not in agreement with former findings (15Claret F.-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), it does confirm recent data (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and corresponds to our in vitro results shown in Fig. 1. Accordingly, free Sgn5 might trap cellular c-Jun and prevent its phosphorylation. Why does Sgn2 overexpression lead to an increased AP-1 activity, whereas Sgn5 does not? One part of the explanation might be that in HeLa cells Sgn2 concentration limits COP9 signalosome assembly. The overexpressed protein could cause de novo complex formation with the consequence of an elevated COP9 signalosome activity resulting in an effective c-Jun stabilization. On the other hand, overexpressed Sgn5 may not incorporate into the complex. To prove this hypothesis we expressed Flag-tagged Sgn2 or Sgn5 in HeLa cells. Lysates of 107 cells each were separated by glycerol density gradients. As shown in Fig. 3, COP9 signalosome was mostly localized in fractions 7–10 according to its molecular mass of 450 kDa (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Approximately 40% of the total Flag-Sgn2 protein sedimented with the COP9 signalosome, indicating that it was incorporated into de novo assembled COP9 signalosome. Compared with control cells, de novo assembly of COP9 signalosome in Sgn2-transfected cells led to an approximately 2-fold increase of the complex amount as estimated from immunoblots with anti-Sgn3 antibody. In contrast, less than 1% of Flag-Sgn5 incorporation into the COP9 signalosome was observed (see Fig. 3). To see whether the transfections had an impact on c-Jun stabilization, the same glycerol gradient fractions were analyzed for c-Jun amounts using an anti-c-Jun antibody. Whereas endogeneous c-Jun can barely be detected in Sgn5-transfected cells and is very low in the controls, increased cellular c-Jun amounts were found in Sgn2-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3). This increase of c-Jun concentration is most likely because of stabilization of the protein and is responsible for the increase of AP-1 activity. As mentioned above, c-Jun is stabilized by phosphorylation including serines 63 and 73, and JNKs have been described to be the responsible kinases (2Karin K. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). To study the possibility whether Sgn2 overexpression leads to JNK activation resulting in elevated AP-1 activity, JNK was immunoprecipitated from Sgn2, transfected Sgn5, or PMA-stimulated cells. The precipitate was assayed for immunocomplex kinase activity with full-length c-Jun as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PMA treatment led to JNK activation as expected. In contrast, there was no JNK-dependent c-Jun phosphorylation as a consequence of Sgn2 or Sgn5 overexpression. Similar data were obtained in experiments in which another regulator of AP-1 activity, p38 MAP kinase (5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), was analyzed (data not shown). These data demonstrate that increased AP-1 activity induced by Sgn2 overexpression is independent of JNK or p38 kinase activities. Thus, AP-1 activity can be stimulated via c-Jun phosphorylation by two different pathways COP9 signalosome-dependent and JNK-dependent signaling. To further discriminate between the two signaling pathways dominant inhibitory MKK4(K116R) (DNMKK4) was transfected into HeLa cells. MKK4 is a physiological activator of JNK at the MAP kinase kinase level and also functions as an activator of p38 MAP kinase (5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4 B, transfection of DNMKK4 into PMA stimulated cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of AP-1 activity. This c-Jun activation is dependent on JNK activation by MKK4. On the other hand, the COP9 signalosome-directed c-Jun activation is not affected by DNMKK4, again demonstrating JNK-independent signaling. Δc-Jun-(1–226) and recombinant Sgn5 inhibit the phosphorylation of full-length c-Jun by the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase in vitro (see Fig. 1). Whether similar effects could be obtained under cellular conditions was tested in HeLa cells cotransfected with Sgn2 and Δc-Jun-(1–226) or Sgn5 cDNAs (Fig. 5). Consistent with in vitroresults, increasing amounts of both Δc-Jun-(1–226), which cannot form dimers and is unable to stimulate AP-1 activity, as well as free Sgn5 led to a complete inhibition of AP-1 activity induced by Sgn2. These data show that Sgn2-stimulated AP-1 activity is dependent on COP9 signalosome-directed phosphorylation of full-length c-Jun. Similar data were obtained with PMA-stimulated cells using Δc-Jun-(1–226) as competitor for JNK. The presented data demonstrate that ectopically expressed Sgn2 incorporates into the cellular COP9 signalosome complex accompanied by a significant de novo complex formation. Increased amounts of COP9 signalosome lead to a stabilization of endogeneous c-Jun and increased AP-1 transactivation activity. Thus, transcriptional regulation of Sgn2 might represent a mechanism for controlling COP9 signalosome amounts and cellular activity, e.g. c-Jun activation/stabilization. The resulting stimulation of AP-1 activity is independent of JNK and MKK4 activities but depends on COP9 signalosome. Therefore, stabilization of c-Jun is because of phosphorylation of the transcription factor at its N-terminal activation domain by the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase as demonstrated with the isolated complex (9Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the existence of a JNK-independent COP9 signalosome-directed c-Jun signaling comes from the fact that the activity of the purified complex is inhibited by curcumin (11Henke W. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Schade R. Jungblut P. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a known inhibitor of AP-1 activity (17Huang T.-S. Lee S.-Ch. Lin J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there seems to be a cross-talk between the COP9 signalosome-directed c-Jun activation and the JNK pathway. The G-protein suppressor 1 (Gps1), identical to signalosome subunit 1, has been shown to act as a suppressor of JNK (18Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Staub S.F. Koo D. Chang C.-Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is perhaps advantageous for the cell to block the stress-activated protein kinases, although the COP9 signalosome is active. In addition to c-Jun stabilization, COP9 signalosome-dependent phosphorylation might also affect the transport of the transcription factor into the nucleus. It has been shown in Arabidopsis that a functional COP9 signalosome complex is essential for the nuclear accumulation of COP1, a transcriptional regulator, in dark adapted plants (19Osterlund M.T. Ang L.-H. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 113-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, the relocalization into the cytoplasm of another protein which binds Sgn5, p27Kip1, might be regulated by COP9 signalosome (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, because the p27Kip1 relocalization was induced by Sgn5 overexpression, one should be cautious with the interpretation in light of the effects of Sgn5 overexpression presented in this paper. If COP9 signalosome is involved in the regulation of p27Kip1, large amounts of free Sgn5 might trap the cell cycle regulator and prevent its interaction with the COP9 signalosome. The high homologies of COP9 signalosome subunits with components of the 26 S proteasome lid (8Wei N. Tsuge T. Serino G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Matsui M. Deng X-W. Curr.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) could be because of a common ancestor and perhaps a functional divergence of the two complexes during evolution. In the case of c-Jun, interaction with the COP9 signalosome leads to stabilization of the transcription factor, whereas the 26 S proteasome lid is involved in its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The balance of the two processes, stabilization and degradation of c-Jun, is crucial for the decision whether cells proliferate, differentiate, or go into apoptosis. We thank M. Karin for providing DNMKK4 and B. Wieland for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2126464442,"Prolactin-dependent signaling occurs as the result of ligand-induced dimerization of the prolactin receptor (PRLr). While three PRLr isoforms have been characterized in the rat, studies have suggested the existence of several human isoforms in breast carcinoma species and normal tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on mRNA isolated from the breast carcinoma cell line T47D, revealing two predominant receptor isoforms: the previously described long PRLr and a novel human intermediate PRLr. The nucleotide sequence of the intermediate isoform was found to be identical to the long isoform except for a 573-base pair deletion occurring at a consensus splice site, resulting in a frameshift and truncated intracytoplasmic domain. Scatchard analysis of the intermediate PRLr revealed an affinity for PRL comparable with the long PRLr. While Ba/F3 transfectants expressing the long PRLr proliferated in response to PRL, intermediate PRLr transfectants exhibited modest incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Significantly, however, both the long and intermediate PRLr were equivalent in their inhibition of apoptosis of the Ba/F3 transfectants after PRL treatment. The activation of proximal signaling molecules also differed between isoforms. Upon ligand binding, Jak2 and Fyn were activated in CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with the long PRLr. In contrast, the intermediate PRLr transfectants showed equivalent levels of Jak2 activation but only minimal activation of Fyn. Last, Northern analysis revealed variable tissue expression of intermediate PRLr transcript that differed from that of the long PRLr. Taken together, differences in signaling and tissue expression suggest that the human intermediate PRLr differs from the long PRLr in physiological function."

The DNA binding adapter p48 ISGF3γ shares strong sequence homology in its DNA interaction domain with members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Indeed, these proteins are able to bind to the ISRE and activate a specific subset of the genes typically activated by IFNα/β (14Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A.

Surprisingly, even transfection of cells with double-stranded RNA is able to trigger the formation of an IRF3 containing DNA binding complex (20Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). While the connection between viral infection and the interferon system is well established, it is largely unclear if or to what extent activation of ISGs plays a role in the response to bacterial infection. Vertebrates and invertebrates respond to bacterial invasion by activation of a defense mechanism that is part of the innate immune response. This response is triggered by the recognition of bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by cells of the immune system. In mammals, it is primarily monocytes and macrophages that respond to LPS, releasing cytokines and chemokines that provoke an inflammatory response. Excessive amounts of LPS can result in a fatal syndrome known as septic shock (21Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, which relies entirely on innate immune defense, four Toll family members have been reported. They are involved in the regulation of dorsal-ventral patterning during development, and have been shown to control immune response to bacterial and fungal infection in the adult fly by inducing antimicrobial peptides (21Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). During the last year two cell surface receptors have been proven to essentially mediate the LPS response. These transmembrane proteins, referred to as the Toll-like receptors, can confer sensitivity toward LPS when ectopically expressed in otherwise LPS unresponsive cells (22Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4456) Google Scholar, 23Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp.

Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Responsiveness to LPS also requires the presence of the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14 myeloid cell membrane protein. Significant progress has been made over the last few years in the identification of the signaling molecules involved in LPS-induced gene expression, however, most of the work focused on the signaling pathway leading to the activation of the nuclear factor NFκB. However, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Toll-like receptors also stimulate signaling cascades that lead to the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) JNK and p38 via MKK4 (MEK4) (21Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). As in the case of the activation pathway of NFκB, the SAPK pathway is highly conserved between mammals and invertebrates. We were interested in evaluating whether LPS stimulation would result in IRF3 activation and ISG induction similar to that observed after human cytomegalovirus infection. The results presented here demonstrate that LPS induces the nuclear translocation and the ISRE binding of IRF-3, followed by the induction of several ISGs. Furthermore, we find that LPS mediated activation of ISGs depends on the activity of p38 SAPK, but occurs independent of protein synthesis. Thus, our findings propose a central role for IRF3 in the innate immune response following viral or bacterial infection. Human U373 astrocytoma cells (U-373 MG) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). IFNα was a generous gift from Hoffman LaRoche. LPS was purchased from Sigma. SB202190 and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. Glutathione S-transferase fused to full-length human IRF-3 was expressed in DH5α cells and used to immunize white New Zealand rabbits. The resulting IRF-3 antisera was tested by Western blotting and supershift experiments for reactivity with recombinant IRF3, and for lack of cross-reactivity with recombinant IRF1. Following treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 15 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were vortexed vigorously and centifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then the nuclei extracted in a high salt buffer (25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm sodium fluoride) and shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using an 32P end-labeled probe corresponding to the ISRE of the ISG15 promoter (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with poly(dI-dC) and labeled oligonucleotides in ISRE binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll, 0.02% Nonidet P-40). Electrophoresis was performed on 6% nondenaturing TBE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide used as a competitor corresponded to either the ISG15-ISRE or the GRR (IFNγ response region) sequence in the promoter of the high affinity FcγRI receptor (5′-AATTAGCATGTTTCAAGGATTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAG-3′) For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated on ice with the specified antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. U373 cells were cultured and stimulated as described above. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobes were generated by transcription of the linearized plasmidin vitro using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Labeled riboprobe and 10 μg of RNA were incubated in hybridization buffer (4:1 formamide and 5× stock; 5× stock was 200 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) overnight at 56 °C before digestion with T1 RNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were solubilized in RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol), boiled for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide/urea gel. U373 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After treatment, cells were rinsed once with PBS and once with 1× PIPES buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldeyde/PBS for 6 min at room temperature. Nuclei were permeabilized by incubating with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, the fixed cells were blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS for 35 min at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-IRF3 serum overnight at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed 4 times for 5 min in PBS before incubation with a goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.) for 40 min at room temperature and mounted after rinsing on glass slides with 50% glycerol, PBS. Several laboratories including our own recently reported similar results regarding the activation of IRF3 following infection with human cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, or after transfection of cells with double-stranded RNA (16Navarro L. Mowen K. Rodems S. Weaver B. Reich N. Spector D. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3796-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We reasoned that IRF3 activation may represent a general cellular host-defense mechanism that could also be triggered by contact with pathogens other than viruses. We therefore decided to investigate whether the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS is capable of initiating a cellular response similar to that observed after contact with viral particles. The human astrocytoma cell line U373 was chosen as it is a well accepted model for investigating cellular responses to LPS. One of the early events in IRF3 activation is its nuclear translocation following appropriate phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. We therefore decided to test whether LPS stimulation would trigger a change in the subcellular distribution of IRF3. U373 cells plated on coverslips were subjected to stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2, 4, or 6 h, and the subcellular localization of IRF3 was determined by immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-IRF3 antiserum. In order to exclude the possibility that IRF3 activation might occur as a consequence of LPS-mediated cytokine release, the experiments were performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS caused the protein synthesis independent nuclear translocation of IRF3 within 4–6 h, a kinetic similar to that observed after viral infection. Next, we decided to elucidate whether the nuclear translocated IRF3 was able to form an ISRE binding complex. U373 cells were stimulated for 6 h with 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and nuclear extracts were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the ISG15-ISRE as a probe. As anticipated, LPS induced the formation of a DNA binding complex whose migration is similar to that of the previously reported human cytomegalovirus-induced CIF complex (16Navarro L. Mowen K. Rodems S. Weaver B. Reich N. Spector D. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3796-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but is distinct from the IFNα/β-induced ISGF3 complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Competition experiments using 10–50-fold molar excess of unlabeled ISRE (lanes 3 and 4) or the unrelated GRR (lanes 5–7) oligo confirmed the binding specificity of the LPS-induced complex for the ISRE (the slower migrating band competing with the unlabeled ISRE was identified as IRF1). In order to verify that the observed DNA binding complex indeed contains IRF3, we performed supershift experiments with anti-IRF3 serum. As shown in Fig. 2 B, incubation of cell lysates with anti-IRF3 antibodies results in a supershift of the LPS-induced complex (lane 3), whereas the STAT1 antiserum which was used as a negative control was without effect (lane 4). These results clearly demonstrate that LPS stimulation of U373 cells is capable of inducing the nuclear translocation and the ISRE binding of IRF3 in the absence of protein synthesis. In order to test whether IRF3 is capable of mediating LPS-induced ISG transcription in a manner similar to virus-induced gene transcription, we performed RNase protection assays using several ISRE driven genes as probes. Again, all experiments were done in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to exclude synthesis of signaling intermediates. Indeed, LPS was able to induce the transcriptional activation of the ISRE containing genes ISG54 and GBP within 6 h in a protein synthesis independent manner (Fig. 3, lane 2). The LPS-induced ISG was not accompanied by formation of the ISGF3 complex, nor did we detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins involved in ISG induction (data not shown). Furthermore, LPS induction ofISG54 was also observed in GRE cells 2L. Navarro and M. David, unpublished observation. which carry a deletion of the type I interferon locus (25Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the observed ISG induction is indeed mediated through the activation of IRF3. LPS or viral infection trigger the activation of several common signaling pathways, some of which may be involved in the activation of IRF3. One such pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor NFκB. However, previous studies and our own results showed that the kinases leading to NFκB activation such as IRAK, NIK, or IKK are unable to phosphorylate IRF3 (27Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Another signaling cascade activated upon viral infection as well as after LPS stimulation leads to the activation of the stress kinase p38 (21Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Indeed, we did observe activation of p38 after LPS stimulation of U373 cells as previously reported (26Schumann R.R. Pfeil D. Freyer D. Buerger W. Lamping N. Kirschning C.J. Goebel U.B. Weber J.R. Glia. 1998; 3: 295-305Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar).2 To explore the role of p38 in IRF3 mediated ISG induction, we treated U373 cells with the specific p38 inhibitor SB202190 prior to stimulation with LPS. As shown in Fig. 3 (lane 4), SB202190 (SB) significantly inhibits LPS-inducedISG54 induction, whereas the structurally related, negative control compound SB202474 did not interfere with the LPS-induced ISG induction (lane 5). Furthermore, SB202190 did not alterISG54 induction in response to IFNα, demonstrating that the compound does not exert a general inhibitory effect on ISG transcription (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7). Last, we found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase specific inhibitor PD98059 (PD) was also without effect on LPS-induced ISG activation (lane 3). During the preparation of this manuscript, Juang et al. (28Juang Y.T. Au W.C. Lowther W. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that LPS inhibits the virus-mediated activation of IRF3. These findings were obtained by exposure of cells to LPS for up to 1 h, followed by removal of the LPS and subsequent viral infection. Although mixed infections are a commonly found clinical manifestation, it is somewhat unlikely that cells are exposed to LPS for only 1 h followed by viral contact. Since our results demonstrate that the LPS mediated activation of IRF3 and the induction of ISGs, although protein synthesis independent, require at least 4 h of stimulation, it is possible that the differences in the experimental approach are responsible for the observed discrepancies. In summary, we demonstrate that LPS stimulation is able to induce the nuclear translocation and the ISRE binding of IRF3. Subsequent induction of ISGs was found to occur in the absence of protein synthesis, but requires the kinase activity of the p38 stress kinase. The activation of IRF3 upon viral infection as well as after engagement of the Toll-like receptors suggests that IRF3 may be part of the evolutionary conserved innate immune response. It is possible that the protein synthesis independent activation of genes involved in the cellular self-defense mechanism may enable a cell to respond quickly to an encounter with viral or bacterial particles, whereas subsequent IFN production and release may primarily benefit neighboring, yet uninfected, cells. We are grateful to Dr. Robert Rickert for critical reading of the manuscript, and Drs. Deborah Spector and Jean Wang for stimulating discussions. We also thank Shant Salakian and Jennifer Cornell for assistance in the generation of the IRF3 antiserum. GRE cells were kindly provided by Dr. Ganes Sen, and IFNα was a kind gift from Hoffman-La Roche."

Three His422mutants (H422A, H422T, and H422C) were purified, which all contained tightly but noncovalently bound FAD. Steady state kinetics revealed that the mutants have retained enzyme activity, although the turnover rates have decreased by 1 order of magnitude.

Thus, formation of a histidyl-FAD bond in specific flavoenzymes might have evolved as a way to contribute to the enhancement of their oxidative power. vanillyl-alcohol oxidase Until now, several hundred flavin-containing enzymes have been described. Most of these enzymes contain a dissociable FAD or FMN cofactor. However, it has been shown that in several cases the flavin is covalently linked to an amino acid of the polypeptide chain. In fact, in humans 10% of the cellular FAD is covalently bound to enzymes like e.g. succinate dehydrogenase and monoamine oxidase (1Decker K.F. Brody T. Nutritional Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 443-447Google Scholar). Within the group of covalent flavoproteins, five different types of covalent flavinylation have been identified. Except for a few examples of cysteinyl- or tyrosyl-linked flavins, tethering to a histidine is by far the most favored binding mode, since it has been observed in about 20 isolated flavoenzymes (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although the first covalent flavoprotein, succinate dehydrogenase, was already identified in 1955 (3Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 17: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the rationale for covalent flavinylation is still unresolved. Only recently, a clear influence of the covalent bond on the reactivity of the cofactor has been observed in trimethylamine dehydrogenase. Unlike the wild type enzyme, mutants of trimethylamine dehydrogenase containing dissociable FMN (4Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mewies M. Basran J. Packman L.C. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) are inactivated by hydroxylation of the cofactor. Apparently, covalent tethering of the cofactor can prevent inactivation of the cofactor. Another striking role of the covalent flavin bond has been suggested for p-cresol methylhydroxylase. Inspection of the crystal structure of this flavocytochrome indicates that the tyrosyl-FAD bond facilitates electron transfer from the reduced FAD to the heme of the cytochrome c subunit (6Kim J.

It has also been shown that introduction of a covalent bond at the 8α-position of the isoalloxazine ring can result in an increase of the redox potential (7Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8144-8149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Moore E.G. Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 73-103Google Scholar). A reduced oxidative activity of mutants of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate dehydrogenase was rationalized by a decrease of the flavin redox potential due to the missing covalent bond (10Blaut M.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the above mentioned results indicate that covalent flavinylation might be advantageous for catalysis, it should be mentioned that several covalent flavoenzymes have homologous flavin-dissociable counterparts that display similar enzyme activities (13Schilling B. Lerch K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Croteau N. Vrielink A. J. Struct.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rationale for this atypical protein modification might not be uniform, and also other factors may have attributed to the formation and conservation of covalent flavoproteins throughout evolution. For example, covalent binding of flavins can be favorable for flavoenzymes that are localized in a flavin-deficient environment. In this respect, it is noteworthy to mention that almost all eucaryotic covalent flavoproteins have been found to be compartmentalized (16Fraaije M.W. Sjollema K.A. Veenhuis M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, the motive for covalent flavinylation might also reside in the physiological function and environment of these flavoenzymes. Further, covalent flavinylation can also be of structural benefit. Except for cofactor saturation of the active site, the introduction of a covalent flavin-protein bond may well result in an improved protein stability. In this study, we have addressed the function of covalent flavinylation in vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO),1 which is a covalent flavoprotein containing 8α-(N 3-histidyl)-FAD (17De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). VAO is a fungal enzyme of 560 residues that can efficiently oxidize a broad range of phenolic compounds (18Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Van den Heuvel R.H.H. Fraaije M.W. Laane N.C.M. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the conversion of the physiological substrate 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol has revealed that the enzyme operates in a ternary complex mechanism (20Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). During the first half-reaction, the substrate reduces the flavin cofactor, resulting in the formation of a stable binary complex of reduced enzyme and a p-quinone methide intermediate of the substrate. Subsequent reoxidation of the cofactor by molecular oxygen completes the catalytic cycle, yielding the final products and oxidized enzyme. Recently, we have solved the crystal structure of VAO (21Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), representing the first crystal structure of a flavoenzyme with a histidyl-bound FAD. The VAO monomer comprises two domains, with the larger domain forming a FAD binding module while the cap domain, containing the histidine linking the FAD, covers the active site (Fig. 1). By sequence homology analysis and inspection of the crystal structure of VAO, we have identified a novel flavoprotein family sharing a conserved FAD binding domain (22Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. van Berkel W.J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Members of this family that have been characterized catalyze a variety of oxidation/reduction reactions and include several well studied covalent flavoproteins: e.g.6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase (23Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), p-cresol methylhydroxylase (6Kim J. Fuller J.H. Kuusk V. Cunane L. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31202-31209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (24Nishikimi M. Kobayashi J. Yagi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 313-320PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in about 35% of the sequences of these VAO homologs, a conserved histidine residue is found, which is predicted to be flavinylated (22Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. van Berkel W.J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Apparently, covalent flavinylation within this flavoprotein family is a relatively frequent event, indicating that the conserved topology is particularly suited for covalent flavinylation or that this flavoprotein family originates from an ancestral covalent flavoprotein. To study the effect of covalent flavinylation on the structural and kinetic properties of VAO, we have mutated the target residue for flavinylation, His422, thereby preventing formation of the histidyl-FAD bond. Here we present the crystal structure of the H422A mutant containing a dissociable FAD. Furthermore, the effects of the covalent bond deletion on the kinetic and redox properties of VAO are discussed. Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′ (25Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Doherty J. Jefferson S.

For this, the NcoI–NsiI fragment of pIM3972 was ligated into pGEM-5Zf(+). Subsequently, the silent mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAAGCCGTCGACATTATTCGTCC-3′ (whereC denotes the mutated base). The mutatedNcoI–NsiI fragment was ligated into pIM3972. The resulting pBC11 plasmid was used for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. For the His422 replacements, theSalI–KpnI fragment of pBC11 was ligated into pUCBM20. This construct was used for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis with the oligonucleotide 5′-CCCTAATGGTGCGXXTCTGTTCTTCTCTCC-3′ (where XXdenotes the replacement for GC (H422A), AC (H422T), and TG (H422C), respectively). The mutated SalI–KpnI fragments were ligated into pBC11, yielding pBC20 (H422A), pBC21 (H422T), and pBC22 (H422C). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by plasmid sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described for wild type VAO (27Benen J.A.E. Sánchez-Torres P. Wagemaker M.J.M. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Visser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7865-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein staining of the gels was achieved using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, while histidyl-FAD fluorescence was detected as described earlier (29Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column using an Äkta system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under conditions described elsewhere (30Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All analytical experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Flavin absorption spectra were recorded on an automated Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer. Flavin fluorescence emission spectra (excitation at 450 nm) were obtained using an Aminco SPF-500 fluorometer. Redox potentials were determined by the method described by Massey (31Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990. Walter de Gruyter, New York1991: 59-66Crossref Google Scholar). For this, a cuvette containing enzyme (2–12 μm), benzyl viologen (2.0 μm), redox dye (2–10 μm), and xanthine (400 μm) was made anaerobic by flushing with argon, after which 0.2–0.5 nm xanthine oxidase was added (total volume was 750 μl). To maintain anaerobic conditions during the reductive titration, the head space of the septum-closed cuvette was continuously flushed with argon. During the xanthine oxidase-mediated reduction (lasting typically 1–2 h), spectra were recorded automatically every 30 s using a Hewlett-Packard 8453A diode array spectrophotometer. Steady state kinetic experiments were performed as described earlier (18Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow kinetics were carried out with a Hi-Tech SF-51 apparatus equipped with a Hi-Tech M300 monochromator diode-array detector (Salisbury, United Kingdom) as described previously (20Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of spectral data was performed using the Specfit Global Analysis program version 2.10 (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC). Bright yellow crystals of all His422 mutants were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at similar conditions (5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium acetate/HCl, pH 5.1) that were used for crystallizing wild type VAO (32Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystallization of H422A resulted in the most regularly shaped crystals. The crystal structure of H422A was determined in the absence and presence of the substrate analog isoeugenol using crystals of about 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm3. Binding of isoeugenol was achieved by soaking the crystal for 3 h in a solution containing a 1 mm concentration of the inhibitor. Data sets were collected at the x-ray diffraction beam line of ELETTRA (Trieste, Italy) at 100 K. Before freezing, the crystals were briefly transferred to a solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm acetate/HCl, pH 5.1. A complete data set was collected at 100 K using a single crystal. The data were processed using MOSFLM (written by A. G. W. Leslie). Crystals of the H422A mutant were isomorphous to those of wild type enzyme, and they belong to space group I4. Crystallographic refinement was performed with the REFMAC program (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction was applied using programs of the CCP4 program package (34Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Model building was carried out using the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), whereas positions of ordered water were identified using the ARP program (36Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The free R-factor was calculated employing the same reflections used for the free R-factor calculations in the refinement of the wild type structure (21Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The free R-factor was used to monitor the progress of refinement.

Open table in a new tab The three His422 mutant enzymes were purified using the same protocol as has been developed for wild type VAO, resulting in bright yellow protein preparations. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with protein staining showed that all three mutant preparations contained protein with a molecular weight similar to that of wild type VAO. Further, fluorescence analysis of the same gel revealed that the His422 mutants do not contain covalent histidyl-FAD, since, in contrast to the wild type enzyme, no flavin fluorescence could be observed. This finding was confirmed by precipitating the mutant enzymes with 5% trichloroacetic acid, resulting in a yellow supernatant containing FAD and a colorless pellet of aggregated protein. Treating wild type VAO in the same way resulted in a colorless supernatant, while a yellow pellet was formed (17De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration experiments showed that the His422 mutants are mainly in the octameric form with a small portion being present as a dimer. By simultaneously monitoring the absorbance at 280 and 450 nm, the presence of FAD in both oligomeric forms could be demonstrated. In both the octameric and dimeric state, the ratio of protein (280 nm) absorbance and flavin (450 nm) absorbance was identical. These results indicate that the purified mutants display a similar oligomerization behavior with respect to wild type VAO (30Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ratio of absorbance between 280 and 439 nm for all mutants was 11.5, which is similar to the value reported for wild type VAO (17De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Further, the flavin absorption spectra of all three mutants were virtually identical with maxima at 390 and 439 nm (Fig. 2). When comparing the flavin spectra of the mutants and wild type enzyme, it can be clearly seen that the spectral characteristics at lower wavelengths have drastically changed, while the spectral characteristics at around 439 nm are hardly affected by the mutation. These results are in line with the fact that the mutants do not form a covalent FAD bond, since 8α-substituted histidyl-FAD can be identified by a typical hypsochromic shift of the near-UV absorbance maximum with respect to unmodified FAD (37Kenney W.C. Edmondson D.E. Seng R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5386-5390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to histidyl-FAD, cysteinyl-bound FAD has been observed in several covalent flavoproteins (2Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The observation that the H422C mutant does not contain any detectable covalent FAD indicates that formation of the covalent histidyl-FAD linkage in VAO is a very specific mechanism. Further, although the mutations prevent covalent linkage of FAD, all mutants contain tightly bound FAD, since they were purified in the holo form. Attempts to generate apoenzyme using established methods (38Van Berkel W.J.H. Müller F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 261-274Google Scholar) failed. The noncovalent His422mutants displayed similar flavin fuorescence properties when compared with wild type VAO. When exciting at 450 nm, emission fluorescence spectra were observed with maxima at 535 nm. Similar to wild type VAO, the flavin fluorescence quantum yields were very low, indicating that the covalent histidyl-FAD bond is not a major factor in flavin fluorescence quenching in VAO. From these experiments, it can also be concluded that the His422 mutants have a high affinity for FAD, since no significant amounts of free FAD could be detected. These results indicate that the covalent histidyl-FAD bond is not essential for FAD binding. To examine the effect of the mutations on enzyme kinetics, the steady state kinetic parameters were determined using 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol as substrate (Table I). It was revealed that all purified mutants display significant enzyme activity. Thek cat values of the three mutants decreased by about 1 order of magnitude, while the K m values were significantly lower with respect to wild type enzyme. In contrast to observations with some other mutated covalent flavoenzymes (5Mewies M. Basran J. Packman L.C. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 39Mauch L. Bichler V. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40Hiro I. Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the activity remained constant during prolonged incubations (10 min) with substrate. This indicates that the FAD cofactor remains bound to the enzyme and is not inactivated during catalysis. Since all three mutants showed similar spectral and steady state kinetic properties, we decided to perform a more detailed study of the H422A mutant.Table IKinetic constants for the reaction of the His 422 mutants and wild type VAO with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (pH 7.5, 25 °C)ParameterWild typeaData taken from Ref. 20.H422AH422CH422TK m (μm)55343741k cat(s−1)3.10.270.320.28K d (μm)4818NDbND, not determined.NDk red(s−1)3.30.30NDNDk ox (m−1s−1)1.5 × 1052.5 × 105NDNDa Data taken from Ref. 20Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H.

Open table in a new tab The apparent increased affinity for phenolic ligands was studied in some more detail by determining the dissociation constant for the competitive inhibitor isoeugenol. Titration experiments with the H422A mutant revealed that the dissociation constant for isoeugenol was also significantly lower when compared with the correspondingK d value for wild type enzyme (18Fraaije M.W.

To identify the rate-limiting step in catalysis by the H422A mutant, stopped-flow experiments were performed. For this, the kinetics of the individual half-reactions were studied. The reductive half-reaction of H422A appeared to be a monophasic process as has been found for wild type VAO (Fig. 3). Anaerobic reduction by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol resulted in fully reduced enzyme as monitored by the absorbance decrease at 439 nm. This indicates that, as in wild type enzyme, the substrate-induced reduction of the flavin cofactor is an irreversible process (41Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Roelofs J.C.A.A. van Berkel W.J.H.

We have reported that 1,25(OH)2D3 specifically activated protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) and also caused a reduction in proliferation while increasing apoptosis and differentiation in CaCo-2 cells, a cell line derived from a human colon cancer. The mechanisms by which this secosteroid influences these important cellular processes, however, remain unclear. The transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), regulates many genes involved in these processes. Therefore, we asked whether 1,25(OH)2D3 activated AP-1 in CaCo-2 cells and, if so, by what mechanisms? 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a time-dependent increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity and significantly enhanced the protein and mRNA abundance of c-Jun, a component of AP-1. 1,25(OH)2D3 also induced a rapid and transient activation of ERK2 (where ERK is extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and a more persistent activation of JNK1 (where JNK Jun N-terminal kinase). Transfection experiments revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 also increased AP-1 gene-transactivating activity. This AP-1 activation was completely blocked by PD 098059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, as well as by a dominant negative JNK or a dominant negative Jun, indicating that the AP-1 activation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 was mediated by ERK and JNK. Using a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms, Gö6976, and CaCo-2 cells stably transfected with antisense PKC-α cDNA, demonstrated that PKC-α mediated the AP-1 activation induced by this secosteroid. Inhibition of JNK activation or c-Jun protein expression significantly reduced 1,25(OH)2D3-induced alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of CaCo-2 cell differentiation, in secosteroid-treated cells. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated AP-1 activation in CaCo-2 cells by a PKC-α- and JNK-dependent mechanism leading to increases in cellular differentiation. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) is a potential chemopreventive agent for human colon cancer.

The cellular actions of 1,25(OH)2D3, and other active metabolites of vitamin D3, are thought to be transduced by the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) upon binding to these secosteroids. The VDR-secosteroid complex heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor to bind to unique promoter sequences within the genome, i.e.vitamin D response elements, which have been demonstrated to alter the expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (2Minghetti P.P.

Recent studies have also indicated that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced several rapid, apparently non-genomic biological effects via a number of signal transduction pathways, including ceramide/phosphoinositide signaling, increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (5Okazaki T.

These isoforms can be divided into three group as follows: Ca2+-dependent (α, βI, βII, and γ), Ca2+-independent (ε, δ, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ, λ, and ι) (7Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these isoforms of PKC share highly conserved domains, they differ in substrate specificity, tissue expression, and cellular distribution, indicating that they likely play different roles in the regulation of important cellular processes (7Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

We have also shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and an enhancement of differentiation (10Halline A.G. Davidson N.O. Skarosi S.F. Sitrin M.D. Tietze C.

The mechanisms by which this secosteroid caused these important cellular processes are currently unknown. Nuclear receptors, such as the VDR and retinoid X receptor, also interact with the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) in a complex manner (12Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A.

The AP-1 complex binds to the palindromic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) with the nucleotide sequence TGA(C/G)TCA, which is found in the promoter region of many genes, including the c-jun gene, and regulates their expression.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities generally correlate with an increase in the abundance of the AP-1 complex, as well as with changes in the phosphorylation of the regulatory sites of its subunits (15Piechaczyk M.

Based on these observations, we therefore asked whether AP-1 and its upstream kinases were activated by 1,25(OH)2D3in CaCo-2 cells and, if so, by what mechanisms? The present studies demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly increased c-jun gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels and induced rapid PKC-dependent activation of ERK2 and JNK1. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 increased AP-1 transcriptional activities in an ERK- and JNK-dependent manner. AP-1 activation by this secosteroid was also PKC-α-dependent. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK activation or suppression of c-Jun expression demonstrated that AP-1 activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 played an important role in stimulating cell differentiation. 1,25(OH)2D3was purchased from Steroids LTD Laboratory (Chicago). PD 098059, a specific inhibitor of MEKs, was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth, PA). The broad spectrum PKC inhibitor, GF109203x, was obtained from LC Services (Wuburn, MA).

Other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Three days after plating, CaCo-2 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nm) with or without curcumin (15 μm), a specific JNK inhibitor (29Chen Y.R. Tan T.H.

Control cells were incubated in DMEM with 0.08% vehicle (EtOH). Media were replaced every other day. Cells were harvested on indicated days after plating for alkaline phosphatase assay. These experiments were conducted as described by Wang et al. (33Wang H. Xie Z. Scott R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In general, phosphothionate-modified oligonucleotides coding for the first six amino acids of c-Jun were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and are as follows: antisense c-junoligonucleotides: 5′-TTCCATCTTTGCAGTCAT-3′; sense c-junoligonucleotides 5′-ATGACTGCAAAGATGGAA-3′. The optimal concentration to suppress c-Jun protein expression was determined by incubation of CaCo-2 cells in DMEM with either antisense or sense c-jun oligonucleotides at the concentration between 0 and 100 μg/ml for 4 h before the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3. After 24 h incubation, the cells were harvested, and the lysates were probed in Western blot analysis by anti-c-Jun. The optimal concentration of antisense c-jun oligonucleotides was further tested in CaCo-2 cells transfected with the 3xTRE-CAT plasmid, which confirmed that at the concentration of 50 μg/ml, AP-1 activation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 was significantly inhibited by antisense c-jun oligonucleotides. To study the role of AP-1 induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in cell differentiation and cell growth, cells 3 days post-plating were treated with either antisense or sense c-jun oligonucleotides (50 μg/ml) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nm). This media containing the oligonucleotides and secosteroid was replaced every other day. Cells were harvested on the indicated days after plating for alkaline phosphatase assay. Cells were scraped and sonicated (twice at 15 s) in 2 mm Tris, 50 mmmannitol (pH 7.4). Sonicated cell extracts (50 μg of proteins) were analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity using an assay kit from Sigma. To determine whether the AP-1 DNA binding activity was induced in CaCo-2 cells by 1,25(OH)2D3, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing a consensus sequence for the AP-1-binding site. As shown in Fig. 1, 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a detectable increase in AP-1 binding as early as 15 min. This activation was maximal by 3 h and persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 1, lanes 1–8). Unlabeled oligonucleotides inhibited this binding in competition assays (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). Anti-c-Jun antibody (α-c-Jun), but not normal rabbit serum, induced a significant shift in the EMSA (supershift) (Fig. 1, lanes 11 and12). A consensus c-Myc binding sequence was used in a c-Myc EMSA to demonstrate specificity of the increases in DNA binding by AP-1, but not c-Myc, induced by 1,25(OH)2D3(data not shown). Taken together, these observations demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 increased AP-1 DNA binding activity. Western blots were used to assess alterations in the major components of AP-1 from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated CaCo-2 cells. The protein abundance of c-Jun rapidly increased within 15–30 min after exposure of CaCo-2 cells to 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 did not change the protein abundance of JunB, JunD, or c-Fos (Fig. 2 A). The RPA demonstrated that the steady state level of c-jun mRNA transcript also rapidly increased within 15 min (Fig. 3) and was maximal at approximately 1 h after exposure of CaCo-2 cells to 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3 B).FIG. 31,25(OH)2D3 increases the steady state levels of c-jun mRNA transcript. Preconfluent CaCo-2 cells were exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nm) for the indicated times. Total RNA was prepared in TRI-Reagent, and the RNase protection assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fifteen micrograms of total RNA per sample were analyzed. Human 28 S rRNA was used as the internal control to normalize total RNA loading. The protected c-Jun and 28 S rRNA are indicated on the right. A, representative c-jun RPA gel.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). To assess the potential ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce AP-1-mediated gene transcription, pre-confluent CaCo-2 cells were transfected with an empty vector plasmid, pBL-CAT, or an AP-1 reporter plasmid, 3x-TRE-CAT, that contains three TRE sites for AP-1 binding upstream of a CAT reporter gene (25Chen A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Aneskievich B.J. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4862-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since we have previously shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 had no detectable effect on c-myc gene expression in CaCo-2 cells (10Halline A.G. Davidson N.O. Skarosi S.F. Sitrin M.D. Tietze C. Alpers D.H. Brasitus T.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a c-Myc reporter plasmid, c-Myc-CAT, was employed as a control in the transfection experiments. After transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle (EtOH) for 36 h. 1,25(OH)2D3, but not vehicle (EtOH), significantly increased CAT activity more than 2-fold in cells transfected with 3x-TRE-CAT (p < 0.05), compared with cells transfected with the empty vector, pBL-CAT, and compared with 3x-TRE-CAT-transfected cells treated with EtOH (Fig. 4). In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on the CAT activity in cells transfected with c-Myc-CAT, indicating the specificity of the AP-1 activation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. MAP kinase signaling pathways, including both ERKs and JNKs, influence AP-1 transcriptional activity by increasing both the abundance of AP-1 components and altering the phosphorylation of their subunits (34Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Further studies were, therefore, performed to assess the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the ERK and JNK pathways. After treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nm) or vehicle (EtOH) for the indicated times, whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots for activated ERK1,2 and JNK1,2 using anti-active ERK1,2 and anti-active JNK1,2 polyclonal antisera, respectively. These antibodies recognize only the dual phosphorylated active forms of ERK1,2 and JNK1,2, respectively. 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a rapid activation of ERK2 within 3 min, which returned to the control level by 3 h (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 did not stimulate ERK1. JNK1, but not JNK2, was also rapidly (3 min) and more persistently (24 h) activated by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether the activation of either ERK2 and/or JNK1 was PKC-dependent, pre-confluent CaCo-2 cells were pretreated for 3 h with Gö6976, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms, and then exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nm) for the indicated times. As shown in Fig. 5 B, pretreatment with Gö6976 completely blocked the activation of ERK2 and JNK1 by 1,25(OH)2D3, indicating that stimulation of ERK2 and JNK1 by this secosteroid is mediated by one or more Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms. To elucidate the effects of ERK activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 on AP-1 activation, CaCo-2 cells, transfected with 3x-TRE-CAT, were pretreated with different concentrations of PD 098059, a specific inhibitor of MEKs, before exposure of these cells to 1,25(OH)2D3. Inhibition of MEKs by PD 098059 has previously been shown to lead to a decrease in the ability of agonists to activate ERKs/MAP kinases (35Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar, 36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that PD 098059 at 5 μm significantly reduced the AP-1 transcriptional ability induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and that at 50 μmcompletely blocked the AP-1 activation (Fig. 6 A). To evaluate the role of JNK in AP-1 activation by this secosteroid, CaCo-2 cells were co-transfected with 3x-TRE-CAT and a dominant negative JNK expression plasmid (dn-JNK), or a dominant negative Jun expression plasmid (dn-Jun), or an empty vector, pMNC (Fig. 6 B). Co-transfected dn-JNK or dn-Jun completely blocked the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to increase CAT activity in cells transfected with 3x-TRE-CAT (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the empty plasmid, pMNC, had no influence on CAT activity in cells transfected with 3x-TRE-CAT. These transfection experiments indicated that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced AP-1 transactivating ability is mediated by both ERK and JNK cascades and likely involves c-Jun phosphorylation. As noted earlier, previous studies from our laboratory have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3specifically activated PKC-α in CaCo-2 cells (9Bissonnette M. Tien X.Y. Niedziela S.M. Hartmann S.C. Frawley Jr., B.P. Roy H.K. Sitrin M.D. Perlman R.L. Brasitus T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G465-G475PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the AP-1 activation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 was PKC-dependent, additional studies were conducted. After transfection with 3x-TRE-CAT, cells were pretreated with GF109203x, a broad spectrum inhibitor of PKC isoforms, or Gö6976, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms, before exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or ethanol for 36 h. Pretreatment of CaCo-2 cells with either of these PKC inhibitors significantly reduced the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced CAT activity in these cells, indicating that PKC mediated the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced AP-1 activation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activity by Gö6976 implicated one or more of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced activation of AP-1. Since Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms were implicated in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced AP-1 activation, and this secosteroid specifically activated PKC-α in CaCo-2 cells, we examined the potential role of PKC-α in 1,25(OH)2D3-induced activation of AP-1. In order to analyze the role of PKC-α in the regulation of several phenotypic characteristics of CaCo-2 cells, we had previously prepared stably transfected CaCo-2 cells with cDNA coding for PKC-α in sense or antisense orientations, or with an empty vector as a control (24Scaglione-Sewell B. Abraham C. Bissonnette M. Skarosi S.F. Hart J. Davidson N.O. Wali R.K. Davis B.H. Sitrin M. Brasitus T.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1074-1081PubMed Google Scholar). These clones were, therefore, used to further evaluate the potential role of PKC-α in the AP-1 activation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. As expected, cells stably transfected with the empty vector responded like their parental counterparts with induction of AP-1 activity by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 8 A). Overexpression of PKC-α in cells transfected with sense PKC-α cDNA increased the basal activation of AP-1, even without the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 8 B). Whereas 1,25(OH)2D3 further enhanced the AP-1 activation in these PKC-α-overexpressing cells, this increase did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1). AP-1 activation in these cells may already be nearly maximally driven by increases in basal PKC-α expression. As sh"

By contrast, even the concentration range over which Ca2+ inhibits adenylyl cyclases AC5 and AC6 is not unambiguously defined; even less so is the mechanism of inhibition. In the present study, we compared the regulation of Ca2+-stimulable and Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclases expressed in Sf9 cells with tissues that predominantly express these activities in the mouse brain. Soluble forms of AC5 containing either intact or truncated major cytosolic domains were also examined. All adenylyl cyclases, except AC2 and the soluble forms of AC5, displayed biphasic Ca2+ responses, suggesting the presence of two Ca2+ sites of high (∼0.2 μm) and low affinity (∼0.1 mm). With a high affinity, Ca2+ (i) stimulated AC1 and cerebellar adenylyl cyclases, (ii) inhibited AC6 and striatal adenylyl cyclase, and (iii) was without effect on AC2. With a low affinity, Ca2+inhibited all adenylyl cyclases, including AC1, AC2, AC6, and both soluble forms of AC5. The mechanism of both high and low affinity inhibition was revealed to be competition for a stimulatory Mg2+ site(s). A remarkable selectivity for Ca2+was displayed by the high affinity site, with a K i value of ∼0.2 μm, in the face of a 5000-fold excess of Mg2+. The present results show that high and low affinity inhibition by Ca2+ can be clearly distinguished and that the inhibition occurs type-specifically in discrete adenylyl cyclases. Distinction between these sites is essential, or quite spurious inferences may be drawn on the nature or location of high affinity binding sites in the Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclases.

Profound physiological significance derives from the regulation of adenylyl cyclase by Ca2+, which provides a confluence of two major signaling pathways. For instance, Ca2+stimulation of adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in learning-memory functions (1Kandel E.R. Klein M. Castellucci V.F. Schacher S. Goelet P. Neurosci.

On the other hand, Ca2+ inhibition of adenylyl cyclase has been proposed to contribute to oscillations and/or pacemaking in cardiac tissue (7Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Mons N.

A central issue in implicating the Ca2+ responsiveness of an adenylyl cyclase in a physiological process concerns the correspondence between the concentrations of Ca2+ achieved in response to physiological stimuli versus those required to regulate these adenylyl cyclases in vitro. 1Earlier biochemical studies had established that the in vitro effect of Ca2+ was direct, readily reversible, and not secondary to phosphorylation or a variety of potentially Ca2+-dependent processes (18Boyajian C.L.

This issue seems moot with Ca2+-stimulable adenylyl cyclases, which are stimulated by Ca2+ in vitro and are also stimulated in response to various physiological means of elevating Ca2+ in vivo (2Chetkovich D.M.

The situation with Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclases is more complex. The averaged cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ achieved in intact cells upon triggering either capacitative- or voltage-gated Ca2+ entry (∼1 μm) corresponds to the concentrations reported to be effective at inhibiting these adenylyl cyclases in some in vitro studies (10Fagan K.A.

Some of the discrepancies may emanate from somewhat uncontrolled assay conditions, e.g. with respect to pH or free EGTA concentrations, which will confound estimates of free Ca2+(26Cooper D.M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, mixed populations of adenylyl cyclases in selected tissues may also confound analysis. The nine isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclases that have been cloned to date (7Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Mons N. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 27Smit M.J Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possess distinct characteristics including their sensitivity to Ca2+, which allows them to be classified as (i) Ca2+-stimulated (AC1, AC8, and, possibly, AC3), (ii) Ca2+-insensitive (AC2, AC4, and AC7), and (iii) Ca2+-inhibited (AC5 and AC6; Refs. 7Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Mons N. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 28Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Heterogeneous preparations of such adenylyl cyclases could give rise to a variety of Ca2+ concentration responses. There is also the issue of low affinity Ca2+ inhibition, which appears to be a property of all adenylyl cyclases. This inhibition is believed to reflect competition by Ca2+ for an allosteric regulatory site for Mg2+ (16Oldham S.B. Rude R.K. Molloy C.T. Lipson L.G. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Giannattasio G. Bianchi R. Spada A. Vallar L. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2611-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Drummond G.I. Duncan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 976-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lasker R.D.

Biophys. 1985; 241: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism is unknown. This low affinity inhibition by Ca2+can be confounded with high affinity inhibition, particularly if Ca2+ concentrations are not rigorously established or controlled (26Cooper D.M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ideally, well controlled, direct comparisons of expressed adenylyl cyclase isoforms should resolve these ambiguities. Indeed, in membranes from transfected HEK 293 cells, AC1 and AC8 were stimulated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+, while they displayed inhibition in response to higher concentrations, mirroring what happens in most brain tissues (9Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, again, the situation with the Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclases is less clear. A monophasic inhibition by Ca2+ spanning sub- to supramicromolar concentrations was associated with the first description of canine AC5 (25Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halmon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second report on rabbit AC5 indicated an inhibition by very low submicromolar (suprananomolar) Ca2+ concentrations (30Wallach J. Droste M. Kluxen F.W. Pfeuffer T. Frank R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the first description of AC6, its activity in transfected cell membranes was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (31Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), although higher concentrations were not explored. Recently, a chimeric, soluble form of AC5, comprising its fused cytosolic (C1 and C2) domains was reported to display high affinity inhibition by Ca2+, which was lost upon truncation of the C1 region (32Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AC2, which is classified as a Ca2+-insensitive adenylyl cyclase, displays inhibition in response to high concentrations of Ca2+. It therefore seems essential to clearly define the effective concentration ranges for Ca2+ inhibition of individual adenylyl cyclases. Consequently, in the present study, we compared the effects of a comprehensive range of Ca2+ concentrations on adenylyl cyclase activity from a variety of sources. Adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes of Sf9 cells expressing AC1, AC2, and AC6 was compared with adenylyl cyclase activity of two selected brain tissues that express respectively AC5 (the striatum; Refs. 33Mons N. Cooper D.M. F Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and 34Glatt C.E. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and AC1 (the cerebellum; Ref. 35Mons N. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Synapse. 1993; 14: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Also, the full-length and truncated forms of the AC5 C1/C2 chimera were assessed. Unequivocal evidence is provided demonstrating that, with a high affinity, Ca2+ inhibits AC6 (and striatal AC5), stimulates AC1 (and cerebellar AC1), and does not modulate AC2. In the supramicromolar concentration range, all adenylyl cyclases tested showed the same low affinity inhibition by Ca2+. Further analyses reveal that both the selective high affinity inhibition occurring in AC6 (and AC5) and the low affinity inhibition occurring in all adenylyl cyclase isoforms involve competitive mechanisms with Mg2+ activation of the enzyme. As for the two soluble forms of AC5, our results show that both chimeras display only low affinity inhibition and that the site of high (and low) affinity inhibition must be sought by other experimental approaches. Forskolin was from Calbiochem. [α-32P]ATP and [3H]cAMP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding AC1 and AC2 were generously provided by Drs. A. G. Gilman (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) and R. Iyengar (Mt. Sinai Medical School, New York), respectively (36Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For construction of recombinant baculovirus encoding AC6, the entire coding region of mouse AC6 was engineered by polymerase chain reaction into the baculovirus vector, pBlueBacHis2, between KpnI and SalI restriction sites. The culture of Sf9 cells and the production, cloning, and amplification of recombinant baculovirus were performed according to the method of Summers and Smith (38Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 155: 1-56Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were usually infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/cell of baculovirus and were harvested 48 h after infection. Membranes were prepared from Sf9 cells expressing individual isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, as described previously (39Caldwell K.K. Newell M.K. Cambier J.C. Prasad K.N. Masserano J.M. Schlegel W. Cooper D.M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cell suspensions were centrifuged, washed with Phillip's buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 12 units/ml kallikrein inactivator, 4 μg/ml antipain, 52.4 μg/ml benzamidine, 52.3 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following centrifugation and subsequent lysis of cells in hypo-osmotic buffer containing protease inhibitors, samples were sheared mechanically by homogenization with a Wheaton Dounce homogenizer with 25 strokes and passage through a 22-gauge needle 10 times. The lysates were centrifuged at 270 × g for 10 min. The crude membranes were prepared by pelleting this supernatant at 20,000 × g. Purified membranes were prepared by fractionation of the lysates using a continuous gradient of 5–50% sucrose in lysis buffer. The plasma membranes banding between 30 and 42% sucrose were removed and washed. The membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 800 μmEGTA, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin, at a final protein concentration of 0.5–2.5 mg/ml (as determined by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Roy A. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard). The preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen. The plasmids encoding the soluble forms of AC5 comprising either the C1 or C1a domain linked to the C2 domain (VC1C2 and VC1aC2, respectively) were kindly provided by Dr. T. B. Patel (University of Kentucky, Lexington; Ref. 32Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain TP2000, which is incapable of producing cAMP (42Beauve A. Boesten B. Crasnier M. Danchin A. O'Gara F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of VC1C2 and VC1aC2, cell lysis and assays were performed as described previously (32Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Male mice of the C57bl/6 strain were decapitated. The brain was removed and placed on dry ice. The cerebellum was detached and homogenized immediately. A transverse section of the forebrain was made at the level of the optic chiasma, and the dorsal striatum were dissected based on the method described by Glowinski and Iversen (43Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5024) Google Scholar). The tissues were homogenized and centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min in 20 volumes of a cold Tris-sucrose (50 mm, 10%) buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.8 mm EGTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described above. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was washed and centrifuged three times before final suspension in a volume of Tris buffer (50 mm) sufficient to give a concentration of proteins in the range of 1 mg/ml as determined by the method of Lowry (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Before use for the adenylyl cyclase assay, the samples were further washed and centrifuged two times in 2 ml of a Hepes buffer (50 mm), pH 7.4, containing 240 μm EGTA and 0.25% bovine serum albumin. The adenylyl cyclase activity of infected Sf9 cells or mouse brain tissues (striatum and cerebellum) was measured in the presence of the following components: 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.04 mm GTP, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 70 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. (MgCl2and ATP concentrations were varied in some experiments, as indicated). Because we were inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity to low levels (at high [Ca2+], particularly at low [Mg2+]), maximizing these values was desirable to generate robust kinetic parameters; consequently, basal activity was enhanced with forskolin for all sources except cerebellum and striatum, which displayed elevated basal activities. Forskolin stimulation was employed in some experiments from these latter sources and yielded unchanged parameters (not shown). Calmodulin (1 μm) was included for the assay of cells expressing AC1 and cerebellar membranes. Free Ca2+concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2solutions buffered with 60 μm EGTA in the assay and were calculated as described previously in detail (44Ahlijanian M.K. Cooper D.M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated with sodium lauryl sulfate (0.5%) containing 1.5 mm cAMP and 22 mm ATP. [3H]cAMP (∼10,000 cpm) was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantified as described previously (45Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Data points are presented as mean activities of triplicate determinations (error bars are indicated when they are larger than the data point symbolsin FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5). For each assay, at least two adenylyl cyclases were compared, and a cerebellum Ca2+ dose-response curve was determined as an internal control to monitor the accuracy of the Ca2+ buffering system.FIG. 4Effects of Ca2+ on the MgATP dependence of adenylyl cyclase activity. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined in the membranes expressing AC6, AC2, and AC1, respectively, and in striatum membranes in the absence of Ca2+ (○) and in the presence of 3.41 μmCa2+ (■) or 89 μm Ca2+ (▵). Forskolin concentration included in the assay was 25 μmfor AC6 and 10 μm for AC2 and AC1. No forskolin was added in striatal assays.

No forskolin was included in assays of either striatal or cerebellar membranes. Eachpanel shows a representative experiment that was repeated at least three times with similar results. Data are mean adenylyl cyclase activity (± S.E.) of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These assays were conducted as described above except that concentrations of Mg2+ or ATP varied. Free Mg2+ concentrations were established from a series of MgCl2 solutions buffered with 60 μmEGTA and were calculated as described previously (44Ahlijanian M.K. Cooper D.M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the respective effects of occupancy of high and low affinity regulatory sites for Ca2+, two selected concentrations of Ca2+ (2.75 and 86 μm) were included in these assays. After calculation, the concentrations of free Ca2+ actually ranged from 2.59 to 3.43 μm and from 81.6 to 90.1 μm, respectively, in the presence of the lowest and the highest concentration of Mg2+ or ATP. Nonlinear regression was used to fit a competition curve with either one or two components to the data (Graphpad, Inplot4). Goodness of fit was quantified by the least-squares method (F-test) and was deemed better suited to one model when p was <0.05. Paired Student's t tests (two-tailed) were performed to compare the means of K m or K a values determined with different concentrations of Ca2+. The effects of a broad range of Ca2+ concentrations on adenylyl cyclase activity were compared in membranes from Sf9 cells expressing AC6 and striatum (which predominantly expresses AC5; Ref. 33Mons N. Cooper D.M. F Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Clearly, Ca2+elicits a biphasic decline in activity with increasing concentration (Fig. 1). In both cases, curve-fitting analyses revealed that the inhibition curves always fitted significantly better to a two-component model (p < 0.05), for which the effective concentrations giving 50% of the response (EC50) were in the ranges of submicromolar concentrations and submillimolar concentrations, respectively (Table I). By contrast, the effects of Ca2+ on the adenylyl cyclase activity in Sf9 cells expressing AC1 and in cerebellum membranes were bidirectional. Stimulation occurred within the range of submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+, whereas inhibition occurred at submillimolar concentrations (Fig. 1). Curve fitting of these data indicated that stimulation occurred with a K a in the submicromolar range and inhibition in the suprami"
https://openalex.org/W1964286235,"The drug-binding domain of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) probably consists of residues from multiple transmembrane (TM) segments. In this study, we tested whether the amino acids in TM11 participate in binding drug substrates. Each residue in TM11 was initially altered by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine. Mutants G939V, F942A, T945A, Q946A, A947L, Y953A, A954L, and G955V had altered drug-stimulated ATPase activities. Direct evidence for binding of drug substrate was then determined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the residues in TM11 and inhibition of drug-stimulated ATPase activity by dibromobimane, a thiol-reactive substrate. Dibromobimane inhibited the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of two mutants, F942C and T945C, by more than 75%. These results suggest that residues Phe942 and Thr945 in TM11, together with residues previously identified in TM6 (Leu339 and Ala342) and TM12 (Leu975, Val982, and Ala985) (Loo, T. W., and Clarke, D. M. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31945–31948) form part of the drug-binding domain of P-gp. The drug-binding domain of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) probably consists of residues from multiple transmembrane (TM) segments. In this study, we tested whether the amino acids in TM11 participate in binding drug substrates. Each residue in TM11 was initially altered by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine. Mutants G939V, F942A, T945A, Q946A, A947L, Y953A, A954L, and G955V had altered drug-stimulated ATPase activities. Direct evidence for binding of drug substrate was then determined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the residues in TM11 and inhibition of drug-stimulated ATPase activity by dibromobimane, a thiol-reactive substrate. Dibromobimane inhibited the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of two mutants, F942C and T945C, by more than 75%. These results suggest that residues Phe942 and Thr945 in TM11, together with residues previously identified in TM6 (Leu339 and Ala342) and TM12 (Leu975, Val982, and Ala985) (Loo, T. W., and Clarke, D. M. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31945–31948) form part of the drug-binding domain of P-gp. P-glycoprotein dibromobimane transmembrane The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp),1 is an ATP-dependent drug pump that can extrude a broad range of structurally diverse compounds from the cell (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Ambudkar S.V.

The physiological role of P-gp is unknown. It is postulated that P-gp may protect us from exogenous and endogenous cytotoxic agents, and this is supported by studies on “knockout” mice (4Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H.

P-gp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transport proteins (10Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). The 1280 amino acids of P-gp are predicted to be organized as two tandem repeats, with each repeat consisting of a hydrophobic domain containing six predicted TM segments followed by a hydrophilic domain containing an ATP-binding site (11Chen C.J. Clark D. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 506-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Earlier studies showed that both halves of the protein are required for activity (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both ATP-binding sites are active (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

P-gp activity is completely abolished if either nucleotide-binding site is blocked by mutation (16Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) or chemical modification (17Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Understanding the nature of the drug-binding site(s) of P-gp is an important step in determining its mechanism. To this end, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis together with a thiol-reactive compound, dibromobimane (dBBn), to identify residues within the transmembrane (TM) domains that form the drug-binding site(s) (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The rationale with this approach is that a thiol-reactive compound that is also a substrate of P-gp would covalently bind to an available cysteine residue in the drug-binding site and inhibit drug-stimulated ATPase activity. In initial studies, we showed that residues in TM6 and TM12 of P-gp contribute to the drug-binding domain (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether TM11 also participates in binding of drug substrates. The residues in TM11 could potentially contribute or form part of the drug-binding site, since a natural mutation (S939F) in mouse mdr3 P-gp was shown to affect the activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme (20Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7289-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Kajiji S. Talbot F. Grizzuti K. Van Dyke-Phillips V. Agresti M. Safa A.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5041-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Most of the residues in TM11 were initially changed to that with a small, nonpolar side chain, and the mutant protein was assayed for changes in activity and substrate specificity. Direct assay for drug binding was then carried out with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and inhibition of substrate-stimulated ATPase activity by dBBn. A full-length MDR1 cDNA was modified to encode for 10 histidine residues at the COOH end of P-gp to facilitate its purification by nickel-chelate chromatography (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less mutant of P-gp that also had a 10-histidine tag at the COOH terminus as described previously (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp was done as described previously (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 10-cm diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μmcyclosporin A. P-gp was expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A because drug substrates promote maturation of the protein (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were then harvested 24 h later and solubilized with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The purified histidine-tagged P-gp was diluted with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml crude sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma, type II, commercial grade) that had been washed with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to remove traces of inorganic phosphate. The samples were then sonicated in an ice water bath for 45 s at maximum setting using a Branson Sonifier 450 sonicator with a bath-type probe attachment. An aliquot of sonicated P-gp/lipid sample was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by the addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and the desired drug substrate. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined by the method of Chifflet et al. (27Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For inhibition with dBBn, the P-gp/lipid mixture was preincubated with 2 mm dBBn (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cysteine, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 40 mm. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was then determined as described above. The purified histidine-tagged P-gp was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The amino acids (937–957) that are predicted to be in TM11 are shown in Fig. 1. The region encompassing TM11 spans the membrane, since it was shown that residue 967 is on the extracellular side of the membrane. In contrast, residue 931 is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We first tested the importance of residues in TM11 by analyzing the effects of mutations on the drug-stimulated ATPase activity of the mutant P-gp. Measurement of drug-stimulated ATPase activity is a useful assay for studying P-gp-drug interactions. Stimulation of wild-type P-gp ATPase activity by drug substrates has a characteristic pattern. In the presence of low concentrations of drug substrates, there is stimulation of ATPase activity. The activity, however, is inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of drug substrates (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Germann U.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that at low concentrations of drug substrates, there is initial stimulation of wild-type P-gp ATPase activity, with maximal activity at about 0.03 mmvinblastine, 0.3 mm verapamil, and 3 mmcolchicine, respectively. The ATPase activity is then inhibited at higher concentrations of drug substrates. This typical ATPase activity profile provides a relatively simple assay for testing the effect of mutations or chemical modification of P-gp on P-gp-drug substrate interactions. The effect (i.e. the apparent affinity) is quantitated by measuring the concentration of drug substrate required to achieve half-maximal stimulation. It was also recently shown that there is good correlation in the turnover numbers between vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity and transport of vinblastine out of the cell (29Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, vinblastine was used for measurement of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil and colchicine were also included because verapamil causes the highest level of stimulation of ATPase activity, whereas colchicine is commonly used in drug resistance profile assays (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The residues in TM11 were initially changed to alanine, except that alanine was changed to valine, glycine to valine, and isoleucine to serine. All of the changes were made to a cDNA of P-gp containing a His10 tag at the COOH terminus. The presence of the tag facilitated purification of the mutant P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography. The presence of the histidine tag does not affect the activity of P-gp (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The mutant P-gps were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Except for mutant G939V, all of the mutants expressed the 170-kDa protein as the major product. The major product in mutant G939V was a 150-kDa core-glycosylated protein that was sensitive to endoglycosidase H (data not shown). In the presence of cyclosporin A, however, all of the mutants, including mutant G939V, yielded the fully mature 170-kDa protein (Fig. 3). It appeared that mutation G939V affected folding and maturation of P-gp. This folding defect was corrected by expression in the presence of drug substrate (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The mutant P-gps were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography, mixed with crude sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine, sonicated, and then assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of various concentrations of verapamil, vinblastine or colchicine (Table I). In the presence of verapamil, the majority of the mutants had 80–120% of the maximal activity of wild-type enzyme. The lowest activity was observed in mutant G939V (62% of wild-type activity), while mutant Y953A had the highest (205%) activity. There was moderate stimulation of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities in mutants T945A (140%), G955V (143%), and F957A (126%).Table IDrug-stimulated ATPase activityMutantDrugVerapamilVinblastineColchicineV maxK mV maxK mV maxK m% of WTaWT, wild type.μm% of WTμm% of WTmmWT100241005.41000.62I937S9422936.11000.69F938A10632965.1960.68G939V628454.01650.26I940S9332935.6930.65T941A100251045.51000.66F942A8893305.1240.80S943A92261005.2850.62F944A93141055.31010.64T945A1401001658.3560.65Q946A101165578.5180.64A947L1051566013.0511.87M948A103231015.91030.62M949A8240965.5610.60Y950A109371195.1990.62F951A9431995.21010.64S952A108361235.1910.69Y953A205110598.51310.67A954L1084413NDbND, not determined due to low activity.8NDG955V143101043.52200.47C956A9724955.31450.63F957A12621474.8321.0a WT, wild type.b ND, not determined due to low activity. Open table in a new tab Several mutants showed changes in the apparent affinity (concentration of substrate required for half-maximal stimulation of ATPase activity) for verapamil (Table I). Wild-type P-gp had an apparent affinity of 24 μm verapamil, while mutants F942A, T945A, Q946A, A947L, and Y953A had decreased apparent affinities of 93, 100, 165, 156, and 110 μm, respectively. One mutant, G939V, showed the largest increase in apparent affinity for verapamil (8 μm). The mutants were then assayed for vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity (Table I). One mutant, T945A, showed a pronounced increase in activity (165% of wild-type enzyme). By contrast, mutants A954L and F942A had only 13 and 30%, respectively, of the wild-type activity. Moderate decreases in activity (40–50%) were observed for mutants G939V, Q946A, A947L, Y953A, and F957A. The mutant, A947L, also exhibited a decrease in the apparent affinity for vinblastine. It had an apparent affinity of 13 μm vinblastine, while that of wild-type P-gp was 5.4 μm vinblastine. The vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant A954L was too low for accurate determination of its apparent affinity. In the presence of colchicine (Table I), mutant G955V showed the largest change in activity. Its maximal colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity was 220% of that of wild-type P-gp, while those of mutants G939V, C956A, and Y953A were moderately increased (165, 145, and 131%, respectively). There were, however, significant decreases in the activity for mutants Q946A (18%), F942A (24%), and F957A (32%). Two mutants had large changes in their apparent affinity for colchicine. Wild-type P-gp had an apparent affinity of 620 μmcolchicine, while those of mutants A947L and G939V were 1870 and 260 μm colchicine, respectively. These results (Table I) show that the activity and apparent affinity of P-gp for verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine are greatly affected by some mutations in TM11. A potential disadvantage of these indirect assays, however, is that it is difficult to determine if the mutations that affected activity were actually close to the drug-binding domain or whether they affected the global structure of the protein. Therefore, an assay that can directly measure the importance of each residue of TM11 in P-gp-substrate interaction was used. Another direct method for testing whether residues in TM11 contribute to the drug-binding site(s) is to use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis followed by modification of with the thiol-reactive substrate, dBBn. The rationale for using a thiol-reactive substrate is that it will occupy the drug-binding site of P-gp and covalently label any adjacent cysteine residue and thus inhibit drug-stimulated ATPase activity. dBBn is a relatively good substrate of P-gp, since it stimulates the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp more than 8-fold at a concentration of 1 mm, and its ability to act as a substrate can be quenched by reaction with cysteine (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a series of Cys mutants was constructed using a Cys-less P-gp that had a histidine tag at the COOH terminus of P-gp (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells to determine whether the mutations had caused misprocessing of the mutant protein. All the mutants, except F957C, yielded the mature 170-kDa protein as the major product (data not shown). Mutant F957C may be unstable and susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Immunoblots of cell extracts of HEK 293 transfected with mutant F957C showed the presence of only degradation products (data not shown). The Cys mutants were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography, mixed with lipid and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil was used because it is the most potent stimulator of P-gp ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows that all of the mutants had ATPase activities that were comparable (70–110%) to that of Cys-less P-gp. Mutant G939C had the lowest activity (70% of that of Cys-less P-gp). To test whether the activity of the Cys mutants could be inhibited by dBBn, each mutant was treated with 1 mm dBBn for 5 min at 37 °C, quenched with cysteine, and then assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. The activity of the dBBn-treated sample was compared with that of a mock-treated sample. Fig. 5 shows that the majority of the mutants, except for G939C, F942C, T945C, and Y953C, were not affected by treatment with dBBn. The activities of mutants F943C and Y953C were slightly inhibited by dBBn (38 and 26% respectively). In contrast, the activities of mutants F942C and T945C, were almost completely inhibited by dBBn (80 and 85%, respectively). The activities of mutants F942C and T945C were inhibited to the greatest extent by dBBn. Therefore, they were chosen for further analysis to determine whether inhibition by dBBn could be prevented by drug substrates such as verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine. In this assay, the mutant P-gps were pretreated with dBBn, quenched with cysteine, and then assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 6 A); or they were preincubated with verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine, treated with dBBn, quenched with cysteine, and then assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 6 B). The activities were compared with that of a mock-treated sample of P-gp. Fig. 6 A shows that Cys-less P-gp was insensitive to inhibition by dBBn. By contrast, the verapamil-, vinblastine-, or colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities of mutants F942C or T945C were inhibited by more than 70% when pretreated with dBBn. We then tested whether the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine could protect mutants F942C or T945C from inactivation by dBBn. The mutant was preincubated with 1 mmverapamil, 0.1 mm vinblastine, or 10 mmcolchicine and then treated with 1 mm dBBn. After 5 min, dBBn reactivity was quenched by the addition of cysteine, and the ATPase activity was determined. Again, the Cys-less P-gp did not show any difference when pretreated with substrate (Fig. 6 B). The activities of mutants F942C and T945C, however, were protected by pretreatment with substrate (Fig. 6 B). Vinblastine offered the greatest protection, since the mutants retained about 70–80% of their original activities. Verapamil and colchicine also protected the mutant from inactivation by dBBn. These results suggest that binding of dBBn to P-gp overlaps that of P-gp binding to verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine and suggest that TM11 forms part of the binding site for dBBn, verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine. Mutants G939V, F942A, T945A, Q946A, A947L, and Y953A in TM11 had altered apparent affinities for verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine. Mutation of residue Ala954 to leucine appeared to disrupt P-gp-substrate interactions, since little drug-stimulated ATPase activity could be detected in the presence of vinblastine or colchicine. When the amino acids of TM11 are arranged in an α-helical wheel (Fig. 7), it was found that these sensitive residues are clustered on one face of the TM segment. These observations are consistent with the results of Hanna et al.(33Hanna M. Brault M. Kwan T. Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3625-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who showed that mutations to the homologous residues in TM11 of mouse mdr3 P-gp had significant effects on the drug resistance profile of P-gp. There is a potential drawback of studying only the effect of mutations on the drug resistance profile of P-gp or of studying the effect of mutations on the ATPase activity of P-gp. It is often difficult to determine whether the mutations that alter the resistance profile or activity of P-gp are due to the residue being critical for drug binding or due to disruption, by the mutation, of the global structure of the enzyme. Previous mutational analysis of mouse, hamster, and human P-gp have shown that changes introduced into all domains such as the TM domains (20Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) can all affect the activity or substrate specificity of P-gp. It is unlikely that all of these residues are involved in binding drug substrates. Indeed, we recently showed by deletion analysis that the nucleotide-binding domains are not required for drug binding (47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutations in the nucleotide-binding domains have been reported to alter drug-stimulated ATPase activity of P-gp (45Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutant G185V is an example of a mutation that probably alters P-gp-drug interactions because of structural perturbations. This mutant was of great interest because it was the first natural mutation in P-gp that altered the substrate specificity of P-gp. It conferred increased resistance to colchicine but reduced resistance to vinblastine when compared with wild-type P-gp (42Choi K.H. Chen C.J. Kriegler M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1988; 53: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 48Kioka N. Tsubota J. Kakehi Y. Komano T. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of this mutant, however, led to the conclusion that G185V alters function of P-gp by affecting the structure of the transporter (49Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Hrycyna C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is also likely that some of the mutations in TM11 in this study that resulted in altered drug-stimulated ATPase activity could also be due to structural perturbations, since relatively small residues were replaced with larger ones (G939V, A947L, A954L, and G955V). Indeed, it is not inconceivable that such a single change can cause rather large perturbations in P-gp. An example of an extreme case is mutant G341C (in TM6) that caused complete misfolding of P-gp such that the mutant P-gp was more susceptible to digestion in the first extracellular loop (50Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, a way of circumventing these potential problems was to use a direct assay with dBBn to test whether TM11 residues participate in binding drug substrate. Reaction of dBBn with two mutants, F942C and T945C, significantly inhibited substrate-stimulated ATPase activity. The presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine protected mutants F942C and T945C from inhibition by dBBn. Fig. 7 shows that both residues Phe942 and Thr945 are separated by one turn of the helix and are on the same face. Taken together, we propose that residues Phe942 and Thr945 form part of the drug-binding domain of P-gp, together with residues Leu339 and Ala342 (TM6) and residues Leu975, Val982, and Ala985 (TM12). dBBn also inhibited the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of these residues when they were mutated to cysteine (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the residues in TM6 and TM12 are far apart in the linear sequence of P-gp, they are quite close together in the tertiary structure of P-gp. Cross-linking studies between residues in TM6 and TM12 have shown that residues Gly346 (TM6) and Gly989 (TM12) can be oxidatively cross-linked (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cross-linking between these residues is blocked by the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine. TM11 also appears to be close to TM6 and TM12 in native P-gp. TM11 is separated from TM12 by a relatively short extracellular loop of only 16 amino acids. Therefore, as a working model, the residues of TM6, TM11, and TM12 are arranged as α-helical wheels, with the residues sensitive to inhibition by dBBn positioned so that they face a central substrate-binding pocket. The helices are also oriented to take into account the cross-linkable nature of residues 346 (TM6) and 989 (TM12) in the mutant G346C/G989C (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to determine the role of residues in other TM segments of P-gp in binding drug substrates. We thank Dr. Randal Kaufman for pMT21."

Pulsatile GH replacement in hypophysectomized mice stimulated body weight gain in wild-type but not in STAT5b-deficient mice. Expression of the male-specific liver P450 enzyme CYP2D9, which is reduced to female levels in hypophysectomized male mice, was restored to male levels by GH pulse replacement in wild-type but not in STAT5b-deficient mice. Similarly, a female-specific liver CYP2B P450 enzyme that was up-regulated to female levels following hypophysectomy of males was suppressed to normal basal male levels by GH pulses only in wild-type hypophysectomized mice. Finally, urinary excretion of the male-specific, GH pulse-induced major urinary protein was restored to normal male levels following pulsatile GH treatment only in the case of wild-type hypophysectomized mice.

Eden S. Jansson J.-O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the temporal patterns of pituitary GH secretion differ in males and females in many species, resulting in the expression of some genes predominantly in males and other genes predominantly in females (2Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3Shapiro B.H. Agrawal A.K. Pampori N.A. Int. J. Biochem.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 391-417Crossref Google Scholar). In male rats, plasma GH pulses are separated by periods of >2 h during which there is negligible GH detectable in blood. In contrast, the female plasma GH pattern is characterized by a more continuous presence of GH or, in some species such as mice, by more frequent pulses of GH (3Shapiro B.H. Agrawal A.K. Pampori N.A.

Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). GH binds to cell surface receptors that dimerize upon hormone binding and subsequently activate the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates itself and the GH receptor on multiple tyrosine residues. STAT proteins are then recruited to the GH receptor/JAK2 complex and are phosphorylated on tyrosine and subsequently on serine. STAT proteins activated in this manner form homo- or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to target sites in GH-responsive genes (6Carter-Su C. Smit L.S. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 61-82PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davey H.W. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 959-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). STAT5 proteins in the liver are intermittently, and repeatedly, activated in response to GH pulses (8Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). GH also activates liver STAT1 and STAT3, but the activation of these STATs is largely independent of the temporal pattern of GH in blood (10Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). STAT5a and STAT5b are encoded by different genes; however, they share >90% amino acid identity. While initially referred to as mammary gland factor because of the role in mediating the effects of prolactin on the expression of β-casein in the mammary gland (11Wakao H. Schmitt-Ney N.M. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16365-16370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Hofer P. Hynes N.E. Groner B. Mol.

Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two separate genes were identified and shown to be expressed in a wide range of tissues (14Lin J.-X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). STAT5a and STAT5b are now known to be differentially expressed in various tissues, and to have independent and distinct as well as common functions (18Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherzhuss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). STAT5b accounts for ∼90% of the STAT5 in the liver; however, STAT5b and STAT5a are both required for the constitutive expression of certain GH-regulated liver cytochrome P450 enzymes (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The involvement of STAT5b in GH-pulse responsive liver gene expression was recognized from studies in which liver STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and DNA binding were temporally correlated with plasma GH pulses and with the pattern of male-specific liver gene expression (8Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further confirmation came from the finding that certain GH pulse-regulated, male-specific liver P450 genes contain STAT5 response elements (21Subramanian A. Wang J.M. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), from the recent demonstration that STAT5b nuclear localization correlates with the gender-specific expression of P450 genes in wild-type and estrogen receptor-α-deficient mice (22Sueyoshi T. Yokomori N. Korach K.S. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and from our analysis of STAT5b-deficient mice, which displayed loss of male-specific pubertal body growth and male-specific liver gene expression (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear from these studies whether GH target tissues such as liver become unresponsive to pulsatile GH as a direct consequence of the loss of STAT5b, or whether an alteration in the pattern of pituitary GH secretion in these animals leads to the observed phenotypes. In the present study, we address this question by directly examining the effects of exogenous GH pulses given to mice where the major source of endogenous GH has been eliminated by hypophysectomy. The effects of pulsatile GH replacement on body weight gain and on the gender-specific expression of genes in the liver were analyzed. Pulsatile GH replacement in wild-type but not STAT5b-deficient mice is shown to restore expression of genes normally expressed in intact male mice. Additionally, GH pulse replacement is shown to increase overall body weight gain in wild-type but not in STAT5b-deficient mice. These data strongly support our proposal that the STAT5b pathway directly mediates physiological signaling in hepatocytes in response to pulsatile GH stimulation. Male outcrossed 129 × BALB/c wild-type and STAT5b gene-disrupted mice (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) were hypophysectomized at 4–17 weeks of age and maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule with free access to food and drinking water supplemented with 5% glucose. After a recovery period of at least 7.5 weeks, the mice were given pulsatile GH replacement by injection. GH (2 μg/g body weight) was injected intraperitoneally at 12-h intervals for 7 days, either alone or combined with T4 (0.2 μg/ml added to the 5% glucose/drinking water to give an approximate dose of 20 ng of T4/g of body weight/day). This hormone replacement regimen has been shown to re-establish male-specific patterns of liver P450 gene expression in GH-deficient mice (24Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15923-1592723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of T4 in combination with GH is required for expression of MUP proteins (25Knopf J.L. Gallagher J.F. Held W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2234-2240Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Urine was collected and body weights were monitored during the hormone replacement period. The mice were maintained without hormone treatment for another 3–6 weeks, at which time they were killed to collect untreated hypophysectomized livers, or were given GH pulse replacement without T4 as described above. Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Animal procedures were approved by the Ruakura Animal Ethics Committee operating under the guidelines of the New Zealand National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee. Mice were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine and rompun (intraperitoneal injection of 120 μg of ketamine hydrochloride (Bristol-Meyers Co.) and 12 μg of xylozine hydrochloride (Rompun, Bayer NZ Ltd., Auckland, NZ) per g of body weight) and hypophysectomized by the parapharyngeal route (26Averill R.L.W. Grattan D.R. Norris S.K. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Successful hypophysectomy was verified by monitoring body weights and major urinary proteins in urine, and by post mortem inspection of the base of the skull. Urine was collected from mice before and after hypophysectomy and following hormone replacement. Samples (0.5 μl) were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue. MUP protein (major ∼20-kDa protein band) was quantified by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Samples that contained high levels of MUP were diluted as required to enable quantification. A total tissue homogenate was prepared by homogenizing liver (∼1 g) in 10 ml of homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 100 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuging at 9,000 rpm for 15 min. Microsomal pellets were separated from the cytosolic supernatant by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h), suspended in 0.1 m KPi buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, pH 7.4, and stored at −80 °C until use. Cytosolic and total tissue homogenate protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC detergent protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Microsomal protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay kit (Sigma). Mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 (S21120) and anti-STAT3 (S21320) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT5a (sc-1081) and anti-STAT5b (sc-835) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). These STAT5 antibodies were shown to be essentially specific for STAT5a and STAT5b, respectively, under our Western blotting conditions (27Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5126-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-rat CYP2B1 (28Waxman D.J. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10446-10457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse CYP2D9 antibody, obtained from Dr. M. Negishi (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC) (29Harada N. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12285-12290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used for the Western blot analysis of mouse microsomal CYP2B and CYP2D proteins, respectively. Liver cytosolic proteins (40 μg) or microsomal proteins (20 μg) were electrophoresed through standard Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% gels for STAT proteins; 8% gels for mouse microsomal CYP proteins), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then probed with anti-STAT or anti-CYP antibodies. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 3% nonfat dry milk and 1% BSA in a high Tween buffer (0.3% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) for anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3, or with 2% Blotto and 2% BSA in TST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl) for probing with anti-STAT5a and anti-STAT5b. For microsomal CYP Western blotting, membranes were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 3% nonfat dry milk and 1% BSA in TST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were diluted 1/3000 (STAT antibodies) or 1/5000 (CYP antibodies) and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. Bands visualized on x-ray film were scanned using a Cannon IX-4015 scanner and Ofoto scanning software. Nitrocellulose membranes were stripped for 20 min at 50 °C (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) before reprobing. Total liver homogenate protein (15 μg) was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 9 μl of gel mobility shift buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 10 fmol of DNA probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5% glycerol, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 625 μmEDTA, and 625 μm dithiothreitol). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the STAT5 response element of the rat β-casein promoter (nucleotides −101 to −80, 5′-GGA-CTT-CTT-GGA-ATT-AAG-GGA-3′) was end-labeled on one strand with32P using T4 kinase. The probe was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and 10 min on ice, to stabilize the STAT5-DNA gel-shift complex (9Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), then added to the protein-buffer mix. For supershift analysis, an additional 10-min incubation in the presence of STAT antibodies was carried out after the addition of the labeled DNA probe. Antibodies used were anti-STAT5a (sc-1081x) and anti-STAT5b (sc-835) from Santa-Cruz. Following 30 min of pre-electrophoresis, the samples were electrophoresed through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (5.5% acrylamide, 0.07% bisacrylamide) (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Trizma base, 44.5 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) for 20 min in the cold room at 120 V, then at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. Wild-type and STAT5b-deficient male mice were hypophysectomized to eliminate endogenous pituitary GH. Successful hypophysectomy was demonstrated by the cessation of body weight gain (Fig. 1) and by the loss of MUP protein excretion in urine (see below), and was verified by post mortem inspection of the base of the skull and by the substantial decrease in serum prolactin at sacrifice (data not shown). In wild-type mice, resumption of growth, evidenced by body weight gain, was stimulated by hormone replacement therapy in the form of pulsatile GH combined with T4 treatment, or alternatively, pulsatile GH alone (Fig. 1,A, closed symbols, and B). In STAT5b-deficient mice, however, GH did not stimulate body weight gain (Fig. 1). MUPs, which are synthesized in the liver in response to GH and other hormonal factors (25Knopf J.L. Gallagher J.F. Held W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2234-2240Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), are excreted in urine at approximately 3-fold higher levels in male than female mice (30Norstedt G. Palmiter R. Cell. 1984; 36: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). MUP excretion in wild-type male mice was markedly reduced following hypophysectomy (Fig. 2), in agreement with earlier reports in hypophysectomized or GH-deficient mice (25Knopf J.L. Gallagher J.F. Held W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2234-2240Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Norstedt G. Palmiter R. Cell. 1984; 36: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Johnson D. al-Shawi R. Bishop J.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 21-34Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). STAT5b-deficient males excreted low levels of MUPs, and these were further reduced following hypophysectomy. Pulsatile GH replacement in combination with T4 in wild-type hypophysectomized mice increased MUP protein excretion to the original levels of intact male mice. By contrast, this same hormonal regimen had essentially no effect in STAT5b-deficient mice (Fig. 2 B). Western blots of liver homogenates probed with anti-STAT antibodies confirmed the selective absence of STAT5b protein and showed that hypophysectomy did not alter the expression of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, or STAT5b proteins in wild-type (Fig. 3 A, lane 6 versus lanes 1 and2) or in STAT5b-deficient mice (Fig. 3 A,lane 7 versus lanes 8–10). GH pulse replacement in hypophysectomized wild-type mice induced the appearance of a slower migrating STAT5b band (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5), which we previously identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b form (10Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similar to our earlier observations (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), the levels of STAT1 were higher in STAT5b-deficient compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3 A,lanes 7–14 versus lanes 1–6), and these levels were not altered by hypophysectomy (lane 7 versus lanes 8–10). EMSA analysis using the STAT5-binding sequence of the rat β-casein promoter (32Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Mall R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed that there was negligible STAT5 DNA binding activity in liver extracts from both wild-type and STAT5b-deficient hypophysectomized mice (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3 and 9–11). This finding is in accord with the requirement of pituitary GH for STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity indicated by studies carried out in the rat liver model (8Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). GH replacement strongly increased DNA binding in hypophysectomized wild-type mice (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6). A significant, albeit weaker STAT5 EMSA activity was obtained in hypophysectomized STAT5b-deficient mice after GH pulse treatment (Fig. 3 B, lanes 12 and13). In wild-type mice these EMSA bands were partially supershifted by anti-STAT5a antibodies (Fig. 3 B,lane 7) and completely supershifted by anti-STAT5b antibodies (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). These supershifted bands primarily contain STAT5b homodimers, but also include STAT5a homodimers and STAT5a-STAT5b heterodimers (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The weak STAT5-DNA complex formed by liver extracts from STAT5b-deficient mice given GH pulse replacement was completely supershifted by anti-STAT5a antibody (Fig. 3 B,lane 14), consistent with the complex corresponding to a STAT5a-STAT5a homodimer that is formed in livers deficient in STAT5b. The supershift with anti-STAT5b antibodies seen in STAT5b-deficient liver extracts (Fig. 3 B, lane 15) is indicative of cross-reactivity between this antibody and STAT5a under conditions of EMSA analysis, as discussed elsewhere (27Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5126-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CYP2D9 is expressed at severalfold higher levels in males compared with females (Fig. 4 A, band b, lanes 1–3 versus lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, livers of STAT5b-deficient male mice express levels of CYP2D9 that are much lower than wild-type males and are similar to those in wild-type females (lanes 4 and 5 and lanes 6 and 7). Wild-type hypophysectomized mice also expressed low levels of CYP2D9 (Fig. 4 B, band b, lanes 2–4), but expression was substantially restored following GH pulse replacement (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–8). In contrast, the low levels of CYP2D9 in hypophysectomized STAT5b-deficient male mice were not restored by GH pulse replacement (Fig. 4 C,band b, lanes 7–9 versus lanes 2–6). CYP2B (band b) is expressed specifically in female mouse liver (Fig. 5 A,lanes 6–7 versus lanes 1–3). Hypophysectomy of wild-type male mice increased CYP2B (band b) to female levels (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4–6), supporting the proposal that expression of this protein is negatively regulated by pituitary GH (33Sharma M.C. Agrawal A.K. Sharma M.R. Shapiro B.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CYP2B (band b) is also expressed at an elevated level in both intact and hypophysectomized male STAT5b-deficient mice (Fig. 5, A,lanes 4 and 5; B,lanes 10–12). GH pulse replacement eliminated the expression of CYP2B (band b) in wild-type males; however, there was continued expression of this CYP following GH pulse replacement in STAT5b-deficient males (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7–9 versus lanes 13–15). Our previous studies with STAT5b-deficient mice indicated that STAT5b is required for multiple biological processes, and that several of the phenotypic defects characteristic of STAT5b-deficient mice are associated with the loss of male-specific, sexually dimorphic liver gene expression (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). However, it could not be determined from these studies whether the observed liver phenotype reflects a direct requirement for STAT5b for maintenance of the male liver expression profile, or alternatively, whether the pattern of pituitary GH secretion in STAT5b-deficient mice is altered to a more frequent secretory pattern, such as is present in females; such a change in pituitary GH secretion would alone be sufficient to induce the feminization of liver gene expression profiles and body growth rates that characterizes STAT5b-deficient mice. Direct analysis of mouse plasma GH profiles has been reported by one group (5MacLeod J.N. Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); however, this type of analysis presents serious technical difficulties owing to the small blood vessels, low blood volume, difficulty in maintaining an open catheter for blood sampling in mice, and the requirement that the mice not be stressed during the sampling process. Moreover, in view of the potential role of STAT5b in the established feedback effects of GH on the hypothalamic regulation of pituitary GH secretion (34Minami S. Kamegai J. Sugihara H. Suzuki N. Wakabayashi I. Endocr. J. 1998; 45 suppl.: S19-S26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), direct measurements of plasma GH profiles in STAT5b-deficient mice would not provide an unambiguous answer to the question of whether the loss of liver STAT5b per se is responsible for the observed feminization of liver P450 profiles and body weight gain in STAT5b-deficient mice. We therefore undertook in the present study an alternative approach, in which the pituitary was surgically removed to eliminate the major source of endogenous plasma GH, enabling us to evaluate the intrinsic responsiveness of the liver to plasma GH pulses applied exogenously. The effects of hypophysectomy and GH pulse replacement on body growth and liver gene expression obtained in wild-type mice were in full agreement with earlier reports (1Isaksson O.G.P. Eden S. Jansson J.-O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Knopf J.L. Gallagher J.F. Held W.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). First, there was no increase in the body weights of any of the mice following hypophysectomy. Second, GH pulse replacement, with or without T4, stimulated a dramatic and immediate resumption of body weight gain in wild-type mice. In contrast, hormone replacement did not stimulate an increase in body weight in STAT5b-deficient mice. This finding provides strong support for our proposal that there is impaired GH signaling in STAT5b-deficient mice and that STAT5b mediates body growth stimulated by the male pattern of pulsatile plasma GH. Further study is required to determine the extent to which this STAT5b dependence of body growth involves the liver acting in concert with other tissues that mediate the whole body growth response. Studies on the excretion of MUPs in urine provide support for the critical importance of STAT5b in intracellular hepatocyte signaling. MUPs are a family proteins of ∼20 kDa that are expressed in and secreted by the liver. There are 35–40 MUP genes and pseudogenes in mice (38Bishop J.O. Clarke A.J. Clissold P.M. Hainey S. Francke U. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Bennett K.L. Lalley P.A. Barth R.K. Hastia N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the encoded MUP proteins are thought to contribute to scent marking of territories (40Hurst J.L. Robertson D.H.L. Tolladay U. Beynon R.J. Anim. Behav. 1998; 55: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). About 3-fold higher levels of MUPs are excreted in male compared with female mouse urine, and the high level expression of some of these genes is induced by pulsatile GH and suppressed by GH administered continuously. The expression of other MUP genes is induced to a smaller degree by pulsatile GH (30Norstedt G. Palmiter R. Cell. 1984; 36: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Johnson D. al-Shawi R. Bishop J.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 21-34Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Johnson D. Harrison S. Pineda N. Heinlein C. al-Shawi R. Bishop J.O. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We previously reported that STAT5b-deficient male mice have MUP levels that are lower than wild-type male mice and are similar to those in wild-type female mice (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). However, the MUP levels in urine of female STAT5b-deficient mice were lower than in the corresponding female wild-type control mice in that study, suggesting that STAT5b might also be generally involved in intracellular GH signaling, and not solely in signaling in response to GH pulses. Because T4 is also required for the expression of MUP proteins (25Knopf J.L. Gallagher J.F. Held W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2234-2240Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), T4 was added to the drinking water when we evaluated the responsiveness of urinary MUP levels to GH pulse replacement. Pulsatile GH in combination with T4 replacement stimulated restoration of urinary MUP levels in wild-type but not in STAT5b-deficient mice (Fig. 2), in support of a role for STAT5b in mediating hepatic responses to pulsatile GH at the level of MUP gene expression. The third observation implicating STAT5b in pulsatile GH signaling pathways comes from cytochrome P450 gene expression studies. We showed previously that the selective loss of male-specific liver cytochrome P450 gene expression in STAT5b-deficient males is coupled with expression of cytochrome P450 genes that are normally expressed only in females (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J.

Removal of the pituitary gland followed by pulsatile GH stimulation of the liver was presently shown to restore expression of the male-specific liver enzyme CYP2D9 while suppressing the expression of a female-specific CYP2B enzyme in wild-type, but not STAT5b-deficient hypophysectomized male mice (Figs. 4 and 5). Presumably, STAT5b acts in a positive manner to stimulate expression of CYP2D9 and other male-expressed liver CYPs bytrans-activating STAT5 response elements found in the 5′-flanking DNA of this group of genes (21Subramanian A. Wang J.M. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 2S.-H. Park and D. J. Waxman, unpublished results. The mechanism responsible for the apparent negative regulation by STAT5b of certain female-expressed liver CYPs (e.g. CYP2B, band b; Fig. 5 and Ref. 20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) is uncertain, but could involve “negative STAT5 response elements” or perhaps other, more complex mechanisms. Further studies will be required to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms through which STAT5b mediates the sexually dimorphic regulation of liver CYP expression. Although GH pulse treatment did not restore the normal male pattern of body weight gain and MUP and CYP gene expression in STAT5b-deficient mice, it did activate STAT5a in livers of these animals, as demonstrated by EMSA analysis (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, GH receptor, JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and other cellular factors required for GH pulsed-induced liver STAT activation are present and functional in the livers of STAT5b-deficient mice. This finding provides further support for our proposal that it is the deficiency in STAT5b per se that gives rise to the observed GH pulse-resistance phenotype of these animals. STAT5a, when activated by GH pulses in livers of these mice, may either be intrinsically ineffective with respect to stimulating and maintaining a male pattern of liver gene expression, or perhaps may be present at a level that is too low (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to effectively carry out these STAT5b-stimulated responses. STAT5a does, however, contribute to the expression of certain female-expressed CYPs, perhaps via a mechanism that involves heterodimerization with STAT5b (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The present study establishes that STAT5b-deficient mice exhibit a GH pulse resistance phenotype that leads to the observed major alterations in sex-dependent liver CYP gene expression and pubertal body growth rates. However, this finding does not rule out the possibility that STAT5b may additionally help regulate the hypothalamic control of pituitary GH secretion (42Bluet-Pajot M.T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and that the pattern of pituitary GH secretion may consequently be altered in STAT5b-deficient mice. Indeed, we have reported increases in plasma GH levels in STAT5b-deficient mice at sacrifice (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Moreover, decreased somatostatin mRNA in hypothalamic periventricular nuclei has been observed in STAT5b-deficient mice, providing indirect evidence that pituitary GH secretion may be increased in these animals (43Luckman S.M. McGuiness L. Thomas G.B. Robinson I.C.A.F. Udy G.B. Davey H.W. Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, November 7–12. Los Angeles, CA, 1998Google Scholar).

After aldosterone treatment, 75% of K-Ras was localized to the plasma membrane compared with 25% in the absence of steroid.

Thus, this steroid hormone is critical to proper maintenance of blood volume and pressure. Whereas the systemic and tissue actions of aldosterone are clear, namely volume expansion by induction of Na+ reabsorption across renal principal cells, the cellular signal transduction mechanism initiated by this steroid remains unclear and controversial. Similar to the actions of other steroids on diverse target tissues, the natriferic actions of aldosterone on Na+ reabsorbing epithelia are mediated by steroid-induced transcription and subsequent translation of new proteins (1Verrey F.

The final step in this aldosterone-mediated process is an increase in activity of luminal Na+ channels (4Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J.

Several different methods have been used to identify a few putative aldosterone-induced proteins; however, it is unclear whether these proteins are actually relevant to the regulation of NaCl and water homeostasis. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption at the distal tubule of the nephron through the actions of aldosterone-induced proteins first by increasing the activity of existing luminal Na+channels (≤4 h) and then by promoting synthesis of new luminal Na+ channel and serosal Na+/K+ATPase proteins (>6 h; (1Verrey F.

Spindler et. al. (7Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that the mRNA of the small, monomeric GTP-binding (smG)1 protein, K-Ras2A, increased within 60 min. in response to aldosterone. Transcript levels increased to a maximum of about 5-fold 3–4 h after treatment and then decreased toward pretreatment levels. However, it remains to be determined whether K-Ras2A protein levels, like that of its mRNA, increase in response to aldosterone. In addition, it is unclear whether K-Ras2A protein is relevant to Na+transport in epithelia. Several laboratories have reported that the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is regulated by GTP (8Cantiello H.F. Patenaude C.R. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol.

In addition, factors that regulate localization of smG proteins to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, such as methyl esterification, also modulate Na+ reabsorption and epithelial Na+ channel activity (2Eaton D.C.

These observations suggest that K-Ras2A levels, localization, and activity may be relevant to aldosterone-stimulated Na+ reabsorption. Further supporting this notion are the recent observations of Mastroberardino and colleagues (16Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showing that co-expression of constitutive-active K-Ras2A with ENaC in the heterologous X. laevis oocyte expression system appeared to increase Na+ channel activity. Nonetheless, it remains to be determined whether K-Ras2A can alter Na+ transport and ENaC activity in epithelial tissue capable of vectorial transport. The current study tested the hypothesis that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein critical to steroid-sensitive Na+ reabsorption in renal epithelia. Aldosterone increases K-Ras2A expression. K-Ras2A is necessary for aldosterone-stimulation of Na+ transport and ENaC activity. Aldosterone also causes translocation of K-Ras to the plasma membrane. Subsequent to the translocation, K-Ras2A signal transduction leads to activation of the downstream, effector kinase MEK. It is unclear whether MEK activation is associated with Na+ transport. However, overexpression of wild-type K-Ras2A was sufficient to mimic some of the natriferic actions of aldosterone suggesting that this protein may be limiting for some portion of the aldosterone-sensitive Na+ transport. Our results support the notions that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein necessary for steroid-regulated Na+ transport and that K-Ras2A ultimately regulates Na+ channel activity. The amphibian A6 cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was used as model epithelia in all experiments. A6 cells were maintained in tissue culture using standard methods (2Eaton D.C.

In brief, A6 cells were cultured in a mixture of Coon's F-12 (3 parts) and Leibovitz's L-15 (7 parts) media (Irving Scientific) supplemented with 104 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.6% penicillin, 1.0% streptomycin, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1.5 μm aldosterone (complete medium) at 4% CO2 and 26 °C. Basic medium was devoid of fetal bovine serum and steroid. Whole cell lysate was extracted from A6 cells using the following lysis buffer: 50 mm HCl-Tris, 76 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, plus 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; see Ref. 18Stockand J.D.

Total Ras protein and K-Ras protein were immunoprecipitated using standard protocols with the commercially available monoclonal antibodies, Ha-Ras (sc-35, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or v-Ha-ras(OP01, Oncogene Research Products), and c-K-ras(OP24), respectively. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysate and immunoprecipitants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of reducing reagent (20 mmdithiothreitol) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots then were probed with either anti-c-K-ras (OP24) or anti-K-Ras2A (sc-522) and appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. All immunoblotting was performed in Tris-buffered saline with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Band density was determined using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific). The polyclonal anti-K-Ras2A antibody (from Santa Cruz) was created against an epitope found only in the A splice variant of K-Ras: the A and B variants diverge at the C terminus between amino acids 165–184. The epitope for anti-K-Ras2A antibody are residues 163–179 of the A variant. This antibody has been shown to be specific for K-Ras2A (19Pells S. Divjak M. Romanowski P. Impey H. Hawkins N.J. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Williamson D.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both rat monoclonal Ha-Ras (Santa Cruz) and v-Ha-Ras (Oncogene) antibodies recognize all forms of Ras (H, K, and N), and are widely used to concentrate Ras protein prior to Western blot analysis. The mouse monoclonal c-K-ras antibody (Oncogene) was developed by immunizing with K-Ras and selecting hypridomas for reactivity with K-Ras (epitope localized between residues 54–189) and the inability to react with Ha-Ras and N-Ras. This antibody binds both A and B K-Ras splice variants. Crude membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. A6 cells were harvested by sonication in 0.25m sucrose (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Subsequent to removal of cellular debris, nuclei and mitochondria, the microsomal fraction (P100) was separated from cytosol (S100) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, p21 ras in the P100 and S100 fractions was concentrated (withv-Ha-ras antibody). Immunoreactivity was determined as above. Anti-MEK 1/2 and anti-phospho-MEK 1/2 antibodies are commercially available (PhosphoPlus MEK 1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221) Antibody Kit, New England BioLabs, Inc.). Both antibodies were used for Western blot analysis per the manufacturer's instructions. For these experiments, A6 cell lysate was prepared with lysis buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1 mm okadaic acid to decrease protein phosphatase activity. Full-lengthX. laevis K-ras2A cDNA was amplified using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) on single-stranded cDNA prepared from A6 cell mRNA using the FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen) in conjunction with specific primers (forward primer, 5′CCGTGAGCCCGAGACAGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AATAGAAGGAGCGGCCGTAGAATC-3′) developed using the published X. laevis K-ras2A sequence (GenBankTMaccession number Y12715; Ref. 7Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The 900-base pair product of this reaction was ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(−) (Invitrogen) with NotI. Sequence data from this eukaryotic expression construct, pKras2A, was homologous to the published sequence (7Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and consistent with the construct containing the full K-ras2A open reading frame. Moreover, in vitro translation of the pKras2A construct as shown in Fig. 1 produced a protein of appropriate size for full-length K-Ras2A. Expression of K-Ras2A from pKras2A is controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. A6 cells were transfected with pKras2A or control plasmid using the LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) system as described previously (17Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K.

Subsequent to transfection, A6 cells were selected with zeocin (800 μg/ml) to enrich the cultures in transfected cells. Zeocin-resistant A6 cells were used for experimentation up to two subpassages after transfection. Zeocin-selected cells cultured in complete medium were allowed to reach confluence prior to experimentation. To facilitate quantification of induction of Na+ transport by aldosterone, cells were treated with basic medium (serum and steroid free) for 2 days prior to the readdition of steroid. This set transport to a basal level and allowed for the investigation of the aldosterone-sensitive signaling pathway that results in increased Na+ reabsorption. Phosphorothioate sense (5′-GGAAGATGACGGAGTACAAGCTGG-3′) and antisense K-ras2A (5′-CCAGCTTGTACTCCGTCATCTTCC-3′) oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility. The K-ras2A antisense oligonucleotide complemented the translation start site of K-ras2A mRNA (base pairs −5 to 19). In addition, the more general ras antisense (5′-CTCCGTCATTTCACCAGCAC-3′) and nonsense (5′-GAGGCAGTAAAGTGGTCGTG) oligonucleotides were created. These oligonucleotides complemented K-ras2A, as well as other forms of X. laevis ras, such as Ha-ras. Confluent A6 cells were cultured for 24 h in basic medium and then treated with (5–10 μm) oligonucleotide in basic medium for an additional 24 h. Currents across treated A6 cell monolayers and the activity of ENaC in cell attached patches (see below) were subsequently made before and after addition of aldosterone (1.5 μm, 4 h). Cells then were harvested for protein chemistry analysis (described above). A6 cells were prepared for single-channel analysis using standard patch-clamp techniques, described previously (4Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typical pipette and bath solutions contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.4). Current recordings of ENaC were made after obtaining gigaohm seals with the patch electrode on the surface of the A6 cell. Unitary current (i) (zero for the closed state (S0)) was determined from the best-fit Gaussian distribution of the amplitude histograms. Channels were considered in an open state (S n ) when the current was greater than (n − ½)i and less than (n + ½)i, where n is the number of open channel current levels. The probability of a channel being in the open state (Po) is defined as the time spent in S divided by the total time of the recording. Because the number of channels in a patch is not known with certainty, the activity of all ENaC in a given patch is reported as NPo, defined as the sum of the Po times the respective current level. For all experiments, data was filtered at 100 Hz and collected at 500 Hz. Trans-epithelia voltages and resistances were collected using the Millicel Eletrical Resistance System (Millipore Corp.) as described previously (17Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K.

Both voltages and resistances were measured in open circuit conditions to better mimic a real physiological environment. Ohm's law was used to calculate equivalent short-circuit current (eqIsc). All current with our conditions is amiloride-sensitive, with the majority being carried by Na+. Thus, in this instance, eqIscis a good measurement of trans-epithelial Na+transport. A6 cells cultured in complete medium were grown to confluence on permeable supports (0.02 μm Anopore membrane; Nalge NUNC International) for these experiments. Forty-eight hours prior to experimentation, cells were treated with basic medium to set transport to a basal level. Currents then were assessed before and after application of aldosterone (1.5 μm) or vehicle for 4 h, and cells were subsequently extracted for biochemical analysis as described above. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem unless otherwise indicated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction primers and phosphorothiate oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility. For each lysate, protein concentration was determined using the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). All values are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) was determined using thet test for differences in mean values or a z test (with the Yates correction for small samples) for differences in proportions. For multiple comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used. Fig. 2 shows that aldosterone application (1.5 μm, 4 h) to A6 cell monolayers increases expression of K-Ras2A protein. For all Western blots, K-Ras was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysate containing equal amounts of total protein (a typical Western blot is shown in Fig. 2 A). The rationale for immunoprecipitating K-Ras prior to Western blot analysis is that Ras is in such low abundance in confluent, terminally differentiated, nondividing A6 cells that direct immunodetection is not feasible without first enhancing the amount of the protein of interest. Subsequent to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferring, blots containing anti-K-Ras-immunoprecipitated protein from untreated (Fig. 2, CON) and steroid-treated (ALDO) cells were probed with anti-K-Ras2A antibody. In Fig. 2, K-Ras2A is indicated by the arrow, and the two heavier proteins are the IgG bands of the immunoprecipitating antibody. Fig. 2 B (and Table I) summarizes the densities of K-Ras2A in untreated and treated cells for six such experiments. Aldosterone treatment for 4 h significantly increased K-Ras2A protein levels 2.8-fold from 1.2 ± 0.1 to 3.4 ± 0.4 arbitrary density units, demonstrating that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein.Table IRegulation of aldosterone-sensitive Na + transport by K-Ras2AeqIsc before aldosteroneeqIsc after 4 h of aldosteronea1.5 μm aldosterone.ΔeqIscbΔeqIsc = (eqIsc after 4 h aldosterone) − (eqIsc before aldosterone).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 demonstrates that steroid-induction of K-Ras2A protein expression is necessary for aldosterone-stimulated Na+ reabsorption. Fig. 3 Ais a typical Western blot probed with anti-K-Ras2A antibody. Both lanes contain protein harvested from confluent A6 cell monolayers that was immunoprecipitated with anti-K-Ras antibody (starting concentration of total protein was identical). The left lane is the precipitant from cells treated with sense K-ras2Aoligonucleotide (5–10 μm) for 24 h and then treated with aldosterone (1.5 μm) plus sense oligo for an additional 4 h. The right lane is the precipitant from cells treated in the same fashion with antisense oligonucleotide. Thearrow indicates K-Ras2A. Antisense K-ras2Aoligonucleotide attenuated the aldosterone-induced expression of K-Ras2A protein. Four such experiments are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Compared with sense-treated cells, antisense treatment significantly reduced aldosterone-induced K-Ras2A proteins levels 3.1 ± 0.23-fold from 3.7 ± 0.7 to 1.2 ± 0.2 arbitrary density units. This same maneuver as shown in Fig. 3 C (see also Table I) reduced aldosterone-induced Na+ transport across A6 cell monolayers. Aldosterone increased current by 1.8 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 in control cells (untreated) (n = 88) and by the same amount in sense-treated cells (n = 83). This increase was significantly greater than the aldosterone-induced increase of 1.3 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 in antisense-treated cells (n = 101). Although the 1.4 ± 0.05-fold reduction in current upon exposure to antisense oligonucleotides is smaller than the reduction in apparent protein density (3.1-fold), there is no significant difference in fractional reduction of protein and current (z test, p = 0.322). In addition, if a small fraction of the current was not due to Na+ transport (even as little as 0.1 μA/cm2), then our measurement of the fractional reduction in current would be significantly underestimated. The single channel current traces (Fig. 4 A) and summary graph (Fig. 4 B) demonstrate that ras antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotide decreases aldosterone-stimulated Na+ channel activity. These current traces are typical of ENaC from A6 cells treated with aldosterone in addition to nonsense (top trace) or antisense (bottom trace)ras oligonucleotide. Summarized in Fig. 4 B are five such experiments. The aldosterone-induced Na+ channel activity of 0.40 ± 0.03 in nonsense-treated cells is significantly greater than the NPo of 0.09 ± 0.01 in antisense-treated cells. Although the 4.3 ± 0.19-fold reduction in NPo upon exposure to antisense oligonucleotides is larger than the reduction in apparent protein density (3.1-fold) and current (1.4-fold), there is no statistically significant difference in fractional reduction of protein and NPo (z test,p = 0.758) or of current and NPo(z test, p = 0.072). Note oligonucleotide treatment did not affect single channel amplitude. Fig. 5 (and Table I) shows that cells transiently transfected with pKras2A have more K-Ras2A protein and Na+ transport compared with control transfectants. Fig. 5 A, top panel, is a typical Western blot probed with anti-K-Ras antibody of the Ras-immunoprecipitant from A6 cells transfected with control plasmid (left lane) or the pKras2A construct (right three lanes). For these experiments, all immunoprecipitations were performed on equal amounts of total protein. K-Ras is indicated by the arrow. The summary graph (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel) shows that cells transfected with the pKras2A construct (n = 6) had 3.1-fold more K-Ras2A protein levels compared with control transfectants. The aldosterone-induced Na+ current of 2.7 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 (n = 36) across K-Ras2A-overexpressing A6 cell monolayers was significantly greater than the 1.5 ± 0.2 μA/cm2 (n = 19) of control transfectants, and the 1.8 ± 0.1 μA/cm2across cells that were not transfected. Moreover, as shown in Table I, the Na+ currents across K-Ras2A-overexpressing A6 cell monolayers in the absence of steroid were 2.2-fold greater than those in control transfectant monolayers, suggesting that overexpression of K-Ras2A is sufficient to mimic some of the natriferic actions of aldosterone. All current across transfected cells was sensitive to 5 μm amiloride. Figs. 6 and 7show that aldosterone-induced K-Ras2A activates MEK, a well established, downstream effector of the Ras signal transduction pathway. Activation of MEK was, in part, dependent on K-Ras2A protein levels and associated with translocation of K-Ras to the plasma membrane, the cellular locale where this smG protein interacts with its effectors. The typical Western blots of Fig. 6 A show that K-Ras protein in A6 cells not treated with steroid is localized to both the cytosol (CON, S100) and particulate fractions (CON, P100). In contrast, K-Ras protein in A6 cells treated with aldosterone for 4 h is localized primarily to the particulate (ALDO, P100) and not the cytosol (ALDO, S100). The summary graph shown in Fig. 6 B (n = 3) shows that approximately 75% of the A6 cell K-Ras is localized to the particulate fraction after treatment with aldosterone; in contrast, 25% is localized to the particulate in the absence of steroid. Movement of Ras to the particulate is consistent with activation of this smG protein. Also consistent with activation of Ras are the results shown in Fig. 7, showing that aldosterone addition to A6 cell monolayers induces MEK phosphorylation. The typical Western blot (Fig. 7 A) of whole cell lysate prepared from cells treated with vehicle (CON) and steroid (1.5 μm) (ALDO) was probed with anti-phospho-MEK 1/2 antibody. Aldosterone activated (phosphorylated) MEK within 15 min. At 4 h, phospho-MEK levels were 3.4 ± 1.6-fold (n = 3) higher in aldosterone-treated A6 cells compared with cells treated with vehicle. As shown in Fig. 7 B, inhibition of K-Ras2A protein synthesis with antisense Kras2A oligonucleotide attenuated MEK activation in response to aldosterone treatment for 4 h. This typical Western blot shows the levels of phospho-MEK (Fig. 7 B, top) and total MEK (bottom) in lysate prepared from aldosterone and Kras2A sense-treated cells (left) and steroid and antisense-treated cells (right).FIG. 7Aldosterone activates (phosphorylates) MEK 1/2 via K-Ras2A signaling. A these typical Western blots show that cells treated with aldosterone have more protein immunoreactive with anti-phospho-MEK 1/2 antibody compared with cells treated with vehicle (control (CON)). Each lane contains similar amounts of total protein. The time of aldosterone or vehicle treatment is indicated. Note, merely washing cells with vehicle sometimes (as in this figure) appeared to slightly increase phospho-MEK levels; however, this observation was not consistent (observed ∼50% of the time). This inconsistent and slight increase in phospho-MEK upon washing results in only a little underestimation of MEK activation by aldosterone. B, this typical Western blot shows that aldosterone activates MEK in sense (SENSE) but not antisense (ANTI) K-ras2A-treated cells. The top blots were probed with anti-phospho-MEK, and the bottom blots were probed with anti-MEK antibody. All lanes contained similar amounts of total protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The summary data in Table I show 1) that aldosterone increases K-Ras2A protein levels and Na+ transport within 4 h; 2) that inhibition of aldosterone-induced K-Ras2A protein synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides leads to an associated decrease in induced Na+ transport; and 3) that transient transfection with pKras2A increases K-Ras2A protein levels and Na+ transport in the absence and presence of aldosterone. The experiments described tested the hypothesis that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein required for steroid-regulated Na+ transport. Aldosterone was shown to increase K-Ras2A protein levels within 4 h, suggesting that this Ras is an aldosterone-induced protein. Moreover, K-Ras2A was shown to be critical to aldosterone regulation of ENaC activity and Na+reabsorption. Overexpression of K-Ras2A increased Na+transport; however, K-Ras2A overexpression alone was not as strong an activator of Na+ transport as aldosterone, suggesting that aldosterone signals to ENaC through pathways independent or complementary to the Ras pathway. Electrophysiological data suggests that K-Ras2A supports the activity of luminal Na+ channels; however, the mechanism of this action remains to be determined. Aldosterone-activated K-Ras2A localized to the plasma membrane, where it subsequently activated MEK. However, it is unclear whether MEK activation is associated with vectorial Na+ transport or ENaC activity. We believe these results show that induction of K-Ras2A by aldosterone is necessary for steroid-sensitive Na+reabsorption and propose that aldosterone activates the luminal Na+ channel, in part, via K-Ras2A signaling as shown in Fig. 8. It is well established that aldosterone regulates Na+ transport by first inducing gene expression and subsequent protein synthesis (1Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N.

However, these aldosterone-induced proteins remain controversial and not well characterized. In a recent publication, Spindler et al. (7Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that in A6 cells, aldosterone increased K-ras2A mRNA levels, supporting the possibility that this transcript codes an aldosterone-induced protein. Transcription of K-ras2A mRNA was a primary effect of aldosterone. The current results of Fig. 2 (see also Table I) showing that K-Ras2A protein levels are 2.8-fold higher in aldosterone-treated A6 cells compared with untreated controls show directly for the first time that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein. This observation and that of Spindler et al. (7Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggest that one primary action of aldosterone on epithelia is to increase K-Ras2A protein levels via transcriptional control of K-ras2A mRNA expression. The time course of increased Kras2A mRNA transcription and synthesis of K-Ras2A protein are consistent with the early actions of aldosterone. This mechanism also is supported by the results of Figs. 3and 4 (see below). K-Ras2A similar to other smG proteins is a component of cell proliferative/differentiation transduction pathways. K-Ras2A-initiated proliferative/differentiation pathways may contribute to the later trophic actions of aldosterone through activation of the MAP Kinase cascade, which then would regulate secondary gene expression. The results of Figs. 6 and 7 are consistent with this notion. The results from antisense experiments (Figs. 3 and 4, Table I) and those localizing K-Ras (Fig. 6) support the idea that K-Ras2A protein is critical for aldosterone-stimulated Na+ transport and ENaC activity. These findings are also consistent with those of Eaton et al. (2Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N.

Physiol. 1985; 248: F43-F47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that aldosterone, in addition to increasing K-Ras2A protein levels, also increases the activity of isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase, the enzyme that uses S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor to modify Ras protein. Thus, it is likely that aldosterone induces expression of K-Ras2A protein simultaneous with activation of the smG protein methylating enzyme, isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase. This would lead to an increase in the cellular pool of methylated-Ras. Because methylated-Ras is active and localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (20Volker C. Stock J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), regulation of the levels of this protein may be one regulatory site for control of Na+ transport (see Figs. 2, 6, and 8). The single Na+ channel current recordings in Fig. 4 support the hypothesis that K-Ras2A regulates aldosterone-signaling to the luminal Na+ channel in epithelia. These show directly that inhibition of Ras protein expression with antisense causes a concomitant decrease in aldosterone-stimulation of apical Na+ channel activity. The specific mechanism whereby K-Ras2A effects the epithelial Na+ channel to regulate vectorial Na+ transport remains to be determined. The observation that overexpression of wild-type K-Ras2A increases Na+ transport across A6 cell monolayers in the absence of steroid is consistent with the results of Mastroberardino et al. (16Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showing that simultaneous expression of constitutive-active K-Ras2A with ENaC in oocytes likely increases ENaC ativity. Although these authors demonstrated that a constitutive-active mutant of K-Ras2A likely increased Na+ channel activity in a heterologous system, it was unclear whether wild-type K-Ras2A was a physiological regulator of Na+ transport in renal epithelia. The main concern with the results of Mastroberardinoet al. (16Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is that, because overexpression of constitutive-active K-Ras2A mutants cause oocyte maturation, the observed increase in Na+ channel activity may have been related to the K-Ras2A-induced oocyte maturation and not a physiological regulation of the Na+ channel (although another agent, progesterone, which also promotes maturation, did not seem to produce an increase in ENaC activity). Nonetheless, the results of the current study demonstrating that overexpression of K-Ras2A is sufficient to cause some Na+ transport support these earlier findings in the oocyte. Moreover, the current results also demonstrate directly that K-Ras2A regulates Na+ transport, likely through modulation of Na+ channel activity in epithelial cells capable of physiological, vectorial transport. Overexpression of K-Ras2A increased Na+ transport in the absence of steroid by 2.2-fold. This result and those obtained with the antisense oligonucleotides suggest that aldosterone signals to the luminal Na+ channel via multiple pathways and that K-Ras2A levels are limiting for one of the aldosterone-stimulated pathways. Aldosterone-induced Na+ transport was 1.8-fold greater in K-Ras2A-overexpressing cells compared with controls. We believe this suggests that in K-Ras2A-overexpressing cells after addition of aldosterone, Ras protein is no longer limiting or that it is saturated. It is possible that K-Ras2A protein is not limiting but that the processing of this protein (e.g. methylation) or the binding of K-Ras2A with GTP becomes limiting after addition of aldosterone (see Fig. 8). This thought is consistent with our recent findings that methylation mediated by isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase regulates Na+ transport and is limiting after but not before the addition of aldosterone (18Stockand J.D. Edinger R.S. Al-Baldawi N. Sariban-Sohraby S. Al-Khalili O.K. Eaton D.C. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26912-26917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether Ras has a role in maintaining the basal activity of the Na+ channel in the absence of steroid. The observation that K-ras2A antisense oligonucleotide does not greatly affect basal Na+ transport is consistent with three possibilities: 1) basal transport is independent of the Ras signaling pathway, 2) experimental limitations do not allow for the discrimination of the effects of Ras on basal Na+transport, and 3) that other ions besides Na+ contribute substantially to basal currents. In summary, the results reported in the current paper support the hypothesis that K-Ras2A is an aldosterone-induced protein necessary for steroid-induced Na+ transport. One final effector of activated K-Ras2A is the epithelial Na+ channel. We thank Otor Al-Khalili, B. J. Duke, and Juan Li for excellent technical support."

Two distinct thiolases have been implicated to function in peroxisomal β-oxidation: the long known 41-kDa β-ketothiolase identified by Hashimoto and co-workers (Hijikata, M., Ishii, N., Kagamiyama, H., Osumi, T., and Hashimoto, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem.262, 8151–8158) and the recently discovered 60-kDa SCPx thiolase, that consists of an N-terminal domain with β-ketothiolase activity and a C-terminal moiety of sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2, a lipid carrier or transfer protein). Recently, gene targeting of the SCP2/SCPx gene has shown in mice that the SCPx β-ketothiolase is involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation of 2-methyl-branched chain fatty acids like pristanic acid. In our present work we have investigated bile acid synthesis in the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. Specific inhibition of β-oxidation at the thiolytic cleavage step in bile acid synthesis is supported by our finding of pronounced accumulation in bile and serum from the knockout mice of 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-27-nor-5β-cholestane-24-one (which is a known bile alcohol derivative of the cholic acid synthetic intermediate 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-24-keto-cholestanoyl-coenzyme A). Moreover, these mice have elevated concentrations of bile acids with shortened side chains (i.e. 23-norcholic acid and 23-norchenodeoxycholic acid), which may be produced via α- rather than β-oxidation. Our results demonstrate that the SCPx thiolase is critical for β-oxidation of the steroid side chain in conversion of cholesterol into bile acids.

Their importance is emphasized by the existence of a group of disorders called peroxisomal diseases, caused by an impairment of one or more peroxisomal functions. The cerebro-hepato-renal (Zellweger) syndrome is generally considered to be the prototype of this group of diseases. Zellweger patients show a large range of severe clinical anomalies, often leading to early death (1Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2287-2324Google Scholar). The catabolic pathways in which peroxisomes are involved include the β-oxidation of fatty acids, the α-oxidation of phytanic acid, the degradation of glyoxylate and various xenobiotics. In addition, anabolic functions contribute to the synthesis of ether phospholipids, docosahexaenoic acid, bile acids, cholesterol, and other isoprenoids (2van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 3Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2)1 contains a PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signal at its C terminus and the protein is one of the most abundant proteins that is present in peroxisomes (4Seedorf U. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; (VOL): 158-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this fact, no human inherited disease is known at present that is caused by SCP2 mutations. The SCP2 gene (Scp2) codes not only for SCP2, but also for a fused protein of 60 kDa called sterol carrier protein-x (SCPx) (5Ohba T. Rennert H. Pfeifer S.M. He Z.G. Yamamoto R. Holt J.A.

Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of SCPx is identical with SCP2 whereas its N-terminal part consists of an active β-ketothiolase (7Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 630-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two proteins are expressed from a common gene via alternative transcription initiation at two separated promoters (9Ohba T. Holt J.A. Billheimer J.T. Strauss J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10660-10668Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that SCPx is localized in peroxisomes and that its β-ketothiolase functions in a newly identified peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway that is involved in the oxidation of 2-methyl-branched chain fatty acids like pristanic acid (10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Conversely, the long known 41-kDa peroxisomal β-ketothiolase identified by Hashimoto and co-workers (11Hijikata M. Ishii N. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8151-8158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) acts preferentially on straight very long chain substrates. In contrast, relatively little is known about the precise roles of SCP2. It has been shown that the protein binds acyl-CoAs (12Wirtz K.W.A. Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.H. Wanders R.J.A. Seedorf U. Jovin T.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Stolowich N.J. Frolov A. Atshaves B. Murphy E.J. Jolly C.A. Billheimer J.T. Scott A.I. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and forms specific complexes in peroxisomes with acyl-CoA oxidase and other β-oxidation enzymes (14Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W.A. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous data indicated that peroxisomal α-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA is diminished in the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice (10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These results imply that the protein may play a role as substrate carrier or regulatory factor in peroxisomal acyl-CoA metabolism. It was recently shown that the SCP2/SCPx gene disruption is associated with activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, PPARα (15Ellinghaus P. Wolfrum C. Assmann G. Spener F. Seedorf U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2766-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which suggests that SCP2 represents a potentially important peroxisomal regulator of PPARα signal transduction. It has once been proposed that SCP2 functions in cytosolic cholesterol transport in liver and adrenals by virtue of its ability to act as a cholesterol carrier (16Pfeifer S.M. Furth E.E. Ohba T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6490-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Bile acid synthesis starts from cholesterol and proceeds via a complex sequence of enzymatic steps that are compartmentalized in cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (19Bjorkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2073-2102Google Scholar). Therefore, this pathway represents the prototype that would depend on target-specific cholesterol trafficking and thus on SCP2. In the present work, we therefore investigated whether the Scp2 gene disruption affects bile acid synthesis in vivo in order to elaborate more precise information about the roles of SCP2 and SCPx in metabolism. Most bile acid standards were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) except for the muricholic acids and oxo-bile acids, which were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). All nor-bile acids that were used in this study were synthesized by side chain degradation of the corresponding bile acids (20Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1387-1395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-27-nor-5β-cholestane-24-one was synthesized essentially as described in references (21Noma Y. Kihira K. Kuramoto T. Hoshita T. Steroids. 1988; 51: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Yuri M. Tokumoto M. Hara N. Fujimoto Y. Kobayashi N. Morisaki M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1993; 41: 1327-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All solvents and high performance liquid chromatography-grade water were obtained from Baker (Griesheim, Germany). Organic solvents were dried over molecular sieves (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, 0.4 nm). Choloylglycine hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.24) from Clostridium perfringens, β-glucoronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), and sulfatase (EC3.1.6.1) from Helix pomatia and all other chemicals were of analytical grade and supplied by Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Reverse-phase octadecylsilane bonded silica cartridges were purchased from Baker (Baker-bond RP-18, 3 ml, 500-mg beds). The cartridges were washed with 5 ml of methanol and primed with 5 ml of water (pH = 3, equilibrated with hydrochloric acid) before use. Glassware was silanized with 1% (v/v) dimethyldichlorosilane in toluene to prevent adsorption of the bile acids (23Street J.M. Trafford D.J. Makin H.L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Internal standard (nordeoxycholic acid, 250 ng) was added to 100 μl of serum followed by simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis and solvolysis at 45 °C for 3 h as described previously (24Suzuki M. Murai T. Yoshimura T. Kimura A. Kurosawa T. Tohma M. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 693: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bile compounds were extracted from the suspension using a Baker-bond RP-18 cartridge, which was washed with 5 ml of water (pH = 3, equilibrated with hydrochloric acid), cholesteryl esters were removed with 10 ml of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60 °C), and free cholesterol was removed with 8 ml of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 9:1 (v/v). The bound fraction was eluted with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of diethyl ether. The solvents were evaporated, and the residue containing the bile acids was derivatized into the methyl esters with 1 m trimethylchlorosilane in methanol (400 μl) at 60 °C for 30 min. After removal of excess reagents, derivatization of the bile compounds into the trimethylsilyl ethers was carried out using a solution of pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/trimethylchlorosilane (3:2:1, v/v/v; 200 μl) at 60 °C for 30 min. Excess reagents were evaporated and the derivatives of the bile compounds were dissolved in 100 μln-hexane/pyridine (99:1, v/v). The mixture was sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min. 20 μl of the supernatant were subjected to further analyses by GC-MS. GC-MS was performed on a Finnigan GCQ (Thermoquest, Egelsbach, Germany) equipped with an ion trap mass analyzer and a HT-5 fused silica capillary column (25 m, inner diameter 0.22 mm, film thickness 0.1 μm; SGE, Weiterstadt, Germany). The sample was injected by the large volume injection technique: after removal of the solvent at 50 °C followed by ballistic temperature increase of the injection port to 280 °C. The temperature of the column oven was maintained at 55 °C for 1 min and increased with 30 °C/min to 280 °C. The parameters for the ion trap mass analyzer were as follows: transfer line at 280 °C, positive EI mode (70 eV), ion source at 200 °C, full scan on masses 100–700 Da; AGC target value 75. Helium was used as carrier gas with 30 cm/s. Bile compounds concentrations were quantified by comparing the ion current response of the sum of characteristic quantitation masses with the peak area response obtained for the known amount of the added internal standard (nordeoxycholic acid) (25Setchell K.D.R. Kritchevsky D. Nair P.P. The Bile Acids: Chemistry, Physiology and Metabolism, Vol. 4 (Methods and Applications). Plenum Press, New York1988: 582-594Google Scholar). Calculations were performed with the GCQ data processing software 2.2. Murine bile was collected by puncture of the gall bladder and analyzed according to a modification of the method of Chijiiwa and Nakayama (26Chijiiwa K. Nakayama F. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 431: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of epicoprostanol was added as internal standard per 5 μl of bile, followed by protein precipitation with ethanol and enzymatic hydrolysis with choloylglycine hydrolase. Bile acids were extracted with ethyl acetate and derivatized into ethyl esters dimethylethylsilyl ethers. Alternatively, derivatization into methyl esters trimethylsilyl ethers was carried out as described above. 1 μl of the final sample was analyzed by gas chromatography, performed on a SP-7100 (Spectra Physics, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with an flame ionization detector and a SE54-CB fused silica capillary column (30 m, inner diameter 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) (Chromatographic Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). The temperature of the column oven was maintained at 100 °C for 1 min, then increased with 20 °C/min to 200 °C, maintained for 5 min and finally increased with 5 °C/min to 280 °C. The temperature of the injection port and the detection unit was at 300 °C. Helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used as the carrier gas. The split ratio was 1:10. Peak areas were calculated with the MT2-Software (Kontron, Neufahrn, Germany) and compared with the peak areas of the added internal epicoprostanol standard. Unless stated otherwise, 6–24-week-old male SCP2/SCPx knockout mice (genetic background: C57Bl/6) were used (10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Age- and sex-matched C57Bl/6 mice served as controls. The mice were fed a standard chow diet (Altrumin, Hanover, Germany) and water of pH 3.4 to 3.6 ad libitum. The cholestyramine diet consisted of standard chow supplemented with 2% (w/w) of cholestyramine (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Animals were kept individually, food intake and body weights were monitored daily. Tissues were dissected routinely between 9 and 10 a.m. (to exclude variations that may be due to circadian regulation). Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues with the guandinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) followed by selection of poly(A) RNA on oligi(dT)-cellulose. Northern blots were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes prepared by random priming using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). All probes were obtained from a mouse liver cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction amplification with appropriate primers. Quantification was carried out relative to expression of gapdh, detected with a probe derived from a 1.3-kilobasePstI fragment from pGAPDH (28Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) containing rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. The membranes were rinsed twice in 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC at room temperature and then twice in 1% SDS, 0.5 × SSC at 68 °C for 15 min. Bands were visualized using the chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star (Tropix-Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed on an automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Upsala, Sweden) according to the instruction manual of the supplier. Statistical analyses were performed with the paired t test. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Any abnormality leading to decreased production of bile acids is likely to result in an up-regulation of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase as a result of reduced negative feedback suppression of this enzyme (29Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To clarify whether this mechanism operates in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice, we compared the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and mitochondrial cholesterol 27-hydroxylase in liver from SCP2/SCPx knockout mice with C57Bl/6 controls. As is shown in Fig. 1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase was expressed ∼4-fold higher in homozygous knockout mice than in C57Bl/6 controls. In contrast, no difference between the two strains could be observed concerning the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase. Methyl ester-trimethylsilylether derivatives of bile acids and other relevant compounds were analyzed by GC-MS in bile collected from SCP2/SCPx knockout mice and age- and sex-matched C57Bl/6 controls. As is shown in Fig. 2, all major bile acids, including cholic acid and the three muricholic acids (α, β, and ω), were present in bile from homozygous knockout mice. In addition, the primary bile acid CDCA, which represents only a minor component of murine bile, could be detected as ethyl ester-dimethylethylsilylether derivative in the samples from the knockout mice (data not shown). Based on an analysis including six mice in each experimental group, we found that the mean biliary levels of bile acids were ∼20% lower in homozygotes compared with C57Bl/6 controls, although the differences were not significant statistically. Moreover, the relative fractions of the common bile acids did not differ significantly between both strains (data not shown). We noted, however, two additional peaks in the chromatograms from knockout bile (marked X1 andX2 in Fig. 2). Both were detected in every sample from homozygous transgenes but were nondetectable in heterozygotes or C57Bl/6 controls. When homozygotes were treated with the bile acid sequestrating drug cholestyramine, known to stimulate bile acid synthesis, both peaks increased pronouncedly, whereas cholic acid remained at a lower level in homozygotes compared with controls (Fig. 3). After 14 days of treatment with cholestyramine, the two extra peaks did not appear in analyses with the samples from C57Bl/6 controls (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Gas chromatography of carboxymethyl ester-trimethylsilylether derivatives of biliary metabolites from cholestyramine-fed SCP2/SCPx knockout mice and C57Bl/6 controls.Adult male mice of both strains were fed with a diet containing 2% (w/w) cholestyramine for 14 days. Bile was collected and 10 μg of epicoprostanol was added per 0.005 ml of bile as internal standard (IS). Sample derivatization and gas chromatographic analyses were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Chol, cholesterol; MCA, muricholic acid. The levels of 7-oxo-cholic acid were variable independently of the genotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mass spectra that were obtained for both compounds are shown in Fig. 4. They point to normal 3α,7α,12α-hydroxylated ring structures that are combined with abnormal side chains. Whereas the side chain of X1 appeared 14 mass units smaller than the carboxymethylated side chain of cholic acid, it was 2 mass units smaller in X2. Comparative analyses performed on methyl ester-trimethylsilylether and ethyl ester-dimethylethylsilylether modified biliary samples showed that X1 was an unusual bile acid whereas X2 lacked the carboxylic function and thus represented an unusual bile alcohol (data not shown). Comparison with a number of chemically synthesized standards led to the identification of X1 as 23-NCA and X2 as 27-NC-24-one. Whereas 23-NCA differs from cholic acid by lack of one methylene group in the side chain, 27-NC-24-one represents an unusual bile alcohol carrying a keto-function at C-atom 24, shortened by one methylene group compared with trihydroxycholestane (Fig. 4). Due to small sample sizes and variable secretion rates of different biliary constituents, analytical measurements of murine bile have limitations. Therefore, we next performed analyses of bile acids and the related alcohols in serum. On the basis of their mass spectra, we identified 23-NCDCA and 23-NUDCA as additional nor-bile acids which were present besides 23-NCA in sera but were absent from bile of SCP2/SCPx knockout mice (Fig. 5). As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the sera from SCP2/SCPx knockout mice also contained high concentrations of 27-NC-24-one, which was not detected in C57Bl/6 controls. Conversely, significantly lower concentrations of all common bile acids were found in the knockout mice compared with C57Bl/6 controls. The decrease found for cholic acid, CDCA, the muricholic acids (α, β, ω), DCA, and UDCA consisted of 40–60% (p < 0.001). In contrast, extremely high concentrations of 23-NCA, 23-NCDCA, 23-NUDCA, and 27-NC-24-one could be demonstrated in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice treated with cholestyramine (Fig. 6). Conversely, these compounds were essentially absent from serum of identically treated C57Bl/6 controls.FIG. 6Serum concentrations of bile acid metabolites in chow- and cholestyramine-fed mice. Serum samples were collected from adult male SCP2/SCPx knockout mice (hatched bars) and C57Bl/6 controls (filled bars). Analyses of bile acid metabolites in serum were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent means ± S.E. of six animals. Identification of the compounds is based on comparison of GC-MS analyses with appropriate standards. 7oxo-CA, 7-oxocholic acid; MCA, muricholic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We did neither detect varanic acid, known to accumulate in patients with d-peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme deficiency (30van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E.

McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2287-2324Google Scholar), or complex bile alcohols consisting of 27 C-atoms and cholestanol (known to accumulate in the human disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) (19Bjorkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2073-2102Google Scholar) in bile or serum of the knockout mice (data not shown). Our results show for the first time that the SCP2/SCPx gene is critical for the synthesis of normal bile acids in vivo. Although the sequence of enzymatic steps in bile acid synthesis are diverse from different species, almost all mammals produce 7-α-hydroxylated bile acids that consist of 24 C-atoms (19Bjorkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2073-2102Google Scholar). These compounds play important roles in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, intestinal lipid and vitamin absorption, and in diseases like atherosclerosis, cholestatic liver disease, or gall stone formation. Unlike in normal mice, a large fraction of bile acids consist of only 23 C-atoms (i.e. 23-NCA and 23-NCDCA) in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. These bile acids, which lack one methylene group from their side chains, accumulate preferentially in serum of chow- or cholestyramine-fed knockout mice, whereas their concentrations in bile are relatively low. Thus, it may be assumed that the 23-nor-bile acids are less efficiently secreted in bile than their normal counterparts. In particular, 23-NCDCA showed extremely high concentrations in serum, whereas it appeared much less prominent in bile. This is in line with previous data showing that 23-NCA and 23-NCDCA are conjugated ineffectively in rats (31Nakatomi F. Kihira K. Kuramoto T. Hoshita T. J. Pharmacobiodynamics. 1985; 8: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Yeh H.Z. Schteingart C.D. Hagey L.R. Ton N.H. Bolder U. Gavrilkina M.A. Steinbach J.H. Hofmann A.F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, hepatic uptake and secretion into bile of 23-NCA was shown to be much lower compared with cholic acid in the perfused rat liver (33Vessey D.A. Whitney J. Gollan J.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 23-Nor-bile acids are most likely produced via α-oxidation from their normal counterparts. It has been shown that 23-hydroxylated cholic acid and CDCA are converted rapidly to the respective 23-nor-bile acids in several rodents (34Merrill J.R. Schteingart C.D. Hagey L.R. Peng Y. Ton N.H. Frick E. Jirsa M. Hofmann A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 98-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased 23-hydroxylation has also been shown in human patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who have elevated concentrations of 23-nor-bile acids (35Wolthers B.G. Volmer M. van der Molen J. Koopman B.J. de J.A. Waterreus R.J.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 131: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is caused by defective sterol-27-hydroxylation, catalyzed by a mitochondrial enzyme that belongs to the cytochrome P-450 family. Because the defect leads to a block in normal β-oxidation of the side chain located prior to the peroxisomal import of THCA-CoA, it differs clearly from the situation in the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. Nevertheless, induction of α-oxidation, leading to synthesis of 23-nor-derivatives, may represent a more general mechanism of compensation that could be associated with inefficient β-oxidation of the steroid side chain. It appears, however, interesting to us that 23-nor-bile acids were apparently absent from sterol-27-hydroxylase knockout mice (29Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which suggests that their production is regulated differently in human and mice. Besides the 23-nor-bile acids, we detected accumulation of high amounts of 27-NC-24-one in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. For a number of reasons, we think that this unusual bile alcohol originates from peroxisomal metabolism of THCA-CoA. During normal bile acid synthesis, the reduction from 27 to 24 C-atoms takes place in peroxisomes via removal of one unit of propionic acid from the side chain of THCA-CoA in one cycle of β-oxidation (compare Fig. 7for a schematic illustration of peroxisomal bile acid metabolism). Model analyses have shown that 27-NC-24-one is formed readily via spontaneous decarboxylation from 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-24-keto-cholestanoic acid (22Yuri M. Tokumoto M. Hara N. Fujimoto Y. Kobayashi N. Morisaki M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1993; 41: 1327-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which comes from the expected biosynthetic cholic acid intermediate 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-24-keto-cholestanoyl-CoA. 27-NC-24-one has been found in an earlier study besides varanic acid and 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-Δ24-cholestenoic acid in a human patient who may have had thiolase deficiency (36Clayton P.T. Patel E. Lawson A.M. Carruthers R.A. Collins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, we think that our results show convincingly that side chain oxidation is inhibitedin vivo in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice at the thiolytic step that takes place in peroxisomal β-oxidation of THCA-CoA. This leads us to conclude that the thiolase that is associated with SCPx is essential for the thiolytic step involved in bile acid synthesis. In a previous study, we showed that the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice have a defect in peroxisomal α- and β-methyl-branched fatty acid metabolism (10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The metabolic block occurred at two levels of peroxisomal metabolism: first, inefficient α-oxidation, presumably via inhibition of import of 3-methyl-branched fatty acids into peroxisomes, and second, inhibition of the thiolytic cleavage of the 2-methylated 3-ketoacyl-CoA derivatives. The structures of these 3-keto substrates are in fact very similar as the 24-keto substituted steroid side chain that is present in 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-24-keto-cholestanoic acid. Thus, it appears plausible to us that both substrates use the same thiolase for their β-oxidation. This conclusion is furthermore in accordance with the substrate specificity that has been studied in vitro for the recombinant rat SCPx protein (37Wanders R.J.A. Denis S. van Berkel E. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Seedorf U. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Wanders R.J.A. Denis S. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Seedorf U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26023-26031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, the substrate for peroxisomal β-oxidation, which is THCA, did not accumulate in SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. This negative finding shows that import of THCA-CoA into peroxisomes may not depend on the presence of SCP2 or SCPx. Alternatively, accumulation of THCA may be prevented by induction of efficient alternative side chain oxidation pathways. Such extraperoxisomal pathways could also explain why SCP2/SCPx knockout mice are still capable of synthesizing normal bile acids. One known alternative side chain oxidation pathway that is active in mice is the microsomal 25-hydroxylase pathway (19Bjorkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2073-2102Google Scholar). This or a 24-hydroxylase pathway was made previously responsible for residual bile acid synthesis in sterol 27-hydroxylase knockout mice (29Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the long known 41-kDa peroxisomal β-ketothiolase identified by Hashimoto and co-workers (11Hijikata M. Ishii N. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8151-8158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be responsible for the residual synthesis of normal bile acids in the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice. Although this enzyme is known to act preferentially on straight very long chain fatty acid substrates (37Wanders R.J.A. Denis S. van Berkel E. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Seedorf U. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it cannot be excluded that overlap of substrate specificity exists between the two peroxisomal thiolases. The hydroxylation steps which occur at the β-cholestane nucleus are apparently not affected in our model. We think that this is an interesting finding, because SCP2, which is missing in the model, has once been proposed to act as cytoplasmic cholesterol carrier (16Pfeifer S.M. Furth E.E. Ohba T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6490-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Considering the physicochemical properties and asymmetric intracellular distribution of cholesterol one would expect that target-specific intracellular cholesterol transport would be required for bile acid synthesis. According to current concepts, the initial steps that use cholesterol as the substrate proceed via two alternative pathways. The first and presumably major pathway consists of 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol catalyzed by cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (called CYP7a) at the endoplasmic reticulum (19Bjorkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2073-2102Google Scholar). The second, which is called the acidic pathway, is initiated by 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol in mitochondria and the 7α-hydroxylation step proceeds later via a newly identified oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase called CYP7b1 (40Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Bjorkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, the recent studies showed that there are two enzymes that are capable of 7α-hydroxylation, the classical cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, and the newly identified oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. The precise metabolic consequences in mice of inhibition of either pathway became evident from the recent characterization of CYP7a and sterol 27-hydroxylase knockout mice (29Rosen H. Reshef A.

In our study, we show that the abnormalities in bile acid synthesis of the SCP2/SCPx knockout mice are clearly distinct from those that have been described for the two other models. Therefore, we presume that the hypothetical function of SCP2 and SCPx as cytosolic cholesterol carrier may either be masked by efficient compensatory mechanisms in our model or that this function is not essential for murine bile acid synthesis in vivo.

This 48 S complex can then associate with the 60 S ribosomal subunit to complete the initiation phase of protein synthesis (for recent reviews on translation initiation, see Refs. 1Merrick W.C.

Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F specifically interact with the mRNA and facilitate its binding to the 43 S ribosome complex (40 S subunit·eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi). eIF4H has been identified as a new protein translation initiation factor that enhances the activities of initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F in various protein synthesis assays (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that eIF4H stimulates the translational activities of eIF4B and eIF4F in a reconstituted reticulocyte lysate system, as well as the RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) activity of the initiation factor eIF4A. Also, it was shown that eIF4H binds weakly to RNA, potentially through its conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), which shares a 45% identity to the RRM in eIF4B (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of this RRM suggests that eIF4H may function similarly to eIF4B to increase the helicase activity of eIF4A, since this motif in eIF4B was shown to be essential for stimulation of duplex unwinding (6Methot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

Previously, it was reported that eIF4H is not an abundant protein, and that ∼1 mg can be purified from 6 liters of rabbit reticulocyte lysate.

Therefore, this human cDNA sequence was obtained for expression and purification of recombinant human eIF4H protein (heIF4H) from a bacterial system. Here, methodology is presented for easily obtaining large amounts of very pure heIF4H that allow for further biochemical and kinetic characterization of eIF4H. Results from studies described here show that recombinant heIF4H has physical properties similar to those found in eIF4H purified from rabbit reticulocytes, with activities identical to those previously reported for rabbit eIF4H (4Richter-Cook N.J.

The availability of large quantities of active and pure protein made it feasible to examine more closely the functional properties of heIF4H in translation. In addition, by using recombinant heIF4H in the studies described below, it was possible to begin examining the differences between eIF4B and eIF4H, which are known to be similar in both activity and amino acid sequence (human eIF4H is 39% identical and 62% similar to human eIF4B). From these studies, it may be possible to develop a model of how eIF4H functions during the initiation of protein synthesis.

A clone of heIF4H cDNA was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Nobuo Nomura at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Japan. This was provided in the pBluescript SK+ vector as an insert between the EcoRV andNotI sites oriented to allow for transcription of the sense strand from the T7 promoter (named pBS4H). DNA mini-preps were performed using the alkaline lysis technique (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 1. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to engineer a unique NdeI restriction site at the AUG start codon for heIF4H (4H1: 5′-TGATGACGGC ATATGGCGGACTTC-3′, NdeI site underlined), and a unique SpeI site 18 nucleotides 3′ of the UGA stop codon (4H2: 5′- CCCCACGCACTAGTCCCTCCCAAC-3′, SpeI site underlined) for subcloning into the pET-17b expression vector. The PCR product and pET-17b plasmid were digested with NdeI andSpeI. The pET-17b fragment was gel purified and recovered by electroelution, treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and then ligated to the digested PCR fragment. The ligation reaction was transformed directly into NM522 competent cells, and selected by ampicillin resistance. Restriction digestion and DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of the heIF4H coding region within the plasmid, which was named pET4H. Subsequently, pET4H was transfected into bacterial strain BL21(DE3) for expression of recombinant human eIF4H upon IPTG induction. DNA sequencing was performed by either the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University, or the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Purification of eIF4H from rabbit reticulocytes was described previously (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Purification of recombinant heIF4H follows the standard procedures used to purify rabbit eIF4H (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with some modifications and additions as outlined below. All steps in the purification of heIF4H were performed at 4 °C. Soluble protein was applied by batch wash sequentially to DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose, both equilibrated in SB + 50 mm KCl + 25% glycerol. Unabsorbed protein was collected by filtering the resin using a small column, and then washing with an equal volume of SB + 50 mm KCl + 25% glycerol. The protein that did not bind to either DEAE- or CM-cellulose (flow-through) was then applied to a column containing phosphocellulose equilibrated in SB + 50 mm KCl + 25% glycerol. The column was washed with at least 1 column volume of equilibrating buffer at ∼0.5 ml/min collecting 10-min fractions. A 50–500 mm KCl gradient (50 mm KCl/column volume) in SB + 25% glycerol was applied at ∼0.5 ml/min collecting fractions every 10 min and monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and those containing eIF4H were pooled and dialyzed against a saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) overnight to precipitate the protein. Precipitated protein was pelleted, resuspended in a small volume of SB + 500 mm KCl + 25% glycerol, and dialyzed overnight against the same. The sample was then applied to a Superdex-75 FPLC column and developed with SB + 500 mm KCl + 25% glycerol at 0.1 ml/min collecting 0.5-ml fractions and monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and those containing eIF4H were analyzed in an ATPase assay both with and without eIF4A. Fractions that were free of contaminatingEscherichia coli proteins with ATPase activity, that stimulated the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of eIF4A, and with the highest concentration of eIF4H were pooled and dialyzed against SB + 100 mm KCl + 25% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (eIF4H has no tryptophans and gives a poor UV reading at 280 nm), and stored at the liquid nitrogen vapor temperature. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Separating gels used were 15% acrylamide (unless otherwise noted) and 0.2% bisacrylamide (ratio acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 58.7:1). Samples of rabbit and recombinant eIF4H were analyzed by LC/MS at the Cleveland Mass Spectrometry Facility, Cleveland State University. Approximately 50 pmol of sample (20–50 μl) was injected onto a 2.1 mm × 25-cm C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac) coupled to a Micromass Quattro-II triple quadrapole electrospray mass spectrometer. Peaks from the HPLC were analyzed by mass spectrometry and molecular weights determined. Purified eIF4H was analyzed by two-dimensional IEF/SDS electrophoresis as described previously (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Where noted, samples were dephosphorylated by treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Human and rabbit eIF4H were analyzed in a reconstituted rabbit reticulocyte lysate system lacking eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H, by measuring the incorporation of [14C]leucine into newly synthesized globin as described previously (4Richter-Cook N.J.

Briefly, 50-μl reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 3 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, purified elongation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomes, globin mRNA, tRNA, 80 μm amino acids (minus leucine), 0.3 μCi of [14C]leucine (specific activity 320 μCi/μmol), 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.34 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The remaining initiation factors (eIF1A, eIF2, eIF4A, eIF5, and eIF5A) were added to the assay in partially purified form as fractions from phosphocellulose chromatography, except for eIF3, which was added in its purified form. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the incorporation of [14C]leucine into hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was measured by scintillation spectrometry. The amount of heIF4H and rabbit eIF4H used was 1.5 μg. Combinations of the initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4F, eIF4B, and eIF4H were used to investigate RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by measuring the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (4Richter-Cook N.J.

Duplexes consisted of a 50-nucleotide RNA (RNA-1) made by in vitro transcription (Megashortscript kit) that is hybridized at its 3′ end to RNA oligonucleotides that are 10–15 bases in length (RNA-10 through 15), which are 5′ end-labeled with 32P (using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase).

In general, 20-μl reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 2 mmDTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, 1 mm ATP, 2.0 nm duplex, 0.2–0.4 μm eIF4A, and 0–0.4 μm eIF4H.

Reactions were analyzed on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) (pre-electrophoresed at 4 °C for 20–30 min) for 1.5 h at 200 V, 4 °C. Gels were then scanned directly using an Ambis radioanalytical scanner for 30–60 min. Results were quantitated as described previously (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Curves in Fig. 4 B were fit using a single phase exponential equation as described in Ref. 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, and the curve in Fig. 4 C was fit using a one-site binding equation, both using the GraphPad graphing software (Prism). Probes were made from cDNA fragments of human eIF4H, human eIF4B, and β-actin by the random primer method using the Prime-a-Gene labeling kit as described by the manufacturer. These 32P-labeled probes (internally labeled with [α-32P]CTP) were used to identify eIF4H and eIF4B mRNA separately on a Human Multiple Tissue Blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from eight different human tissues following procedures described by the manufacturer. Blots were exposed to x-ray film, and bands were quantitated using a SciScan 5000 densitometer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and OS-Scan Image Analysis System software (Oberlin Scientific Corp.). Quantitation of each band by densitometry was standardized to that in liver tissue on the same blot where the level of mRNA expression in liver tissue was set to a value of 1.0 (arbitrary units), and all other values were calculated relative to that within the same blot. The cDNA fragments of human eIF4H and human eIF4B used to make probes were created by PCR amplification from pBS4H and pET4B (a generous gift from Drs. T. Pestova and C. Hellen), respectively. Primers used for eIF4H (4H1 and 4H2) are described above. Primers used for eIF4B are as follows: 4B1, 5′-ATGGCGGCCTCAGCAAAAAAGAAGA-3′; 4B3, 5′-GAGAAAAGCACAGGATGTAGAGGTC-3′. The cDNA used for the β-actin probe was supplied by the manufacturer. A 200-μl 6 μm sample of heIF4H in a 20 mm KPO4 (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol buffer was analyzed at 10 °C using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Secondary structure was determined using the Jasco J-700 for Windows secondary structure estimation software. Denaturation studies were performed using 6 μmheIF4H diluted into urea solutions at concentrations shown in Fig. 7 B. Curve fitting was performed using the GraphPad graphing software (Prism). The sequence of the cDNA encoding human eIF4H (heIF4H) and the aligned protein sequence, is shown in Fig. 1. This cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector to facilitate purification of large quantities of recombinant protein from bacteria. PCR primers 4H1 and 4H2 (shown in Fig. 1) were used to amplify the coding sequence for heIF4H with a unique NdeI restriction site engineered at the AUG start codon, as well as a unique SpeI site 18 base pairs from the UGA stop codon at the 3′ end of the coding sequence. This PCR product was then subcloned into the pET-17b expression vector between theNdeI and SpeI sites, and this plasmid was named pET4H. Restriction digestion and DNA sequencing confirmed the presence and integrity of the heIF4H coding sequence. Fig. 2 A shows the levels of recombinant heIF4H expressed using 50 μm IPTG (lane 4), and the amounts in the soluble and insoluble fractions (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). As can be seen, high quantities of heIF4H are expressed (compare lanes 3 and4), and a significant portion of the heIF4H was in the soluble fraction (at least 75%). This was determined by comparing the ratios of protein “X” to heIF4H in the total protein fraction, soluble fraction, and insoluble fraction.FIG. 2Expression and purification of heIF4H.

Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were employed. As was done with rabbit eIF4H, all buffers used during the purification contained 25% glycerol to stabilize the protein. A detailed protocol for purification of heIF4H is described under “Methods.” Soluble heIF4H was obtained upon clarification of the cell lysate at 50,000 × g (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), applied to DEAE- and CM-cellulose columns by batch wash in 50 mm KCl, and heIF4H was recovered in the flow-through (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). This fraction was now enriched for heIF4H (compare lanes 3 and 4), and the majority of nucleic acids that bind tightly to DEAE-cellulose at low salt concentrations have been removed (data not shown). heIF4H from the DEAE- and CM-cellulose columns was then applied to a phosphocellulose column in 50 mm KCl, and eluted using a 50–500 mm KCl gradient. Fig. 2 B, lane 5, shows that the flow-through from phosphocellulose chromatography contained most of the contaminating E. coli proteins, while the majority of heIF4H was found to elute between 200 and 225 mm KCl (pool from gradient shown in lane 6). At this point the heIF4H preparation was ∼70–80% pure, yet contained high amounts of contaminating RNA-dependent and -independent ATP hydrolysis activity (data not shown), and therefore would not be useful in some functional studies. Previous studies suggested that eIF4H by itself has no ATPase activity (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To further purify heIF4H, it was applied to a Superdex-75 FPLC column in 500 mm KCl, and column fractions containing heIF4H were analyzed in an ATP hydrolysis assay. The final pool was made from fractions that were most concentrated for heIF4H, were free of contaminating ATPase activity, and stimulated the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of eIF4A. A sample from this pool is shown in Fig. 2 B, lane 7. After this purification step, heIF4H was >95% pure, and was used in physical analysis and functional activity assays as described below. Recombinant human eIF4H, when compared with the rabbit protein by SDS-PAGE, has a similar apparent molecular weight (refer to Fig. 2). The native molecular weight of heIF4H was determined empirically by size exclusion chromatography using the Superdex-75 FPLC column. Profiles from purifications of both rabbit and human eIF4H showed that both proteins eluted at the same position from this column (data not shown). To determine their actual molecular weight, samples of both rabbit and recombinant human eIF4H were analyzed by LC/MS. Mass spectrometry analysis of the main reverse phase HPLC peak showed that the heIF4H preparation contained two species (data not shown). The major species of heIF4H has a molecular mass of 25,072 Da, and the minor species has one of 24,340. The molecular mass of human eIF4H calculated from its amino acid sequence is 25,200 Da. Removal of the initiating formylated methionine (fMet) after protein synthesis would yield a molecular mass of 25,069 Da, which is essentially identical to that of the major species determined by LC/MS within error (±2–4 Da). This result confirms, along with the complete DNA sequencing of the coding region in pET4H, that the expressed heIF4H protein has the expected amino acid sequence. The minor species seen in the heIF4H sample (24,340 Da) was most likely one of the contaminating E. coli proteins seen in Fig. 2 B, lane 7, which may have co-eluted by HPLC with heIF4H. Analysis of rabbit eIF4H by LC/MS revealed three species within the major HPLC peak with the following molecular masses: 25,166 Da (major species), 25,277 Da, and 25,387 Da (minor species) (data not shown). The calculated molecular mass of human eIF4H, as stated above, is 25,200 Da, yet it is known that the N terminus is blocked in the rabbit protein (4Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) so that the first initiating methionine is most likely removed and the new N-terminal amino acid subsequently acetylated (16Flinta C.

When the molecular mass is recalculated for the N-terminal blocked human eIF4H, the resulting size is 25,111 Da. However, all of the molecular masses determined by LC/MS for rabbit eIF4H were slightly higher than that calculated, and the differences between the three species were 110–111 Da. The increase in molecular mass of the rabbit protein relative to that calculated for the human eIF4H sequence (55 Da) was most likely due to minor differences in amino acid sequence.

However, little actual evidence is available for the protein radical. We report here that LPO reacts with the spin trap 3,5-dibromo-4-nitroso-benzenesulfonic acid to give a 1:1 protein-bound radical adduct. Furthermore, LPO undergoes the H2O2-dependent formation of dimeric and trimeric products. Proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis indicates that the dimer is held together by a dityrosine link between Tyr-289 in each of two LPO molecules. The dimer retains full catalytic activity and reacts to the same extent with the spin trap, indicating that the spin trap reacts with a radical center other than Tyr-289. The monomeric protein recovered from incubations of LPO with H2O2 is fully active but no longer forms dimers when incubated with H2O2, clear evidence that it has also been structurally modified. Myeloperoxidase, a naturally dimeric protein, and eosinophil peroxidase do not undergo H2O2-dependent oligomerization. Analysis of the interface in the LPO dimers indicates that the same protein surface is involved in LPO dimerization as in the normal formation of myeloperoxidase dimers. Oligomerization of LPO alters its physical properties and may alter its ability to interact with macromolecular substrates.

Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Monzani E. Gatti A.L. Profumo A. Casella L. Gullotti M.

The second oxidation equivalent in this latter Compound I species presumably resides on the protein, but no actual evidence for this has been available. The present spin trapping studies provide the first direct evidence that a protein radical is indeed formed in the reaction of LPO with H2O2 (Fig. 1). The relevance of the radical and the protein-bound nature of the spin-adduct are confirmed by the demonstration that (a) its formation requires catalytically active LPO and H2O2, (b) the EPR signal of the spin adduct is anisotropic and remains associated with the protein upon passage of the protein through a PD-10 gel filtration column, and (c) tryptic digestion of the protein adduct yields a peptide with a sharp isotropic EPR signal.The demonstration that LPO undergoes a radical dimerization reaction in which a tyrosine residue in each of two LPO molecules couples to give a dityrosine cross-link provides solid independent evidence for a protein radical and identifies one of the residues in which the radical density resides. The nature of the cross-link is definitively established by (a) the fact that the dimeric protein (Fig. 7 A) and the cross-linked peptide obtained upon digestion of the protein dimer (Fig. 7 B) exhibit the characteristic dityrosine fluorescence and (b) mass spectrometric identification of the cross-linked peptide as Ala280-Gly-Phe-Val-Cys-Pro-Thr-Pro-Pro-Tyr 289-Gln-Ser-Leu-Ala-Arg294(Fig. 9), with Tyr-289 as the cross-linked residue. The yield of the cross-linked peptide (40–50%) shows that the radical density is largely accessible through Tyr-289, although other residues share the unpaired electron density, because the formation of an LPO trimer implicates at least one residue in addition to Tyr-289 as a locus of unpaired electron density. Furthermore, the radical trapped by DBNBS is not Tyr-289, because the LPO dimer reacts just as well with DBNBS as the parent LPO monomer when both proteins are exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 6). In addition, although preincubation of LPO with DBNBS and H2O2prevents dimer formation, chromatographic removal of the spin trap gives LPO that dimerizes when incubated with H2O2 (not shown). Thus, a minimum of two radical sites are present, one of which is centered on Tyr-289. The protection offered by DBNBS against dimerization is probably due to reducing impurities in the spin trap, which is present in very high concentration.The finding that the monomeric LPO recovered from incubations of LPO with H2O2 yields no dimeric protein when re-exposed to H2O2 indicates either that the native protein exists in two forms, only one of which can undergo dimerization, or that a reaction that modifies the LPO structure competes with the dimerization process. The protein modification, whether preexisting or the result of a peroxide-dependent reaction, either prevents transfer of unpaired electron density to Tyr-289 or suppresses subsequent cross-linking of this residue. The unimpaired catalytic activity of the recovered LPO monomer and the fact that it reacts normally with DBNBS to give a spin-adduct (Fig. 6) clearly show that the recovered protein functions more or less normally and is still able to form protein radicals. Thus, the modification that prevents LPO dimerization reflects a specific effect at Tyr-289 rather than a general disabling of the protein or its ability to form protein radicals.The relationship between protein radical formation, spin-adduct formation with DBNBS, and protein cross-linking is delineated by studies with LPO substrates and inhibitors. Iodide and thiocyanate undergo two-electron oxidations catalyzed by the Compound I with the ferryl/porphyrin radical species (21Courtin F. Deme D. Virion A. Michot J.-L. Pommier J. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Courtin F. Michot J.-L. Virion A. Pommier J. Deme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DBNBS spin-adduct formation and cross-linking by both of these substrates therefore stems from a competition between their oxidation by the initial Compound I and its conversion to the Compound I form with a protein radical. Ferrocyanide is a one-electron donor and may inhibit LPO dimer formation by reducing both Compound I forms to Compound II, Compound II to the resting ferric state, and the protein radical directly to the diamagnetic state. As already noted, DBNBS appears to inhibit cross-linking due to the presence of reducing impurities in the spin trap rather than by trapping the radical(s) involved in dimerization. Cross-linking and spin-adduct formation can thus be inhibited by consuming the first Compound I species before it decays to the second Compound I species, by reducing Compound I to Compound II, and by directly trapping or quenching the protein radicals that are formed.EPO and MPO do not detectably dimerize when incubated with H2O2 even though they share a high degree of sequence identity with LPO (Fig. 3 B). A model of the LPO structure based on a sequence alignment with MPO, using the MPO crystal structure as a template, provides interesting insights into this difference (Fig. 10). MPO normally exists as a dimer in which Cys-153 links the two monomers through a disulfide bond. Cys-153, as this implies, is located at the dimer interface in MPO. Sequence alignments indicate that Cys-284 in LPO corresponds to Cys-153 in MPO. However, Cys-284 in LPO, although it appears from the model to be surface-exposed, is not involved in the formation of a disulfide bond analogous to that of MPO, because LPO is a monomeric enzyme. The LPO homology model places Tyr-289 close to Cys-284 on the protein surface (Fig. 10). The radical dimerization of Tyr-289 thus occurs at the same protein surface in LPO as the cysteine cross-link in MPO. This requires that two LPO protein molecules interact closely through the same surface as the two subunits in the MPO dimer, although dimer formation involving Cys-284 is blocked in some manner. The residue that corresponds to Tyr-289 in MPO is Ile-324, which readily explains why a dityrosine cross-link is not formed in MPO. H2O2-dependent cross-linking of MPO, if observed, would require interaction of two dimer molecules through a surface other than that involved in dimer formation. The fact that LPO slowly forms oligomeric species indicates that such interactions are possible but are less favored than interaction of the proteins through the surface used in MPO to form the protein dimer.Evidence exists that the LPO dimer may be formed in vivo and may be physiologically relevant. Early studies showed that LPO catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins such as collagen and that this cross-linking is inhibited in vitro by iodide and thiocyanate (46Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Dimerization of LPO itself was not examined, but later analyses of human salivary peroxidase showed that this peroxidase is present in both monomeric (M r ∼ 80,000) and polymeric (M r ∼ 280,000) states (47Tenovuo J. Paunio K. Archs. Oral Biol. 1979; 24: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48Tenovuo J. Archs. Oral Biol. 1981; 26: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As salivary peroxidase is closely related to LPO except in carbohydrate content (49Mansson-Rahemtulla B. Rahemtulla F. Baldone D.C. Pruitt K.M. Hjerpe A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), oligomerization of LPO may also occur physiologically. As we show here, dimerization does not alter the intrinsic catalytic activity of the protein toward small substrates but alters the physical properties of the protein and may alter its ability to interact with other proteins. The present study unambiguously demonstrates that a protein radical is formed, but the possible role of this radical in substrate turnover by LPO remains to be definitively explored. LPO1 (EC 1.11.1.7; donor-H2O2 oxidoreductase), which oxidizes thiocyanate (HSCN) to hypothiocyanate (HOSCN) and more highly oxidized species, is a component of the mammalian antimicrobial defense system (1Thomas E.L. Pruitt K.M. Tenovuo J.O. The Lactoperoxidase System. Chemistry and Biological Significance. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1985: 31-54Google Scholar). It is closely related by sequence and function to MPO and EPO and also by sequence to thyroid peroxidase (2Cals M.-M. Mailliart P. Brignon G. Anglade P. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Ueda T. Sakamaki K. Kuroki T. Yano I. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LPO is not only of intrinsic interest but is also a useful model for the study of MPO and EPO, neither of which has been successfully expressed in other than mammalian cells (4DePillis G.D. Ozaki S.

Bovine LPO is a protein of 612 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 78,000 Da, approximately 10% of which is carbohydrate (2Cals M.-M. Mailliart P. Brignon G. Anglade P. Dumas B.R. Eur.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 7: 499-509Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The prosthetic group of the enzyme is a heme in which the 1- and 5-methyl groups bear hydroxyl groups esterified with the side chains of Glu-275 and Asp-125, respectively (4DePillis G.D. Ozaki S.

The prosthetic heme in myeloperoxidase is bound via two similar ester bonds to the protein (9Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) but in addition is linked to the protein by a bond between the 2-vinyl group and a methionine residue (10Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We established earlier that the prosthetic group is bound to the protein in LPO via a self-activating process in which noncovalently bound heme becomes covalently bound on exposure of the heme-protein complex to H2O2 (4DePillis G.D.

Recent evidence indicates that a similar mechanism is involved in covalent attachment of the heme to the protein in EPO and thyroid peroxidase (12Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.-L. J.

The peroxidative mechanism for LPO, as is true for all hemoprotein peroxidases, involves the following three-step sequence, where AH is a substrate (14Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 18-32Google Scholar). LPO+H2O2→Compound I+H2O(Eq. 1) Compound I+AH→Compound II+A·(Eq. 2) Compound II+AH→LPO+A·+H2O(Eq. 3) Compound II is a fairly well defined intermediate, with an FeIV=O species in which the iron is one oxidation state above its resting ferric state. The nature of Compound I is less well defined. In horseradish peroxidase, the prototypical peroxidase, Compound I consists of a ferryl species and a porphyrin radical cation (15Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

MPO normally exists as a dimer in which Cys-153 links the two monomers through a disulfide bond. Cys-153, as this implies, is located at the dimer interface in MPO. Sequence alignments indicate that Cys-284 in LPO corresponds to Cys-153 in MPO. However, Cys-284 in LPO, although it appears from the model to be surface-exposed, is not involved in the formation of a disulfide bond analogous to that of MPO, because LPO is a monomeric enzyme. The LPO homology model places Tyr-289 close to Cys-284 on the protein surface (Fig. 10). The radical dimerization of Tyr-289 thus occurs at the same protein surface in LPO as the cysteine cross-link in MPO. This requires that two LPO protein molecules interact closely through the same surface as the two subunits in the MPO dimer, although dimer formation involving Cys-284 is blocked in some manner. The residue that corresponds to Tyr-289 in MPO is Ile-324, which readily explains why a dityrosine cross-link is not formed in MPO. H2O2-dependent cross-linking of MPO, if observed, would require interaction of two dimer molecules through a surface other than that involved in dimer formation. The fact that LPO slowly forms oligomeric species indicates that such interactions are possible but are less favored than interaction of the proteins through the surface used in MPO to form the protein dimer.Evidence exists that the LPO dimer may be formed in vivo and may be physiologically relevant. Early studies showed that LPO catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins such as collagen and that this cross-linking is inhibited in vitro by iodide and thiocyanate (46Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Dimerization of LPO itself was not examined, but later analyses of human salivary peroxidase showed that this peroxidase is present in both monomeric (M r ∼ 80,000) and polymeric (M r ∼ 280,000) states (47Tenovuo J. Paunio K. Archs. Oral Biol. 1979; 24: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48Tenovuo J. Archs. Oral Biol. 1981; 26: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As salivary peroxidase is closely related to LPO except in carbohydrate content (49Mansson-Rahemtulla B. Rahemtulla F. Baldone D.C. Pruitt K.M. Hjerpe A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), oligomerization of LPO may also occur physiologically. As we show here, dimerization does not alter the intrinsic catalytic activity of the protein toward small substrates but alters the physical properties of the protein and may alter its ability to interact with other proteins. The present study unambiguously demonstrates that a protein radical is formed, but the possible role of this radical in substrate turnover by LPO remains to be definitively explored. The reaction of LPO with H2O2 initially yields a horseradish peroxidase-like Compound I with a ferryl species and a porphyrin radical cation that decays with time to a poorly defined Compound I that retains the ferryl species but not the porphyrin radical cation (19Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Monzani E. Gatti A.L. Profumo A. Casella L. Gullotti M.

Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second oxidation equivalent in this latter Compound I species presumably resides on the protein, but no actual evidence for this has been available. The present spin trapping studies provide the first direct evidence that a protein radical is indeed formed in the reaction of LPO with H2O2 (Fig. 1). The relevance of the radical and the protein-bound nature of the spin-adduct are confirmed by the demonstration that (a) its formation requires catalytically active LPO and H2O2, (b) the EPR signal of the spin adduct is anisotropic and remains associated with the protein upon passage of the protein through a PD-10 gel filtration column, and (c) tryptic digestion of the protein adduct yields a peptide with a sharp isotropic EPR signal. The demonstration that LPO undergoes a radical dimerization reaction in which a tyrosine residue in each of two LPO molecules couples to give a dityrosine cross-link provides solid independent evidence for a protein radical and identifies one of the residues in which the radical density resides. The nature of the cross-link is definitively established by (a) the fact that the dimeric protein (Fig. 7 A) and the cross-linked peptide obtained upon digestion of the protein dimer (Fig. 7 B) exhibit the characteristic dityrosine fluorescence and (b) mass spectrometric identification of the cross-linked peptide as Ala280-Gly-Phe-Val-Cys-Pro-Thr-Pro-Pro-Tyr 289-Gln-Ser-Leu-Ala-Arg294(Fig. 9), with Tyr-289 as the cross-linked residue. The yield of the cross-linked peptide (40–50%) shows that the radical density is largely accessible through Tyr-289, although other residues share the unpaired electron density, because the formation of an LPO trimer implicates at least one residue in addition to Tyr-289 as a locus of unpaired electron density. Furthermore, the radical trapped by DBNBS is not Tyr-289, because the LPO dimer reacts just as well with DBNBS as the parent LPO monomer when both proteins are exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 6). In addition, although preincubation of LPO with DBNBS and H2O2prevents dimer formation, chromatographic removal of the spin trap gives LPO that dimerizes when incubated with H2O2 (not shown). Thus, a minimum of two radical sites are present, one of which is centered on Tyr-289. The protection offered by DBNBS against dimerization is probably due to reducing impurities in the spin trap, which is present in very high concentration. The finding that the monomeric LPO recovered from incubations of LPO with H2O2 yields no dimeric protein when re-exposed to H2O2 indicates either that the native protein exists in two forms, only one of which can undergo dimerization, or that a reaction that modifies the LPO structure competes with the dimerization process. The protein modification, whether preexisting or the result of a peroxide-dependent reaction, either prevents transfer of unpaired electron density to Tyr-289 or suppresses subsequent cross-linking of this residue. The unimpaired catalytic activity of the recovered LPO monomer and the fact that it reacts normally with DBNBS to give a spin-adduct (Fig. 6) clearly show that the recovered protein functions more or less normally and is still able to form protein radicals. Thus, the modification that prevents LPO dimerization reflects a specific effect at Tyr-289 rather than a general disabling of the protein or its ability to form protein radicals. The relationship between protein radical formation, spin-adduct formation with DBNBS, and protein cross-linking is delineated by studies with LPO substrates and inhibitors. Iodide and thiocyanate undergo two-electron oxidations catalyzed by the Compound I with the ferryl/porphyrin radical species (21Courtin F. Deme D. Virion A. Michot J.-L. Pommier J. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Courtin F. Michot J.-L. Virion A. Pommier J. Deme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DBNBS spin-adduct formation and cross-linking by both of these substrates therefore stems from a competition between their oxidation by the initial Compound I and its conversion to the Compound I form with a protein radical. Ferrocyanide is a one-electron donor and may inhibit LPO dimer formation by reducing both Compound I forms to Compound II, Compound II to the resting ferric state, and the protein radical directly to the diamagnetic state. As already noted, DBNBS appears to inhibit cross-linking due to the presence of reducing impurities in the spin trap rather than by trapping the radical(s) involved in dimerization. Cross-linking and spin-adduct formation can thus be inhibited by consuming the first Compound I species before it decays to the second Compound I species, by reducing Compound I to Compound II, and by directly trapping or quenching the protein radicals that are formed. EPO and MPO do not detectably dimerize when incubated with H2O2 even though they share a high degree of sequence identity with LPO (Fig. 3 B). A model of the LPO structure based on a sequence alignment with MPO, using the MPO crystal structure as a template, provides interesting insights into this difference (Fig. 10). MPO normally exists as a dimer in which Cys-153 links the two monomers through a disulfide bond. Cys-153, as this implies, is located at the dimer interface in MPO. Sequence alignments indicate that Cys-284 in LPO corresponds to Cys-153 in MPO. However, Cys-284 in LPO, although it appears from the model to be surface-exposed, is not involved in the formation of a disulfide bond analogous to that of MPO, because LPO is a monomeric enzyme. The LPO homology model places Tyr-289 close to Cys-284 on the protein surface (Fig. 10). The radical dimerization of Tyr-289 thus occurs at the same protein surface in LPO as the cysteine cross-link in MPO. This requires that two LPO protein molecules interact closely through the same surface as the two subunits in the MPO dimer, although dimer formation involving Cys-284 is blocked in some manner. The residue that corresponds to Tyr-289 in MPO is Ile-324, which readily explains why a dityrosine cross-link is not formed in MPO. H2O2-dependent cross-linking of MPO, if observed, would require interaction of two dimer molecules through a surface other than that involved in dimer formation. The fact that LPO slowly forms oligomeric species indicates that such interactions are possible but are less favored than interaction of the proteins through the surface used in MPO to form the protein dimer.

Mannosylglycerate appears to be one of the most prevalent compatible solutes in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea, and is believed to be, along with di-myo-inositolphosphate, an archetypal osmolyte of organisms living near or at the highest growth temperatures for life. In Rhodothermus marinus, mannosylglycerate accumulates in response to growth at supraoptimal temperature and salinity while the amide form, mannosylglyceramide, accumulates exclusively in response to salt stress (5Nunes O.C. Manaia C.M. Da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Silva Z. Borges N. Martins L.O. Wait R. Da Costa M.S. Santos H. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mannosylglycerate was found to protect several enzymes against inactivation by temperature and freeze-drying (12Ramos A. Raven N.D.H. Sharp R. Bartolucci S. Rossi M. Cannio R. Lebbink J.

The elucidation of metabolic pathways for the synthesis of compatible solutes is essential to understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in the adaptation of many thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms to fluctuations in salt or temperature. Moreover, the biochemical and genetic characterization of key enzymes is also a prerequisite for achieving overproduction of these compounds in suitable hosts. In this study we elucidated the biosynthetic pathways of mannosylglycerate in R. marinus, and characterized the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase, catalyzing a final step in the synthesis of mannosylglycerate. In addition, we report the cloning and overexpression of the respective gene in Escherichia coli. The type strain of R. marinus DSM 4252 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) was grown on Degryse medium containing 2.5 g of tryptone and 2.5 g of yeast extract/liter (24Nunes O.C. Donato M.M. Da Costa M.S. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 92-97Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and supplemented with 1, 4, and 6% NaCl (w/v). Cultures were grown in a 5-liter fermentor at 65 °C, with continuous gassing with air and stirred at 150 rpm. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 600 nm. Escherichia coli TG1 (supE thi hsdΔ5 Δ(lac-proAB) [F′traD36 proAB lacI q ZΔM15]) and E. coliXL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac[F′proAB lacI q ZΔM15 Tn10 (Tetr)]) were used as hosts for the cloning vectors pUC18, pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). E. coli was grown in YT-medium containing 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl/liter. Ampicillin was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for selection of plasmids. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and IPTG1 were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany) and added at a final concentration of 80 μg/ml and 0.5 mm, respectively. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 ×g, 15 min, 20 °C) during the late exponential phase of growth and frozen at −80 °C. The cell sediment was suspended in Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6) containing DNase I (10 μg/ml extract) and MgCl2 (5 mm), and a mixture of protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.08 mg/ml), leupeptine (0.02 mg/ml), and antipain (0.02 mg/ml). Cells were disrupted in a French pressure cell, followed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 h, 10 °C) to remove cell debris. Cell extracts were applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) to remove mannosylglycerate (MG) and other low molecular weight compounds prior to measuring enzyme activities. The protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The specific activities of phosphoglucose isomerase (EC5.3.1.9), phosphomannose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8), and phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8) were determined by spectrophotometry at 55 °C using coupled reaction assays. Phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphomannose isomerase assays were based on the method described by Slein (26Slein M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 299-306Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phosphomannomutase activity was assayed by the method described by Pindar and Bucke (27Pindar D.F. Bucke C. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC2.7.7.13), mannosylglycerate synthase, and the combined mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase activities were assayed by 1H NMR to detect and quantify substrate consumption and product formation. The assay mixture for measurement of mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase activity was based on that suggested by Munch-Peterson (28Munch-Peterson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 10: 928-934Crossref Google Scholar) and contained 10 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mmguanosine-5′-triphosphate (Sigma), 4 mm mannose 1-phosphate (Sigma), and 2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase in Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6). For determination of the combined activity of mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase the reaction mixture contained 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm GDP mannose (Sigma), 4 mmd-3-P-glycerate (sodium salt, Sigma), and 0.3 mKCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Mannosylglycerate synthase was measured in an assay mixture containing 10 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm GDP mannose, and 4 mmd-glycerate (hemicalcium salt, Sigma) in the same buffer. Discontinuous or continuous methods were used to measure the activities of these enzymes at 65 °C. In the discontinuous method, cell extracts (generally, 100 μl) were incubated with the substrates, in a total reaction volume of 0.6 ml, for various periods of time, and the reactions were stopped by cooling and acidification with 25 mm HCl. After centrifugation, the pH of the supernatants was adjusted to 7.0 before freeze-drying. The residues were dissolved in 2H2O and analyzed by NMR. In the continuous method, the substrates were added to a 5-mm NMR tube and the reactions started by addition of aliquots of the enzyme preparation. The time course of product formation was followed by sequential acquisition of spectra. The reactions were stopped by rapid cooling followed by acidification. After centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized and MG quantified by 1H NMR. Control assays lacking the cell extracts or the substrates were also carried out. All specific activities are the mean values of six assays in crude extracts prepared from cells derived from three independent growths. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker DRX500 or AMX300 spectrometers. 1H NMR spectra were acquired with a 5-mm broad band inverse probe head with presaturation of the water signal. For quantification spectra were acquired with a repetition delay of 35 s and acetate was used as an internal concentration standard. Proton chemical shifts are relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propanesulfonic acid (sodium salt). Chromatograms were run on silica gel plates (Silica 60; Merck) with a solvent system composed of chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (6:10:5, v/v). The sugar and sugar derivatives were visualized by spraying with α-naphtol-sulfuric acid solution followed by charring at 120 °C (29Jacin H. Mishkin A.R. J. Chromatogr. 1965; 18: 170-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic standards of mannose, mannose 1-phosphate, GDP mannose, GDP, GMP, guanosine, and mannosylglycerate were used for comparative purposes. The enzyme, catalyzing the synthesis of MG from GDP mannose andd-glycerate, was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature fromR. marinus cells grown in medium containing 4% NaCl. Fractions were examined for the presence of the enzyme by the mannosylglycerate synthase assay method described above and visualization of MG formation by TLC. Cell-free extract was applied to a column (XK50/30; bed volume, 250 ml) packed with DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6). Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0–0.2 m and 0.2–0.4 m) in the same buffer. Mannosylglycerate synthase activity was found in the fractions eluting at approximately 0.3 m NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled fractions from the previous step to a final concentration of 0.5 m. This sample was applied to a column (XK16/20; bed volume, 90 ml) packed with phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. Elution was carried out with a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.5–0.0 m) in potassium phosphate buffer. Mannosylglycerate synthase eluted toward the end of the gradient. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (30-kDa cutoff). Fractions (1 ml) were applied to a gel filtration column (XK16/60; bed volume, 120 ml) packed with Superdex-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and eluted with the same buffer. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated to 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.7). The resulting sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column. Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0–0.2 m and 0.2–1 m). The fractions eluting between 0.22 and 0.25 m NaCl contained mannosylglycerate synthase. Electrophoresis of native proteins was performed on 7.5% polyacrylamide (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Four protein bands were located by cutting two thin longitudinal strips from the sides of the gel slab and staining with Coomassie Blue. The four bands were recovered by electrophoretic elution from the gel using a BIOTRAP BT 1000 (Schleider & Schuell) at 200 V for 4 h, and each protein was assayed for mannosylglycerate synthase activity. Of these bands, only one had this activity, originating a single band by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of mannosylglycerate synthase was determined by the method of Edman and Begg (31Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystem Model 477A protein sequencer. The internal sequences were determined by Edman degradation after digestion with trypsin and separation of the peptides by micro-HPLC at the Microchemical Facility, Emory University School of Medicine, GA. Most DNA manipulations followed standard molecular techniques and procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total DNA from R. marinus was purified by the method of Marmur (33Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8944) Google Scholar). For sequencing purposes, recombinant plasmid DNAs were prepared using plasmid kits (QIAGEN). Southern blots of restriction endonuclease-cleaved genomic or plasmid DNAs, and colony blots were hybridized with DNA probes labeled with a digoxigenin DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). From the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mannosylglycerate synthase, FPFKHEHPEV (amino acids 6–15), the degenerate sense primer 5′-TTCCC(G/C)TTCAAGCA-CGAGCACCC(G/C)GAGGT-3′ was designed. From the partial amino acid sequences of three internal peptides, HFYDADIT (amino acids 97–104), QVELLELFT (amino acids 286–294), and GYDYAQQ (amino acids 359–366), the degenerate antisense primers 5′-GTGATGTC(G/C)GCGTCGTAGAAGTG-3′, 5′-GTGAA(G/C)AGCTC(G/C)AG(G/C)AGCTC(G/C)ACCTG-3′, and 5′-TACTGCTG(G/C)GCGTAGTCGTA(G/C)CC-3′, respectively, were designed. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 in reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 200 ng of genomic R. marinus DNA, 100 ng of each primer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase, and 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then subjected to 20 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min. Annealing was performed at gradually decreasing temperatures (59 to 49 °C) for 1 min, and primer extension was at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 10 cycles in which the annealing temperature remained constant at 49 °C. The extension reaction in the last cycle was prolonged for 5 min. Amplification products were purified from agarose gels for use as hybridization probes, and ligated to the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). To obtain a genomic library from R. marinus, total DNA was partially digested with restriction enzyme Sau3A. Fragments ranging from 1 to 5 kbp were purified from agarose gels, and ligated into the BamHI site of dephosphorylated pUC18. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TG1 cells. Transformed cells were plated on YT-broth supplemented with ampicillin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and IPTG. Approximately, 2 × 104 transformants were obtained after 18 h of growth at 37 °C. Similarly, a partial genomic library from R. marinus, containing DNA fragments selected by Southern analysis of genomic DNA preparations with themgs probe, was obtained by complete digestion of total DNA with restriction enzyme PstI, followed by ligation of purified fragments of about 2.1 kbp in size into the PstI site of pUC18, and subsequent transformation of E. coliXL1-Blue cells with the ligation mixture. Positive clones were detected by colony hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled probes as described above. Nucleotide sequences were determined by MWG-BIOTECH (Ebersberg, Germany) using the LI-COR 4200 automated sequencing system. Inserts of positive pUC18 clones (pMG721, pMG7, and pMG161), pGEM-T Easy-clones, and plasmid clone pMG37 were sequenced in both orientations using vector- and insert-specific oligodeoxynucleotide primers. Nucleic acid and protein sequence analyses were conducted with programs in the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package (34Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The European Bioinformatics Institute data bases, and functionally annotated genomes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, as well as the archaeal genome sequence data base were screened for homologies using the (T)FASTA (35Pearson W.R.

Overexpression of the mgs Gene and Purification of the Enzyme—The mgs gene was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GCGGAATTCATGAGCCTGGTCGTTTTTCCC-3′ with an additional EcoRI recognition sequence (underlined) immediately upstream of the ATG start codon, and the reversed primer 5′-GCGCTGCAGGGATCCTCAGGCGGTCGACAGTGCC-3′ with additionalPstI and BamHI recognition sequences (underlined) directly behind the TGA stop codon. The PCR product was purified after digestion with EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into the corresponding sites in the pKK223-3 expression vector to obtain plasmid pMG37. E. coli XL1-Blue cells containing pMG37 were grown to the midexponential growth phase (OD600 = 0.4), induced with IPTG, and growth continued for a further 3 to 4 h. Cells were harvested and treated as described above for the preparation of cell-free extracts. The resulting extract was incubated for 30 min at 75 °C and centrifuged. After dialysis against 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), the sample was loaded onto a Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column that was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm). Fractions with activity were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Superdex-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The temperature profile for the activity of mannosylglycerate synthase was determined between 35 and 95 °C, by using the discontinuous method described above. The effect of pH on mannosylglycerate synthase activity was determined at 90 °C in 50 mm MES (pH 5.5–6.5) and 50 mm BisTris-propane buffer (pH 6.5–9.5). All pH values were measured at room temperature; pH values at 90 °C were calculated by using ΔpK a /ΔT °C = −0.011 and −0.015 for MES and BisTris-propane, respectively. Enzyme thermostability was determined at 65 and 90 °C by incubating an enzyme solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). At appropriate times, samples were withdrawn and immediately examined for residual mannosylglycerate synthase activity using the discontinuous assay at 90 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined at 90 °C. Reaction mixtures contained GDP mannose (0.165–10.0 mm) plus 10 mmd-glycerate, or d-glycerate (0.188–10.0 mm) plus 10 mm GDP mannose. Samples were preheated for 3 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme preparation, and MG was quantified by 1H NMR. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Values forV max and K m were determined from Hanes plots. The molecular mass of native mannosylglycerate synthase was determined on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.15m NaCl. Cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa) were used as standards. The isoelectric point of native mannosylglycerate synthase was determined by isoelectric focusing (model 111 mini-IEF cell, Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer. A pH 3–10 isoelectric focusing gel and standards in a range of pI 4.5–9.6 were used. The nucleotide sequence of mannosylglycerate synthase has been deposited in GenBank under accession number AF173987. By analogy with the known biosynthetic pathways of other sugar derivatives, such as glucosylglycerol (16Hagemann M. Erdmann N. Microbiolology. 1994; 140: 1427-1431Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and trehalose (38Giæver H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strøm A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2841-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the terminal reaction in the synthesis of MG should involve a sugar nucleotide as donor of the glycosyl moiety, and a phosphorylated acceptor (3-P-glycerate). From an array of experiments with GDP mannose, UDP mannose, and ADP mannose as donors, andd-3-P-glycerate as acceptor, we were unable to detect the formation of MG in cell extracts prepared from R. marinusgrown in medium containing 4% NaCl. Activity for the synthesis of MG, however low, was detected upon the addition of NaCl or KCl (150, 300, and 450 mm), to the enzyme assay, when GDP mannose was used as a glycosyl donor. Optimal activity was observed at 300 mm NaCl or KCl. Unexpectedly, the activity for the formation of MG in cell extracts was significantly higher whend-glycerate, instead of d-3-P-glycerate, was used in addition to GDP mannose (Table I, compare the values for mannosylglycerate synthase and mannosyl 3-P-glycerate synthase/mannosyl 3-P-glycerate phosphatase). Furthermore, this activity did not depend on the salt concentration in the assay mixture (0–450 mm NaCl or KCl). 1H NMR was used to detect and monitor the time course for the formation of MG in crude cell extracts at 65 °C. In the anomeric region of the spectra clear resonances due to the anomeric protons of MG and the ribose and mannose moieties in GDP mannose were detected, allowing to monitor on line the consumption of the substrate and build up of the product (Fig. 1).Table IEnzymatic activities involved in the biosynthesis of mannosylglycerate in cell-free extracts of Rhodothermus marinusEnzymesSpecific activitiesaAll specific activities are the mean values of six assays in crude extracts prepared from cells obtained from three independent growths./NaCl in the growth media1%4%6%nmol/min·mg proteinPhosphoglucose isomerase621 ± 14551 ± 19556 ± 17Phosphomannose isomerase657 ± 28528 ± 8470 ± 12Phosphomannose mutase242 ± 3174 ± 7102 ± 6Mannose-1-P guanylyltransferase107 ± 1491 ± 2098 ± 25Mannosylglycerate synthase17 ± 0.112 ± 617 ± 6Mannosyl-3-P-glycerate synthase bActivities measured in the presence of 0.3 mKCl.3.0 ± 1.42.0 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.3(Mannosyl-3-P-glycerate phosphatase)a All specific activities are the mean values of six assays in crude extracts prepared from cells obtained from three independent growths.b Activities measured in the presence of 0.3 mKCl.

Furthermore, the interrelationship(s) between this SCP-2 ligand binding site and the recently reported SCP-2 long chain fatty acid (LCFA) and long chain fatty acyl-CoA (LCFA-CoA) binding site(s) remains to be established. In the present work, two SCP-2 ligand binding sites were identified. First, both [4-13C]cholesterol and 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol (NBD-cholesterol) binding assays were consistent with a single cholesterol binding site in SCP-2. This ligand binding site had high affinity for NBD-cholesterol, K d = 4.15 ± 0.71 nm. 13C NMR-labeled ligand competition studies demonstrated that the SCP-2 high affinity cholesterol binding site also bound LCFA or LCFA-CoA. However, only the LCFA-CoA was able to effectively displace the SCP-2-bound [4-13C]cholesterol. Thus, the ligand affinities at this SCP-2 binding site were in the relative order cholesterol = LCFA-CoA > LCFA. Second, 13C NMR studies demonstrated the presence of another ligand binding site on SCP-2 that bound either LCFA or LCFA-CoA but not cholesterol. Photon correlation spectroscopy was consistent with SCP-2 being monomeric in both liganded and unliganded states. In summary, both 13C NMR and fluorescence techniques demonstrated for the first time that SCP-2 had a single high affinity binding site that bound cholesterol, LCFA, or LCFA-CoA. Furthermore, results with 13C NMR supported the presence of a second SCP-2 ligand binding site that bound either LCFA or LCFA-CoA but not cholesterol. These data contribute to our understanding of a role for SCP-2 in both cellular cholesterol and LCFA metabolism.

While spontaneous desorption and intracellular diffusion of lipids occur, they do not account for (i) the asymmetric distribution of cellular lipids, (ii) the synthesis of cholesterol in and targeted efflux from the relatively cholesterol poor endoplasmic reticulum, (iii) the lysosomal release and intracellular targeting of cholesterol, fatty acids, and glycerides, or (iv) high density lipoprotein-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. Cellular lipids are transferred and targeted within the cell via vesicular pathways, cytosolic proteins, and possibly via as yet undefined interactions between cytosolic proteins and vesicular pathways. In addition to vesicular pathways, intracellular cholesterol is believed to be transferred and targeted within the cell via proteins such as SCP-21 (reviewed in Refs. 1Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R.

Despite these observations, very little is known regarding the mechanism whereby SCP-2 transfers cholesterol between membranes.

Unfortunately, clear demonstration of cholesterol binding or saturation binding of other sterols to SCP-2 has been difficult to achieve. In addition to its involvement in intermembrane cholesterol transfer, recent reports that SCP-2 also interacts with long chain fatty acids (LCFA) and long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoA) suggest additional role(s) for this protein in intracellular LCFA and/or LCFA-CoA trafficking. The pathway(s) whereby LCFA and their CoA derivatives traffic and are targeted within the cell are as yet undefined (reviewed in Refs. 36McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B.

Increasing evidence shows that the intracellular fatty acid binding proteins function in intracellular trafficking by enhancing LCFA uptake, intracellular diffusion, or metabolic targeting (reviewed in Refs. 36McArthur M.J.

For over a decade, it was thought that one of the intracellular lipid binding proteins, SCP-2, did not bind fatty acids in the Lipidx-1000 assay and was not involved in fatty acid metabolism (40Scallen T.J.

However, more recent data using improved fluorescence and 13C NMR binding assays showed that the SCP-2 binds LCFA (41Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G.

Furthermore, SCP-2 also binds branched-chain LCFA (43Frolov A. Miller K. Billheimer J.T. Cho T.-C. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Seedorf U.

Thus, SCP-2 clearly exhibits saturation binding of LCFA and LCFA-CoA with high affinity. Whether this ligand binding site(s) is identical to the putative cholesterol binding site remains to be determined. The objective of the present investigation was to characterize the interrelationships of the SCP-2 binding site(s) for LCFA, LCFA-CoA, and cholesterol. 13C and fluorescent labeled LCFA and sterols were used to show for the first time that SCP-2 has two ligand binding sites; 13C NMR and fluorescence techniques both revealed a high affinity site at which cholesterol, fatty acid, or fatty acyl-CoA bound. SCP-2 bound sterol at this site with K d = 4 nm, near that reported for LCFA-CoA, K d = 2–4 nm (44Frolov A. Cho T.H. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31878-31884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A second site, revealed by 13C NMR but not fluorescence assays, bound only fatty acid or fatty acyl-CoA, but not cholesterol. The second site was not due to oligomerization of SCP-2 at the high protein concentrations required for 13C NMR. Fully enriched [13C18]oleic acid and [1-13C]oleic acid were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) as was perdeuterated dithiothreitol. [4-13C]cholesterol was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was obtained from Aldrich, and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was from American Maize-Products Co. (Hammond, IN). 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol (NBD-cholesterol) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Oleic acid, oleoyl-CoA, cholesterol, and Tris were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. The recombinant human SCP-2 was prepared as described earlier (47Matsuura J.E. George H.J. Ramachandran N. Alvarez J.G. Strauss J.F.I. Billheimer J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The concentration of SCP-2 was determined by Bradford assay (48Bradford M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Most recombinant SCP-2 proteins from a variety of species reported thus far contain at least one mutation near the N terminus. Deletion of large segments, e.g. 10 or more amino acids, at the amino terminus as well as some substitutions at position 20 were able to inactivate the recombinant SCP-2 as determined by large changes in circular dichroic spectra and in sterol transfer assays (49Seedorf U. Scheek S. Engel T. Steif C. Hinz H.J. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2613-2618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, small differences in amino terminus amino acid sequence in the recombinant SCP-2 do not result in significantly altered function. For example, recombinant human SCP-2 and native rat liver SCP-2, which differ in their amino terminus (50Pfeifer S.M. Sakuragi N. Ryan A. Johnson A.L. Deeley R.G. Billheimer J.T. Baker M.E. Strauss J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), enhanced intermembrane sterol transfer almost identically (49Seedorf U. Scheek S. Engel T. Steif C.

Chem. 1980; 255: 4282-4289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, recombinant mouse, human, or rat SCP-2 and native rat SCP-2 (all differ in the N-terminal three amino acids) as well as mutants in the N-terminal five amino acids of human recombinant SCP-2 did not significantly differ in circular dichroic structure or a variety of functional assays such as enhancement of microsomal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, stimulation of microsomal acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase, enhancement of intermembrane sterol transfer, or stimulation of intermembrane phospholipid transfer (49Seedorf U.

For each sample prepared, an SCP-2 (<2 mg/ml) stock solution was subjected to several buffer exchanges (20 mm KP, 4 mm perdeuterated dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, in 20% D2O) through a YM 3 Ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) before being concentrated to a final volume of 400–500 μl. The final SCP-2 concentration employed was 15–20 mg/ml (1.0–1.5 mm). The 13C NMR reference spectra of apo-SCP-2 were obtained using this solution prior to complexing with fatty acid or cholesterol. Complexes of fatty acids and SCP-2 were prepared as described earlier (42Stolowich N.J. Frolov A. Atshaves B.P. Murphy E. Jolly C.A. Billheimer J.T. Scott A.I. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Complexes of cholesterol and SCP-2 were prepared as follows. Method 1 involved first complexing the cholesterol with O-modified cyclodextrins as described earlier (53Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes were prepared with either methyl-β-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as the host by mixing varying amounts of [4-13C]cholesterol with a 5% (w/v) solution of the cyclodextrin at 80 °C, followed by lyophilization. 13C NMR analysis as the lyophilized complexes indicated that the highest degree of cholesterol inclusion was achieved using 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and a cholesterol concentration of 1 mg/g of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (data not shown). This sample was then used in attempt to deliver cholesterol to SCP-2. However, removal of the 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin by membrane filtration led to a loss of cholesterol, indicating a preference for the cyclodextrin over SCP-2. Method 2 involved the addition of aliquots (2-fold molar excess relative to SCP-2) of the [4-13C]cholesterol (20 mm in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1)) to a clean NMR tube and evaporation of the solvent with a stream of argon and with gentle heating (35–40 °C). SCP-2 in buffer (20 mm KP, 4 mm perdeuterated dithiothreitol, pH 7.0 in 20% D2O) were added directly to the tube containing the solid cholesterol, and the tube was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min, being removed intermittently to be briefly sonicated. The sample was then used for NMR spectroscopy, without further removal of residual suspended cholesterol. A Bruker ARX-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm C/H probe was used to obtain proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra at 125.76 MHz. Low power (¼-watt) proton decoupling was accomplished using the powergated WALTZ sequence in the Bruker software. All other conditions were as described earlier (42Stolowich N.J. Frolov A. Atshaves B.P. Murphy E. Jolly C.A. Billheimer J.T. Scott A.I. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The intense signal of the SCP-2 ε-Lys/β-Leu carbons was used as an internal chemical shift reference (39.45 ppm) (54Gurd F.R. Keim P. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 836-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). SCP-2 binding affinity for NBD-cholesterol was determined as described previously (41Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 2-ml sample of 11.1 nm SCP-2 in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) was titrated with small increments of NBD-cholesterol (0.5–2.0 μl) dissolved in dimethylformamide. The NBD-cholesterol stock solution concentration was 14 μm. Each sample and blank (without SCP-2) were thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 2–4 min to permit stable measurement of the fluorescent signal. NBD-cholesterol fluorescence was excited at 465 nm, and emission was recorded in the region of 500–600 nm. Excitation and emission slits were 8 and 16 nm, respectively. The integrated NBD-cholesterol emission was measured after each addition of the ligand, corrected for the background and blank, and used to construct the binding isotherm. Data were fit using a simple, single binding site model as described (41Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Photon correlation spectroscopy with a Coulter N4 Plus Photon Correlation Spectrometer (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Miami, FL) was used to determine the particle size distribution of unliganded SCP-2 (1 mm), oleoyl-CoA (2 mm), and a 2:1 complex of 1 mm SCP-2 plus 2 mm oleoyl-CoA. The samples were run at the 90o angle for 900 s directly. Size distribution processor weight analysis and size distribution processor weight peak values were reported. Photon correlation spectroscopy optimally measures particle size in the range of 3–3000 nm in diameter, within the size range of SCP-2 near 4.1 nm as indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy (43Frolov A. Miller K. Billheimer J.T. Cho T.-C. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 44Frolov A. Cho T.H. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31878-31884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As outlined in the Introduction, SCP-2 has been widely implicated in sterol transport, etc.; however, the direct detection of cholesterol binding to SCP-2 has been difficult due to the sterol's insolubility in an aqueous environment, particularly at concentrations near physiological significance (reviewed in Ref. 55Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.S. Vassiliev A. Wood G.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, two different approaches were used to demonstrate binding of [4-13C]cholesterol to SCP-2. First, O-modified cyclodextrins were used to increase the aqueous solubility of the [4-13C]cholesterol. The utility of employing O-modified cyclodextrins for this purpose and for increasing delivery of several sterols including cholesterol has been demonstrated (reviewed in Refs. 36McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lip. Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 56Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, several attempts to utilize cholesterol-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes in the present study, using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as the host, did not conclusively demonstrate SCP-2 binding of [4-13C]cholesterol in the presence of the cyclodextrin carrier. Furthermore, removal of the cyclodextrin carrier via membrane filtration resulted in complete loss of the [4-13C]cholesterol signal (data not shown), indicating a binding preference of [4-13C]cholesterol for cyclodextrin over SCP-2. Second, [4-13C]cholesterol was solubilized by SCP-2 from solid [4-13C]cholesterol. Fig. 1 shows the outcome of adding a 1 mm solution of SCP-2 to an NMR tube that has been previously coated with a film of 2 eq of [4-13C]cholesterol. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the 13C NMR spectrum was obtained (Fig. 1). A new resonance, not present in SCP-2 alone (Fig. 1 A), was identified at δ 40.8 ppm (Fig. 1 B). The chemical shift of the new peak was similar to that observed for the enriched C-4 carbon of cholesterol in CDCl3 (δ 42.8 ppm) as well as to that bound to 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (δ 41.7 ppm) (Table I). The sample was then transferred to a new NMR tube containing an additional 2 eq of solid [4-13C]cholesterol, again incubated, and the NMR spectrum was determined. A further increase in the intensity of the new peak at δ 40.8 ppm was observed (Fig. 1 C), indicating SCP-2 in Fig. 1 B had not yet been saturated with sterol. Subsequent attempts to bind more [4-13C]cholesterol led to no further increase in signal intensity. Since solid sterol residue was left behind after each incubation, it was difficult to ascertain the amount of cholesterol complexed to SCP-2 based only on the number of equivalents of [4-13C]cholesterol added to the NMR tube. However, judging by comparison to the peak areas observed for other 1:1 complexes of ligand to protein (42Stolowich N.J. Frolov A. Atshaves B.P. Murphy E. Jolly C.A. Billheimer J.T. Scott A.I.

Our laboratory had previously shown that SCP-2 and another LCFA binding protein (L-FABP) did not bind the NBD group by itself, but both proteins bound NBD-LCFA with aK d value similar to that for other LCFA (41Schroeder F.

The affinity of SCP-2 for NBD-cholesterol was at least 50-fold higher than that for LCFA (41Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G.

https://openalex.org/W2095118539,"We previously identified a cluster of basic spectrin-like repeats in the dystrophin rod domain that binds F-actin through electrostatic interactions (Amann, K. J., Renley, B. A., and Ervasti, J. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28419–28423). Because of the importance of actin binding to the presumed physiological role of dystrophin, we sought to determine whether the autosomal homologue of dystrophin, utrophin, shared this rod domain actin binding activity. We therefore produced recombinant proteins representing the cluster of basic repeats of the dystrophin rod domain (DYSR11–17) or the homologous region of the utrophin rod domain (UTROR11–16). Although UTROR11–16 is 64% similar and 41% identical to DYSR11–17, UTROR11–16 (pI = 4.86) lacks the basic character of the repeats found in DYSR11–17 (pI = 7.44). By circular dichroism, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity analysis, we determined that each purified recombinant protein had adopted a stable, predominantly α-helical fold and existed as a highly soluble monomer. DYSR11–17 bound F-actin with an apparentK d of 7.3 ± 1.3 μm and a molar stoichiometry of 1:5. Significantly, UTROR11–16 failed to bind F-actin at concentrations as high as 100 μm. We present these findings as further support for the electrostatic nature of the interaction of the dystrophin rod domain with F-actin and suggest that utrophin interacts with the cytoskeleton in a manner distinct from dystrophin. We previously identified a cluster of basic spectrin-like repeats in the dystrophin rod domain that binds F-actin through electrostatic interactions (Amann, K. J., Renley, B. A., and Ervasti, J. M.

We present these findings as further support for the electrostatic nature of the interaction of the dystrophin rod domain with F-actin and suggest that utrophin interacts with the cytoskeleton in a manner distinct from dystrophin. dithiothreitol Dystrophin is the 427-kDa protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus. It binds both F-actin and a complex of membrane-associated proteins that binds merosin, thereby providing a physical connection between the cortical cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (2Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The importance of this functional complex of proteins to striated muscle physiology is demonstrated by the observations that genetic disruption of dystrophin, merosin, or several other protein components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex results in muscular dystrophies.The dystrophin sequence consists of four distinct domains (Fig. 1): an amino-terminal, calponin homology-type actin binding domain; a large, rod-shaped domain comprised of 24 spectrin-like repeats and four hinge regions; a cysteine-rich domain and a unique carboxyl-terminal domain (3Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Sequences located in the cysteine-rich and carboxyl-terminal domains are responsible for dystrophin binding to the glycoprotein complex and other associated proteins (4Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Yamamoto H. Ozawa E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Kramarcy N.R. Vidal A. Froehner S.C. Sealock R. J. Biol.

Until recently, it was generally thought that dystrophin bound cortical actin solely through its amino-terminal actin binding domain (7Hemmings L. Kuhlman P.A. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G.

However, transgenic mice expressing a dystrophin construct deleted for the actin binding amino-terminal domain presented with a surprisingly mild phenotype, indicating that the amino-terminal domain is not specifically essential for dystrophin function (12Corrado K. Rafael J.A. Mills P.L. Cole N.M. Faulkner J.A. Wang K. Chamberlain J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that native dystrophin bound F-actin with substantially higher affinity and lower stoichiometry than did the isolated amino-terminal actin binding domain (13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We also identified a novel actin binding activity located between the 11th and 14th spectrin-like repeats in the dystrophin rod domain (13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). From these and other data, we proposed that the two independent and physically separated actin binding sites act in concert to effect a high affinity, lateral association between native dystrophin and F-actin.We have since demonstrated that the interaction of the dystrophin rod domain with F-actin is limited to a subset of the rod domain repeats and that the interaction is due to electrostatic interactions between the acidic actin filament and a unique cluster of basic repeats in the otherwise acidic dystrophin rod domain (1Amann K.J.

While our previous studies employed a recombinant protein representing repeats 11–14, sequence analysis (Fig. 1) revealed that the cluster of basic repeats extends from repeat 11 to repeat 17, suggesting that a more extensive lateral association between the dystrophin rod domain and F-actin may be possible.A number of recent studies (14Rafael J.A.

Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) have suggested that dystrophin may be functionally interchangeable with its autosomal homologue, utrophin. Utrophin is highly expressed throughout fetal and regenerating muscles but is down-regulated at birth and restricted to the myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions of normal adult muscle (21Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because utrophin also displays several of the protein binding activities described for dystrophin, utrophin was hypothesized to function as a fetal homologue of dystrophin that may be capable of compensating for dystrophin deficiency. Indeed, continued utrophin expression in mdxmice partially attenuates the phenotype associated with dystrophin deficiency, since mice lacking both dystrophin and utrophin exhibit a more severe phenotype similar to that presented by patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (16Grady R.M. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Deconinck A.E. Potter A.C. Tinsley J.M. Wood S.J. Vater R. Young C. Metzinger L. Vincent A. Slater C.R. Davies K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In mdx mice, transgenic overexpression of full-length utrophin results in further functional improvement (14Rafael J.A. Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), while overexpression of a truncated utrophin lacking the middle rod domain resulted in less complete recovery (15Deconinck N.

Trickett J.I. Davies K.E. Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we expected to identify a cluster of basic, spectrin-like repeats in the utrophin rod domain that would enable it to laterally bind F-actin in a manner similar to that shown for dystrophin. Surprisingly, only utrophin repeats 4 and 21 were found to be basic, with the remaining 20 repeats exhibiting calculated pI values ranging from 3.8 to 6.3 (Fig. 1). Although it has been demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of utrophin binds actin with similar characteristics to that of dystrophin (22Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this observation led us to hypothesize that utrophin may lack the rod domain actin binding activity present in dystrophin (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).To determine whether dystrophin rod domain repeats 11–17 form a more extensive lateral association than do repeats 11–14 and to determine whether utrophin's central rod domain is capable of binding F-actin, we produced recombinant proteins representing the complete cluster of basic repeats of the dystrophin rod (DYSR11–17) or the corresponding region from utrophin (UTROR11–16). By circular dichroism, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity analysis, we found that each purified recombinant protein adopted a stable, predominantly α-helical fold and existed as a highly soluble monomer over a wide range of concentrations and buffer conditions. DYSR11–17 bound F-actin with 7.3 μm affinity and 1:5 molar stoichiometry, while UTROR11–16 failed to bind actin at concentrations as high as 100 μm. We presently conclude that the entire cluster of basic repeats, spanning repeats 11–17 of the dystrophin rod domain, form a higher affinity and more extensive lateral association with F-actin than previously demonstrated with a subset of the cluster. Furthermore, the failure of the homologous, but acidic, utrophin middle rod domain to bind actin is further support for the electrostatic nature of the interaction of the basic dystrophin repeats with actin and suggests that utrophin interacts with the cytoskeleton in a manner distinct from dystrophin.RESULTSOur previous limited proteolysis and recombinant protein studies demonstrated that repeats 11–14 of the dystrophin rod domain were capable of binding actin in vitro, while repeats 7–10 lacked actin binding activity (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (Fig. 1) revealed that dystrophin repeats 11–14 were basic but that 11–17 might form more extensive lateral association with actin. Also, analysis of the dystrophin homologue utrophin (Fig. 1) indicated that its rod domain lacked the cluster of basic repeats. To further test whether basic character conferred the middle rod domain actin binding activity, we expressed and characterized recombinant proteins encoding the middle rod domain of dystrophin (DYSR11–17) and utrophin (UTROR11–16).We first characterized the hydrodynamic properties of each purified recombinant protein. By gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis (Table I), we determined the native molecular weight of each protein as well as its frictional coefficient. The measured native molecular weight of each protein was within 6% of its predicted monomeric molecular weight, therefore indicating that each protein, in addition to being highly soluble under a variety of buffer conditions, existed predominantly as a monomer in solution. These data are further support for the monomeric nature of dystrophin and the first evidence for a monomeric state of utrophin. Additionally, the frictional coefficients of DYSR11–17 (1.86) and UTROR11–16 (1.74) and Stokes' radii (5.50 and 4.75 nm, respectively) indicated that both proteins assumed an asymmetric shape consistent with their predicted rod shapes.Table IPhysical properties of rod domain fragmentsPropertiesDYSR11–17UTROR11–16No. of residues750650Predicted M r87,89973,835Native M r87,27769,966pI7.444.86α-Helical content62%68%T m55.6 °C56.5 °CStokes radius5.50 nm4.75 nmSedimentation coefficient3.70 s3.42 sFrictional coefficient1.861.74 Open table in a new tab To assess proper folding, we performed circular dichroism analysis of the two proteins and found that, based on the magnitude of ellipticity at 222 nm (26Greenfield N.

Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar) and the ratio of ellipticities at 209 and 222 nm, each possessed a high degree of α-helical content (Fig. 2 a, Table I). These findings were consistent with both predictions based on the primary structure of the dystrophin rod domain and previous experimental observations (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol.

We also analyzed the ultraviolet absorbance spectra of DYSR11–17 and UTROR11–16 and observed in each spectrum the presence of a pronounced shoulder between 288 and 290 nm (Fig. 2 B), which is a strong marker for stably folded dystrophin repeats (32Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, we determined the urea denaturation profiles of DYSR11–17 and UTROR11–16 (Fig. 3) and found that each exhibited a plateau of stability in urea concentrations as high as 1 m. Such a plateau has been demonstrated as a specific property of stably folded dystrophin rod fragments (29Kahana E. Marsh P.J. Henry A.J. Way M. Gratzer W.B. J. Mol.

Furthermore, thermal melting profiles, determined from plots of molar ellipticity at 222 nm over a wide range of temperatures, indicated that each recombinant protein had a T m of approximately 56 °C, consistent with those previously reported for stable dystrophin fragments (30Calvert R.

The results of the circular dichroism, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity analysis collectively indicate that the recombinant rod domain fragments adopted stable, helical conformations, consistent with native folds.FIG. 2A, circular dichroism spectra of recombinant rod domain fragments.

Note that both proteins exhibit a plateau of stability at urea concentrations up to 1m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We measured the F-actin binding properties of both proteins by high speed cosedimentation analysis using 5 μm F-actin and 5 μm recombinant protein and found that, while DYSR11–17 qualitatively bound F-actin, UTROR11–16 exhibited no actin binding activity (Fig. 4 A). In order to quantitatively measure the actin binding activities of the two proteins, we performed F-actin cosedimentation assays using 5 μm actin and a range of recombinant proteins from 0.5 to 100 μm. Over this wide range of concentrations, DYSR11–17 bound actin saturably, with an apparentK d of 7.3 ± 1.3 μm and a molar stoichiometry of 1:5 (B max = 0.19 ± 0.07 (Fig. 4 B). Over this wide range of concentrations, we again observed no binding activity of UTROR11–16, demonstrating that the middle rod domain of utrophin lacks the actin binding activity of dystrophin. In order to verify that actin binding by DYSR11–17 was due to electrostatic attractions, we performed F-actin cosedimentation using 5 μm actin and 5 μm DYSR11–17 in buffer containing a wide range of NaCl concentrations. We found the binding of DYSR11–17 to F-actin to be highly sensitive to increasing ionic strength, exhibiting an IC50 of 200 mm, with binding essentially abolished at 400 mm (Fig. 5). These results further support the electrostatic nature of the interaction of the dystrophin rod domain with F-actin.FIG. 4A, cosedimentation of rod domain fragments with F-actin.

Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Identification of this binding site was first made through actin binding analysis of fragments obtained by limited proteolysis of native dystrophin and confirmed with recombinant proteins designed to best represent the proteolytic rod domain fragment that retained actin binding activity (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein DYS1416, encoding rod domain repeats 11–14, was found to bind F-actin with 14 μm affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the recombinant protein DYS1030, encoding rod domain repeats 7–10, exhibited no actin binding activity at concentrations as high as 20 μm. Sequence analysis further indicated that three of the four spectrin-like repeats in DYS1416 were basic, while only one of four repeats in DYS1030 was basic, which led us to hypothesize that DYS1416 bound F-actin largely through electrostatic interactions. In support of this hypothesis, the binding of DYS1416 to F-actin was dramatically inhibited by increasing NaCl concentrations (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis, however, further indicated that the cluster of basic repeats was not limited to the portion of the rod domain represented by DYS1416 (Fig. 1). Instead, we found that two additional basic repeats were contained within the dystrophin sequence spanning repeats 11–17, suggesting that this region may form a more extensive electrostatic association with the actin filament. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the recombinant protein DYS11–17, encompassing the most contiguous cluster of basic repeats found in dystrophin, bound F-actin with approximately 2-fold higher affinity and 5-fold lower stoichiometry (Fig. 4 B) than was previously measured for DYS1416 (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). While available data indicate that a single, basic spectrin-like repeat is incapable of binding F-actin (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), our previous (1Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and present results indicate that concatenation of three or more basic spectrin-like repeats results in rod domain fragments with actin binding properties that directly correlate with the number of basic repeats present.We also expressed and characterized a recombinant protein, UTROR11–16, which represented the portion of the utrophin rod domain most similar (by sequence identity) to the basic, actin binding region of the dystrophin rod domain. Although DYS11–17 and UTROR11–16 are 41% identical (64% similar) in primary structure, the predicted pI of DYSR11–17 is 7.44, while that of UTROR11–16 is 4.86 (Fig. 1). Five of seven repeats in DYSR11–17 exhibit pIs over 7.5, while none of the six repeats in UTROR11–16 has a pI greater than 6.3 (Fig. 1). Significantly, the distribution of basic and acidic repeats in dystrophin and utrophin is conserved across all vertebrate dystrophins and utrophins in the data base, including human, mouse, dog, rat, and chicken, suggesting that any charge-specific differences between the two proteins are functionally significant. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that UTROR11–16 lacks the actin binding activity (Fig. 4,A and B) that we have consistently observed in proteolytic fragments and recombinant proteins corresponding to the basic repeat cluster of dystrophin. While we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that UTROR11–16 lacks actin binding activity because it is improperly folded, other results (Table I, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4) suggest that DYSR11–17 and UTROR11–16 exhibit grossly similar physical and structural properties. By gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis, we determined that each recombinant protein was an elongated, highly soluble monomer. Thus, like dystrophin (31Kahana E. Flood G. Gratzer W.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the middle rod domain of utrophin shows no propensity to dimerize. The Stokes radius, sedimentation, and frictional coefficients of DYSR11–17 were slightly greater than those of UTROR11–16, which is wholly consistent with its greater predicted and observed molecular weights and the fact that DYSR11–17 encodes one additional spectrin-like repeat. Furthermore, circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis revealed both proteins to be highly stable, helical structures. Thus, we conclude that the failure of UTROR11–16 to bind F-actin is due to the acidic nature of the repeats comprising this protein, which lends further support to our hypothesis that it is an excess of basic residues that confers actin binding activity to the repeats present in the dystrophin middle rod domain.While previous studies have identified functional differences between comparable domains of dystrophin and utrophin (25Guo W.X.A.

Furthermore, this is the first study to provide a structural basis for an observed functional difference between dystrophin and utrophin. We previously demonstrated that the two spatially separated actin binding sites in dystrophin enable it to form an extended, lateral association with F-actin and protect actin filaments from depolymerization in vitro (13Rybakova I.N.

In the absence of ERK2, the MKP3-catalyzed hydrolysis of simple aryl phosphates does not display any dependence on pH, viscosity, and the nature of the leaving group. Increased catalytic activity and enhanced affinity for oxyanions are observed for MKP3 in the presence of ERK2. In addition, normal bell-shaped pH dependence on the reaction catalyzed by MKP3 is restored in the presence of ERK2. Collectively, these results suggest that the rate-limiting step in the absence of ERK2 for the MKP3 reaction corresponds to a substrate-induced conformational change in MKP3 involving active site rearrangement and general acid loop closure. The binding of ERK2 to the N-terminal domain of MKP3 facilitates the repositioning of active site residues and speeds up the loop closure in MKP3 such that chemistry becomes rate-limiting in the presence of ERK2. Remarkably, it is found that the extent of ERK2-induced MKP3 activation is substrate dependent, with smaller activation observed for bulkier substrates. Unlike simple aryl phosphates, the MKP3-catalyzed hydrolysis of bulky polycyclic substrates exhibits bell-shaped pH rate profiles in the absence of ERK2. Furthermore, it is found that glycerol can also activate the MKP3-catalyzed reaction, increase the affinity of MKP3 for oxyanion, and restore the bell-shaped pH rate profile for the MKP3-catalyzed reaction. Thus, the rate of repositioning of catalytic groups and the reorienting of the electrostatic environment in the MKP3 active site can be enhanced not only by ERK2 but also by high affinity substrates or by glycerol."

Spontaneous 5-HT1A receptor activity was partially attenuated by 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists with anxiolytic activity (e.g. buspirone and flesinoxan) but was not altered by full agonists or antagonists.

The Thr-149 → Ala mutation in the second intracellular domain of the 5-HT1A receptor disrupted Gβγ-selective activation of ACII. Spontaneous 5-HT1A receptor activity was partially attenuated by 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists with anxiolytic activity (e.g. buspirone and flesinoxan) but was not altered by full agonists or antagonists. Thus, anxiolytic activity may involve inhibition of spontaneous 5-HT1A receptor activity. pertussis toxin adenylyl cyclase G protein alpha subunit carboxyl-terminal fragment of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 8-hydroxy-(2-(N,N-di-propylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene human embryonic kidney cells prostaglandin E1 protein kinase C serotonin 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate i3, second (third) intracellular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate The 5-HT1A receptor functions as an inhibitory somatodendritic autoreceptor on serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei and as a post-synaptic receptor in a variety of serotonergic targets (1Blier P. de Montigny C.

The antidepressant action of these compounds appears to involve both agonist-mediated down-regulation of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and activation of the post-synaptic receptors (that are resistant to desensitization) to result in enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. By contrast, the anxiolytic actions of 5-HT1A partial agonists may involve inhibition of serotonergic activity by enhancing autoreceptor activation and reducing post-synaptic receptor action. Homozygous null 5-HT1A receptor mutant mice display enhanced serotonin release and anxiety-associated behaviors (8Parks C.L. Robinson P.S. Sibille E. Shenk T. Toth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 5-HT1A receptor mediates inhibitory signaling by coupling to pertussis toxin-sensitive (PTX-sensitive)1 G proteins (Gi and Go) to mediate a variety of intracellular changes including inhibition of cAMP accumulation, activation of potassium channels, and inactivation of calcium channels (2Peroutka S.J.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1816-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Activation of the Gi-coupled 5-HT1A or GABA-B receptors potentiated the electrophysiological actions of the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor in hippocampal CA1 neurons (14Andrade R. Neuron. 1993; 10: 83-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ACII protein has been localized to the dendrites and cell bodies of neurons of the hippocampus (15Baker L.P. Nielson M.D. Impey S. Hacker B.M. Poser S.W. Chan M.Y.M. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This subtype of adenylyl cyclase is known to be conditionally stimulated by Gβγ subunits derived from activation of Gi/Goproteins (16Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 17Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor may couple to, or potentiate Gs-mediated actions in the central nervous system by activation of Gβγ-regulated adenylyl cyclases like ACII. Recently, we have shown that modulation of G protein subunits by expression of antisense Gαi1 subunit cDNA can switch inhibitory coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to mediate a PTX-sensitive stimulation of cAMP in GH4 pituitary cells, which express ACII endogenously (18Liu Y.F.

We hypothesized that in Gαi1-depleted GH4 cells, the 5-HT1A receptor may activate ACII via release of Gβγ subunits derived from other Gi/Go proteins. Using a cotransfection approach, we have identified a specific requirement for ACII in coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to enhance AC activity. Furthermore, cotransfection of 5-HT1A receptor, ACII, and Gαi2 specifically, resulted in an agonist-independent increase in cAMP that was not inhibited by receptor antagonists. Interestingly, 5-HT1A partial agonists but not full agonists or antagonists inhibited spontaneous coupling of the receptor to stimulate cAMP accumulation. Thus, part of the anti-anxiety activity of 5-HT1A ligands may be to silence the spontaneous activity of the 5-HT1A receptor. All chemicals were reagent grade. PTX was from Sigma, St. Louis.

Rabbit anti-rat Gαo and anti-rat Gαicommon polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Gαi2 polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM medium (4.5 mg/l d-glucose) + 8% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The 1.9-kilobaseBamHI/XbaI fragment of the rat 5-HT1A receptor or receptor mutants was subcloned intoBamHI/XbaI-cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate p3-DBX or mutants and the rat Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, GαoA, and ACII cDNAs were ligated into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The opossum βCT construct was cloned as described previously (21Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M.C. Albert P.R. J. Biol.

For transfection, HEK-293 cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and incubated overnight. Calcium phosphate precipitate (2 ml/dish) containing p3-ACII, 12 μg; p3-DBX, 12 μg; pCMV-βGAL, 6 μg; or p3-Gi/Go, 15 μg or as indicated, was overlaid with 8 ml/dish DMEM + 8% fetal calf serum, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), and incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h in 5% CO2. The calcium phosphate was aspirated and replaced with 8 ml/dish DMEM + 8% fetal calf serum, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) for incubation overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then plated onto 6-well plates for cAMP and β-galactosidase assays. 24 h after plating cells in 6-well dishes, the cells were rinsed with DMEM and incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml/well DMEM, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15–20 min. Experimental compounds were added to triplicate wells as indicated. Media were recovered and centrifuged at 13,000 × g (30 s) to remove floating cells, and the supernatant was recovered and stored at −20 °C. Attached cells were extracted using reporter lysis buffer (Promega), centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and stored at −20 °C. Media were assayed for cAMP by specific RIA, as described previously. Cell extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity to monitor transfection efficiency. Statistical analyses of the data were done using the GraphPad Prism software, and groups were compared using unpaired t test with Welsh's correction to determine significance (p < 0.05). The transfected cells were rinsed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, scraped, frozen, and thawed to complete cell lysis. The lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 20 s), and the supernatant was recovered for measurement of β-galactosidase activity. Equal volumes (30 μl each) of cell extract and 0.3 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside substrate in 15 mm Tris (pH 8.8) were mixed gently, incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated upon addition of 50 μl of Stop solution (300 mm glycine, 15 mm EDTA (pH 11.2)). The sample was transferred to 2 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and fluorescence was measured at λEX = 350 nm, λEM = 450 nm on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrofluorometer (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The variation of β-galactosidase activity between wells observed within a transfection was <6%, and between transfections was <7%. Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min and rinsed 2–3 times with PBS and stained overnight using the X-galactosidase solution (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml Xgal in PBS) in a humidified container at 37 °C. The proportion of stained cells was quantitated from representative photographic frames (2 photos/well). The transfection efficiency attained was 36.5 ± 5.4% (mean ± S.E.), and the variation in transfection efficiency between different transfections was 7.5% by this method. Cells (107/10-cm plate) were harvested and resuspended in 200 μl of RIPA-L buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice. The cell lysate was sheared through a 25-gauge needle, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was recovered, stored at −80 °C, and assayed for protein content by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates (20–50 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on sodium lauryl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gels at 100 V, 40 mA for 1 h, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1 h at 250 mA. Blots were incubated overnight in 5% casein in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibody, followed by 30-min incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, and the peroxidase product was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence for Western blot protocol. Membranes were prepared from cotransfected HEK-293 cells as described (23Lembo P.M. Ghahremani M.H. Morris S.J. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and stored as pellets at −80 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in TME (75 mmTris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA), aliquotted (100 μg in 50 μl) in tubes containing 200 μl of TME and [3H]DPAT (20 nm) or [3H]5-HT (50 nm) and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The binding reaction was applied to Whatman GF/C filters under vacuum and rinsed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The filters were placed in 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima-Gold, Packard) and counted for 2 min using the direct-disintegrations/min program of the Tricarb TR2100 counter (Packard). 5-HT (10 μm) was used to define nonspecific binding. The 5-HT1A receptor couples to inhibition of cAMP accumulation in most cell types. Inhibition of cAMP formation by 5-HT1A receptor activation was examined in HEK-293 cells transiently cotransfected with the Gs-coupled dopamine-D1 receptor (20Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the 5-HT1A receptor (Fig. 1). In three experiments, dopamine induced a 7.6 ± 0.9-fold increase in cAMP level that was inhibited by 49 ± 3% upon activation of 5-HT1A receptors with DPAT. DPAT-mediated inhibition of dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation was reversed by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiperone. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor is coupled to inhibition of Gs-mediated cAMP accumulation in HEK-293 cells. We addressed whether the 5-HT1A receptor was coupled to enhancement of cAMP levels upon cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding ACII (Fig. 2). In HEK-293 cells transfected transiently with the rat 5-HT1A receptor cDNA alone (Fig. 2 A, first lane), addition of the selective 5-HT1A agonist DPAT (1 μm) inhibited basal cAMP accumulation by 40%, as observed in other cell lines (24Albert P.R. Zhou Q.Y. Van Tol H.H. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5825-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in cells cotransfected with 5-HT1A receptor and ACII cDNAs, DPAT induced a 1.5-fold increase in cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2 A,second lane; Table I), which was blocked by pretreatment with 50 ng/ml PTX (data not shown). DPAT had no effect in non-transfected cells or cells transfected with ACII alone. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor couples to endogenous G proteins to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity upon cotransfection with ACII, as observed for other Gi-coupled receptor subtypes (16Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,25Chan J.S. Chiu T.T. Wong Y.H. J.

Allen R.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 835-841PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-HT1A receptor may also weakly activate Gαs, because activation of ACII requires both Gβγ release from Gi and minimal Gαs activity (17Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). However in the absence of transfected ACII, DPAT-induced inhibition of basal cAMP is observed (Table I) indicating that the 5-HT1A receptor couples via Gαi to inhibit the activity of endogenous AC subtypes in HEK-293 cells.Table IG protein selectivity for 5-HT1A receptor constitutive activityTransfectionLevel of cAMPBasal+ DPAT(% Gαi2level)(% basal)Control16 ± 5 (5)149 ± 14* (3)Gαo31 ± 9 (6)69 ± 6** (3)Gαi121 ± 5 (5)83 ± 30 (3)Gαi2100 *** (6)98 ± 10 (4)Gαi336 ± 14 (5)142 ± 32 (3) Open table in a new tab Upon cotransfection of 5-HT1A receptor, Gαi2, and ACII cDNAs, a pronounced agonist-independent increase in cAMP level was observed that was not altered by addition of the agonist, DPAT (Fig. 2 A, Table I). Although constitutive activity of the 5-HT1A receptor/G protein complex has been indirectly suggested by the spontaneous binding of GTPγS in membranes from cells transfected with 5-HT1A receptors (28Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 29Newman-Tancredi A. Conte C. Chaput C. Spedding M. Millan M.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Newman-Tancredi A. Conte C. Chaput C. Verriele L. Millan M.J. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the present results provide the first direct evidence of agonist-independent coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor in the absence of GTPγS. Constitutive enhancement of basal cAMP levels required cotransfection of 5-HT1A receptor, Gαi2, as well as of ACII cDNA (Fig. 2) and was blocked by >80% following pretreatment with 50 ng/ml PTX (Fig. 2 B), further indicating the participation of Gi/Go proteins. By contrast, little increase in cAMP was observed upon cotransfection with Gαo. The G protein specificity of agonist-independent stimulation of cAMP levels by the 5-HT1A receptor was examined further by co-transfecting equal amounts of 5-HT1A receptor, ACII, and either Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, or Gαo cDNAs in HEK-293 cells (Table I). Cotransfection of receptor and ACII with Gαi2, but not Gαi3, Gαi1, or Gαo, resulted in a 6-fold increase in basal cAMP levels compared with cells transfected with receptor and ACII (16%versus 100%). In multiple experiments, the rank order of G protein preference (Gi2 > Gi3, Go, Gi1) is similar to that identified for G protein interaction with the bacterially expressed 5-HT1A receptor protein (31Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Breyer R.M. Schutz W. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8200-8206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the extent of constitutive activation of the 5-HT1A receptor appears to reflect the extent of coupling between receptor and G protein and is most dependent on the G protein subtype Gi2. Addition of the full agonist DPAT resulted in a small increase in cAMP level in cells not transfected with exogenous G proteins (Control, Table I), as observed above. DPAT induced no change or a small decrease in cAMP levels in cells cotransfected with Gαi1 or Gαi2. In contrast, DPAT inhibited cAMP levels by 30% in cells transfected with Gαo (Table I), suggesting that this G protein mediates inhibitory receptor coupling in cells transfected with ACII. A slight DPAT-induced increase in cAMP level was observed with Gαi3 but did not achieve significance. Thus, the spontaneous activity of the 5-HT1A receptor was specific for the presence of Gαi2 and was insensitive to the full agonist DPAT. The relative inactivity of Gαo (or Gαi1, Gαi3) to mediate constitutive coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor could be because of inefficient expression of the receptor, ACII, or the G protein upon cotransfection in HEK-293 cells. The level of 5-HT1A receptors expressed in Go- and Gi2-transfected cells was not significantly different as detected by specific binding of [3H]DPAT (Table II). Because the ACII subtype is regulated by activation of PKC, functional expression of ACII was detected indirectly by measuring the change in cAMP level induced by the PKC activator, TPA. In non-transfected HEK-293 cells, no response to TPA was observed, consistent with a lack of ACII immunoreactivity observed in these cells (15Baker L.P. Nielson M.D. Impey S. Hacker B.M. Poser S.W. Chan M.Y.M. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells cotransfected with plasmids for 5-HT1A receptor, ACII and either Gαo or Gαi2, a strong response to TPA (5- to 6-fold) was detected that did not differ between Gαo or Gαi2 (Table II). This result suggests that robust and equivalent expression of ACII was obtained in both transfections.Table IIContent of 5-HT1A receptor and ACII in cotransfected HEK-293 cellsTransfectionContent5-HT1A receptorACIISpecific bindingTPA-induced cAMPfmol/mg-fold basalGαo140 ± 176.0 ± 0.6Gαi2182 ± 114.9 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Although transfection efficiencies were equivalent for each G protein tested (35%, see “Experimental Procedures”), it remained possible that the inactivity of Gαo to mediate constitutive activation of the 5-HT1A receptor was because of a lack of expression of Go protein. The level of G protein expression was assessed directly by Western blot analysis of membranes from Gαo- or Gαi2-transfected cells (Fig. 3). In two independent transfections, protein extracts from non-transfected HEK-293 cells displayed an undetectable level of Gαo immunostaining, whereas samples from cells transfected with Gαo cDNA expression plasmid displayed robust expression of Gαo that was proportional to the amount of protein/well (Fig. 3). By contrast, endogenous Gαi proteins were detected in both non-transfected and transfected cells. In cells transfected with p3-Gαi2, a 4.8 ± 0.75-fold (n = 4) increase in Gi2 protein level relative to control was observed. A smaller 2.0 ± 0.2-fold control increase was detected in Gαi2-transfected cells using the less selective anti-Gi-common antibody which also detected endogenous Gi proteins in non-transfected cells. In summary, there was an equivalent induction of Gαo and Gαi2proteins upon separate cotransfection with 5-HT1A receptor and ACII plasmids. Thus, the inactivity of Gαo to mediate constitutive coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to ACII was not because of inefficient expression of the Gαo protein, 5-HT1A receptor, or ACII. The concentration dependence of p3-Gαi2 cDNA for 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activation of ACII and inhibition of PGE1-stimulated cAMP levels was examined in parallel (Fig. 4). Upon cotransfection with 5-HT1A receptor and ACII plasmids, the p3-Gαi2 plasmid induced a concentration-dependent enhancement of cAMP levels, with an EC50 value of 1.7 μg of Gαi2 cDNA (Fig. 4 A). The response appeared to saturate at a DNA concentration that was approximately equimolar for 5-HT1A receptor, G protein, and ACII plasmid (i.e. approximately 15 μg). For comparison, the concentration dependence of Gi2 cDNA for 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibition cAMP levels was examined. PGE1 induced a 3-fold increase in cAMP above the constitutive level of cAMP in HEK-293 cells transfected with 5-HT1A, ACII, and Gαi2(Fig. 4 B). Increasing amounts of Gαi2inhibited PGE1-mediated enhancement of cAMP levels only at the highest plasmid concentration (50 μg). Thus, the requirement for Gαi2 cDNA was ten-fold greater for agonist-independent inhibition of PGE1-stimulated cAMP than for activation of ACII by the 5-HT1A receptor. The concentration dependence on Gαi2 cDNA suggests that the extent of constitutive activation of the 5-HT1A receptor depends on the content of Gi2 and on the signaling pathway (i.e., stimulation versus inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) examined. To identify the receptor domain implicated in constitutive activation of ACII by the 5-HT1A receptor, we utilized a point mutant (5-HT1A-i2, Fig. 5) in the second intracellular loop (T149A) of the 5-HT1A receptor that couples to Gαi-mediated inhibition of cAMP, but not to various Gβγ-mediated pathways such as activation of PLCβ2 or inactivation of calcium channels (23Lembo P.M. Ghahremani M.H. Morris S.J. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 5-HT1A-i3 is a receptor mutant with three point mutations that retains coupling to PLC-mediated calcium mobilization (32Lembo P.M. Albert P.R. Mol.

By contrast, the 5-HT1A-i3 mutant displayed agonist-independent enhancement of cAMP levels similar to the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor (Fig. 5). The levels of receptor expressed were similar for each clone although the value for the 5-HT1A-i2 clone was slightly lower; this may reflect the lower affinity of this mutant for [3H]DPAT (23Lembo P.M. Ghahremani M.H. Morris S.J. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the second intracellular domain of the 5-HT1A receptor appears to dictate coupling to Gβγ subunits resulting in activation of ACII, as well as other Gβγ-regulated effectors (33Albert P.R. Morris S.J. Ghahremani M.H. Storring J.M. Lembo P.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because the 5-HT1B receptor is structurally homologous to the 5-HT1A receptors, we tested whether this receptor subtype mediated agonist-independent activity (Fig. 5). Upon cotransfection with ACII and Gαi2, the 5-HT1B receptor mediated a 5-fold increase in cAMP levels that was inhibited by PTX. The smaller effect of the 5-HT1B receptor may reflect a lower constitutive activity compared with the 5-HT1A receptor because the levels of receptor expressed were similar. Other receptor subtypes like the dopamine-D1 (Gscoupled) or the dopamine-D2S (Gi/Go-coupled) did not increase cAMP in the absence of agonist (data not shown). Previous studies have indicated that the dopamine-D2S receptor does not couple to Gs in the presence of ACII (16Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation of ACII by 5-HT1A receptors does not result from basal activation of Gs by other receptors endogenous to HEK-293 cells. This supports the hypothesis that the 5-HT1A receptor does couple to Gs (weakly) in the HEK-293 cells, despite the inability to detect biochemically an interaction between the receptor and Gs (28Barr A.J.

Although 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors inhibit cAMP synthesis in most tissues and cell lines, these results indicate that, in cells where ACII is predominant, these receptors spontaneously couple to stimulate cAMP accumulation. The activity of a variety of ligands and protein inhibitors to modulate 5-HT1A receptor coupling to Gi2 and ACII was examined and compared with the action of PTX, which entirely uncouples the receptor (Fig. 6). Because ACII is conditionally activated by Gβγ subunits from Gi/Go proteins (17Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), the importance of Gβγ subunits was examined by cotransfection of an equal amount of expression plasmid containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 (βCT), a Gβγ antagonist (37Koch W.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). βCT inhibited spontaneous coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor with maximal inhibition equivalent to that achieved with PTX. This suggests that the 5-HT1A receptor couples spontaneously to the Gi2 heterotrimer to release Gβγ subunits, resulting in a βCT-sensitive activation of ACII. Transfection of Gαi2 apparently augments the activity of endogenous Gβγ subunits to couple to ACII in the presence of the 5-HT1A receptor, presumably by increasing the level of Gi2heterotrimer. Co-regulation of Gα and Gβγ subunit protein levels has been observed in Gαi2 nullizygous mice that are depleted of Gαi2 and specific Gβγ subunits (39Rudolph U. Spicher K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3209-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activity of 5-HT1A agonists and antagonists was tested in cells transfected with 5-HT1A receptor, Gi2, and ACII (Fig. 6). Ligands for the 5-HT1A receptor have been previously characterized as full or partial agonists or neutral antagonists (40Schoeffter P. Bobirnac I. Boddeke E. Hoyer D. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Fletcher A. Cliffe I.A. Dourish C.T. Trends Pharmacol.

Sci. 1994; 15: 220-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 4Mongeau R. Blier P. de Montigny C. Brain Res.

Neuropsychopharmacology. 1996; 14: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Full agonists (e.g., DPAT, 5-HT) and antagonists (spiperone, (+)WAY100,135, NAN-190, pindolol) lacked or had minimal inhibitory activity compared with control. Lack of inhibition by antagonists suggests that Gi2-dependent constitutive activation of 5-HT1A receptor is indeed agonist-independent and not mediated by endogenous 5-HT. Spiperone has been characterized as an inverse agonist that induces a small (30%) decrease in 5-HT1A receptor-induced GTPγS binding to Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes (29Newman-Tancredi A. Conte C. Chaput C. Spedding M. Millan M.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of spiperone or (+)WAY100,135 to inhibit spontaneous coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor was not due to their inactivity in the HEK cells because both spiperone (Fig. 1) and (+)WAY100,135 (data not shown) blocked 5-HT1A-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation. Determination of inverse agonism in membrane preparations in the presence of the high affinity G protein ligand GTPγS may not reflect modulation of receptor-G protein coupling to specific effectors in intact cells which contain GTP/GDP. The lack of inverse agonist activity of spiperone in coupling to Gi2/ACII suggests that as observed for agonists, inverse agonists may show greater efficacy for some effectors but not others (47Leff P. Scaramellini C. Law C. McKechnie K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 355-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 48Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol.

Sci. 1997; 18: 416-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Depending on the effector studied, agonists of the 5-HT1A receptor can have different efficacies of coupling. A “tight” coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to inhibition of cAMP is observed, and all agonists mediate some response; however, for calcium mobilization or pH change, a “loose” coupling is apparent in which some agonists are ineffective (40Schoeffter P. Bobirnac I. Boddeke E. Hoyer D. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 50Dunlop J. Zhang Y. Smith D.L. Schechter L.E. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1998; 40: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on our results, spiperone induced a conformation of the 5-HT1A receptor that permits coupling to Gi2/ACII but inhibits Gαi-mediated inhibition of Gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. The partial agonists buspirone, BMY-7378, and especially flesinoxan, all demonstrated inhibitory activity, which was maximal at 1 or 10 μm. By comparison, pretreatment with PTX or cotransfection with βCT induced a greater reduction in cAMP levels, reflecting a more complete uncoupling of the receptor by these agents. The partial agonism of these ligands to incompletely stimulate the inactive 5-HT1A receptor, and to inhibit partially the constitutively active receptor, suggests that the partial agonists promote an incompletely active conformation of the 5-HT1A receptor upon binding to the receptor. Furthermore, there appears to be a correlation between the clinical effectiveness of these compounds as anti-anxiety drugs and their ability to reduce coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to ACII. It has been proposed that anxiety results in part from a hyperactivity of the serotonin system and that anxiolytic 5-HT1A partial agonists inhibit serotonergic neurotransmission by activating the presynaptic autoreceptor (51Olivier B. Soudijn W. van Wijngaarden I. Prog. Drug Res. 1999; 52: 103-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); hence the knockout mice that lack 5-HT1A receptors display both serotonergic hyperactivity and anxiety-related behavior (8Parks C.L.

Our results suggest that in addition to partial activation of the presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptor to inhibit raphe firing, anti-anxiety agents may also inhibit constitutive, as well as 5-HT-induced activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. It is tempting to speculate that 5-HT1A receptor ligands that inhibit constitutive receptor activity may have potentially greater therapeutic efficacy as anti-anxiety or antidepressant agents than ligands that lack this activity. The cotransfection paradigm presented here for detecting inhibitory activity at the 5-HT1A receptor may provide an effective screening method for identifying anti-anxiety agents. In summary, we have identified stimulatory coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to adenylyl cyclase in the presence of ACII that becomes agonist-independent upon co-transfection with Gαi2. Coupling to ACII required mobilization of Gβγ subunits and was mediated by a putative Gβγ coupling domain in the i2 loop of the 5-HT1A receptor. Partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists that have anti-anxiety properties inhibited spontaneous receptor coupling to ACII, whereas full agonists or antagonists lacked this activity; thus, inhibition of constitutive 5-HT1A receptor activity may contribute to the therapeutic actions of these compounds.

In the case of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), the bottleneck in its activation appears to be addition of the second phosphoryl group to AZT-monophosphate (AZT-MP) by thymidylate kinase (TmpK) (1Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier work suggested that a specific and unique feature of the highly homologous yeast and human TmpKs (Fig. 1) is responsible for the low efficiency of these enzymes in phosphorylating AZT-MP. This is the fact that an arginine at positionX 3 of the P-loop (the GX 1 X 2 X 3 X 4GKS(T) motif involved in fixing the α- and β-phosphates of ATP (3Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1738) Google Scholar)) appears to play an important catalytic role but is mispositioned because of steric hindrance between the azido group of AZT-MP and the preceding carboxylic acid side chain of Asp-14 (positionX 2) (4Lavie A. Schlichting I. Vetter I.R. Konrad M. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 922-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Lavie A. Vetter I.R. Konrad M. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A catalytic role was assigned to Arg-15 of yeast TmpK based on the observations that in the structure with the bisubstrate inhibitor P1-(5′-adenosyl)-P5-(5′-thymidyl)pentaphosphate (TP5A) this residue interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP moiety and that its mutation to glycine results in a 200-fold decrease of phosphorylation activity with the natural substrate, dTMP (Table I). Interestingly, TmpK from E. coli has no arginine in its P-loop motif but rather several arginine residues in its lid region, a flexible stretch of amino acids that in adenylate kinase becomes ordered upon ATP binding (6Schulz G.E. Mueller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One or more of these arginines inE. coli TmpK were predicted to assume the catalytic role assigned to the P-loop arginine of the yeast enzyme. Therefore, we anticipated that the bacterial TmpK would be less affected by the presence of the azido group in AZT-MP, and this prediction proved to be correct (7Lavie A. Konrad M. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3677-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme suggested that the role of Arg-15 in the yeast enzyme is taken over by Arg-153 from the lid region (8Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe rationale of our initial design of a yeast TmpK variant with enhanced AZT-MP activity was to prevent the azido group-induced P-loop displacement by mutating Asp-14 to a smaller amino acid. However, all Asp-14 mutant proteins were catalytically inactive (see Table I). Therefore, we decided to pursue a new approach that entailed the modification of the yeast enzyme to mimic the E. coli TmpK, thus, hopefully, alleviating the detrimental effect of the P-loop mispositioning by providing catalytic residues from the lid region. The chosen strategy was to avoid the steric clash between the introduced arginines in the lid region with the P-loop arginine by first mutating Arg-15 to glycine. The R15G mutation results in a 200-fold reduced k obs for dTMP but attempts to recover activity by systematically mutating lid residues (residues 142–146) to arginines did not increase the dTMP activity appreciably (AZT-MP activity was not detectable). On close structural comparison between the lid regions of the yeast and E. coli TmpKs (8Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Konrad M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we noticed that the lid region of E. coli TmpK is one residue longer, and that the most promising position for the introduced arginine (such that it could potentially interact with the γ-phosphate group of ATP) corresponds to the position of Phe-146. However, the attempt to incorporate this information, by the simultaneous mutation of Phe-146 to arginine and the insertion of an alanine residue prior to it, also failed to recover activity with either dTMP or AZT-MP.The exact positioning required by the catalytic residues, which was probably not achieved in our initial efforts of simple modifications of the yeast lid region, prompted the replacement of the entire yeast lid region (residues 131–149) by that of the E. coli lid (residues 138–157) (Fig. 2). The variant that retains the P-loop arginine exhibits only 4% of wild type activity with dTMP, with no improvement in AZT-MP phosphorylation. However, the variant that in addition to the replaced lid has the P-loop Arg-15 exchanged by a glycine recovers 25% of wild type activity and, most encouragingly, results in a 400% increase of the AZT-MP phosphorylation rate. This result suggests that the presence of arginines in both P-loop and lid leads to steric interference but that the loss of activity caused by removal of Arg-15 can be partially restored by an arginine in the lid region. In summary, we have created a mutant of yeast TmpK that phosphorylates AZT-MP four times more efficiently than wild type, and at the same time the ratio between thek obs for dTMP and AZT-MP is improved 16-fold.FIG. 2Arginines that may interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP originate from the P-loop in the case of the human and yeast enzymes but from the lid region in the case of the E. coli TmpK . The figure shows an overlay of the yeast TmpK (7Lavie A. Konrad M. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3677-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (green) and E. coli TmpK ( 8) (red) structures, both determined in the presence of the bisubstrate inhibitor TP5A. The spatial position of the guanidinium group of Arg-15 of the yeast TmpK and that of Arg-153 ofE. coli TmpK are nearly identical, enabling similar interactions with the third phosphate (two conformations were observed for the middle phosphate in the E. coli-TP5A complex structure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For the long term aim of gene therapeutic potentiation of AZT effectiveness, there would be significant advantages from the use of a modified human enzyme. We therefore extended the mutational studies to the human enzyme (Table II). Here, too, mutation of the P-loop carboxylic acid (Asp-15) completely inactivates the enzyme. Contrary to all expectations arising from the studies on the yeast enzyme, replacement of Arg-16 (equivalent to Arg-15 in the yeast enzyme) does not lead to a loss in catalytic activity. At present, we have no experimentally based explanation for this observation. However, it is possible that it is related to the fact that k obs for the human enzyme is much lower than for the yeast enzyme (0.7 versus 35 s−1), which is already very slow when compared with other nucleoside monophosphate kinases (e.g. 570 s−1 for human adenylate kinase (12Ayabe T.

Because the catalytic machinery in both enzymes appears to be identical, as shown by sequence comparison and three-dimensional structural determination, 2A. Lavie, R. Brundiers, T. Veit, J. Reinstein, I. Schlichting, N. Ostermann, R. S. Goody, and M. Konrad, manuscript in preparation. we speculate that it is possible that the chemical step (i.e. phosphoryl transfer) is not rate-limiting, but rather another step such as product release; so that slowing a relatively rapid chemical step, by removing the P-loop arginine, might not have any influence on the overall rate.Table IISteady state kinetics of human TmpK mutantsk obsfor dTMPk obs for AZT-MPRatiok obs for dTMP/k obs for AZT-MPRatio k obs mutant/WT for AZT-MPs −1s −1WT0.730.012611D15X (Ala, Asn, Glu)<0.001<0.001R16G1.0<0.01WT + E. coli small lidaResidues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.150.003500.25WT + E. colilarge lidbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.170.002850.17R16G + E. coli small lidaResidues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.70.223.218R16G +E. coli large lidbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.1.52.140.7178F105Y0.170.250.721R16G + E. colilarge LIDbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK. + F105Y0.330.600.5550a Residues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.b Residues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK. Open table in a new tab More in keeping with expectations arising from the yeast TmpK data was the fact that introduction of the E. coli lid region without removing Arg-16 leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. Most dramatically, the combination of the E. coli lid with the replacement of Arg-16 by glycine not only restores full wild type catalytic activity, but it results in a protein that is more efficient with AZT-MP than with dTMP (for the E. coli large lid variant, see Table II). The increase in activity with AZT-MP is approximately 200-fold over wild type. This mutant thus has properties that are highly attractive for improving the potency of AZT, because the efficiency of AZT-MP phosphorylation is improved dramatically with only a minor increase in dTMP phosphorylation activity. The latter is an important aspect, because AZTTP must compete with dTTP for HIV reverse transcriptase-catalyzed addition to the end of a growing viral DNA chain.Interestingly, an increase of AZT-MP phosphorylation with a concomitant reduced activity for dTMP is achieved by the F105Y mutant (Table II). The rationale for constructing this mutant was that in the yeast enzyme, the corresponding residue (at position 102) is a tyrosine, and its hydroxyl group interacts with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-14, which (like Asp-15 in the human enzyme) appears to be an essential residue for the catalytic mechanism. In the hope for synergy, we combined our lid modification with the F105Y point mutation (i.e. R16G + E. coli large LID + F105Y), and in fact, this variant shows the best catalytic ratio of AZT-MP to dTMP.The mutants of TmpK described so far, showing altered specificity for AZT-MP and dTMP, were produced according to rational considerations based on comparative structure-function studies of TmpK from three different sources. Despite certain gaps in our understanding of the mechanistic features of TmpK (e.g. the role of Arg-16 in the human enzyme), mutants have been obtained that have almost ideal properties for enzymes that potentiate the action of AZT, and these are presently being tested in appropriate cell culture experiments. Further unraveling of the details of the mechanism of human TmpK may lead to the design and construction of mutants that have an even more pronounced reversal of specificity, i.e. that can phosphorylate AZT-MP but not dTMP. Earlier attempts to improve the inhibitory effect of AZT on HIV replication (13Guettari N. Loubiere L. Brisson E. Klatzmann D. Virology. 1997; 235: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), by transfecting human cells with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (which is several orders of magnitude slower in AZT-MP phosphorylation than our best human TmpK variant), have been partially successful, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.Our goal of designing mutants of human TmpK with improved AZT-MP-phosphorylating properties has been criticized on several grounds (14Balzarini J. Degreve B. de Clercq E. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One of these is that knowledge of the structure of the homologous but not identical yeast enzyme would not be enough to design mutants of the human enzyme with the desired properties. Although this is a well founded cautionary note in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the present work shows that incorporation of knowledge gained from E. coli TmpK, which can phosphorylate AZT-MP readily, has indeed allowed our aim to be achieved at the level of enzyme activity, as predicted by Lavie et al. (7Lavie A. Konrad M. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3677-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Konrad M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that a similar undertaking with the thymidine/thymidylate kinase from herpes simplex, in which DNA family shuffling was used to generate enzymes capable of phosphorylating AZT more efficiently than the wild type protein, were considerably less successful than the work presented here in achieving the desired improvement (15Christians F.C. Scapozza L. Crameri A. Folkers G. Stemmer W.P.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Another potential area of application of nucleoside analogs is that of cancer chemotherapy (reviewed in Ref. 16Moolten F.L. Cancer Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 279-287PubMed Google Scholar). The approach adopted here is to use an analog that is not phosphorylated by cellular kinases and to combine this with transfection with herpes simplex thymidine kinase, which is less specific in its requirements concerning substrate structure. Promising results have been obtained in cell culture experiments with the combination of transformation with herpes simplex thymidine kinase and the open chain guanosine analog ganciclovir. With the help of the viral kinase, the analog is phosphorylated to its highly cytotoxic triphosphate. However, ganciclovir is actually a very poor substrate for herpes simplex thymidine kinase, and its use may limit the effectiveness of this approach. The results reported here suggest that a better strategy might be to generate and use mutants of the appropriate human kinases for the activation of such potentially cytotoxic prodrugs. This would have the advantage, presumably, of lower immunogenicity and, judging by the results of mutation of human Tmpk, potentially higher activity. One of the main reasons for the less than optimal properties of nucleoside prodrugs in the treatment of HIV1 infection is their poor phosphorylation to the active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes. In the case of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), the bottleneck in its activation appears to be addition of the second phosphoryl group to AZT-monophosphate (AZT-MP) by thymidylate kinase (TmpK) (1Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier work suggested that a specific and unique feature of the highly homologous yeast and human TmpKs (Fig. 1) is responsible for the low efficiency of these enzymes in phosphorylating AZT-MP. This is the fact that an arginine at positionX 3 of the P-loop (the GX 1 X 2 X 3 X 4GKS(T) motif involved in fixing the α- and β-phosphates of ATP (3Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1738) Google Scholar)) appears to play an important catalytic role but is mispositioned because of steric hindrance between the azido group of AZT-MP and the preceding carboxylic acid side chain of Asp-14 (positionX 2) (4Lavie A. Schlichting I. Vetter I.R. Konrad M. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 922-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Lavie A. Vetter I.R. Konrad M. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A catalytic role was assigned to Arg-15 of yeast TmpK based on the observations that in the structure with the bisubstrate inhibitor P1-(5′-adenosyl)-P5-(5′-thymidyl)pentaphosphate (TP5A) this residue interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP moiety and that its mutation to glycine results in a 200-fold decrease of phosphorylation activity with the natural substrate, dTMP (Table I). Interestingly, TmpK from E. coli has no arginine in its P-loop motif but rather several arginine residues in its lid region, a flexible stretch of amino acids that in adenylate kinase becomes ordered upon ATP binding (6Schulz G.E. Mueller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One or more of these arginines inE. coli TmpK were predicted to assume the catalytic role assigned to the P-loop arginine of the yeast enzyme. Therefore, we anticipated that the bacterial TmpK would be less affected by the presence of the azido group in AZT-MP, and this prediction proved to be correct (7Lavie A. Konrad M. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3677-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme suggested that the role of Arg-15 in the yeast enzyme is taken over by Arg-153 from the lid region (8Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Konrad M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using this knowledge we have engineered yeast and human TmpKs to obtain enzymes that have dramatically improved AZT-MP phosphorylation properties. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe rationale of our initial design of a yeast TmpK variant with enhanced AZT-MP activity was to prevent the azido group-induced P-loop displacement by mutating Asp-14 to a smaller amino acid. However, all Asp-14 mutant proteins were catalytically inactive (see Table I). Therefore, we decided to pursue a new approach that entailed the modification of the yeast enzyme to mimic the E. coli TmpK, thus, hopefully, alleviating the detrimental effect of the P-loop mispositioning by providing catalytic residues from the lid region. The chosen strategy was to avoid the steric clash between the introduced arginines in the lid region with the P-loop arginine by first mutating Arg-15 to glycine. The R15G mutation results in a 200-fold reduced k obs for dTMP but attempts to recover activity by systematically mutating lid residues (residues 142–146) to arginines did not increase the dTMP activity appreciably (AZT-MP activity was not detectable). On close structural comparison between the lid regions of the yeast and E. coli TmpKs (8Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Konrad M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we noticed that the lid region of E. coli TmpK is one residue longer, and that the most promising position for the introduced arginine (such that it could potentially interact with the γ-phosphate group of ATP) corresponds to the position of Phe-146. However, the attempt to incorporate this information, by the simultaneous mutation of Phe-146 to arginine and the insertion of an alanine residue prior to it, also failed to recover activity with either dTMP or AZT-MP.The exact positioning required by the catalytic residues, which was probably not achieved in our initial efforts of simple modifications of the yeast lid region, prompted the replacement of the entire yeast lid region (residues 131–149) by that of the E. coli lid (residues 138–157) (Fig. 2). The variant that retains the P-loop arginine exhibits only 4% of wild type activity with dTMP, with no improvement in AZT-MP phosphorylation. However, the variant that in addition to the replaced lid has the P-loop Arg-15 exchanged by a glycine recovers 25% of wild type activity and, most encouragingly, results in a 400% increase of the AZT-MP phosphorylation rate. This result suggests that the presence of arginines in both P-loop and lid leads to steric interference but that the loss of activity caused by removal of Arg-15 can be partially restored by an arginine in the lid region. In summary, we have created a mutant of yeast TmpK that phosphorylates AZT-MP four times more efficiently than wild type, and at the same time the ratio between thek obs for dTMP and AZT-MP is improved 16-fold.For the long term aim of gene therapeutic potentiation of AZT effectiveness, there would be significant advantages from the use of a modified human enzyme. We therefore extended the mutational studies to the human enzyme (Table II). Here, too, mutation of the P-loop carboxylic acid (Asp-15) completely inactivates the enzyme. Contrary to all expectations arising from the studies on the yeast enzyme, replacement of Arg-16 (equivalent to Arg-15 in the yeast enzyme) does not lead to a loss in catalytic activity. At present, we have no experimentally based explanation for this observation. However, it is possible that it is related to the fact that k obs for the human enzyme is much lower than for the yeast enzyme (0.7 versus 35 s−1), which is already very slow when compared with other nucleoside monophosphate kinases (e.g. 570 s−1 for human adenylate kinase (12Ayabe T.

Because the catalytic machinery in both enzymes appears to be identical, as shown by sequence comparison and three-dimensional structural determination, 2A. Lavie, R. Brundiers, T. Veit, J. Reinstein, I. Schlichting, N. Ostermann, R. S. Goody, and M. Konrad, manuscript in preparation. we speculate that it is possible that the chemical step (i.e. phosphoryl transfer) is not rate-limiting, but rather another step such as product release; so that slowing a relatively rapid chemical step, by removing the P-loop arginine, might not have any influence on the overall rate.Table IISteady state kinetics of human TmpK mutantsk obsfor dTMPk obs for AZT-MPRatiok obs for dTMP/k obs for AZT-MPRatio k obs mutant/WT for AZT-MPs −1s −1WT0.730.012611D15X (Ala, Asn, Glu)<0.001<0.001R16G1.0<0.01WT + E. coli small lidaResidues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.150.003500.25WT + E. colilarge lidbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.170.002850.17R16G + E. coli small lidaResidues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.0.70.223.218R16G +E. coli large lidbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.1.52.140.7178F105Y0.170.250.721R16G + E. colilarge LIDbResidues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK. + F105Y0.330.600.5550a Residues 145AFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 151RARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK.b Residues 136QLADAAKRGAFGH148 of human TmpK were replaced by 142TPEVGLKRARARGEL156 from E. coli TmpK. Open table in a new tab More in keeping with expectations arising from the yeast TmpK data was the fact that introduction of the E. coli lid region without removing Arg-16 leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. Most dramatically, the combination of the E. coli lid with the replacement of Arg-16 by glycine not only restores full wild type catalytic activity, but it results in a protein that is more efficient with AZT-MP than with dTMP (for the E. coli large lid variant, see Table II). The increase in activity with AZT-MP is approximately 200-fold over wild type. This mutant thus has properties that are highly attractive for improving the potency of AZT, because the efficiency of AZT-MP phosphorylation is improved dramatically with only a minor increase in dTMP phosphorylation activity. The latter is an important aspect, because AZTTP must compete with dTTP for HIV reverse transcriptase-catalyzed addition to the end of a growing viral DNA chain.Interestingly, an increase of AZT-MP phosphorylation with a concomitant reduced activity for dTMP is achieved by the F105Y mutant (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W1964392625,"In this study a pathway for the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has been identified, using microsomes that had been preconditioned by depleting their endogenous substrates and then fusing them with biotinylated phosphatidylserine liposomes containing CoASH and Mg2+. Incubating these fused microsomes with tri[3H] oleoylglycerol and [14C]oleoyl-CoA yielded microsome-associated triacylglycerol, which resisted extensive washing and had a [3H]:[14C] ratio close to 2:1. The data suggest that the precursor tri[3H]oleoylglycerol was hydrolyzed by microsomal lipase to membrane-bound di[3H]oleoylglycerol and subsequently re-esterified with luminal [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The accumulation of TAG within the microsomes, even when overt diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT I) was inactive, is consistent with the existence of a latent diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT II) within the microsomal lumen. Moreover, because luminal synthesis of TAG was carnitine-dependent and markedly reduced by glybenclamide, a potent carnitine acyltransferase inhibitor, microsomal carnitine acyltransferase appears to be essential for trafficking the [14C]oleoyl-CoA into the microsomal lumen for subsequent incorporation into newly synthesized TAG. This study thus provides the first direct demonstration of an enzymatic process leading to the synthesis of luminal triacylglycerol, which is a major component of very low density lipoproteins. In this study a pathway for the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has been identified, using microsomes that had been preconditioned by depleting their endogenous substrates and then fusing them with biotinylated phosphatidylserine liposomes containing CoASH and Mg2+. Incubating these fused microsomes with tri[3H] oleoylglycerol and [14C]oleoyl-CoA yielded microsome-associated triacylglycerol, which resisted extensive washing and had a [3H]:[14C] ratio close to 2:1. The data suggest that the precursor tri[3H]oleoylglycerol was hydrolyzed by microsomal lipase to membrane-bound di[3H]oleoylglycerol and subsequently re-esterified with luminal [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The accumulation of TAG within the microsomes, even when overt diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT I) was inactive, is consistent with the existence of a latent diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT II) within the microsomal lumen. Moreover, because luminal synthesis of TAG was carnitine-dependent and markedly reduced by glybenclamide, a potent carnitine acyltransferase inhibitor, microsomal carnitine acyltransferase appears to be essential for trafficking the [14C]oleoyl-CoA into the microsomal lumen for subsequent incorporation into newly synthesized TAG. This study thus provides the first direct demonstration of an enzymatic process leading to the synthesis of luminal triacylglycerol, which is a major component of very low density lipoproteins. Evidence for triacylglycerol synthesis in the lumen of microsomes via a lipolysis-esterification pathway involving carnitine acyltransferases.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 32PreviewPage 35581: The text relating to Fig. 6 unintentionally omitted mentioning that Fig. 6 was based on a similar diagram in Owen et al. (Owen, M. R., Corstorphine, C. C., and Zammit, V. A. (1997) Biochem. J. 323, 17–21). The reason for including this figure was to provide a rationale for the radiolabeling pattern that was observed, not to claim intellectual precedence. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, our study provides the first direct demonstration of triacylglycerol synthesis within the microsomal lumen. Full-Text PDF Open Access carnitine acyltransferase I (overt) and II (latent) very low density lipoproteins diacylglycerol triacylglycerol diacylglycerol acyltransferase I (overt) and II (latent) bovine serum albumin phosphatidylserine 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid Overt and latent forms of carnitine acyltransferase (CAT I1 and CAT II, respectively) have been shown to exist in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microsomes (1Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18283-18286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a parallel occurrence of the two isozymic forms of this enzyme in these organelles. Although these two enzymes are known to facilitate the uptake of acyl-CoAs (via interconversion with acylcarnitine) into mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation (2Osmundsen H. Bremer J. Pedersen J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,3Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), their physiological function in microsomes is yet to be established. It has been suggested that microsomal CAT is likewise part of a system that enables delivery of acyl moieties across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (4Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which is considered to be an integral step in the synthesis of VLDL triacylglycerol (TAG). This is supported by the fact that the sulfonylurea drug tolbutamide inhibits microsomal CAT I (4Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and suppresses VLDL TAG secretion by hepatocytes to the same extent (6Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). If acyl-CoA generated within the lumen of the microsomes is employed in the acylation of DAG to form VLDL TAG, the existence of a luminal (latent) diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT II), as distinct from the overt enzyme (DGAT I), is suggested (4Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, currently only one DGAT gene has been identified in mice (7Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Cases et al. (7Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of a second DGAT mRNA to explain the fact that in Northern blots more than one band hybridizes with the DGAT probe (7Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The present investigation provides novel metabolic evidence supporting the existence of DGAT II within the microsomal lumen. It is proposed that this enzyme catalyzes the formation of intraluminal TAG from membrane-bound diacylglycerol (DAG) and luminal acyl-CoA, which are generated by microsomal lipase and a carnitine-dependent process, respectively. I. Because carnitine can be unidirectionally transported (8Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2994-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), microsomes were first incubated with carnitine (8Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2994-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure that their intraluminal carnitine concentration was sufficient to facilitate oleoylcarnitine uptake through an exchange reaction. Simultaneously, they were exposed to excess CDP-choline (9Tsao F.H.C. Lipids. 1986; 21: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to convert endogenous diacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine, thus eliminating endogenous DAG. The microsomes were then centrifuged through dibutyl phthalate, an oil immiscible with water, to remove the unreacted reagents. II. The microsomes were resuspended and incubated with tri[3H]oleoylglycerol (tri[3H]TAG) to generate membrane-bound di [3H]oleoylglycerol (di[3H]DAG) through the action of microsomal lipase, followed by a further centrifugation of the microsomes through dibutyl phthalate to remove the unreacted tri[3H]TAG and liberated [3H]oleic acid. III. Because CoASH is depleted from microsomes during their isolation (10Garland P.B. Shepherd D. Yates D.W. Biochem. J. 1965; 97: 587-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cannot be taken up by simple diffusion (8Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2994-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ramsay R.R. Tubbs P.K. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the CoASH was replenished by fusing them with biotinylated phosphatidylserine liposomes encapsulating CoASH and Mg2+. IV. Microsomes were then incubated with [14C]oleoyl-CoA in the presence and absence of carnitine to prove that the pathway of internal, but not external, TAG synthesis from the membrane-bound DAG is carnitine-dependent. Both pools of newly synthesized TAG were subsequently quantified. TAG was extracted and purified by thin-layer chromatography before determining the relative amounts of3H and 14C incorporated into the TAG. Rough microsomes were isolated from the livers of 10-week old male Wistar rats using a previously described method (1Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18283-18286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shepherd J.C. Schumacher T.N.M. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Imaeda S. Ploegh H.L. Janeway Jr., C.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 74: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) but with the inclusion of 50 mm EDTA to remove ribosomes (13Houssais J.F. Rickwood D. Iodinated Density Gradient Media. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1983: 43-67Google Scholar). Removal of ribosomes exposes the highly positively charged N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain (pI = 11) (14Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13140-13145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), thus providing greater charge attraction for the negatively charged liposomes in the fusion step. Microsomes were essentially “outside-out” vesicles with the same orientation of the membrane as in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was confirmed by the latency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is bound to the inner face of the microsomal membrane and was assayed using mannose-6-phosphate as a substrate, as described previously (15Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J. Wallin B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4901-4907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Graham J. Ford T.C. Rickwood D. Iodinated Density Gradient Media. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1983: 195-232Google Scholar). Microsomal-bound di[3H]oleoylglycerol was generated by allowing microsomal lipase to hydrolyze exogenously added tri[3H]oleoylglycerol (900 mCi/mmol), under conditions slightly modified from that previously described (17Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 751: 230-240Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A higher concentration of tri[3H]TAG (50 μm) was used to compete with the newly synthesized di[3H]DAG, thus preventing further hydrolysis of di[3H]DAG by DAG lipase. The assay was carried out in a final volume of 1 ml containing ∼150 μg of microsomal protein, 175 mmmorpholinoethanosulfonic acid (pH 6.0), 400 μg of BSA, and 50 μg of a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, previously sonicated for 2 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm MnCl2. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μmtri[3H]oleoylglycerol in 25 μl of acetone (final concentration in the assay mixture was 2.5%). Note that the assay components employed above have previously been shown to have no effect on the latency of glucose-6-phosphatase (17Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 751: 230-240Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 40 min of incubation at 37 °C, 3 ml of cold homogenization buffer was added to rapidly cool the reaction mixture, which was then put on ice. The ice-cold mixture was layered over 3 ml of dibutyl phthalate oil (top) and 1 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.3, containing 0.5m sucrose and 1 mm dithiothreitol (bottom) in a 10-ml polycarbonate tube and centrifuged at 115,000 ×g at 4 °C for 60 min. The aqueous solution above the oil layer was carefully aspirated with a Pasteur pipette, and the wall of the tube was gently washed with water and wiped with a tissue before removing the oil and the buffer underneath. For the determination of microsomal-bound di[3H]DAG, 1.5 ml of isopropanol:heptane:water, 80:20:2 (v/v/v), was added to the microsomal pellet followed by vigorous mixing. After mixing, 1 ml of heptane and 0.5 ml of water were added. The tube was then capped and vortexed vigorously and centrifuged (700 × g for 10 min). After phase separation, an aliquot (400 μl) was taken from the upper heptane phase (total volume approximately 1.3 ml) and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The dried material was solubilized in ≤50 μl of diethylether and applied to a thin-layer chromatography plate (250 μm silica gel LK6DF), which was developed using hexane:diethylether:acetic acid (80:20:1) as the solvent. The regions corresponding to TAG and DAG were identified by comparison with known standards and scraped into scintillation vials to which 3 ml of Optiphase scintillation fluid was added and the radioactivity measured in a Beckman LS 3802 liquid scintillation β-counter (Beckman Instruments). Greater than 98% of TAG and 94% of DAG was extracted and recovered as judged by the application of standard amounts of radiolabeled TAG and DAG. The yield of di[3H]DAG synthesized is described under “Results and Discussion.” Biotinylated phosphatidylserine (PS) was prepared from phosphatidylserine according to a previously described method (18Bayer E. Rivnay B. Skutelsky E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 550: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The generation of biotinylated PS liposomes (encapsulating a buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaCl, with and without 16 mm CoASH and 2 mm MgCl2) and their subsequent fusion with microsomes were carried out as described previously (19Pistolesi R. Corazzi L. Arienti G. Membr. Biochem. 1990; 9: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 20Rakowska M. Zborowski J. Corazzi L. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fused microsomes, which as a consequence of fusion had biotinylated PS on their surface, were separated from unfused microsomes by allowing them to bind to streptavidin-coated Dynabeads, a step which exploits the remarkably high affinity of streptavidin for biotin (K d = 10−15m) (21Pahler A. Hendrickson W.A. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Argarana C.E. Cantor C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fused microsomes bound to the Dynabeads were then isolated using a Magnetic Particle Concentrator. Dynabeads were applied to only one-tenth of the mixture of fused and unfused microsomes after the removal of unfused liposomes, which would otherwise have interfered with the fused microsomes binding to the Dynabeads. Unfused liposomes were removed by layering an aliquot of the microsome/liposome mixture (5 ml) over 3 ml of dibutyl phthalate (top) and 1 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.3, containing 0.5m sucrose and 1 mm dithiothreitol (bottom) in a 10-ml polycarbonate tube and centrifuging at 115,000 ×g for 60 min. The synthesis of TAG from the membrane-bound di[3H]DAG precursor was facilitated by providing the optimum conditions for CAT I and DGAT. Because DGAT (22Fallon H.J. Barwick J. Lamb R.G. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Marshall M.O. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and CAT I (24Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are both active at neutral pH when phosphate is present, potassium phosphate was included as described previously (25Bhuiyan A.K.M.J. Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). Additions were made to the microsomal-liposomal suspension to give final concentrations of 220 mm sucrose, 40 mmKCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 100 mm potassium phosphate, and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), with or without 0.5 mmcarnitine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (5 mCi/mmol) at concentrations of 0.8, 1, 2, 5, 25, and 50 μm, and included fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) at an oleoyl-CoA:BSA molar ratio of 9:1. The role of BSA as a binder and delivery system for acyl-CoA was partially substituted for by the presence of liposomes in the system (26Pande S.V. Murthy M.S.R. Noël H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Pauly D.F. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18160-18167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min before being rapidly cooled on ice. The microsomes were then washed by centrifugation through dibutyl phthalate. Acyl-CoA hydrolysis during the incubation period was minimized by using microsomes that had been frozen overnight, a procedure that inactivates deacylase activity (28Mannaerts G.P. Debeer L.J. Thomas J. De Schepper P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4585-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ATP was included in the assay as recommended by McGarryet al. (29McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) to facilitate acyl-CoA synthetase activity and thus offset any hydrolysis of acyl-CoA. Moreover, alkaline hydrolysis of acyl-CoA only occurs at a considerable rate at pH >9.0 (30Bishop J.E. Hajra A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the pH at which our assay was performed was 7.4. TAG synthesized externally (in the supernatant) and within the microsomal lumen, as well as membrane-bound DAG, was determined after thin-layer chromatography purification, as described above. In one experiment, conducted in triplicate, 220 μm glybenclamide (1-{4[2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy benzamido)-ethyl]benzene-sulfonyl}-3-cyclohexylurea) was added to the assay in dimethylformamide (final concentration 0.5%) at the times indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. Recombinant acyl-CoA-binding protein was isolated from Escherichia coli as described previously (31Mandrup S. Hojrup P. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using a modification of the Lowry procedure to facilitate quantitation of protein in the presence of high concentrations of lipids (32Markwell M.A.N. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In this study, microsomes were fused with liposomes encapsulating various components to investigate the proposed involvement of latent activities of DGAT and CAT in the luminal synthesis of TAG. Fused microsomes were magnetically separated from the unfused microsomes by being bound to streptavidin-coated Dynabeads. The extent of fusion was 54.2% ± 5.0, as determined by expressing the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in microsomes bound to a saturating amount (300 μl) of Dynabeads (Fig. 1 A) as a percentage of the total activity of the enzyme in the original mixture of fused and unfused microsomes (Fig. 1 B). This extent of fusion was higher than the 39% recorded by Pistolesi et al. (19Pistolesi R. Corazzi L. Arienti G. Membr. Biochem. 1990; 9: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using PS liposomes, confirming our assumption that biotinylation of the PS would enhance subsequent fusion by increasing the electronegativity of the liposomes (18Bayer E. Rivnay B. Skutelsky E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 550: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and thus their attraction for the positively charged microsomes (33Depierre J.W. Dllaner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 411-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). When microsomes were incubated with 50 μm tri[3H]TAG and washed free of unreacted tri[3H]TAG by centrifuging the microsomes through dibutyl phthalate, 14.6 ± 2.9 nmol of di[3H]DAG/mg of microsomal protein was shown to be bound to the microsomal membrane. Microsomal lipase has been shown to hydrolyze TAG to DAG and 2-monoacylglycerols (34Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, under our assay conditions the concentration of TAG was vastly in excess of newly formed DAG and would thus have prevented further breakdown of DAG to 2-monoacylglycerol by preferentially binding to the active site of the lipase (35Groener J.E.M. Knauer T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When microsomes containing membrane-bound di[3H]DAG and loaded with CoASH were further incubated with [14C]oleoyl-CoA in the absence of carnitine, 98% of the resultant radiolabeled TAG could be removed by centrifuging the microsomes through dibutyl phthalate. Thus only 0.08 ± 0.01 nmol of TAG/mg of microsomal protein remained associated with the microsomes, implying that the TAG synthesized in the absence of carnitine must have been predominantly external to the microsomes. In contrast, if microsomes were incubated with [14C]oleoyl-CoA in the presence of carnitine, the amount of TAG remaining associated with the washed microsomes was 11.58 ± 2.36 nmol of TAG/mg of fused microsomal protein, corresponding to a ∼140-fold increase. Because dibutyl phthalate was very effective in removing the externally synthesized TAG, it is concluded that the majority of TAG generated in the presence of carnitine, and remaining associated with the microsomes after passage through dibutyl phthalate, must have been synthesized inside the microsomes. Because only trace amounts (∼2%) of externally synthesized TAG remain associated with dibutyl phthalate-washed microsomes, the TAG synthesized by fused microsomes in the presence of carnitine must be predominantly free in the lumen and/or bound to the inner surface of the microsomal membrane. The 3H:14C molar ratios in the external and internal pools of TAG were 2.02 ± 0.03 and 2.13 ± 0.04, respectively, confirming that, for both pools of TAG, the tri[3H]TAG was initially hydrolyzed to di[3H]DAG, which is membrane-diffusible (36Allan D. Thomas P. Michell R.H. Nature. 1978; 276: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and that this DAG was subsequently re-esterified with the introduced [14C]oleoyl-CoA. It has been previously shown that DGAT has a stereospecific preference for sn-1,2-DAG oversn-2,3-DAG or sn-1,3-DAG (23Marshall M.O. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14253-14256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Coleman R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4537-4543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Coleman R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 99-104Google Scholar), suggesting that the acylation of the DAG is likely to have occurred in thesn-3 position. This demonstration of the existence of a lipolysis/esterification pathway is consistent with the observation of Yang et al. (40Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the fatty acid composition of the TAG of liver and of VLDLs were homologous in the sn-1 andsn-2 positions but distinctly different in thesn-3 position. The fact that the3H:14C molar ratio in the TAG produced within the microsomal lumen was slightly higher than the expected ratio of 2.0 suggests that there may have been some endogenous acyl-CoA within the lumen, which would have competed with the [14C]oleoyl-CoA during the re-esterification of DAG. Furthermore, if the newly synthesized TAG had been derived from monoacylglycerol then the3H:14C ratio would be expected to be 1:2. Clearly this was not the case. The extent of external and internal synthesis of TAG by the carnitine-independent and carnitine-dependent pathways, respectively, at varying concentrations of oleoyl-CoA and at a fixed amount of membrane-bound DAG, is compared in Fig. 2. When these data were analyzed using double reciprocal plots, the amounts of extraluminal and internal TAG that were synthesized at a saturating concentration of [14C]oleoyl-CoA, were calculated to be 5.6 ± 0.9 and 10.9 ± 2.9 nmol of TAG/mg of microsomal protein, respectively. That is, the extent of synthesis of internal TAG (the carnitine-dependent pathway) was 1.95-fold higher than that of external TAG (the carnitine-independent pathway) shown in this study. The total TAG synthesized at this saturating concentration of oleoyl-CoA was 16.5 ± 3.8 nmol of TAG/mg of microsomal protein, which is not significantly different (p > 0.1) from the original amount of DAG bound to the microsomal membrane (see above). This study used microsomes with an essentially outside-out orientation, i.e. having a similar sidedness to intact endoplasmic reticulum, as judged by the latency of glucose-6-phosphatase (data not shown). Thus, TAG synthesized within the lumen and in the extraluminal space correspond to the distinct microsomal and cytoplasmic pools of TAG, respectively. The luminal synthesis of TAG within a mixture of fused and unfused microsomes (6.21 ± 0.96 nmol/mg of total microsomal protein) was shown to be predominantly associated with those microsomes that had fused with biotinylated PS liposomes, previously loaded with 16 mm CoASH and 2 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3). This is evident from the fact that only the fused microsomes, i.e. those bound to streptavidin-coated Dynabeads, had appreciable amounts of internal radiolabeled TAG (11.58 ± 2.36 nmol/mg of fused microsomal protein). Unfused microsomes, i.e. those not bound to the streptavidin-coated Dynabeads, contained negligible amounts of internal radiolabeled TAG. There was also negligible TAG produced within the lumen of microsomes that had been fused with either empty liposomes (data not shown) or with liposomes containing Mg2+ but no CoASH (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is concluded that it was not simply the act of fusion but rather was the consequence of CoASH being delivered to the microsomal lumen, thereby facilitating intraluminal acyl-CoA synthesis, that promoted the production of luminal TAG.FIG. 4Incorporation of the acyl moiety of exogenously added [14C]oleoyl-CoA into newly formed luminal TAG . The amount of exogenous [14C]oleoyl-CoA incorporated into newly synthesized luminal TAG was determined under different experimental conditions. In a typical complete assay, DAG-bound microsomes were loaded with CoASH by fusing them with liposomes encapsulating 16 mm CoASH. These microsomes were incubated with 50 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA and 0.5 mm carnitine. The extent of incorporation of the [14C]oleoyl moiety into luminal TAG was quantitated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of CoASH in the microsomal lumen (via liposomes) and carnitine in the incubation media. When both CoASH and carnitine were absent, [14C] oleoyl-CoA was directly loaded into microsomes by fusing them with liposomes encapsulating 50 μm of the labeled acyl-CoA.

Microsomes were fused with liposomes encapsulating 50 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA and then subsequently treated with excess (>350 μm) of acyl-CoA-binding protein and washed through dibutyl phthalate. Because acyl-CoA-binding protein binds acyl-CoAs with a very high affinity (nanomolar K d ), this procedure not only removes external acyl-CoA but also that bound to the outer leaflet of the microsomal membrane (31Mandrup S. Hojrup P. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Rasmussen J.T. Borchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These microsomes failed to acylate exogenously added 1 mm DAG (data not shown), prepared as a sonicated mixture with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (43Miller J.C. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12662-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sonicated DAG-PG mixtures have been shown in this laboratory to be very effective in presenting DAG in an appropriate physical form for microsomal diacylglycerol-choline phosphotransferase activity (44Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Cake M.H. Potter I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, this type of preparation of DAG has previously been shown to be suitable for the DGAT I reaction (5Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of acylation activity in this study indicates that DGAT I was rendered completely inactive by the removal of extraluminal acyl-CoA and was not due to the exogenous DAG being in an inappropriate physical form. This observation also demonstrates that DAG not bound to the membrane (in contrast to membrane-bound DAG (36Allan D. Thomas P. Michell R.H. Nature. 1978; 276: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) is inaccessible to DGAT II and that the intraluminal [14C]oleoyl-CoA is impermeable to the microsomal membrane (45Bell R.M. Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore inaccessible to DGAT I. When the above microsomes were incubated with tri[3H]TAG, under conditions that generate membrane-bound di[3H]DAG, a high level of newly synthesized di[3H]oleoyl-mono[14C]oleoylglycerol (8.84 ± 1.30 nmol/mg of microsomal membrane) was generated, which survived washing through oil (Fig. 4). Because DGAT I was deprived of one of its two substrates, namely acyl-CoA, this TAG most plausibly originated from DGAT II activity. Distinct overt and latent forms of microsomal CAT have been independently isolated and purified in two different laboratories (1Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18283-18286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46Broadway N.E. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests that carnitine-mediated transfer of acyl moieties across the microsomal membrane might occur. However, whereas mitochondria and peroxisomes have been shown to possess a carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase system (8Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2994-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fraser F. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), such a system has not been detected in microsomes (47Fraser F. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, acylcarnitine (but not acyl-CoA) transfer across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane does occur, perhaps by a gated channel mechanism (47Fraser F. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In such a system, acyl-CoA (which is impermeable to microsomal membranes (45Bell R.M. Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fraser F. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) is converted by CAT I into its corresponding acylcarnitine. This crosses the membrane via a gated channel and is re-esterified to acyl-CoA by a CAT II-catalyzed reaction. The experiment represented in Fig. 4supports the existence of such a system. When all of the assay components were present, the amount of the [14C]acyl moiety incorporated into the newly synthesized luminal TAG by DGAT II was 11.58 ± 2.36 nmol/mg of fused microsomal protein. This amount was ∼140-fold higher than that produced when carnitine was omitted from the medium and ∼236-fold higher than that produced when microsomes were devoid of CoASH (Fig. 4). In the former case, acylcarnitine would not have formed and in the latter case, luminal acylcarnitine would not have been reconverted to acyl-CoA. To prove that the availability of acyl-CoA within the microsomal lumen is critical for the DGAT II reaction, the system was bypassed by directly loading acyl-CoA into the microsomes by fusing them with liposomes encapsulating 50 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA. In these microsomes, despite being devoid of CoASH and deprived of exogenously added carnitine, appreciable amounts of the [14C]oleoyl moiety (8.84 ± 1.30 nmol/mg of fused microsomal protein) were incorporated into newly synthesized luminal TAG (Fig. 4). When microsomes were fused with liposomes containing 50 μm [14C] oleoyl-CoA and 8 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), there was a high level of inhibition (71.0 ± 8.3%) of luminal synthesis of TAG (data not shown). Because DTNB is unable to penetrate the membrane (48May J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 108: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), this suggests that one or more thiol groups are at or sufficiently near to the active center of DGAT II such that the enzyme is inhibited when they are reacted with DTNB. DTNB has been previously shown to strongly inhibit acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (49Wasan K.M. Cassidy S.M. J. Pharm. Sci. 1997; 86: 872-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which is genetically and structurally related to DGAT (50Oelkers P. Behari A. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), but to have no effect on microsomal lipase activity (51Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When the sulfonylurea drug glybenclamide (220 μm), a potent inhibitor of CAT I (4Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was included during the incubation of microsomes with tri[3H]TAG but removed by washing the microsomes through dibutyl phthalate prior to the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA, the production of luminal TAG was only marginally reduced (5.3%; see Fig. 5). This indicates that microsomal lipase, unlike lysosomal lipase (6Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), is not affected by sulfonylurea drugs. However, if glybenclamide was present during the incubation of the microsomes with [14C]oleoyl-CoA, i.e. during the CAT I-dependent transfer of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into the microsomes, the production of TAG in the lumen was markedly reduced by 90.8% (Fig. 5). This suggests that CAT I is an essential component of the pathway involved in TAG synthesis within the microsomal lumen. The concept of a lipolysis-esterification pathway being involved in the secretion of VLDL TAG was previously suggested to explain the differences in fatty acid composition of TAG in the liver and in VLDLs (40Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism and intracellular location of the enzymes responsible for lipolysis and re-esterification have been the subject of conjecture (6Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and have remained obscure (34Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Microsomal lipase has been suggested as a candidate for the lipolysis of cytosolic TAG (17Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 751: 230-240Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 51Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is an integral step in the proposed VLDL-TAG lipolysis-esterification cycle (6Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, Lehner et al. (34Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have ruled out a possible contribution from lysosomal lipase and/or hormone-sensitive lipase in this process and have shown that microsomal lipase is confined to the centrilobular regions of the liver where lipoprotein assembly and secretion would be expected to occur. In addition, cells that are impaired in VLDL assembly/secretion lack microsomal lipase (34Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These findings provide strong support for the involvement of microsomal lipase in the VLDL-TAG lipolysis-esterification cycle. This enzyme has been shown to reside on the cytoplasmic side of microsomal vesicles as is evident from its susceptibility to limited proteolysis (17Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 751: 230-240Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in the proposed pathway for intraluminal TAG synthesis are microsomal lipase and CAT I, which act on the cytosolic side of microsomal membrane, and CAT II and DGAT II, which act on the luminal side of microsomal membrane. Although our study has demonstrated that microsomal transfer protein is not required for intraluminal synthesis of TAG (data not shown) it could be involved in the subsequent utilization of this TAG in the assembly of VLDL. Microsomal transfer protein, which is localized within the microsomal lumen (52Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.-H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), has been shown to be required for the lipidation of apoB (53Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E.

Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1986-1993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The critical role of microsomal transfer protein in the assembly and secretion of VLDL has been supported by detailed studies in liver-specific microsomal transfer protein knockout mice (55Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjšrkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,56Chang B.H. Liao W. Li L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In conclusion, a proposed pathway, by which intraluminal microsomal TAG is derived from cytoplasmic TAG and acyl-CoA, is suggested to be as follows. First, microsomal TAG lipase generates membrane-bound DAG from TAG. Second, CAT I and CAT II work sequentially to generate acyl-CoA inside the microsomes. Third, DGAT II utilizes this intraluminal acyl-CoA to synthesize TAG from the membrane-bound DAG, which is membrane-diffusible and thus exists on both sides of the membrane. The pathway is depicted in Fig. 6, which shows the radiolabeled precursors and products used experimentally to confirm this pathway. We are indebted to Dr. T. Grand-Perret (Laboratoire Glaxo Wellcome, France) for providing us with 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone and are grateful to Drs. D. A. Gordon and J. R.

https://openalex.org/W2034867322,"The rat hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor mediates clearance of galactose- andN-acetylgalactosamine-terminated glycoproteins by endocytosis, binding ligands through a C-type, Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) at extracellular pH and releasing them at lower pH in endosomes. At physiological Ca2+ concentrations, the midpoint for ligand release from the CRD of the major subunit of the receptor is pH 7.1. In contrast, the midpoint is pH 5.0 for a galactose-binding derivative of the homologous C-type CRD of serum mannose-binding protein, which would thus not efficiently release ligand at an endosomal pH of 5.4. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CRD from the major subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor has been used to identify residues that are essential for efficient release of ligand at endosomal pH. The effects of changes to residues His256, Asp266, and Arg270 singly and in combination indicate that these residues reduce the affinity of the CRD for Ca2+, so that ligands are released at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. The proximity of these three residues to the ligand-binding site at Ca2+ site 2 of the domain suggests that they form a pH-sensitive switch for Ca2+ and ligand binding. Introduction of histidine and aspartic acid residues into the mannose-binding protein CRD at positions equivalent to His256 and Asp266 raises the pH for half-maximal binding of ligand to 6.1. The results, as well as sequence comparisons with other C-type CRDs, confirm the importance of these residues in conferring appropriate pH dependence in this family of domains.

Related but distinct forms of the receptor are found in mammalian liver and in peritoneal macrophages (1Spiess M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10008-10019Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Li M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11295-11298PubMed Google Scholar). The rat hepatic receptor is composed of three subunits, of which the major subunit, rat hepatic lectin 1 (RHL-1),1 represents 70–80% of the total mass of the receptor. The second subunit, RHL-2/3, consists of two species that are differentially glycosylated forms of a second, homologous polypeptide (3Halberg D.F. Wager R.E. Farrell D.C. Hildreth IV, J. Quesenberry M.S. Loeb J.A. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9828-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RHL-1 and RHL-2/3 bind carbohydrate ligands through COOH-terminal, Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type CRDs). Structural analysis of wild-type and mutant forms of the homologous C-type CRD from serum mannose-binding protein suggests that carbohydrate ligands bind to the CRDs of RHL-1 at a conserved Ca2+ designated site 2. The primary interaction with sugar is through hydroxyl groups that form coordination bonds with the Ca2+ and hydrogen bonds with protein side chains that also ligate the Ca2+ (4Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for galactose binding to C-type CRDs has been particularly well investigated in a mutant CRD from serum mannose-binding protein which has been engineered to bind galactose. Three single amino acid replacements (E185Q, N187D, and H189W) and insertion of a glycine-rich loop result in a modified CRD designated QPDWG, which has affinity and selectivity similar to RHL-1 (5Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of this modified CRD and of a further mutant that binds N-acetylgalactosamine with high affinity have been solved (6Kolatkar A. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6679-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These structures provide a basis for modeling the CRD of RHL-1. Following binding of ligand to the asialoglycoprotein receptor at the cell surface, the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and directed to endosomes, where the complex dissociates. The carbohydrate ligand is targeted for degradation in lysosomes while the receptor recycles to the cell surface with a vacant binding site (1Spiess M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10008-10019Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Because the RHL-1 subunit alone can perform receptor-mediated endocytosis (8Braiterman L.T. Chance S.C. Porter W.R. Lee Y.C. Townsend R.R. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1682-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it provides a useful tool for analyzing the molecular basis for the endocytosis process. Endosomal pH is an important determinant of recycling of the asialoglycoprotein receptor as well as other endocytic receptors (9Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation process that occurs in endosomes can be mimicked in vitro by ligand release at pH 5.4. In the case of the chicken hepatic lectin, an homologous endocytic receptor, pH modulates structural transitions between several distinct states of the CRD (10Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At endosomal pH, the structural change causes an approximately 10-fold reduction in affinity for Ca2+ with concomitant loss of ligand binding activity. Although these studies provide insight into the effect of pH on ligand binding activity and receptor conformation, they do not address the identity of the amino acids that sense the environmental pH. The results of site-directed mutagenesis reported here identify three residues, including a histidine conserved in other endocytic receptors, that determine the pH dependence of ligand binding to RHL-1. Loss of ligand binding activity at low pH is closely correlated with decreased affinity for Ca2+. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. Gal34-BSA was obtained from E-Y Laboratories and was iodinated by the chloramine-T method (11Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar). Na125I was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Galactose-Sepharose was prepared by the divinyl sulfone method (12Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Immulon-4 polystyrene wells were from Dynex Technologies. DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase II kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mutagenesis was performed by insertion of double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (GenoSys and Applied Biosystems, United Kingdom) at appropriate restriction sites of a cDNA for RHL-1 as described previously (13Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For expression, mutant constructs of RHL-1 were transferred to the pT5T vector (14Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain C41(DE3), a modified version of strain BL21(DE3) (15Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol.

For fluorescence measurements, the mutant versions of QPDWG were further dialyzed to ensure the absence of Ca2+. The proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C against three changes of 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl made with distilled water from which metal ions had been removed by passage over a Chelex-100 column. Each assay was performed in duplicate at least twice. Ca2+-free BSA and incubation buffer were prepared by filtration through Chelex ion-exchange syringe filters (Bio-Rad). For the pH dependence assay, Immulon-4 wells were coated with protein and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After the protein solution was removed, the wells were rinsed twice with cold loading buffer (1.25 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 25 CaCl2) and blocked with 5% BSA in loading buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The wells were rinsed twice with cold 1.25 mm NaCl, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in the same solution and then rinsed a third time. Aliquots (50 μl) of125I-Gal34-BSA (1 μg/ml) in 2 × incubation buffer (10 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5% BSA) were mixed with equal volumes of 2 × pH buffer (50 mm sodium acetate in the pH 4.5–6.5 range, 50 mm MES in the pH 6–7.5 range, and 50 mm Tris-Cl in the pH 6–8 range, with all solutions containing 2.5 m NaCl and 4% BSA) and transferred to the Immulon-4 wells. Incubation was for 2 h at 4 °C, which was sufficient to achieve equilibrium binding. The wells were emptied, rinsed three times with cold high-Ca2+ loading buffer (1.25m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 250 mm CaCl2), dried, and counted in a Wallac Wizard 1470 γ-counter. For the determination of Ca2+ dependence of neoglycoprotein ligand binding, Immulon-4 wells were coated with protein and incubated at 4 °C overnight. One set of wells was prepared as described above and rinsed twice with cold high pH Ca2+-free rinse buffer (1.25 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8) and a duplicate set of wells was rinsed with low pH Ca2+-free rinse buffer (1.25 m NaCl, 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4). All wells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and then rinsed a third time in the appropriate Ca2+-free rinse buffer. Aliquots (50 μl) of 125I-Gal34-BSA (1 μg/ml) in high pH, Ca2+-free incubation buffer (1.25m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 5% BSA) or in low pH, Ca2+-free incubation buffer (1.25 mNaCl, 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 5% BSA) were added to equal volumes of serial 3:2 dilutions of CaCl2 and then transferred to the appropriate Immulon-4 wells. Incubation was for 2 h at 4 °C. The wells were emptied, rinsed three times with cold high-Ca2+ loading buffer, dried, and counted as above. Measurements were performed on a Jasco FP777 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 170 W lamp using a 1-cm square quartz cuvette. Emission spectra were recorded for 30 s using excitation at 295 nm (10 nm slit width) and measuring emission at 340 nm (5 nm slit width). For the determination of Ca2+affinity, aliquots of CaCl2 were added to tubes containing 1.5 ml of a 1 μm protein solution in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5–6.2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.2–7.5, or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7–7.8, with all solutions containing 100 mm NaCl. All buffers were made with distilled water passed over a Chelex-100 column. The tubes were allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C and the temperature of the measurements was maintained at 37 °C. Background intensity in samples without protein was subtracted from the measurements. Using a nonlinear least-squares fitting program (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific), data from the pH dependence assay were fitted to Equation 1, Fraction maximal binding=(pOH)order)/[(pHB)order+(pOH)order](Eq. 1) where pHB is the pH value at which half-maximal binding is observed. Data from the Ca2+ affinity binding assays and the fluorescence experiments were fitted to Equation2, Fraction maximal binding(or fluorescence)=[Ca2+]2/(KCa2+[Ca2+]2)(Eq. 2) where K Ca is the concentration of Ca2+ at which half-maximal binding is observed. Values reported are the mean ± S.D. for at least two assays. Binding experiments were each performed in duplicate. The coordinates of QPDWG modified to contain histidine at residue 202 (7Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol.

Residues from the RHL-1 sequence were inserted at corresponding positions using the standard rotomer library in Insight II (BioSym). No attempt was made to minimize the structure. A solid-phase binding assay was used to analyze the pH dependence of ligand binding to the isolated CRD of RHL-1 (Fig. 1). At a Ca2+ concentration near to that found in extracellular fluids (1 mm), ligand binding to the isolated CRD decreases as the pH goes from extracellular, pH 7.3, to endosomal, pH 5.4. The pattern of binding is similar to that of the intact receptor (18Hudgin R.L. Price Jr., W.E. Ashwell G. Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5536-5543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that residues which confer pH sensitivity are located within the CRD portion of RHL-1. In contrast, QPDWG, the galactose-binding mutant CRD derived from serum mannose-binding protein, shows substantially less change in ligand binding over the pH range 7.3 to 5.4, although ligand binding activity is lost at lower pH values. Similar behavior is observed for unmodified serum mannose-binding protein, which is not directly involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and therefore does not require the ability to release ligand at endosomal pH (data not shown). Points of half-maximal ligand binding, designated pHB, are 7.1 ± 0.1 for the CRD from RHL-1 and 5.0 ± 0.3 for QPDWG (averages for three different experiments). The CRDs of QPDWG and RHL-1 are 31% identical in overall amino acid sequence and are based on the same protein fold (5Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the behavior of these two CRDs suggests that pH sensitivity of ligand binding in the range between pH 5.4 and 7.3 is conferred by specific amino acid residues found in RHL-1 but not in QPDWG. Side chains that might be involved in establishing the appropriate pH sensitivity for cycles of ligand binding and release during endocytosis were highlighted by comparing the amino acid sequence of RHL-1 to the sequences of QPDWG and two other C-type lectins that have pH-dependent ligand-binding profiles similar to RHL-1: the chicken hepatic lectin (10Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptor (pHB of 6.3). 2H. Dobbyn and S. Wragg, unpublished observations. On the assumption that pH sensitivity of ligand binding results from the interaction of protons with amino acid side chains, candidate residues for controlling pH sensitivity in RHL-1 were identified as residues conserved in the macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptor but not found in QPDWG. Comparison of the sequences shown in Fig. 2 reveals nine potentially protonatable residues that meet this criterion. As an initial test of the role of specific residues in defining pH dependence of ligand binding to RHL-1, each of the nine residues identified in the preceding section was changed to a non-dissociating amino acid of a similar size. Changing Arg273 to a leucine residue results in a CRD that can no longer be purified by affinity chromatography on galactose-Sepharose, suggesting that this mutation causes misfolding of the domain. The remaining eight mutants containing single site changes could be purified on galactose-Sepharose, indicating that the basic fold of the CRD is unaffected by these mutations. In the solid-phase binding assay, five of the mutants, with changes at positions His203, Asp224, Asp227, Glu229, and Asp260, have profiles indistinguishable from wild-type (Table I), suggesting that side chains of these residues are unlikely to play a role in establishing pH sensitivity of ligand binding.Table IpH values at half-maximal binding (pH B ) and Ca 2+ dependence of ligand binding for RHL-1 wild-type and mutant CRDsCRDHis256Asp260Asp266Arg270pHB(1 mm Ca2+)pHB (5 mmCa2+)K Ca (pH 5.4)K Ca (pH 7.8)Mutations without effect on pHBWild-type RHL-1++++7.1 ± 0.16.3 ± 0.150.7 ± 0.20.49 ± 0.02H203Q++++7.1 ± 0.1—aNot determined.65 ± 00.42 ± 0.00D224N++++6.8 ± 0.2—92 ± 100.78 ± 0.11D227N++++6.9 ± 0.2—96 ± 100.72 ± 0.07E229Q++++7.3 ± 0.1—82 ± 11.10 ± 0.00D260N+−++7.0 ± 0.1—67 ± 121.18 ± 0.35R269L++++6.8 ± 0.2—124 ± 70.85 ± 0.08Mutations that decrease pHBH256Q−+++5.9 ± 0.1—15.4 ± 2.20.18 ± 0.02D266N++−+5.9 ± 0.3—8.2 ± 0.90.07 ± 0.01H256Q/D266N−+−+6.0 ± 0.25.5 ± 0.04.2 ± 0.60.11 ± 0.01H256Q/D260N−−++6.0 ± 0.1—24.7 ± 3.20.29 ± 0.05D260N/D266N+−−+5.8 ± 0.1—12.1 ± 4.00.09 ± 0.03H256Q/D260N/D266N−−−+5.8 ± 0.1—8.5 ± 1.20.13 ± 0.04Mutations that increase pHBR270L+++−NBbNB, no binding at 1 mm Ca2+.8.6 ± 0.1>50011.3 ± 3.2H256Q/D266N/R270L−+−−6.4 ± 0.1—13.5 ± 0.10.38 ± 0.03a Not determined.b NB, no binding at 1 mm Ca2+. Open table in a new tab Of the three single site mutations that do alter pH dependence of ligand binding, two cause a decrease in the pHB value. Representative results for mutants H256Q and D266N are shown in Fig. 3 A. For both of these mutants, the pH that supports half-maximal ligand binding is approximately 1 unit lower than for wild-type CRD. The pH profile and pHBvalue for a double mutant containing both of these changes are very similar to those of the single mutants, indicating that His256 and Asp266 do not function in an additive fashion. The ability of the singly and doubly mutant CRDs to maintain ligand binding at endosomal pH also suggests that the role of His256 and Asp266 is to destabilize the CRD so that physiological release of ligand can take place. A model for RHL-1 was generated based on the crystal structure of the CRD from a previously described variant of QPDWG that contains the histidine corresponding to His256 in RHL-1. Insertion of the additional RHL-1 side chains that have been mutated reveals that the five residues which appear not to be involved in establishing pH dependence of ligand binding are at least 16 Å distant from the sugar-binding site adjacent to Ca2+ site 2. In contrast, His256 and Asp266 are predicted to lie within 7 Å of this Ca2+ (Fig. 4). The fact that the His256 and Asp266 side chains are close to each other is consistent with the idea that they work together to affect pH dependence and thus that mutations at these positions produce similar and non-additive effects. The proximity of these side chains to the sugar-binding site suggests that partial protonation of one of these residues might have a direct, local effect on the binding site, causing loss of ligand binding activity. The remaining single mutant that displays a change in the pH dependence profile is R270L, for which the pHB is shifted to a higher value. This change is accompanied by a substantial loss in affinity for Ca2+, so pH dependence was measured in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of the adjacent residue Arg269 to leucine results in essentially no change in pH dependence of ligand binding, suggesting that the effect of the Arg270 mutation results from a specific effect of this arginine side chain. Combination of the H256Q and D266N mutations with the R270L change results in partial compensation between the shifts seen with the separate mutations (Table I). The loss in absolute affinity for Ca2+ makes it difficult to interpret the effects of the change at position 270. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the arginine side chain is likely to be positioned close to His256 and Asp266 and within 8 Å of Ca2+ site 2. It thus forms part of a cluster of amino acid side chains that affect pH sensitivity. It has previously been demonstrated that pH-dependent binding of saccharide ligands to the chicken hepatic lectin is correlated with pH-dependent changes in affinity of the C-type CRD for Ca2+ (10Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to generate mutant domains with altered pH dependence makes it possible to examine the relationship between pH and Ca2+ binding in more detail. As a starting point, the Ca2+ dependence of galactose-BSA binding to the wild-type CRD of RHL-1 and to QPDWG at high and low pH values are compared in Fig. 5. In all cases, binding is dependent on the second power of the concentration of Ca2+, reflecting the presence of two Ca2+ sites in the CRD (10Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence can be characterized by an apparent K Ca, which represent the Ca2+ concentration that supports half-maximal ligand binding. Like the chicken hepatic lectin, RHL-1 shows substantially reduced affinity for Ca2+ at endosomal pH. In contrast, QPDWG is relatively insensitive to a reduction in pH from 7.8 to 5.4. The relationship between K Ca and pH over this range is demonstrated in greater detail for RHL-1 in Fig. 6. The value of logK Ca shows an approximately linear dependence on pH. The point at which this line crosses the physiological Ca2+ concentration range represents the pH at which half-maximal binding of ligand will be achieved and thus corresponds to the pHB value. The behavior of the H256Q/D266N mutant of RHL-1 contrasts with the wild-type in that K Cavalues at all pH values are lower. This shift has the effect of reducing the pH for half-maximal binding at physiological pH. For the receptor to function during endocytosis, the position of theline in Fig. 6 must be such that it passes through the physiological Ca2+ concentration range between the pH value at the cell surface and the value in endosomes. As noted above, the effect of His256 and Asp266 is to decrease affinity for Ca2+ over the entire pH range. While it was not practical to measure K Ca values at all pH values for all of the mutant CRDs, the approximately linear relationship between pH and log K Ca makes it possible to gain an appreciation for the effects of the mutations by measuring K Ca at the two extreme pH values of 5.4 and 7.8. A compilation of such values for various mutant CRDs from RHL-1 is presented in Table I. The results confirm that decreases in pHB are accompanied by an overall increase in apparent affinity for Ca2+ throughout the pH range and that increases in pHB are correlated with weaker binding of Ca2+. Thus, the effect of the mutations that decrease the pHB is to increase Ca2+ affinity so that the domain continues to bind ligand at physiological Ca2+concentrations. The roles of residues His256, Asp260, and Asp266 in RHL were further investigated by incorporating these amino acids at equivalent positions into the relatively pH insensitive CRD of QPDWG. The results, which are summarized in Table II, confirm the ability of His256 to raise pHB. Incorporation of this residue into QPDWG increases the pHB by more than half of a pH unit. In contrast, incorporation of residues equivalent to Asp260 or Asp266 alone has no significant effect on pHB, although there is a slight increase in pHB when these residues are incorporated in the presence of the histidine residue. Although these effects are largely consistent with the results for RHL-1, the highest pHB obtained, in the presence of both His256 and Asp266, is still roughly one pH unit lower than for wild-type RHL.Table IIpH values at half-maximal binding (pH B ) and Ca 2+ dependence of ligand binding for QPDWG and further mutant CRDs from serum mannose-binding proteinAmino acid changesHis256 aPosition of the equivalent residues in the CRD of RHL-1.Asp260 aPosition of the equivalent residues in the CRD of RHL-1.Asp266 aPosition of the equivalent residues in the CRD of RHL-1.Arg270 aPosition of the equivalent residues in the CRD of RHL-1.pHB(1 mm Ca2+)pHB (4 mmCa2+)K Ca (pH 5.4)K Ca (pH 7.8)QPDWG +−−−−5.0 ± 0.33.5 ± 0.10.98 ± 0.090.42 ± 0.04I212D−−+−5.2 ± 0.1—bNot determined.1.34 ± 0.060.31 ± 0.04N206D−+−−5.1 ± 0.1—1.46 ± 0.070.13 ± 0.02T202H+−−−5.7 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.12.65 ± 0.30.17 ± 0.03T202H/N206D++−−5.7 ± 0.1—3.96 ± 1.00.08 ± 0.02T202H/I212D+−+−6.1 ± 0.15.7 ± 0.13.28 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.2T202H/N206D/I212D+++−5.9 ± 0.1—5.37 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.5QPDWG in which region 216–218 is replaced by RHL-1 sequence (RPY) +−−−+5.3 ± 0.03.2 ± 0.00.67 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.02I212D−−++5.7 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.21.47 ± 0.10.55 ± 0.2T202H+−−+5.5 ± 0.04.7 ± 0.42.27 ± 0.30.16 ± 0.03T202H/I212D+−++NBcNB, no binding at 1 mm Ca2+.6.4 ± 0.128.2 ± 5.77.2 ± 0.3QPDWG in which region 157–161 is replaced by RHL-1 sequence (QNG) +−−−−7.1 ± 0.1—37.53 ± 6.24.75 ± 0.06Q162P−−−−7.8 ± 0.2—72.95 ± 1.43.69 ± 0.9a Position of the equivalent residues in the CRD of RHL-1.b Not determined.c NB, no binding at 1 mm Ca2+. Open table in a new tab The effect of pH on K Ca was also investigated for the QPDWG mutants, since changes on Ca2+ affinity provide a means of determining how accurately these mutants mimic the behavior of a CRD involved in endocytosis. As shown in Table II, theK Ca of QPDWG determined from the Ca2+ dependence of neoglycoprotein binding is relatively insensitive to pH, as it changes by a factor of roughly 2.5 over the range of 5.4 to 7.8. These results suggest that shifts in the pHB values either up or down are not related to large changes in the relative K Ca values at pH 5.4 and 7.8, but represent an overall loss of affinity for Ca2+ at all pH values. This interpretation was verified in direct measurements of Ca2+ binding, which can be monitored in mannose-binding protein and derivatives by following changes in intrinsic fluorescence (20Ng K.K.-S. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17977-17989Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results for QPDWG and the mutant with the highest measured pHB are shown in Fig. 7. As noted in previous experiments with wild-type mannose-binding proteins, the absolute K Ca values measured by this technique differ from those determined indirectly in the neoglycoprotein-binding assay, probably because of the effect of the bound sugar. Nevertheless, this approach provides a convenient way to compare affinity for Ca2+ over a range of pH values. The results shown in Fig. 7 confirm that the mutations introduced into QPDWG result in an overall decrease in affinity for Ca2+ at all pH values without substantially changing the relative affinity at low and high pH, which would correspond to increased slope in a plot ofK Ca as a function of pH. Thus, even the mutant containing residues corresponding to His256 and Asp266, which has the highest pHB value at 1 mm Ca2+, differs substantially from RHL-1 in its Ca2+-binding properties. In an attempt to make the behavior of QPDWG more like RHL, similar experiments were undertaken investigating the contribution of residues Arg270 and Arg273. The presence of a proline residue adjacent to Arg270 in RHL-1 suggests that the local conformation of the polypeptide may differ substantially from QPDWG. For this reason, all three amino acid residues predicted to be in this loop (Arg-Pro-Tyr) were incorporated into QPDWG at positions 216–218. As indicated in Table II, this change by itself or in the presence of His256 alters the pHB only slightly when measured at 1 mm Ca2+. However, the slight compensatory relationship between the His256 and Arg270 positions is amplified at 4 mmCa2+. These results are again consistent with the findings for RHL, in which removal of arginine at position 270 causes an increase in pHB, since in QPDWG incorporation of the arginine residue decreases the pHB. In contrast, in the presence of both Asp266 and His256, this arginine actually increases the pHB. However, this triple mutant shows substantially reduced affinity for Ca2+, again suggesting that changes in this region may result in significant rearrangement of the Ca2+-binding sites. Similarly, mutants of QPDWG containing arginine at the position corresponding to Arg273 of RHL-1 display greatly decreased affinity for Ca2+, which could not be quantified using the solid-phase binding assay. A further important difference between RHL and QPDWG is the arrangement of ligands for the accessory Ca2+ site (site 1). As noted in Fig. 2, at least one of the site 1 ligands, at position 217 in RHL, must be different from QPDWG and two adjacent residues are absent from RHL. The effect of inserting the shorter loop corresponding to residues 216–219 of RHL, replacing residues 157–168 of QPDWG, was tested by the creation of two additional mutations, resulting in a dramatic loss in affinity for Ca2+ and a concomitant increase in the apparent pHB (Table II). These results suggest that the arrangement of Ca2+ site 1 ligands may contribute to establishing the appropriate affinity for Ca2+ and the pHB of RHL. However, the data also indicate that mutants containing the modified site 1 do not attain all of the Ca2+-binding characteristics of RHL. The results reported here provide strong evidence linking pH sensitivity of ligand binding to C-type CRDs with pH-dependent changes in Ca2+ affinity. The presence of a cluster of titratable amino acid side chains near the ligand-binding site at Ca2+ site 2 in RHL-1 suggests that control of binding by pH is probably mediated at least in part by this set of side chains acting as a pH sensor. The pH sensitivity of the domain is ultimately a result of the summed effect of multiple titratable groups in the domain. However, many potentially titratable groups on the surface of the protein can be mutated without affecting the pH dependence of ligand binding to the CRD from RHL-1, indicating that loss of binding activity in the physiological pH range is a result of a local event involving relatively few amino acid side chains. One scenario consistent with the evidence is that the protonation state of the histidine side chain at position 256 determines the affinity for Ca2+ binding at site 2, perhaps because it makes direct hydrogen bond interactions with certain of the Ca2+ site 2 ligands. The exact interactions of this histidine residue in the QPDWG model background are known to vary depending on the presence of other side chains in this region (7Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), so it is not yet possible to propose a specific mechanism for linking the pH sensor to Ca2+ site 2. However, it is possible that a hydrogen bond forms between His256 and one of the site 2 Ca2+ ligands, corresponding to Asn264 (Fig. 4), so that protonation of the imidazole group would directly affect the position of the amide group and thus alter affinity for Ca2+. In any case, the divergent effects of changing residues Asp266 and Arg270 could result from the influence of these side chains on the pK a of His256. The presence of an aspartate side chain would reduce the pK a of the imidazole group while the arginine side chain would increase the pK a . Even in the absence of His256, ligand binding activity of the CRD from RHL-1 is lost at low pH (below 5.4). This loss of activity, under nonphysiological conditions, may reflect more general unfolding of the domain as multiple aspartate and glutamate side chains start to become protonated. This interpretation suggests that the increased steepness of the pH curves at low pH values (Fig. 3) reflects the involvement of multiple protons in bringing about this unfolding. It is also possible that carboxylate coordination ligands for the two Ca2+ become sufficiently protonated at this pH to result in release of Ca2+ and hence loss of ligand binding activity. Examination of the CRDs from multiple C-type lectins with differing pH profiles provides additional evidence for the importance of the residue corresponding to His256 in establishing pH sensitivity in the physiological pH range. Although the CRD of RHL-2/3, the minor subunit of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, is 59% identical to RHL-1, it binds Ca2+ more weakly and does not show a loss of affinity as the pH decreases from 7.8 to 5.4. Interestingly, this subunit differs at positions corresponding to His256, Asp266, and Arg270 (Fig. 2). These residues are also absent from almost all other CRDs in the C-type lectin family, which correlates with the fact that most of these proteins are not known to undergo pH-dependent release of ligand under physiological conditions. CRDs that do contain a histidine side chain at the position corresponding to His256 of RHL-1 include the chicken hepatic lectin and the macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptor. The pH dependence of ligand binding to the chicken hepatic lectin is closely similar to RHL-1, although the amino acid residues corresponding to Asp266 and Arg270 are not conserved (Fig. 2), suggesting that, while the histidine side chain may remain the primary pH sensor, the effective pK a of this side chain is established in different ways. The absence of the critical histidine residue from the primary ligand-binding CRD of the macrophage mannose receptor (CRD-4) correlates with the fact that ligand release from this CRD occurs at lower pH than from RHL-1 (21Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other endocytic receptors share with the C-type lectins the presence of divalent cations at critical sites in the ligand-binding domains. The Mn2+ residue that forms part of the ligand-binding site in the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor is in close proximity to a histidine residue that has been suggested as a possible pH-dependent regulator of sugar binding (22Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Many other endocytic receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor, contain homologous complement-like repeats that are folded around a Ca2+. Several of these domains have been characterized structurally and it has been suggested that loss of ligand binding activity at endosomal pH may be mediated by release of the Ca2+ (23Domer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, examination of the sequences of the Ca2+-containing complement-like repeats fails to reveal a conserved histidine residue near to the Ca2+ site. In different receptors, other mechanisms must be responsible for determining the pH-sensitive changes in ligand binding activity that are essential to the endocytic processes. In addition, the concentration of Ca2+ in endosomes appears to be reduced compared with the extracellular environment, providing an alternative route to destabilization of Ca2+-dependent receptor-ligand complexes (24Gerasimenko J.V.

The dephosphorylation of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 results in a considerable free energy change, in no small part due to the relief of the severe electrostatic and steric constraints imposed by the high density of phosphate groups that are clustered around the inositol ring (7Stephens L.R.

Nevertheless, in vivo there is rapid turnover of both PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4, so the levels of these compounds must be continually replenished at a robust rate. This ATP-consuming process therefore places a substantial burden upon the cell's energy reserves (12Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 turnover might act as a molecular switch for a very dynamic cellular process, for which vesicle trafficking has emerged as a candidate (13Huang C.-F. Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Saiardi A. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14998-15004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dormán G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Support for the idea that PP-InsP5 in particular might regulate the movement of vesicles through the cell comes from demonstrations that some of the proteins that regulate this process bind PP-InsP5 very tightly; examples include coatomer (5Ali N. Duden R. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AP-2 (see Ref. 3Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Another energy-consuming activity that may be nominated for being regulated by diphosphoinositol polyphosphates is mRNA export from the nucleus. Recent studies indicate that efficient mRNA export in yeasts requires the synthesis of inositol hexakisphosphate (17York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, rather than inositol hexakisphosphate participating in this process directly, as was originally proposed (17York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the significance of inositol hexakis- phosphate may actually be as the precursor of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 (12Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the turnover of which can more readily account for some of the energy-dependent aspects of mRNA export. The contention that it is the actual turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates that is functionally significant is further supported by their cellular levels being regulated by specific cell-signaling events. These include the mobilization of certain categories of cellular Ca2+ stores, which inhibits the synthesis of PP-InsP5 (18Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the metabolism of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates is regulated by receptor-mediated changes in levels of cAMP and cGMP (19Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since DIPP is the enzyme with primary responsibility for controlling the dephosphorylation of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), this phosphohydrolase is a prime candidate for being regulated by these intracellular signaling processes. Recently, the prominence of DIPP 2The continued use of DIPP as an acronym to describe this enzyme does not prejudge whether diphosphoinositol polyphosphates or diadenosine polyphosphates are the favored substratesin vivo in all specialized subcellular microenvironments. was further enhanced by the discovery that this enzyme also actively hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), particularly Ap6A (Fig. 1). This group of molecules act extracellularly as neurotransmitters (21Miras-Portugal M.T. Gualix J. Pintor J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and vasomodulators (22Ogilvie A. Blasius R. Schulze-Lohoff E. Sterzel R.B. J. Autonom. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 157-163Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Schlüter H. Offers E. Bruggemann G. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nordhoff E. Karas M. Spieker C. Witzel H. Zidek W. Nature. 1994; 367: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, they are thought to regulate cardiac K ATP channels (24Jovanovic A. Jovanovic S. Mays D.C. Lipsky J.J. Terzic A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ryanodine receptors (25Holden C.P. Padua R.A. Geiger J.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Clearly, enzymes that regulate the concentrations of Ap6A in vivo can play pivotal roles in some important signal transduction processes. Given the importance of the two different catalytic activities of DIPP, it is of considerable enzymological significance to understand how this enzyme has the flexibility to hydrolyze both diadenosine polyphosphates and the structurally unrelated diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (Fig. 1). There would appear to be little scope for two separate catalytic centers in DIPP, considering its relatively small size of only 19.5 kDa (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In fact, a single candidate catalytic core in DIPP has been proposed (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), on the basis of it matching a consensus for the catalytic motif of Nudix hydrolases (nucleosidediphosphate attached to another moiety, “x” (26Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)). The Nudix designation embraces Ap6A, but not PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4. Thus, one of the goals of the current study was to ascertain whether amino acid residues within the Nudt (Nudix-type) catalytic core of DIPP were recruited for the hydrolysis of both classes of substrates. Yet we also queried whether there might be some substrate-dependent interactions with specific amino acid residues, in part because DIPP cleaves the internal polyphosphate chain of Ap6A, but the enzyme removes the terminal β-phosphates from PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 (Fig. 1). Still further catalytic agility of DIPP must be accounted for because of its alternative positional specificity when either PP-InsP5 or (PP)2-InsP4 is a substrate (Fig. 1). It is the 5-β-phosphate that is cleaved from PP-InsP5 (3Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Bröker M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), yet the 5-β-phosphate on (PP)2-InsP4 is apparently protected, and it is the other β-phosphate that is predominantly hydrolyzed (3Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify candidate active-site residues in DIPP, we first compared the amino acid sequence of this enzyme with those of Aps1 and YOR163w, which are two yeast proteins that share DIPP's ability to actively hydrolyze diadenosine polyphosphates and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sequences of these three proteins diverge considerably, except for a limited degree of conservation within the Nudt motif and short flanking regions (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L.

Thus, this homologous region of DIPP was the area of focus for this study; we compared this portion of DIPP with the corresponding sequences of the Nudix hydrolase family members. In this paper, we outline how this alignment procedure identified a subset of proteins with a number of conserved residues, and we go on to describe how we obtained new information concerning their functional significance, in the most detailed mutagenic study of a Nudt protein described to date. PP-[3H]InsP5 was obtained from NEN Life Science Products; (PP)2-[3H]InsP4 was prepared as described previously (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ap6A was purchased from Sigma. The Partisphere 5-μm SAX column was purchased from Krackler Scientific (Durham, NC). NuPAGE gels were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). Wild-type, recombinant human DIPP was prepared as described previously (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The recombinant DIPP mutants were prepared by using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two complementary mutagenic primers, each containing one base mismatch, were synthesized with a Beckman Oligo 1000M DNA synthesizer (Table I); the preparation of the E70Q mutant was described previously (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cDNA construct for recombinant DIPP was used as template for PCR using the mutagenic primers. The wild-type strand in the resulting PCR product was removed by digestion with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h before being used to transform Escherichia coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The colonies from the transformation plates were screened by colony PCR with two primers flanking the DIPP gene, and plasmids were prepared from the colonies that generated the expected PCR product. The presence of the correct mutation in all of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing using a PCR-based dRhodamine fluorescent dye method (Perkin-Elmer).Table ISequences of mutagenic primersMutantsSequenceG50A5′-G ATT GTC CCT GCA GGA GGC ATG-3′G51A5′-G ATT GTC CCT GGA GCA GGC ATG GAG-3′G52A5′-GTC CCT GGA GGA GCC ATG GAG CCC GAG-3′G50V5′-G ATT GTC CCT GTA GGA GGC ATG-3′G51V5′-GTC CCT GGA GTA GGC ATG GAG CCC GAG-3′G52V5′-GTC CCT GGA GGA GTC ATG GAG CCC GAG-3′E66Q5′-GCA GCA GTT CGTCAA GTC TGT GAG-3′G72A5′-GAG GAG GCT GCA GTA AAA GGG ACA TTG-3′G75A5′-GCT GGA GTA AAA GCG ACA TTG GGA AG-3′G78A5′-GGG ACA TTG GCA AGA TTA GTT GGA-3′G78V5′-GGG ACA TTG GTA AGA TTA GTT GGA-3′G82A5′-GGA AGA TTA GTT GCA ATT TTT GAG AAC C-3′F84Y5′-GTT GGA ATT TAT GAG AAC CAG-3′H91L5′-GAG AGG AAG CTC AGG ACG TAT G-3′ Open table in a new tab The cDNAs for DIPP and each of the mutants were transformed into M15 competent cells, which were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. The overnight culture was inoculated into 100 ml of the same medium, and the incubation was continued untilA 600 reached 0.9–1.0, whereupon 1.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside was added to initiate the expression. After an additional 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The techniques used to lyse the cells and to purify recombinant DIPP and the various mutants using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column are all as described previously (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To increase the quantity of protein for analysis by circular dichroism, 10 ml of the overnight culture was inoculated into 250 ml of LB medium in the expression step. In addition, the peak fraction eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was placed in a 3-ml Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) and dialyzed against 4 liters of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The dialyzed protein was then filtered (0.45 μm), and its protein concentration was determined according to Beer's law. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was calculated (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) to be 27,670 m−1cm−1 for recombinant DIPP and its mutants (except F84Y, which was 28,950 m−1 cm−1). The final concentration of the dialyzed mutants was between 9.1 and 32.2 mm. The purity of each protein preparation was determined on 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gels (Fig. 2) with MES SDS running buffer. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatically regulated cuvette (set to 15 °C) with a 1-mm path length, using a resolution of 0.1 nm, a bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a response time of 2 s. Samples were diluted to 9.1–11.2 mm of protein in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Five CD spectra were acquired and averaged before the buffer background was subtracted. Estimates for α-helix and β-pleated sheet content were obtained using the Selcon fitting program. First-order rate constants for the dephosphorylation of PP-[3H]InsP5 and (PP)2-[3H]InsP4 were determined as described previously (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of 100 μm Ap6A was measured in 100-μl assays (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W.

Samples were then neutralized with 100 μl of 1m K2CO3, 5 mm EDTA. Reaction products were resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography using a 4.6 × 125-mm Partisphere 5-μm SAX column, eluted at 1 ml/min by the following gradient generated by mixing buffer A (1 mm Na2EDTA) and buffer B (buffer A plus 1.3m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.85, with H3PO4): 0–1 min, 0% B; 1–31 min, 0–25% B; 31–51 min, 25–55% B; 52–62 min, 0% B. Metabolites were identified as described previously (28Ingram S.W. Stratemann S.a. Barnes L.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3649-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mammalian DIPP has dual specificity, in that it hydrolyzes diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and diadenosine polyphosphates (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two yeast proteins (Aps1 and YOR163w; see Ref. 20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholarand Fig. 3) have been identified that also hydrolyze these two different groups of substrates. The amino acid sequences of these yeast proteins diverge considerably from that of DIPP, except for a limited degree of conservation within the central core that includes the Nudt catalytic motif and short flanking regions (20Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We focused on this homologous internal region of DIPP, and aligned it with a large number of Nudix hydrolases, including 40 that were listed in a recent study (29O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A small subgroup of these proteins were identified, in which there are varying degrees of conservation of several interesting features (Fig. 3): (i) highly conserved glutamate residues within the Nudt motif; (ii) Gly-rich regions flanking the Nudt motif; (iii) a conserved phenylalanine residue; and (iv) a patch of amino acids with strongly positive electrostatic potential, in which a His residue is the most strongly conserved. The identification of these conserved elements forms the basis for the mutagenic strategy that we have used in this study. In our sequence alignments (Fig. 3), five of the seven Glu residues in the Nudt region of DIPP are highly conserved; two of these aligned Glu residues have previously been shown to be catalytically essential in other Nudt contexts (Glu52 in human MutT homologue type 1 (30Cai J.-P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Glu57 in MutT (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). We therefore targeted the equivalent Glu residues in DIPP (Glu66 and Glu70; see Fig. 3). The E70Q mutant of recombinant DIPP had a greatly reduced rate of hydrolysis of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 (Fig. 4 and Ref. 1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have extended this observation by demonstrating that this same E70Q mutation also greatly impaired (by 98%) the ability of recombinant DIPP to hydrolyze Ap6A (Fig. 4). The E66Q recombinant DIPP mutant also had no significant activity toward either PP-[3H]InsP5 or (PP)2-[3H]InsP4, and hydrolase activity against Ap6A was found to be only 2% as active as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The catalytic paradigm for the Nudt motif envisages these two Glu residues participating in both binding of the Mg2+-substrate complex and in general base catalysis (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our experiments are consistent with this catalytic process in DIPP being utilized for the hydrolysis of both diphosphoinositol polyphosphates and diadenosine polyphosphates. We also used CD spectroscopy to examine whether these two mutations had any effect on the secondary structure of recombinant DIPP. The CD spectra of the E66Q and E70Q mutants were not significantly different from that of wild-type recombinant DIPP (data not shown). The CD spectrum for the wild-type enzyme (see below), when analyzed using the Selcon computer algorithm, indicated that the content of α-helix and β-sheet was 18 ± 0.3 and 29 ± 1.2%, respectively (n = 4). Although the Nudt motif is well recognized to represent the catalytic core of the family of proteins in which it occurs (26Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), relatively little is known of the contributions to catalysis made by the amino acid residues that lie outside this conserved motif. Previously published sequence alignments of Nudix hydrolases have identified a conserved Phe residue that lies downstream of the eponymous catalytic motif (33Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); this residue is believed to ensure appropriate positioning of the nucleotide ring (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although the impact of mutagenesis of this residue has not previously been studied. Our own multiple sequence alignments suggested that this conserved residue was equivalent to Phe84 in DIPP (Fig. 3). Thus, an F84Y mutant was constructed to further examine this idea. The CD spectra indicated that this mutation did not have a significant effect on the secondary structure of the protein (data not shown). However, the rates of hydrolysis of (PP)2-InsP4 and Ap6A were substantially impaired (by 63 and 75%, respectively; Fig. 4). In contrast, the rate of hydrolysis of PP-InsP5 was only slightly reduced in the F84Y recombinant DIPP mutant (by only 30%; Fig. 4), suggesting only a relatively minor role for Phe84in the dephosphorylation of that particular substrate. A recurring characteristic to emerge from our multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 3) is the presence, in six of these eight proteins, of a patch of between two and five residues with strong positive electrostatic potential, beginning 16–23 residues downstream of the carboxyl terminus of the Nudt motif. This kernel of positive charge is a good candidate for having electrostatic interactions with the negative charges carried by the phosphate groups on DIPP's substrates. The most conserved of this group of residues (His91) was chosen as a target for further study of this particular issue. An H91L mutant of recombinant DIPP was constructed; CD spectra indicated that this amino acid substitution had no significant effect on the overall secondary structure (data not shown). With PP-InsP5 as substrate, the H91L mutant expressed nearly normal phosphohydrolase activity (70% of the activity of the wild type recombinant DIPP; see Fig. 4). The hydrolysis of Ap6A was more substantially impaired in the H91L mutant (26% of the activity of the wild type enzyme; Fig. 4). However, the most profound effect of this mutation was observed with (PP)2-InsP4 as substrate; the H91L mutant expressed only 4% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The particular sensitivity of (PP)2-InsP4 hydrolysis to the H91L mutation, especially when compared with its relatively small impact upon PP-InsP5 metabolism, may be relevant to the differential positional specificity of DIPP toward these two substrates (Fig. 1);i.e. the 5-β-phosphate is hydrolyzed from PP-InsP5 (3Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K.

J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but this same phosphate group on (PP)2-InsP4 is apparently protected from attack, and it is the other β-phosphate that is hydrolyzed (3Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); His91 appears to have relatively specific interactions with (PP)2-InsP4. DIPP contains two short Gly-enriched regions (GR1 and GR2; see Fig. 3) that extend out from each end of the Nudt motif in DIPP. Despite their short length, these two regions together contain over half of DIPP's total complement of 13 Gly residues (1Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our sequence alignments (Fig. 3) reveal that three of the four Gly residues in the GR2 region comprise a consensus sequence (GX 2GX 6G) that is conserved in both Aps1 and YOR163w, which, like DIPP, also express dual specificity toward diphosphoinositol polyphosphates and diadenosine polyphosphates (20Safrany S.T.

As for GR1, this tripeptide is unique to DIPP in our alignments, but Gly itself is represented between two and four times in the first nine residues of all the sequences in Fig. 3. One clue as to the significance of these Gly clusters comes from predictive analyses of the general architecture of the Nudt motif, which suggests an α-helix flanked by loops (34Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M.C. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This arrangement was empirically confirmed by the determination of the solution structure of the prototypical Nudix hydrolase, the E. coliMutT protein that attacks 8-oxo-dGTP (32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The importance of Gly residues in GR1 and GR2 may be to construct the tight bends in the polypeptide backbone upon which the loop structure depends (36Bossemeyer D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the significance of Gly can extend beyond this structural role; there are circumstances in which these loops form compact ligand-binding pockets in which Gly itself directly participates. Two types of Gly-ligand interactions are suggested by the Nudix context in which GR1 and GR2 are found. First, one of the binding sites for the catalytically essential divalent cation in the E. coli MutT protein is the carbonyl carbon of Gly38 (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in other Nudix hydrolases and corresponds to Gly51 in the GR1 region of DIPP (Fig. 3). Second, since Ap6A is a nucleotide, it is significant that Gly-rich sequences are also a recurring feature of nucleotide-binding loops (36Bossemeyer D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,37Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). 3Some of these sequences are known as “P-loops” (37Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), but these represent only a subset of a wider collection of Gly-rich, phosphate-binding sequences (36Bossemeyer D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 39Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The absence of a side chain in the Gly residue permits a phosphate group to approach the backbone amides, to which the ligand is gripped by hydrogen bonds (38Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,39Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This represents a potential role for GR2. Our proposition that Gly51 may be functionally significant in GR1 (see above) was pursued by conservatively mutating this residue to Ala. This mutant of recombinant DIPP had the same CD spectrum as the wild-type enzyme (data not shown), but its catalytic activity was severely compromised (>97% less than that of the wild-type enzyme; see Fig. 5). Assuming we are correct with our suggestion that the cation-binding function for the carbonyl carbon of Gly38 in the E. coli MutT protein (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) is conserved for Gly51 in DIPP (see above), then we can rationalize the effect of the G51A mutation; the steric bulk of the Ala side chain may prevent the cation from approaching the backbone carbonyl group of Gly51. We also examined the importance to catalysis of the two Gly residues that flank Gly51. The rates of hydrolysis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates by G50A and G52A mutants of recombinant DIPP was substantially (>85%) less than that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 5). The hydrolysis of Ap6A was also decreased compared with wild type recombinant DIPP, although slightly less dramatically (by 60–75%; see Fig. 5). The rate of Ap6A hydrolysis was further reduced (by 90–99%; see Fig. 5) in G50V and G52V mutants of recombinant DIPP. The fact that Gly-to-Val mutants are impaired more dramatically than Gly-to-Ala substitutions is again consistent with the idea that the introduction of steric bulk in the GR1 region prevents proper ligand-protein interactions. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that the secondary structure of these additional mutants were not significantly different from that of the wild type recombinant DIPP (data not shown). Four separate Gly-to-Ala mutants of recombinant DIPP were constructed in the GR2 region: G72A, G75A, G78A, and G82A. The catalytic activity of the G78A mutant (Fig. 6) and its CD spectrum (data not shown) were not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. This is an interesting observation, because Gly78 is the only one of these four Gly residues that is not conserved in Aps1 and YOR163w. Note, however, that the additional steric bulk introduced in a G78V mutant was not tolerated, and then there was a substantial decrease in catalytic activity toward all three substrates (Fig. 6). The CD spectrum obtained from the G82A mutant showed a substantial change from that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 7). The nadir in the spectrum at 203 nm broadened considerably and increased in value from −9000 to −3000 degrees·cm2·dmol−1 (Fig. 7). The Selcon computer algorithm estimated that, compared with the wild-type recombinant DIPP, the content of α-helix in the G82A mutant was 36% lower, while the β-sheet content was 30% higher. Considering the very conservative nature of the Gly-to-Ala substitution, the consequences for the overall secondary structure of the protein are very dramatic. Further structural analysis will be required in order to account for this effect. However, in view of the fact that Gly plays an important role in the architecture of certain polypeptide loops (36Bossemeyer D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), such as those that generally flank the Nudt motif (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S.

Wilkinson M.C. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is notable that there are examples of proteins where no other amino acid can replace Gly at particularly tight turns in a loop (40Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar); this may be why the introduction of an G82A mutation promotes some unraveling of the normal secondary structure. Presumably as a consequence, the catalytic activity of this mutant recombinant DIPP is substantially impaired (Fig. 6). The CD spectra of the remaining two mutants, G72A and G75A, were both very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown), indicating that the mutations had no significant impact upon the secondary structure. However, the catalytic activities of the G72A and G75A mutants toward PP-InsP5, (PP)2-InsP4, and Ap6A were impaired by >95% (Fig. 6). Our mutagenesis of the GR2 region of DIPP has therefore identified a novel Gly-rich consensus, GX 2GX 6G, that is essential for this enzyme's dual specificity. The importance of this study primarily lies in its providing new information relevant to our understanding of the structural and functional relationship that DIPP has with Nudix hydrolases. This knowledge is particularly significant, because the metabolism of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates is an unorthodox activity for a protein that has a Nudt catalytic motif. Our study also breaks new ground by identifying some catalytically important residues that lie outside the Nudt consensus. It is these extramural residues that are believed to impart substrate specificity upon each of the individual members of this hydrolase family (26Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We have found several residues in this category that make important contributions to the unusual dual catalytic specificity of DIPP."
https://openalex.org/W2049950335,"Short-chain, fluorescent derivatives are commonly used to investigate intracellular phospholipid trafficking. However, their use can yield misleading results because they, unlike the native species, can rapidly distribute between organelles due to their low hydrophobicity. On the other hand, hydrophobic derivatives are very difficult to introduce to cells and thus have hardly been used. Here we show that carboxyethylated γ-cyclodextrin (CE-γ-CD) greatly enhances transfer of a variety of hydrophobic fluorescent phospholipid derivatives from vesicles to cultured cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that CE-γ-CD enhances transfer of lipid molecules by increasing their effective concentration in the aqueous phase, rather than by inducing membrane fusion or hemifusion. Incubation with CE-γ-CD and donor lipid vesicles does not extract cholesterol or phospholipids from the cells or compromise plasma membrane intactness or long term cell viability. Using CE-γ-CD-mediated transfer, we introduced hydrophobic pyrene-labeled phosphatidylserine to the plasma membrane of fibroblast cells and followed their distribution with time. In contrast to what has been previously observed for other, less hydrophobic species, transport of this lipid to the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria was not detected. Rather, much of this fluorescent PS remained in the plasma membrane or was incorporated to various endocytotic compartments. These findings indicate that thenative, typically hydrophobic phosphatidylserine molecules efflux only very slowly via the cytoplasm to intracellular organelles. This helps to explain how cells can maintain a very high concentration of phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of their plasma membrane. Furthermore, the present results underline the importance of using hydrophobic analogues when studying intracellular trafficking of many phospholipid classes."

Two stable cell lines, i.e. SPI6 and SPI8, were isolated, which showed a 2- and 3-fold increase, respectively, in the level of PI-TPα. Overexpression of PI-TPα resulted in a decrease in the duration of the cell cycle from 21 h for the wild type (nontransfected) NIH3T3 (wtNIH3T3) cells and mock-transfected cells to 13–14 h for SPI6 and SPI8 cells. Analysis of exponentially growing cultures by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that a shorter G1 phase is mainly responsible for this decrease. The saturation density of the cells increased from 0.20 × 105 cells/cm2 for wtNIH3T3 cells to 0.53 × 105 cells/cm2 for SPI6 and SPI8 cells.

The addition of PI-TPα to a total lysate ofmyo-[3H]inositol-labeled wtNIH3T3 cells stimulated the formation of lyso-PtdIns. The addition of Ca2+ further increased this formation. Based on these observations, we propose that PI-TPα is involved in the production of lyso-PtdIns by activating a phospholipase A acting on PtdIns. The increased level of lyso-PtdIns that is produced in this reaction could be responsible for the increased growth rate and the partial loss of contact inhibition in SPI8 and SPI6 cells.

The subsequent isolation of the cDNAs encoding mouse and human PI-TPα revealed a high homology between the different mammalian PI-TPs (about 99% amino acid sequence identity) (9Geijtenbeek T.B.H. de Groot E. van Baal J.

Furthermore, the cross-reactivity of the antibodies raised against bovine PI-TPα with a 35-kDa protein from other animals (e.g. rat, mouse, chicken, frog, and lizard) indicates an extensive conservation of the amino acid sequence between species (11Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Hilderson H.J. Subcellular Biochemistry. 16. Plenum Press, New York1990: 129-174Google Scholar). An exception is PI-TP from yeast (i.e.SEC14p) that has the same molecular weight as mammalian PI-TP and comparable phospholipid transfer activities yet shows no homology in the amino acid sequence (12Bankaitis V.A.

So far, very little is known about the precise cellular role of mammalian PI-TPα. Since PI-TPα is able to transfer in vitro PtdIns between membranes in exchange for phosphatidylcholine, it was proposed that PI-TPα has a function in the transfer of PtdIns from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to other cellular membranes in order to maintain the level of PtdIns upon metabolism (15Wirtz K.W.A.

PtdIns is a precursor molecule for several intracellular (and possibly also extracellular) lipid messengers, the best characterized of which are 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) (18Berridge M.J.

These messengers are formed when PtdIns is phosphorylated by PtdIns 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (4,5)P2), which subsequently is degraded by PLC. Other PtdIns derivatives of potential biological significance include those formed in the PtdIns 3-kinase pathway (20Panayotou G.

Recently, it was shown in permeabilized human neutrophils that PI-TPα stimulates the formylmethionyl leucylphenylanaline-dependent production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the presence of PtdIns 3-kinase γ (35Kular G.

Moreover, in permeabilized PC12 cells, PI-TPα was found to be one of the three essential factors needed for the ATP-dependent, Ca2+-regulated fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane (36Hay J.C. Martin F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). An additional effect on secretion was shown in permeabilized HL60 cells, where PI-TPα and PI-TPβ were able to restore GTPγS-stimulated protein secretion in the presence of ADP-ribosylation factor (37Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S. Tan S.K. Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a cell-free system containing trans-Golgi membranes it was shown that PI-TPα (as well as PI-TPβ) stimulates the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules (38Ohashi M. De Vries K.J. Frank R. Snoek G. Bankaitis V. Wirtz K. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PI-TP has a function in intracellular membrane traffic from the Golgi to the plasma membrane that may be linked to the production of intracellular lipid messengers. The above studies, using semi-intact cells and in vitrosystems, would indicate that PI-TP acts in different compartments of the cell, in particular at the plasma membrane and at the Golgi membranes. Localization studies by indirect immunofluorescence and by microinjection of fluorescently labeled purified PI-TPα and PI-TPβ into intact mammalian cells have shown that PI-TPα is mainly localized in the nucleus and in cluster-like structures in the cytosol and that PI-TPβ is mainly associated with the Golgi membranes (3De Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A.J. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4De Vries K.J.

However, upon stimulation of the cells by different growth factors (bombesin, PDGF) that stimulate the phospholipase C-dependent degradation of PtdIns(4,5)P2, accumulation of PI-TPα near the plasma membrane was not observed. Thus, no correlation was found between the cellular localization of PI-TPα and its proposed sites of action. In order to gain further insight in the function and the mechanism of action of PI-TPα, we have established stable cell lines that overexpress PI-TPα. In this paper, we show that overexpression of PI-TPα in NIH3T3 cells affects the phenotype, the growth characteristics, and the inositol lipid metabolism of these cells. The pBluescript vector SK+ was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The anti-PI-TP antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides representing the amino acid sequence of predicted epitopes in rat brain PI-TPα (39Snoek G.T. de Wit I.S.C. van Mourik J.H.G. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Geneticin G418 and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was from Nordic Immunological Laboratories (Tilburg, The Netherlands). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher and Schuell. Agar-agar (Agar Noble) was obtained from Difco, RNase A from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and myo-[2-3H]inositol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNA encoding mouse PI-TPα was isolated and cloned into the pBluescript vector (9Geijtenbeek T.B.H. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PI-TPα cDNA contains aNcoI restriction site around the translational start codon and an EcoRI and XhoI site downstream of the translational stop codon. The NcoI–XhoI fragment was isolated (including the EcoRI site) and ligated into the cloning vector pUC21 (41Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) in the corresponding restriction sites in order to introduce an extra EcoRI site upstream of the PI-TPα cDNA. The resulting EcoRI fragment (containing the complete coding cDNA) was cloned into the uniqueEcoRI site of the pSG5 expression vector (42Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). A construct was selected with the cDNA encoding PI-TPα in the sense direction. This construct will be denoted as pSG5-PI-TPα. The expression of PI-TPα will be regulated by the SV40 early promoter, and polyadenylation will be provided by the SV40 poly(A)-adenylation signal (42Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) and buffered with NaHCO3 (44 mm) in a 7.5% CO2humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. wtNIH3T3 fibroblast cells were seeded 5 h prior to transfection at a density of 1.3 × 104cells/cm2. Cells were co-transfected with 30 μg of pSG5-PI-TPα and 10 μg of pSV2-neo (43Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique at a CO2 concentration of 7.5% (44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Fresh medium was added 20 h after transfection, and the next day the cells were seeded in new flasks at a density of 2500 cells/10 cm2. After 24 h, neomycin (400 μg/ml Geneticin G418) was added for the selection of neomycin-resistant cells. Fresh medium containing neomycin was added every 4 days, and resistant clones were identified after 2 or 3 weeks of growth. The PI-TPα content of several neomycin-resistant clones was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PI-TP antibodies. Confluent cell cultures were washed twice with PBS0 (phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and removed from the dish by incubation with 8 mm EGTA in PBS0 for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was stored at −20 °C. A cell homogenate in 0.1 ml of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 m sucrose) was prepared in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by sonication (1 min at 50 watts). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 17,000 ×g, and the A 280 of the supernatant was used to calculate the protein content. 17.5 μg of supernatant protein was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylmide gel, and gel electrophoresis was performed as described (39Snoek G.T. de Wit I.S.C. van Mourik J.H.G. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet in a Multiphor II Nova Blot electrophoretic transfer unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature applying 1 mA/cm2 of gel for 2 h, and PI-TPα was detected as described (39Snoek G.T. de Wit I.S.C. van Mourik J.H.G. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Quantification of the PI-TPα levels on an immunoblot was performed by scanning with a Bio-Rad GS 700 imaging densitometer equipped with an integrating program, with known PI-TPα concentrations as a standard. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104cells/dish (9 cm2) in DMEM containing 10% NCS. Cell growth was determined by counting the cells every day for 9 days (in duplicate). The saturation density of the different cell lines was determined by seeding 105 cells/dish (9 cm2), and the number of cells was determined after 7 days (in triplicate). The medium was changed every 3 days in both assays. To determine the ability of the different cell lines to grow in soft agar, 2 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.3% agar in DMEM containing 10% NCS and layered on 0.5% agar in the same medium. Fresh medium was added every 5 days. The colony growth was determined after 3 weeks. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm EDTA in PBS and washed once with PBS. The cells were fixed in PBS/methanol (3:7, v/v) for 20 min at 4 °C. A 9-fold excess of PBS was added, and the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing RNase A (1 mg/ml). Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were diluted 10-fold with PBS before analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Two methods were used to analyze the inositol metabolites. The first method was used to obtain a quantitative preparation of the water-soluble total inositol phosphate (IP n ) fraction. The second method was used to analyze the composition of the inositol phosphate fraction and of the inositol phospholipids. The cells were grown in a six-well plate. 60–70% confluent cell cultures were incubated for 48 h with 1 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol in HEPES-buffered DF medium without inositol, containing 2% dialyzed NCS. Cultures were washed twice with PBS0 and scraped in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm LiCl. The cells were sonicated for 1 min in a sonication bath (Branson 1200), and a small sample was removed for protein determination. The cells were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer method (45Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 96: 634-643Google Scholar). Upon phase separation, the organic phase was washed twice with MeOH/CHCl3, and the water phases were combined and loaded on a Seppak column (Waters AccellTM Plus QMA Cartridges) Freemyo-[3H]inositol was eluted from the column by water, and the total IP n fraction was eluted with 500 mm triethyl ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The organic phase, including the protein layer, was acidified by the addition of 0.03 n HCl and washed twice with H2O/MeOH/0.03 n HCl. The inositol phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography. The cells were grown in a 12-well plate and labeled as in method 1 except that 5 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol was used. After labeling, the cells were stimulated for 10 min with PDGF (20 ng/ml) or bombesin (10 nm). Prior to stimulation, 0.5 ml of DF medium without inositol, containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 10 mmLiCl, was added to the cells. After 10 min at 37 °C, the incubation was continued for 15 min in the absence or presence of the growth factors. Cultures were washed twice with PBS0 and harvested by scraping in 1 ml of −20 °C MeOH. myo-[3H]Inositol, the inositol phosphate fraction, and the inositol phospholipids were extracted and analyzed as described previously (29Falasca M. Corda D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Falasca M. Silletta M.G. Carvelli A. Di Francesco A.L. Fusco A. Ramakrishna V. Corda D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar). wtNIH3T3 cells were labeled to equilibrium withmyo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi) for 48 h in 5 ml of DF medium without inositol containing 2% dialyzed NCS/50-cm2 dish. The cells were scraped in 1.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 350 mm sucrose, 154 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and homogenized by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 rpm for 2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and cell debris, and 0.4 ml of the supernatant, containing about 600,000 dpm in [3H]inositol derivatives, was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (5 mm) and PI-TPα. Lipid extraction and analysis were performed as described in method 2 (see above). The cDNA encoding mouse PI-TPα (9Geijtenbeek T.B.H. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector pSG5, and the vector with PI-TPα in the sense orientation is denoted as pSG5-PI-TPα. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were co-transfected with both the pSG5-PI-TPα and pSV2-neo vectors or with only the pSV2-neo vector (control) by a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique (44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected by using the antibiotic Geneticin G418. Several hundred positive neomycin-resistant clones appeared after 2 weeks. From these clones, we selected three stable clones transfected with only the control pSV2-neo vector and 15 clones co-transfected with both the pSG5-PI-TPα and the pSV2-neo vector. The stable clones transfected with the control vector (pSV2-neo) are denoted as OPIx (control vector, clone x), and the clones co-transfected with both pSG5-PI-TPα and pSV2-neo are denoted as SPIx (sense PI-TPα, clone x). The level of PI-TPα expression in these clones was estimated by immunoblotting of the cytosolic fractions of the cells. Two cell lines, SPI6 and SPI8, were selected because they express an increased level of PI-TPα as compared with OPI3 and wtNIH3T3 cells. Scanning of the immunostained PI-TPα bands indicated that the transfected cell lines SPI6 and SPI8 show a 2- and 3-fold increase in the PI-TPα level, respectively, as compared with the wtNIH3T3 and OPI3 cells (Fig. 1 A). Clones that expressed increased amounts of PI-TPα displayed an altered morphology (Fig. 1 B). These cells (panels 2 and 3) were somewhat smaller and rounder than wtNIH3T3 fibroblasts (panel 1). The stably transfected cell lines displayed an increased growth rate and a higher cell density at confluency (Table I). The doubling time decreased from 21 h for wtNIH3T3 and OPI3 to 13–14 h for SPI6 and SPI8. In addition, the maximal cell density when the cultures are fully confluent increased from 0.20 × 105cells/cm2 for wtNIH3T3 cells (or OPI3 cells, 0.16 × 105 cells/cm2) to 0.53 × 105cells/cm2 for SPI6 and SPI8. Despite the difference in expression of PI-TPα between SPI6 and SPI8 cells, no significant difference in growth rate or saturation density was observed.Table IGrowth characteristics of the cells that are transfected with the cDNA encoding mouse P1-TPαCell lineCell cycle durationSaturation densityCells in S phase/mitosisDuration of G1h×10 5 cells/cm 2%hwtNIH3T3210.20 ± 0.23813OPI3210.16 ± 0.23513SPI6140.53 ± 0.3438SPI8130.53 ± 0.2467 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the cellular DNA content in exponentially growing cell cultures by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that in wtNIH3T3 cells and in OPI3 cells, respectively, 38 and 35% of the cells were in the S phase/mitosis. For SPI6 cells and SPI8 cells, this percentage was 43 and 46%, respectively (Table I). From these values, and from the duration of the full cell cycle, it was calculated that the G1 phase is significantly shorter in SPI6 cells and SPI8 cells (7–8 h) than the G1 phase in wtNIH3T3 cells or in OPI3 cells (13 h, Table I). Confluent monolayers of wtNIH3T3 and SPI6/SPI8 cells were different. At full confluency, wtNIH3T3 cultures shed dead cells, while SPI6/SPI8 monolayers started to curl up from the edges of the culture dish, forming a “solid” piece of tissue after some time, indicating a different interaction between the cells. To investigate whether increased expression of PI-TPα led to anchorage-independent growth of the cells, the capacity of the cells to grow in soft agar was investigated. However, none of the cell lines were able to form colonies in soft agar. Therefore, increased expression of PI-TPα does not lead to a loss of contact inhibition or to transformation. In order to investigate whether overexpression of PI-TPα affects the metabolism of the inositol phospholipids, the SPI8/SPI6 cells and wtNIH3T3 cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol, and the relative incorporation in the inositol derivatives was determined as described in method 1. After equilibrium labeling of the cells (experimentally established by comparing various periods of labeling) the 3H label in the total IP n fraction was determined (Fig. 2). In wtNIH3T3 cells, 4.4% of the myo-[3H]inositol was incorporated in the IP n fraction. The addition of LiCl had no significant effect on the incorporation. However, incubation with bombesin, in the presence of LiCl, led to a 2–3-fold increase in the incorporation ofmyo-[3H]inositol in the IP n fraction (Fig. 2). In the SPI6 and SPI8 cells, the percentage of incorporation in the IP n fraction was 2–3-fold higher as compared with wtNIH3T3 cells. Incubation with LiCl or with bombesin (in the presence of LiCl) did not further increase the level of incorporation. This indicates that the stimulation of the PLC-mediated degradation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is impaired in the cells overexpressing PI-TPα. TLC analysis of the inositol phospholipid fraction showed that the relative incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol in PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 was similar for wtNIH3T3, SPI6, and SPI8 cells (data not shown).

Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the G protein βγ complex has been shown to directly modulate effector function and is required for receptor interaction of the G protein, the individual functions of these γ subunits are still unclear. Reconstitution assays with rhodopsin and Gt indicated that G protein coupling with a receptor involves specific contact of the γ1 subunit COOH terminal with the receptor (2Kisselev O.G.

To test whether the COOH-terminal domains of other γ subunits are involved in receptor interaction we have examined the effect of a peptide from the γ5 subunit type on muscarinic receptor signaling. γ5 is expressed abundantly in the heart similar to the muscarinic receptor, M2 (4Peralta E.G.

We examined the effect of the γ5 COOH-terminal peptide on the activation of Gi2 reconstituted with the M2 receptor. To examine the effect of the peptide in cells, we injected a peptide specific to the γ5 COOH terminus into superior cervical ganglion (SCG)1 neurons and measured receptor modulation of N-type Ca2+ current (I ca). SCG neurons contain the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors which inhibit N-type Ca2+ channels through Gq and Go, respectively (6Caulfield M.P. Jones S. Vallis Y. Buckley N.J. Kim G.D. Milligan G.

This variety of receptors modulating the activity of a common effector allowed us to assess the specificity of the γ5 peptide action. The effect of γ5 peptides as well as peptides from γ7 and γ12, on these pathways was examined. Finally, to test the effect of the γ5 peptide on the central nervous system, we introduced the γ5 peptide into postsynaptic neurons in a spinal cord slice and measured the modulation of glutamate receptor mediated synaptic current by muscarinic and α2-adrenergic receptors (8Li P. Zhuo M. Nature. 1998; 393: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). [3H]N-methylscopolamine and [35S]GTPγS were from NEN Life Science Products. Somatostatin was from Peninsula.

Solid peptide synthesis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis were performed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine. Geranylgeranylation was performed and checked as described (12Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were as follows: γ5 peptide, VSSSTNPFRPQKVC or a shorter version, STNPFRPQKVC; γ5 scrambled peptide, PSRTPVNFSQVSKC; γ7, SENPFKDKKPC; and γ12, SENPFKDKKTC. The shorter γ5 wild type peptide was used in all electrophysiological assays. Patch clamp experiments were done on 1-day-cultured SCG neurons from 2- to 4-week-old male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Neurons were dissociated, and plated as described (13Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

To deplete endogenous G protein subunits membranes were washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 m urea, 100 μm GTPγS. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to β1 showed a significant decrease in that subunit after this treatment. Whole-cell recording ofI Ca used 50–60% compensation of series resistance. I Ca current records were sampled (25 kHz). Voltage-dependent inhibition ofI Ca was studied with two 10-ms test pulses to +10 mV, from a holding voltage at −80 mV, one before (P1) and other (P2) after a 25-ms prepulse to +125 mV. Facilitation ratio and amplitude of I Ca were measured as described (19Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Agonist-mediated inhibition of I Ca was quantified only for the P1 test pulse. To avoid one source of systematic bias, control and experimental measurements were alternated in each set of experiments. SCG neurons were pressure-injected with Gγ peptides by using an Eppendorf transjector system. Injection pipettes were filled with a solution containing 50 μmgeranylgeranylated γ subunit-peptides and 0.05% dextran-fluorescein (M r = 10,000) as injection marker. After injection, cells were returned to the incubator and 1–2 h later were transferred to a 50-μl chamber for I Carecording. Experiments were done at 25 °C. To block Na+ and l-type Ca2+ currents, 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin and 2 μm nifedipine were added to Ringer's solution. External and internal solution compositions were as described (13Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Spinal cord slices were prepared and whole-cell recordings performed as described previously (8Li P. Zhuo M. Nature. 1998; 393: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Peptide was included in the solution in the recording pipette (see Ref. 8Li P. Zhuo M. Nature. 1998; 393: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Carbachol effect was measured 30 min after first EPSC was recorded. Agonists were applied in bath solution (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) for 10 min and then washed out with bath solution (∼10 min). 10 μm bicuculline methiodide and 1 μm strychnine hydrochloride were present in the bath solution throughout the experiment. Statistical comparisons were made with the use of one-way analyses of variance (Dunnett test for post-hoc comparison) or Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Membranes from CHO cells expressing high levels of M2 receptor were depleted of endogenous G protein subunits as described in the methods section and assayed for activity by binding of antagonist. The receptors bound [3H]N-methylscopolamine with a dissociation constant of 0.35 nm. When M2 containing membranes were reconstituted with heterotrimeric Gi2 (under conditions similar to those in Fig. 1 B), GTPγS binding by the G protein was stimulated 5-fold by the agonist, carbachol, compared with the antagonist, atropine (data not shown). Little or no GTPγS was incorporated (i) in the absence of the G protein heterotrimer, (ii) in the presence of the α subunit alone, or (iii) in the presence of the βγ complex alone. These results indicated that the membranes were free of functional G proteins and that the M2 receptors in this preparation were functional with properties similar to those previously reported (17Beech D.J. Bernheim L. Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To examine interaction between the M2 receptor and a γ subunit, γ5, we synthesized a 14-amino acid peptide specific to the COOH-terminal sequence of γ5 and chemically modified it with geranylgeranyl, a C-20 isoprenoid that is post translationally added to the COOH-terminal cysteine of most γ subunits (1Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The γ5 peptide was then tested for its ability to inhibit G protein activation. If the γ subunit tail of Giinteracts with M2, the peptide should compete with the heterotrimer for a site on the receptor. Results in Fig. 1 B show that the wild type peptide significantly reduced the rate of agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding by the G protein. A peptide with the same amino acids scrambled was significantly less effective, indicating that this effect was sequence specific (Fig. 1 B). Heterotrimerization of a G protein is essential for receptor interaction (16Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of G protein activation was due to the disruption of the heterotrimer by the γ5 peptide, an experiment was performed under conditions similar to the receptor assays (described in Fig. 1 C). The hexahistidine-tagged βγ complex was brought down with resin containing Ni2+. Although aluminum fluoride disrupted the heterotrimer (Fig. 1 C, compare lane3 with lane 2), both in the absence and in the presence of the wild type γ5 peptide similar amounts of αi2 were co-eluted with β1His-γ2 (Fig. 1 C, compare lane 5 with lane 1). This indicated that the heterotrimer was not disrupted by the γ5 peptide. To test the effect of peptides specific to the COOH-terminal region of the γ5 subunit on signaling in cells, cultured SCG neurons were injected with a wild type γ5 peptide or the γ5 peptide with the amino acid sequence scrambled (γ5 s) (described under “Materials and Methods”). The effect of maximal concentration of the muscarinic agonist oxo-M was measured onI Ca amplitude and on the facilitation ratio. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, voltage-dependent inhibition was revealed by inserting a depolarizing prepulse. In the cells injected with the γ5-scrambled peptide, I Ca amplitude was little affected by the prepulse in the absence of agonist (C1 compared withC2 and open circles compared with filled circles on plot). Oxo-M produced a large inhibition ofI Ca that could be partially relieved by the prepulse, thereby increasing the facilitation ratio from 1.11 to 2.22. In uninjected cells and in cells injected with the γ5-scrambled peptide, oxo-M increased the facilitation ratio and inhibitedI Ca, similarly (Fig. 2, C andD). Thus, cytoplasmic injection by itself did not disrupt muscarinic signaling. In contrast, muscarinic modulation ofI Ca was substantially different in the γ5 peptide-injected cell: first, inhibition was smaller (compareC1 and O1 records in Fig. 2 B); second, the +125 mV prepulse was less effective in relievingI Ca suppression (compare O1 andO2 records and open and filled triangles in Fig. 2 B). Indeed, in 13 neurons injected with the γ5 peptide, oxo-M inhibited I Ca by only 31.8% (Fig. 2 D) and increased facilitation ratio from 1.08 to only 1.33 (Fig. 2 C). Thus the γ5 peptide blocked the voltage-dependent inhibition ofI Ca mediated by M4 receptors. We wanted to assess in the same neurons whether the γ5 peptide disrupted modulation ofI Ca by other Go-coupled receptors, namely α2-adrenergic or somatostatin receptors. Therefore, after I Ca recovered upon oxo-M and Cd2+ treatment, neurons were challenged with norepinephrine or somatostatin. Table I summarizes the results. Here, because there were no statistically significant differences between uninjected cells and cells injected with γ5 scrambled peptide, we pooled together both samples (control) to facilitate comparison with the γ5 peptide-injected cells. Neither voltage-dependent inhibition of I Caby norepinephrine nor by somatostatin were affected by the γ5 peptide. In SCG neurons I Ca is also suppressed by M1 muscarinic receptors in a voltage-independent and pertussis toxin-insensitive manner (13Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Inhibition by M1 receptors occurs through the G protein Gq (7Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Dayrell M. Haley J.E. Milligan G. Caulfield M.P. Brown D.A. Buckley N.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that disruption of the M1-mediated signaling pathway might contribute to the smaller muscarinic inhibition of I Ca in γ5 peptide-injected neurons (Fig. 2 D). This hypothesis was tested by injecting γ5 peptide into pertussis toxin-treated cells. Pertussis toxin blocks the voltage-dependent, M4-mediated component of I Ca modulation leaving intact the voltage-independent component (17Beech D.J. Bernheim L. Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because M1 receptors also use the same signaling pathway to suppress the K+current named M-current (13Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of the γ5 peptide on suppression of M-current. The γ5 peptide did not block M1-mediated inhibition of ICa or M-current (not shown). Furthermore, the γ5 peptide lacking the geranylgeranyl moiety failed to prevent voltage-dependent inhibition ofI Ca (Table II). Thus both the amino acid sequence of the γ5 subunit COOH terminus and the prenyl group are essential for activity.Table Iγ5 peptide does not prevent α2-adrenergic and somatostatin-induced inhibition of I CaNorepinephrineaAfter oxo-M treatment, most cells from Fig. 1 were perfused with 10 μm norepinephrine or 500 nmsomatostatin.SomatostatinaAfter oxo-M treatment, most cells from Fig. 1 were perfused with 10 μm norepinephrine or 500 nmsomatostatin.Control (n = 10)γ5 peptide (n = 6)Control (n = 7)γ5 peptide (n= 6)% Inhibition76.1 ± 4.275.7 ± 5.970.0 ± 4.261.0 ± 5.9Basal facilitation ratio1.03 ± 0.011.09 ± 0.020.98 ± 0.011.01 ± 0.02Facilitation ratio2.20 ± 0.152.42 ± 0.282.00 ± 0.201.84 ± 0.15a After oxo-M treatment, most cells from Fig. 1 were perfused with 10 μm norepinephrine or 500 nmsomatostatin.

Open table in a new tab Since the γ5 peptide reduces only M4-mediated voltage-dependent inhibition of ICa and not that stimulated by the adrenergic or somatostatin receptors, we wanted to test whether this selective action is shared by other carboxyl-terminal γ subunit type peptides. Table II summarizes data from neurons injected with geranylgeranylated γ7 or γ12 peptides. The γ7 and γ12 subunit types are distinct and are grouped in a different subfamily from γ5 (1Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Neither the γ7 nor the γ12 peptide affect voltage-dependent inhibition of I Ca by oxo-M. In spinal cord slices, electrical stimulation of the dorsal root entry zone evokes EPSCs which are mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxozole propionic acid and kainate receptors (18Li P. Wilding T.J. Kim S.J. Calejesan A.A. Huettner J.E. Zhuo M. Nature. 1999; 397: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Bath application of carbachol or clonidine, an agonist of the α2-adrenergic receptor, significantly decreased EPSCs (Fig. 3, A and B). Postsynaptic application of the γ5 scrambled peptide had no effect on the inhibition of EPSCs by carbachol (Fig. 3, A andC). However, the wild type γ5 peptide significantly relieved this inhibition by carbachol but not by clonidine (Fig. 3). These results confirm the ability of the γ5 peptide to specifically disrupt signaling from muscarinic receptors in the spinal cord. The receptors that use Go to modulate Ca2+channels in SCG neurons are known to act through the G protein βγ complex (19Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 20Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the effect of the γ5 peptide is that it competes for a site on the Ca2+ channel with the βγ complex released on receptor activation. However, in the experiments presented here, the γ5 peptide inhibits G protein activation by muscarinic receptors in a reconstituted system and also selectively disrupts signaling from the same class of receptors in intact cells. It seems more likely therefore, that the peptide competes with the βγ complex for a site on the receptor rather than the effector. Among members of the muscarinic receptor family it is known that M2 and M4 share similar properties in terms of G protein coupling (21Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Cell. 1989; 56: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Dell'Acqua M.L. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5676-5685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the γ5 peptide to inhibit M2 activation of a G protein in a reconstituted system and also inhibit signaling from M4 receptors in intact cells implies that the γ5 peptide interacts with this class of muscarinic receptors. The inability of the γ7 and γ12 peptides to affect signaling from M4 in combination with the inability of γ5 to affect signaling from receptors other than M4 indicate a high degree of specificity in the action of the peptide. Past findings where antisense oligonucleotides specific to two different γ subunits inhibited the action of the muscarinic and somatostatin receptor signaling indicated that G protein γ subunit types may have a specific role in signaling (23Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Results from the analysis of rhodopsin coupling to Gt with different γ subunit types indicated specificity between γ subunit types and a receptor at the protein level (24Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results here indicate that there may be selectivity in the interaction between γ subunit types and receptors. Furthermore, the indication of such specificity in intact cells raises the possibility that peptides from the γ subunits and their more potent analogues can be used to selectively disrupt individual pathways in a signaling network.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sutherland, MA1992: 127-130Google Scholar). Biophysically, N-type inactivation has long served as the model for gating transitions in ion channels and is realized by a “ball plug-in” mechanism. In this mechanism a protein domain termed “inactivation gate” or “inactivation ball” binds to its receptor at the inner vestibule of the open channel and thereby occludes the ion pathway (2Armstrong C.

Such inactivation gates have been localized in the N terminus of various Kvα subunits and were shown to be functional entities,i.e. they conferred rapid inactivation to “ball-less” Kvα subunits when applied to the cytoplasmic side of the channels as synthetic peptides (5Murrell-Lagnado R.D.

Identical to protein-harbored inactivation domains, the synthetic gates interacted with channels in the open state, blocked the pore with low voltage dependence, and were competed with the channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) (9MacKinnon R.

Besides with Kvα subunits owning an N-terminal ID, fast inactivation was observed for a subset of non-inactivating Kvα1 channels when coexpressed with certain β-subunits (15Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

These auxiliary subunits constitute a family of cytoplasmic proteins (subdivided into subfamilies Kvβ1, -2, and -3) that are made up of two distinct regions: a highly conserved core region that shows homology to the superfamily of aldo-keto reductases and a variable N terminus (18McCormack K.

Fig. 1 A, depicts the mechanism for inactivation of a non-inactivating Kvα1 subunit by the coexpressed β-subunit, Kvβ1.1. Kvβ constitutively (and specifically) binds to the Kvα1-subunit via the conserved core region (20Yu W. Xu J. Li M.

The latter should contain a “ball-like” domain that occludes the channel pore from the cytoplasmic side similar as known for IDs derived from α-subunits. This view is mainly supported by two findings. First, β-induced inactivation was absent when the N terminus of Kvβ1.1 was deleted, and second, inactivation was sensitive to oxidation, similar to that reported for inactivation in fast inactivating Kv channels (16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Although this suggested an N-type mechanism of inactivation, the “β-ball” was never tested for competition with TEA. This competition is considered indicative for N-type inactivation (9MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 10Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is puzzling controversy on the functionality of a peptide that comprises the N-terminal 24 amino acids of Kvβ1.1 and is supposed to constitute the β-ball. This peptide induced inactivation in some experiments (16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) but failed in others (22Stephens G.J. Cockett M.I. Nawoschik S.P. Schecter L.E. Owen D.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although the coexpressed Kvβ1.1 subunit inactivated the Kvα1 subunit in either case. To get insight into the molecular mechanism of fast β-mediated inactivation, we investigated structure and function of the hydrophilic Kvβ1.1 N terminus using NMR spectroscopy and giant patch clamp recording on a synthetic peptide (βN-(1–62)) that covers the entire hydrophilic domain N-terminal to the well conserved core region of Kvβ1.1. Kv1.1 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described elsewhere (23Fakler B. Brändle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Giant patch recordings were made at room temperature (approximately 23° C) 3–7 days after injection of capped Kv1.1-specific cRNA. Pipettes used were made from thick walled borosilicate glass, had resistances of 0.3–0.6 megaohm (tip diameter of about 20 μm), and were filled with 5 mm KCl, 115 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.8 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.2). Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and corrected for capacitative transients with an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Lamprecht, Germany) with an analog filter set to 3 kHz (−3 decibel). The fast application system used is described elsewhere (8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct.

The βN-(1–62) peptide was made by conventional solid-phase synthesis and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (25Frank R. Gausepohl H. Modern Methods in Protein Chemistry. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1988Google Scholar); the mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry. 5.4 mg of βN-(1–62) was dissolved in 99.9% D2O as well as in a solution of 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The final peptide concentration was 1.6 mm, pH 3.3. To verify structural properties under physiological conditions, NMR experiments were also performed on βN-(1–62) dissolved in a physiological salt solution (90 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm Mg2Cl) at pH 6.6. NMR spectra were recorded at 283 K with a Bruker DRX 600 and Bruker DMX 800 spectrometer. Spin system identification and sequential assignments were accomplished by two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY (26Jeener J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4805) Google Scholar), total correlation spectroscopy (27Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3075) Google Scholar), and DQF-COSY (28Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) experiments. NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 250 ms; total correlation spectroscopy experiments were acquired with isotropic mixing times of 80 ms.3JHNHα coupling constants were measured by high-resolution DQF-COSY spectra. The digital resolution of the time domain data used in thet 2 direction was 0.77 Hz/point. The time proportional phase increments method was used for signal detection in the ω1-direction; for water suppression a binomial pulse sequence with gradients as well as presaturation technique was employed. 1H chemical shifts were referred to the internal standard of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. NMR data were processed with XWINNMR (Bruker). Spectral assignment was performed by AURELIA (29Neidig K.P. Geyer M. Görler A. Antz C. Saffrich R. Beneicke W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) according to standard procedures using total correlation spectroscopy and DQF-COSY spectra for identification of spin systems and NOESY spectra for sequence-specific assignment. Amide-Hα coupling constants3JHNHα were obtained by fitting the corresponding DQF-COSY peaks to two antiphase Lorentzian functions. Proton-proton distances were calculated from the volumes of the NOESY spectra using δ-proline protons with a known separation of 0.18 nm as reference. NOESY cross peaks were integrated by the automated segmentation procedure, which is part of the AURELIA software package. Prior to first order H/D exchange rate determination the peptide was lyophilized of a 90% H2O, 10% D2O solution. To evaluate the exchange rates, the peptide was dissolved in 99.9% D2O, and a one-dimensional NMR spectrum was recorded within less than 3 min. The functional characteristics of βN-(1–62) were tested in inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing non-inactivating Kv1.1 channels. As shown in Fig. 1 B, βN-(1–62) induced rapid inactivation of these channels when present at 50 μm on the cytoplasmic side of the patch; the time-course of inactivation depended on the peptide concentration (not shown). βN-(1–62) blocked Kv1.1 channels only in the open state (Fig. 1 B), similar to IDs derived from Kvα subunits (6Ruppersberg J.P. Frank R. Pongs O. Stocker M. Nature. 1991; 353: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The latter are known to interact with a receptor that becomes accessible upon opening of the channel and that is competed by the “open channel blocker” TEA (9MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar,10Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, βN-(1–62)-induced inactivation was investigated in the presence of 1 mm TEA, a concentration which blocked about two-thirds of open Kv1.1 channels. As shown in Fig. 1,C–E, the time-course of βN-(1–62)-mediated inactivation was slowed down by about a factor of 3 (time constants for inactivation in the absence and presence of TEA were 8.0 ± 1.7 and 22.2 ± 3.0, respectively) consistent with the peptide and TEA competing for an overlapping binding site in the pore (11Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13357-13361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results suggested that βN-(1–62) inactivated Kv1.1 channels in a “ball-like manner” via interaction with a receptor site on the α-subunit that is accessible only in the open state. The interaction between βN-(1–62) and the channel α-subunit was more closely investigated by the “fast application” technique. This technique (see “Materials and Methods”) allows solution exchange at giant inside-out patches in less than 2 ms and enables separate determination for on and off rates of channel-peptide interaction (8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,24Oliver D. Hahn H. Antz C. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2318-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A andB, shows rapid application and wash-off of 50 μm βN-(1–62); these experiments were performed at a membrane potential of 0 mV under asymmetrical K+ conditions ([K+]ex 5 mm, [K+]in 120 mm). Inactivation occurred with a time constant of ≈10 ms (10.3 ± 1.6 ms,n = 3) and was the same whether determined by fast application (left panel, first activation) or in the continuous presence of βN-(1–62) (left, second activation). Wash-off of βN-(1–62), which should reflect unbinding of the peptide from the receptor, exhibited a time constant of ≈100 ms (99.9 ± 16.8 ms, n = 3) and could be well fitted with a monoexponential (Fig. 2 B, right). This indicated that interaction between βN-(1–62) and its receptor on the α-subunit is a first order reaction, with on and off rates (k on, k off) calculated as 1.7 × 106 mol−1 s−1 and 10.3 s−1 (Fig. 2 C). These values were close to the rates determined for the “α-ball” from Shaker B channels (k on, 4.4 106mol−1 s−1, k off 13.8 s−1, (5Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), but differed from those found for the ID from Kv3.4 channels (Kv3.4-ID: k on, 10.2 × 106 mol−1 s−1;k off, 2.6 s−1, Fig. 2 C). The binding affinity of βN-(1–62) was about 25-fold lower than that of Kv3.4-ID, but almost equals that of the ShakerB-inactivation domain (5Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reason(s) for the largely different kinetics observed with the IDs from Shaker B and Kv3.4 channels are not well understood but might be related to their different tertiary structure. Kv3.4-ID shows a well defined and compactly folded three-dimensional structure, whereas the Shaker B ID does not have a unique structure in solution (13Schott M.K. Antz C. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Fernandez-Ballester G. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Criado M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biophys.

Biol. 1990; 55: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To get more insight into the structure-function basis of N-type inactivation in general and β1.1-mediated inactivation in particular, we investigated the structural properties of βN-(1–62) with NMR spectroscopy. Experiments were performed under various conditions, in aequous solution at low pH and in a physiological salt solution at neutral pH (see “Materials and Methods”). The spin systems were completely assigned by two-dimensional NMR methods in the low pH solution and verified under physiological salt and pH conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 3, only sequential NOE contacts were found, with the pattern of NOEs dominated by dαN, the NOE between the α-proton of an amino acid and the amide proton of the following ones. Stretches of consecutive amide-amide NOEs (dNN), indicative for formation of local structures, were absent as were intermediate or long range NOE contacts. All of the experimentally determined coupling constants between amide and α-protons showed values very close to those reported for random coil peptides (31Bundi A. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 185-297Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). This view was further supported by the deviations of amide and α-proton chemical shifts (ΔδHN and ΔδHα) from the random-coil values (32Wüthrich K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 177: 125-131Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 4, some of the shifts slightly deviated from random-coil values. However, analysis of the data with the chemical shift index by Wishard et al. (33Wishart D.S. Bigam C. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) did not lead to identification of a pattern typical for canonical secondary structures (Fig. 4, A and C). Nevertheless, upfield shifts (characteristic for helical structures) and downfield chemical shifts (characteristic for β-pleated structures) can be observed and are distributed nonuniformly over the sequence. This suggests transient formation of these structures in the thermal equilibrium. In addition, there are three stretches of downfield shifted amide resonances (between amino acids 2–10, 44–52, and 56–61) indicating a helical propensity in these regions. These results were essentially independent of whether the chemical shifts were determined under low pH or physiological salt and pH conditions (Fig. 4, B and D). Furthermore, experiments performed to determine the rates of H/D exchange of amide protons showed that all these protons were exchanged in <3 min., indicating that none of these protons are protected by formation of hydrogen bonds within an “internal structure.” Rather all amide protons are easily accessible from the solvent, as is typical for not compactly folded peptides. In summary, these results indicated that βN-(1–62) does not exhibit a well defined structure in solution, but rather behaves like a flexible peptide showing only transient formation of local structures. The results presented here show that Kvβ1.1 mediates fast inactivation of Kv1α subunits via an N-type mechanism of inactivation. Accordingly, the unique N terminus of Kvβ1.1 comprises a ball-like domain that blocks the channel via interaction with a receptor site that becomes accessible upon channel opening. This interaction is competed with TEA, very similar to what is known from α-derived IDs. As determined from NMR experiments, the hydrophilic N terminus of Kvβ1.1 does not exhibit a well defined, unique three-dimensional structure. Rather it can be described by a fast conformational equilibrium of weakly structured substates. With the structural and functional properties described above, the ID of Kvβ1.1 closely resembles the ID from Shaker B, but clearly differs from that of Kv3.4 (5Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct.

Thus, on rates of inactivation were significantly slower for the unstructured IDs compared with the structured Kv3.4-ID, whereas the respective off rates were considerably faster for the IDs from Shaker B and Kvβ1.1 than for Kv3.4-ID. Interestingly, on and off rates of inactivation mediated by the well ordered Kv3.4-ID changed considerably when its structure was disturbed by protein phosphorylation (8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Partial unfolding of the N-terminal hemisphere of the Kv3.4-ID resulted in a significant slowing of the on rate, whereas destabilization of the C-terminal hemisphere lead to an increase in the off rate of inactivation (8Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H. Ruppersberg J. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These correlations suggest that the structural properties of the IDs in solution affect the characteristics of their receptor binding. Thereby, a compactly folded ID exhibits faster access to its receptor than an unfolded domain, even if the latter is more positively charged (net charges are +2, +6, and +4 for IDs from Shaker, Kvβ1.1, and Kv3.4, respectively). Unbinding is much faster for the nonstructured domains compared with the folded. This may either be because of the higher number of molecular contacts (hydrogen bonds, etc.) formed between the folded domain and the receptor or because of the higher flexibility of the unfolded IDs that destabilizes the ID-receptor interaction. Taken together, the overall structural stability may represent a major determinant of the ID-channel interaction in addition to overall charge and the presence of hydrophobic domains, which were reported previously to govern on and off rates of this interaction (5Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 977-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The results about inactivation of Kv1.1 channels with the “core-free” N terminus of Kvβ1.1 differs from the results obtained from coexpression of both subunits. βN-(1–62) induced almost complete inactivation, whereas inactivation mediated by the entire Kvβ1.1 protein was found to be considerably less effective (15Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

This discrepancy might reflect some variation in binding of Kvβ1.1 to the N terminus of Kv1.1 or might be because of interaction of the α-β complex with other proteins affecting the mobility of the β-inactivation domain. Thus, it was recently suggested that the Kv1.1-Kvβ1.1 complex may interact with the Gβγ dimer, thereby increasing the degree of β-mediated inactivation (35Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We appreciate the help of Tanja Bauer with synthesis and purification of the β-peptide."

Regulation of this class of enzymes is complex: protein kinase C (2Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

The lipophilic product of PLD cleavage, phosphatidic acid (PA), acts as a second messenger in cells and has been shown to activate phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-γ1 (4Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibit adenylate cyclase (5Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5522-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (6Xu Y.J. Panagia V. Shao Q. Wang X. Dhalla N.S. Am. J.

The PLD secreted by Streptomyces chromofuscus is considerably smaller than the eukaryotic enzymes, although like those enzymes it requires Ca2+ for activity (8Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The bacterial PLD is not involved in signal transduction but has a role in phosphate retrieval; it may also play a role in promoting infections of the organism. The S. chromofuscus PLD is an unusual phospholipase in that it does not exhibit “interfacial activation” (preference for micellar rather than monomeric short chain phospholipid substrate (9Roberts M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) or “surface dilution” (dependence of enzyme specific activity on the mole fraction of substrate in a micelle or bilayer surface (10Dennis E.A. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 152-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) kinetics (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A ping-pong-like ordered binding mechanism has been proposed for the enzyme in which the substrate (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) binds and is converted to a covalent phosphatidyl-enzyme with release of the free base (e.g. choline), followed by water attacking the PLD-PA covalent adduct to release phosphatidic acid (12Holbrook P. Pannell L.K. Daly J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The nucleophilic attack of water on the distal phosphate ester bond results in cleavage of the P-O bond. The phosphatidyl-enzyme intermediate can be decomposed to a different phospholipid in the presence of a high concentration of a primary alcohol such as ethanolamine, serine, methanol, butanol, etc., a reaction used to generate different head group phospholipids (13Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Eibl H. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 633-639Google Scholar). S. chromofuscus PLD is dramatically activated for hydrolysis of PC packed in vesicles by the incorporation of PA (lyso-PA or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate) in the vesicle. The presence of PA increases the apparent V max and has little effect on the apparent K m (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other nonsubstrate anionic phospholipids such as PI or fatty acids do not activate the enzyme. This activation is allosteric because PA bilayers can activate the PLD toward diC4PC, a water-soluble substrate with no tendency to partition into bilayers (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two forms of S. chromofuscus PLD have been isolated from culture supernatants (15Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar): intact PLD that is a monomer with a molecular mass of 57 kDa (PLD57) and a tight complex of PLD that has been proteolytically cleaved near the C-terminal portion of the protein (PLD42/20, named for the apparent size of the two subunits on SDS-PAGE). Interestingly, PLD42/20 is more active than intact enzyme toward PC vesicles and toward monomeric substrates (dihexanoyl-phospholipids). Only the intact PLD57 can be activated by PA. One possible explanation for PA activation is that the negatively charged product anchors the enzyme to the zwitterionic PC surface for processive catalysis, although this cannot be the only explanation because PA bilayers enhance PLD57 cleavage of diC4PC (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present work is aimed at examining the binding affinity of S. chromofuscus PLD for PA, PC, and other phospholipid surfaces. Two different types of surfaces were used to measure protein binding to phospholipids: (i) hydrophobic beads (composed of styrene divinylbenzene (SDVB)) coated with a monolayer of phospholipid and (ii) unilamellar vesicles. The results show that PLD57 has a pH-dependent high affinity for POPA bilayers in the presence of EGTA that is weakened (at pH ≥ 7) as Ca2+or other divalent cations are added to the system. The proteolytically clipped PLD42/20 also binds tightly to POPA in the absence of metal ions at pH 8; isolated PLD42 has a considerably weaker affinity for POPA surfaces. In contrast to PA surfaces, all PLD forms exhibited very low affinity for PC interfaces with an increased binding when Ba2+ was added. The binding of PLD57 to PC was enhanced by preincubation of the enzyme with diC4PA, consistent with PA binding to an allosteric site and causing a conformational change of the protein to a form with a higher affinity for bilayer surfaces. All PLD forms also bound tightly to other anionic phospholipid surfaces (e.g. PS, PMe, and PI); however, this binding was not modulated by the addition of divalent cations. These results indicate that PLD partitioning to phospholipid surfaces and kinetic activation are two separate events. Crude S. chromofuscus PLD (lyophilized powder) was purchased from Sigma. DiC4PC, POPC, POPA, POPS, PI, and dioleoylphosphatidylmethanol were purchased from Avanti and used without further purification. Hitrap HIC and Hitrap Q columns and phenyl-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DiC4PA and diC4PMe were synthesized from diC4PC as described previously (11Geng D. Chura J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reaction progress was monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy (17Roberts M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the final product was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. SDVB beads were purchased from Seradyn and prepared for coating with phospholipids as described by Cho and co-workers (18Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205461) Google Scholar) was carried out using a Bio-Rad Mini Protein II vertical slab gel electrophoresis cell. Molecular mass standards (from Sigma) included bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), egg albumin (45 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), trypsinogen (24 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14 kDa). Crude PLD from Sigma was fractionated to yield PLD57, PLD42/20, and PLD20 using Hitrap HIC and Hitrap Q columns as described previously (15Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, chromatography on palmitoyl cellulose equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was used to isolate PLD42 from the other species (20Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 1639-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein was eluted with a Triton X-100 gradient from 0 to 0.5 mm; PLD activity of fractions was assayed toward 5 mm diC4PC using the pH-stat technique. The PLD species responsible for the activity were identified by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing PLD were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to remove the Triton X-100. PLD57 and PLD42 were cleanly isolated from this column; PLD20 was not detected in the eluants from the palmitoyl cellulose column. An alternate purification scheme to isolate PLD57 and PLD42 used chromatography of S. chromofuscus supernatant on a phenyl-Sepharose column. PLD fractions were eluted with a gradient of 1.0 to 0 mammonium sulfate. An appropriate aliquot of phospholipid dissolved in chloroform was evaporated under argon for 10–20 min. The resulting film was lyophilized and then resuspended in 1 mm EGTA (or EDTA), pH 8.0. For formation of small unilamellar vesicles, aqueous suspensions of the lipid were sonicated (using a Branson W-150 sonifier with a 1-cm-diameter probe) on ice in 3 × 10-min intervals. NaCl was added to the vesicles to a final concentration of 100 mm. Varying amounts of divalent cations (Ba2+ or Ca2+) were then added to the vesicles. The vesicles were often stored overnight at 4 °C and used the following day; PA vesicles could be stored for 1–2 days as long as the lipid concentration was <1 mm (vesicles aggregated and fused if stored longer). Higher concentration PA vesicles were used immediately. To control the maximum size of vesicles used in binding assays, all vesicle preparations were extruded through a 0.1-μm syringe filter (Gelman Sciences Supor Acrodisc 32 syringe filters) and used directly in binding experiments. Partitioning of PLD proteins to phospholipid vesicles was measured by adding 25–50 μg of protein to an aliquot of the vesicle solution. The samples were immediately vortexed, centrifuged, and filtered through an Amicon centricon-100 concentrator. PLD bound to vesicles stayed on the filter; free PLD passed through the filter and into the supernatant. There was always some protein “lost” during filtration (not accounted for on the filter or in the filtrate and presumably adhered to the filter and not easily eluted). This varied from 5% to at most 15% of the total protein. An equal volume of solution before and after filtration was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by pH-stat for activity toward 5 mm diC4PC (the pK a2 of short chain PA is 6.8 so that most of the product PA is titratable at pH 8.0) to measure the amount of PLD bound to the vesicles. Bound PLD (E b) was calculated by measuring total activity of PLD toward diC4PC (5 mm) in the absence of beads (E T) and comparing it with free PLD activity in the supernatant after filtration (E f): E b =E T − E f. Alternatively, intensities of PLD bands on SDS-PAGE before (E T) and after filtration (E f) were compared to estimate E b. The K D was derived from fitting the data to the equationEb /ET =Lo /(Lo + K D ), where L o is the total phospholipid concentration, and E b is bound enzyme. Lyophilized beads (100 mg) were suspended in hexane:methanol (1:1) containing 420 μm phospholipid. The bead suspension was gently vortexed; the coated beads were recovered by rotary evaporation over a warm (37 °C) water bath. Dried coated beads were resuspended in water to a concentration of 60 μm phospholipid, sonicated, and then washed until no floating beads remained. The coated beads were lyophilized overnight and then weighed out in tared Eppendorf tubes so that when resuspended in 250 μl of buffer the final concentration of phospholipid would range between 60 and 600 μm. For binding experiments where the ligand was varied, a fixed amount of enzyme was added to each tube (e.g. for PLD572.5 μg/500 μl). PMe-, PI-, and POPA-coated beads were incubated with PLD with gentle rocking for 10 min at room temperature. PLD binding to POPC and POPS vesicles could not be examined in the presence of Ca2+, because the enzyme would be active and generate PA under those conditions. Instead, Ba2+ was used and compared with vesicle binding of the enzymes in the presence of EGTA. Free PLD (E f) was separated from bound PLD (E b) by centrifugation; the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Bound PLD (E b) was calculated by measuring total activity of PLD toward diC4PC (5 mm) in the absence of beads (E T) and comparing it with free PLD activity in the supernatant after centrifugation (E f). When the enzyme concentration was fixed and phospholipid concentration was varied, the K D was derived as indicated above. In experiments with fixed phospholipid but varied enzyme, K D was derived from Eb = Lo /(1 +K D /Ef ). Cooperative binding was not considered. All datum points were done in at least duplicate (and often in triplicate). SDVB beads were not saturated with phospholipid at 60 μmbut were saturated when prepared in 600 μm bulk phospholipid (bead surface saturation by phospholipids occurred between 120–300 μm bulk phospholipid). Therefore, a qualitative comparison of PLD binding to SDVB beads at comparable total phospholipid concentration but different surface saturation was used to check for large differences in PLD affinity that could indicate PLD binding directly to uncoated beads. For a fixed total phospholipid concentration of 420 μm, there was only a slight decrease in PLD57 specific activity in the supernatant (indicating slightly more PLD57 binding to the beads) when beads were coated with 600 versus 60 μm phospholipid. Although PLD57 binds slightly more tightly to saturated beads, the difference is small and consistent with PLD57interacting with the phospholipid monolayer rather than the bead surface. The proteolytically clipped PLD42/20 bound to beads with a much stronger dependence on the bead coverage. To avoid complications of the PLD42/20 interacting differentially with the subsaturated beads, binding experiments were run at fixed ligand (420 μm) and varying PLD42/20. Both PLD57 and proteolytically cleaved fragments of PLD were examined for aggregate formation in the absence and presence of phospholipids and metal ions using the chemical cross-linking agent EDC, a heterobifunctional imide, obtained from Pierce. The cross-linking reaction was carried out in 100 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, with the pH between 6 and 7 (average 6.5) in the absence and presence of cations. PLD, ranging from 25 to 75 μg, and 10 mm EDC were incubated for various times at 30 °C or room temperature. Cross-linking studies with PLD and POPA or PI vesicles used incubation times of 30 min; studies with POPC used 10–30 min (to try and minimize production of PA by the high concentration of PLD, which is inhibited by Ba2+ but not totally). Excess reagent was quenched by increasing the pH to 9. Samples were analyzed using either a 6.5% denaturing gel or a 7.5–15% gradient denaturing gel. The amount of protein free and bound as well as protein lost (trapped in the centricon filters) was measured with NanoOrange Protein Quantitation Kit (Molecular Probes N-6666). The NanoOrange reagent (bound to protein) was excited at 480 nm, and the emission scanned from 570–590 nm. A known amount of PLD57or some proteolytic fragment was used to construct a standard curve. Two methods were used to measure PLD specific activity. To quantify free PLD in the binding studies, a pH-stat assay was used. Hydrolysis of 5 mm diC4PC to diC4PA was monitored with a Radiometer pH-stat model VIT90 as described previously (15Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using 5 mm NaOH as the titrant. For each phospholipid concentration, assays were run in duplicate or triplicate. For assays with unilamellar vesicles as the substrate, either 31P or 1H spectra were acquired to monitor PLD activity as described previously (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The assay buffer used was 50 mm imidazole in D2O buffer, pH 7.2 (meter reading). In the presence of EGTA and at pH 8.0, PLD57 bound quite tightly to the PA-coated SDVB beads; no activity for free PLD57 was detected in the supernatant under these conditions. Given the error in determining PLD specific activity (15%) and the smallest concentration of PA examined (10 μm), K D < 2 μm (Table I). Inclusion of Ca2+ (or Ba2+) in the binding buffer dramatically weakened the interaction of PLD with the PA-coated beads, and more free enzyme could be detected in the supernatant (Fig. 1). At a fixed metal ion concentration but with varying PA, the amount of enzyme bound to the beads was quantified and used to calculate a K D (Fig. 2). Increasing the Ca2+concentration from 2 to 5 mm (in the presence of 1 mm EGTA) increased the PLD57 K D for the PA from 12 to 215 μm (Fig. 2). In the presence of 5 mm Ba2+ instead of Ca2+, the PLD57 K D for PA-coated beads was 462 ± 21 μm (Table I). However, not all divalent ions were effective in releasing PLD57from PA surfaces. In the presence of Mg2+, PLD remained tightly bound to the PA-coated beads. The apparent affinity of Ca2+ for PA has been described in the literature as ranging from 0.5 to 5 mm. A large number of factors affect this interaction including pH, solution ionic strength, and the presence of divalent cations or cationic peptides. The change in PLD binding to PA in the presence of Ca2+ suggested that Ca2+ may compete very effectively with PLD for binding to PA surfaces.Table IEffect of metal ions on PLD binding to anionic phospholipid-coated SDVB beadsEnzymeCa2+aEGTA (1 mm) was present in the binding buffer along with the indicated concentration of metal ion.Ba2+aEGTA (1 mm) was present in the binding buffer along with the indicated concentration of metal ion.K DPAPIPMePSmmmmμmPLD5700<2<2<2<22012 ± 1.350215 ± 43294 ± 2005462 ± 21235 ± 211220 ± 180>1000PLD42/2000130 ± 15<10<5050536 ± 5305459 ± 31PLD4200757 ± 74052.0 ± 0.2a EGTA (1 mm) was present in the binding buffer along with the indicated concentration of metal ion.

In Fig. 3, lane 1 shows total enzyme (PLD57) prior to filtration, andlane 5 shows free enzyme after incubation with 0.5 mm POPA vesicles. Clearly, most of the PLD57was bound to the vesicle surface in the absence of divalent metal ions. The effects of pH and ionic strength on PLD partitioning to the bilayer surface were also monitored. The amount of free PLD was estimated from residual PLD activity in the filtrate toward diC4PC or by SDS-PAGE of the filtrate compared with sample prior to filtration. As the solution pH was decreased from 8 to 6, there was a significant decrease in the amount of PLD bound to the PA surface (Table II). Because pK a 2 for PA is ∼8.5 in pure PA bilayers (21Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the majority of the PA is monoanionic over this pH range and not changing significantly. Between pH 5 (16% bound) and 7 (78% bound), the PA is nearly all monoanionic; hence the large change in binding is not likely to result from changes in PA ionization. A more likely explanation is that a group on the enzyme (possibly a histidine) must be deprotonated for efficient binding of PLD to PA in the absence of Ca2+. Adding Ca2+ to the solution of PA vesicles enhanced PLD binding at acidic pH values (Table II). This suggests that a group(s) on the enzyme interacts with the metal ion to lower the pK a of the group that must be deprotonated for optimal binding of the protein to PA.Table IIpH dependence of PLD 57 (25 μg) binding to phospholipid (1 mm) unilamellar vesiclesPhospholipidM2+E b/E TCa2+Ba2+pH 5pH 6pH 7pH 8mmPA000.160.540.780.86200.500.65500.950.90PI000.240.240.550.57050.590.390100.410.28 Open table in a new tab PLD57 binding to POPA in the absence of divalent cations was also examined as a function of added NaCl. Increasing the NaCl from 0.1 to 1.0 m caused a large decrease in the amount of enzyme bound to the PA vesicles (Table III). The ability of high NaCl to inhibit PLD binding to PA indicates that the interaction has a large electrostatic component.Table IIIEffect of NaCl on PLD 57 (25 μg) binding to phospholipid vesicles at pH 8.0InterfaceBa2+NaClEnzyme boundaThe percentage of enzyme bound to vesicles is calculated as E b/E T × 100.mmm%POPA (0.5 mm)00.19400.29200.46000.65900.83601.034POPC (10 mm)40.15641.061POPEbPOPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine.

Open table in a new tab Intact PLD also bound tightly to other anionic phospholipid surfaces, both phospholipid-coated SDVB beads and unilamellar vesicles, in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (Table I). PLD57 bound to PI, PMe, and PS surfaces withK D < 2 μm. Again, as Ca2+(or Ba2+ in the case of substrates PS and PMe) was added, the PLD binding affinity decreased for the phospholipid. With the nonsubstrate and noninhibitor PI, PLD57 binding at pH 8.0 was the same whether Ca2+ or Ba2+ was added (e.g. K D values of 294 ± 20 and 235 ± 21 μm were obtained for PI at 4 mm (total cation minus EGTA concentration) Ba2+and Ca2+, respectively). As with PA, the interaction of the enzyme with PI was weaker at acidic pH and metal ions enhanced binding at low pH (Table II). Interestingly, PI, PMe, and PS do not activate PLD57 toward PC vesicles (11Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, binding to phospholipid surfaces alone is not sufficient for kinetic activation. The proteolytically clipped PLD where the two fragments are still associated was not activated by PA for hydrolysis of PC vesicles (15Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). How it interacts with PA surfaces could shed light on the mechanism for the kinetic activation. When incubated with 0.5 mm PA vesicles in the absence of divalent metal ions, PLD42/20bound well to the PA (Fig. 3, compare lane 4 with lane 8). Using PA-coated SDVB beads (Table I), theK D of PLD42/20 for PA in the presence of EGTA was considerably higher (K D = 130 ± 15 μm) than that of intact PLD57(K D <2 μm). However, theK D of the clipped enzyme for PMe and PS, both substrates of PLD42/20, was still low (<50 μm) in the presence of EGTA. Addition of Ba2+reduced the affinity of the PLD fragments for these anionic phospholipid surfaces as it did for the intact PLD. The 42-kDa fragment alone exhibited much weaker binding to anionic lipid surfaces irrespective of phospholipid identity and surface (Fig. 3, for vesicles compare lane 2 (total PLD42) with lane 6 (PLD42 in the filtrate); for SDVB beads see Table I). For example, the PLD42 K D for a PS monolayer in the presence of EGTA was 760 ± 75 μm compared with <2 μm for both PLD57 and clipped but associated PLD42/20(<50 μm). In the presence of 5 mmBa2+, the K D for PLD42binding to PA-coated SDVB beads was 2.0 ± 0.2 mm; theK D for PLD42/20 was 0.46 ± 0.03 mm. Thus, removal of the 20-kDa fragment weakened PLD binding to anionic phospholipid surfaces. The 20-kDa fragment exhibited the weakest interaction with PA vesicles (Fig. 3, compare lane 3 (total PLD42/20) with lane 7(PLD42/20 in the filtrate)) and PA-coated SDVB beads (no binding could be measured). These differences suggest that part of the PA activation phenomenon involves selective binding to PA in the presence of Ca2+ and that an intact C-terminal part of the protein is involved. In contrast to the tight binding to anionic phospholipid surfaces, either monolayers on beads or vesicles, PLD exhibited poor binding to PC surfaces in the presence of EGTA or EDTA. The binding was sufficiently weak that estimates of the PLD K D for PC-coated SDVB beads were >1 mm for intact PLD57 and associated PLD fragments (PLD42/20). The interaction of the enzyme with PC surfaces was examined in detail using PC unilamellar vesicles and monitoring the amount of PLD bound to the PC bilayer (Table IV). In the absence of divalent metal ions, isolated PLD fragments (PLD42 and PLD20) exhibite"

Using co-transfection assays, this study demonstrated that the hGABP complex mediated efficient activation of transcription from E4 promoter synergistically with activating transcription factor (ATF) 1 or cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), but not ATF2/CRE-BP1. This synergy also partially occurred when hGABPα was used alone in place of the combination of hGABPα and hGABPβ. hGABP activated an artificial promoter containing only ATF/CREB-binding sites under coexistence of ATF1 or CREB. Consistent with these results, physical interactions of hGABPα with ATF1 or CREB were observed in vitro. Functional domain analyses of the physical interactions revealed that the amino-terminal region of hGABPα bound to the DNA-binding domain of ATF1, which resulted in the formation of ternary complexes composed of ATF1, hGABPα, and hGABPβ. In contrast to hGABPα, hGABPβ did not significantly interact with ATF1 and CREB. Taken together, these results indicate that hGABP functionally interacts with selective members of the ATF/CREB family, and also suggest that synergy results from multiple interactions which mediate stabilization of large complexes within the regulatory elements of the promoter region, including DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding factors.

By itself, hGABPβ, which contains four notch/ankyrin-type repeats, neither binds to a specific sequence nor stimulates transcription, but has homodimerization activity via the carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper-like domain.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Members of the Ets family of DNA-binding proteins contain about an 85-amino acid region of similarity called the ETS domain, which is sufficient for direct DNA binding to a sequence containing a common 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ core motif (17Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Recently, partnerships between the Ets-related proteins and transcription factors belonging to other structural families have been reported, and their functional protein-protein interactions were shown to be important for regulation of gene expression (19Treier M. Bohmann D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1995; 83: 753-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Sieweke M.H. Tekatte H. Frampton J. Graf T.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The promoter of the adenovirus E4 contains not only an hGABP-binding site, but also several binding sites for the ATF/CREB family which has been revealed to be important for its activity by deletion analysis of the promoter (22Ooyama S. Imai T. Hanaka S. Handa H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Transcription factors belonging to the ATF/CREB family were found to be required for its efficient transcriptional activation in vitro (23Hai T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). But it is unclear how hGABP and members of ATF/CREB family regulate the transcription. In order to gain further insight into the transcriptional activator complex involved with the Ets-related protein hGABP, and to better understand the molecular basis of synergistic transcriptional regulation, we used co-transfection and biochemical assays to examine the possibility that hGABP can cooperate with some members of ATF/CREB family. Based on the studies presented here, we propose that hGABP functions as a transcriptional partner of ATF1 or CREB, leading to efficient transcription activation. Our data suggest that a functional synergy between these factors results from a multitude of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions which stabilize the large activator complex on promoter/enhancer elements. Luciferase reporter plasmid p4(hGABP-CRE)luc was constructed to insert the DNA fragment obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pTF1–4(C2AT) (3Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as a template into PicaGene PGV-B plasmid (Toyo-ink), the polymerase chain reaction product which contains four tandem repeats of 5′-AACGGAAGTGACGAA-3′ and TATA box sequence, derived from the adenovirus E4 promoter. Luciferase reporter plasmids p4(hGABPmt-CRE)luc, p4(hGABP-CREmt)luc, and p4(hGABPmt-CREmt)luc were generated to substitute the tandem repeats of p4(hGABP-CRE)luc for four tandem repeats of 5′-AACGCTAGTGACGAA-3′, 5′-AACGGAAGTGTGGAA-3′, and 5′-AACGCTAGTGTGGAA-3′, respectively. The pGEX/hGABPα plasmid, which encodes hGABPα fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) to its amino terminus (designated GST/hGABPα), was created by the insertion of aBamHI digested DNA fragment from hGABPα cDNA into pGEX/prehGABPα that was constructed by insertion of Klenow polymerase-treated NcoI DNA fragment from pET60 (4Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) into theSmaI site of the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T. The pGEX/hGABPα mutant plasmids, which encode various GST/hGABPα mutants were constructed using available restriction sites or polymerase chain reaction-mediated strategies. The pGEX/hGABPβ plasmids, which encode hGABPβ fused with GST to their amino terminus (designated GST/hGABPβ), were constructed by the insertion of Klenow polymerase-treated NcoI-BamHI DNA fragments from pET53 (4Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T. Restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments encoding the full-length of hGABPα and hGABPβ were cloned into NdeI-BamHI-digested pKA, a plasmid designed for the expression of a histidine-stretch and the phosphorylation target sequence of a catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-fused proteins to the amino terminus in Escherichia coli. The GST-ATF1 expression plasmid pGEX-ATF1 was described previously (24Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawase H. Hiramoto M. Ferudous A. Takayama M. Lee K.A. Hurst H.C. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a series of GST-ATF1 mutant expression plasmids were constructed using available restriction sites or polymerase chain reaction-mediated strategies. Expression plasmids for full-length hGABP subunits in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells (25Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were constructed as described previously (7Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of expression plasmids for full-length ATF1, pBS/ATF1 was constructed by insertion of a EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment containing ATF1 cDNA isolated from pGEM-ATF1 (gift of H. C. Hurst) (26Hurst H.C. Totty N.F. Jones C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) into the sites of EcoRI and HindIII of pBlueScriptII SK+. The DNA fragment encoding ATF1 was isolated from pBS/ATF1 by digestion with KpnI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the sites of KpnI and EcoRI of pA5CΔP to create an ATF1 expression plasmid, pA5CΔPATF1. The coding region for CREB was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pT7βCREB (gift of H. C. Hurst) (26Hurst H.C. Totty N.F. Jones C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as template, and the polymerase chain reaction product was then ligated into the site of SmaI of pUC119 to create pUC119/CREB. The CREB expression plasmid, pA5CΔP/CREB was constructed by insertion of an EcoRI-BamHI DNA fragment containing CREB cDNA isolated from pUC119/CREB into the site of BamHI and EcoRI of pA5CΔP. Nuclear extracts of HeLa cells were prepared according to Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). For the gel shift assay, hGABP and ATF/CREB family were purified from HeLa nuclear extract using the corresponding binding site-immobilized latex beads (28Inomota Y. Kawaguti H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each eluate was dialyzed against 0.05 TGKEDN (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). hGABP was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column on SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to separate the hGABPα and hGABPβ complex from the hGABPα and hGABPγ complex. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, BL21(DE3). The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% sucrose), lysed by sonication, and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until they were used forin vitro protein binding assays. hGABPα and hGABPβ with six histidine residues and a PKA phosphorylation site fused to their amino terminus, which were used in Figs. 5 and 6, and also expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3). These fused proteins were purified from supernatants on His-Bind Resin and dialyzed against 0.05 TGKEDN. They were stocked at −80 °C until they were used as32P-labeled proteins for GST pull-down assays. Recombinant hGABPα intact form used in Fig. 5 B was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) and purified from the bacteria extract using the hGABP-binding site-immobilized latex beads as described previously (9Suzuki F.

(3Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed using a 1% agarose gel containing 2.5% glycerol and TGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and 5 V/cm for 4 h. The DNA probes derived from adenovirus early 4 promoter was prepared by digesting pUCE4-20 (3Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and HindIII. The fragments were isolated using 10% polyacrylamide gel and32P-labeled by treatment with Klenow polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, followed by purification using a Nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). About 2 ng of the DNA probe was used for the binding reactions. SL2 cells were maintained as described previously (7Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 35-mm polystyrene dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/2 ml of medium per dish 5–10 h prior to transfection. DNA/CaPO4precipitates were formed by the dropwise addition of 100 μl of 0.25m CaCl2 containing the DNA to 100 μl of 2 × HBS (42 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 275 mmNaCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4) and added to the cells 25 min later. Transfection mixture contained 0.6 μg of reporter construct, 50 ng of the β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency and the indicated activators' expression plasmids. In each transfection assays, empty expression plasmid A5CΔP was added as necessary to achieve a constant amount of transfected DNA. After addition of DNA, cells were incubated at 27 °C and left undisturbed until the time of harvest 40 h later. Transfected SL2 cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, as described previously (7Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). N173 cells was established by transfection of pSV2/neo and an HA-tagged hGABPα expression plasmid pCHA/E4TF1–60 which was constructed to insert HA-tagged hGABPα cDNA into mammalian expression plasmid pCAGGS (29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar), and following two isolations of a colony in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml G418. The cell line was maintained in tissue culture dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml G418. N173 and HeLa monolayer cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were prepared as previous described (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The nuclear fraction and cytoplasm fraction were mixed and dialyzed against 0.1 TGKEDNP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 6 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed by adding anti-HA antibody HA.11 (Babco) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to 200 μl of the cell extract followed by rotation at room temperature for 2 h. The immunoprecipitation pellet was washed once with 200 μl of 0.1 TGKEDNP buffer, and antigens were released by five subsequent incubating for 3 min in 20 μl of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. Samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE and examined by immunoblotting experiment using antibodies against hGABPα, hGABPβ, CREB (Santa Cruz), and Sp1 (Santa Cruz) and the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins fused with both a histidine tag and a protein kinase A site and His-tagged ATF1 were phosphorylated by addition of 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 0.1 mm ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 units of PKA catalytic subunit (Promega), followed by incubation in 10 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl) at 30 °C for 30 min. The radiolabeled proteins were purified on His-Bind resin and subsequently loaded onto a Nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove [γ-32P]ATP and imidazole. For the in vitro binding assay, equal amounts (about 5 μg) of GST fusion proteins were immobilized on 3 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the corresponding volumes of the supernatants containing GST fusion proteins. The GST protein-immobilized beads were equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01∼0.05% Nonidet P-40). The beads were then incubated with about 1 ng of 32P-labeled proteins at 4 °C for 2 h and packed in a 1-ml syringe as an affinity column and then washed with 300 μl of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Released proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Protein interactions detected by surface plasmon resonance were performed using a BIACORE instrument BIACORE2000 (Biacore AB). Sensor Chip CM5 and GST Kit for fusion capture (Biacore AB) were used. For capture of GST fusion proteins, polyclonal goat anti-GST antibody was covalently coupled on the sensor chip surface using standard amine-coupling conditions. The supernatant of E. coli lysates containing GST fusion proteins were used for their immobilization on the sensor chip via anti-GST antibody. Sensor chips containing about 2,500 resonance units of GST fusion protein and running buffer 3 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20) were used for experiments. Different concentrations of analyte proteins were injected over the surface in a total volume of 250 μl of running buffer 3 at 30 μl/min continuous flow. After each protein injection, the sensor chip surfaces were washed with an injection of 2 m KCl at 30 μl/min continuous flow for 1 min to dissociate proteins interacting with the surface-bound GST fusion protein. All experiments were performed at 24 °C. Kinetics constants of the interactions were calculated by the analysis software BIAevalution, adapted to the modified sensorgrams. The E4 promoter has ATF/CREB-binding sites and an hGABP-binding site. To investigate whether hGABP and ATF/CREB family proteins exist on the promoter simultaneously to regulate its activity, gel shift assays were performed with probes derived from the E4 promoter (Fig. 1). This probe DNA contains an hGABP-binding site and a major and a minor recognition site for ATF/CREB family. As shown in Fig. 1, purified hGABP, containing both α and β subunits, formed α2β2heterotetramers with the probe as described previously (lanes 1 and 8). Members of the ATF/CREB family were prepared by purification from HeLa nuclear extract using DNA affinity beads (28Inomota Y. Kawaguti H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and ATF/CREB family proteins formed DNA-protein complexes with higher mobility (lane 2). When hGABPα/hGABPβ heterotetramers were incubated with purified ATF/CREB family proteins, a new complex with the least mobility appeared (lane 3). Three retarded bands appeared when HeLa nuclear extract was used (lane 7). The mobility of the three bands were similar to those of the three bands obtained by combination use of the purified proteins of hGABP and ATF/CREB family. In either case when the purified proteins or HeLa nuclear extract were used, the DNA-protein complex with the least mobility was competed out with both cold DNA fragments containing hGABP and ATF/CREB family recognition sequences, while the two complex with faster mobility disappeared by adding either competitor containing hGABP or ATF/CREB-binding sites (lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9). This result indicates that hGABP and the ATF/CREB family can bind to the E4 promoter simultaneously with sequence-specific interaction. To further examine whether the slowest migrated DNA-protein complex by HeLa nuclear extract contains hGABP and the ATF/CREB family, antibodies were used in gel shift assay. The most slowly migrated band was obviously reacted against both anti-hGABPβ and anti-CREB antibodies (lanes 13 and 15). These results show that hGABP and some members of the ATF/CREB family simultaneously bind to the adenovirus E4 promoter in a sequence-specific manner in vitro. To study which members of the ATF/CREB family functionally interact with hGABP, we performed co-transfection assays using D. melanogaster Schneider (SL2) cells with pE4-luci, a luciferase reporter gene under control of the adenovirus E4 promoter (7Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) (31Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (32Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fisher W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs W. Vale W.W.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) which is identical to ATF2 except for two amino acids) were examined as representative members of the ATF/CREB family because these three factors belonging to ATF/CREB family were reported to be involved in the regulation of adenovirus E4 gene (26Hurst H.C. Totty N.F. Jones C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Transfected ATF1 increased luciferase activity only slightly above background levels, even when large quantities were transfected (Fig. 2 A, solid columns). In contrast, co-transfections of increasing amounts of transfected ATF1 with constant amounts of hGABPα and hGABPβ led to a marked synergistic transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A, white columns). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the use of transfected CREB as substitute for transfected ATF1 (Fig. 2 B). But ATF2/CRE-BP1 transfected together with hGABP did not lead to a synergistic activation of transcription (Fig. 2 C). These results show that hGABP functionally interacts with ATF1 and CREB, but not ATF2/CRE-BP1, resulting in stimulation of synergistic transcription. To explore whether the synergy between hGABP and ATF1 or CREB entirely depends on the interactions to their binding sites on DNA, we used four luciferase reporter gene constructs. The p4(hGABP-CRE)luc reporter plasmid was constructed to be under control of an artificial promoter including four tandem repeats of an E4 promoter-derived DNA sequence containing both an hGABP-binding site and a CRE site (ATF/CREB family binding site). It is noted that the CRE sequence 5′-TGACGAAA-3′ is not a very good CRE site with some deference compared with the consensus one 5′-TGACGTCA-3′. The p4(hGABPmt-CRE)luc, p4(hGABP-CREmt)luc, and p4(hGABPmt-CREmt)luc reporter plasmids were also constructed to have mutations in their hGABP-binding sites, CREs, or both sites, respectively, resulting in the inability of each factor to bind to their reporter genes. Lack of the hGABP-binding motif resulted in no activation by transfected hGABPα and hGABPβ, even when large amounts of the expression plasmids were used (Fig. 3 A, compare solid columns 2–5 with white columns 2–5). But p4(hGABPmt-CRE)luc did not abrogate the ability of hGABP to synergistically activate transcription in the presence of co-transfected ATF1 or CREB (Fig. 3 A, solid columns 6–15). Importantly, the magnitude of the synergistic effect was reduced when compared with the reporter constructs p4(hGABP-CRE)luc (Fig. 3 A, compare solid columns 6–15 with white columns"

Recently, we revealed that Ca2+ entry could be activated in response to S-nitrosylation and that this process was stimulated by Ca2+ pool emptying (Favre, C. J., Ufret-Vincenty, C. A., Stone, M. R., Ma, H-T., and Gill, D. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 30855–30858). In DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells and DC-3F fibroblasts, Ca2+ entry activated by the lipophilic NO donor, GEA3162 (5-amino-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium), or the alkylator, N-ethylmaleimide, was observed to be strongly activated by transient external Ca2+ removal, closely resembling activation of SOC activity in the same cells. The nonadditivity of SOC and NO donor-activated Ca2+ entry suggested a single entry mechanism. Calyculin A-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton prevented SOC but had no effect on GEA3162-induced Ca2+ entry. However, a single entry mechanism could account for both SOC and NO donor-activated entry if the latter reflected direct modification of the entry channel byS-nitrosylation, bypassing the normal coupling process between channels and pools. Small differences between SOC and GEA3162-activated Ba2+ entry and sensitivity to blockade by La3+ were observed, and in HEK293 cells SOC activity was observed without a response to thiol modification. It is concluded that in some cells, S-nitrosylation modifies an entry mechanism closely related to SOC and/or part of the regulatory machinery for SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry.

Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). The resulting depletion of Ca2+ stored within the ER lumen serves as the primary trigger for a message that is returned to the plasma membrane, resulting in the slow activation of “store-operated” Ca2+ entry channels (2Putney J.W.

This second Ca2+entry phase of Ca2+ signals serves to mediate longer term cytosolic Ca2+ elevations and provides a means to replenish intracellular stores (2Putney J.W. Bird G.S.

Whereas receptor-induced generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the function of Ca2+release channels to mediate the initial Ca2+-signaling phase is well understood, the mechanism for coupling ER Ca2+ store depletion with Ca2+ entry remains a crucial but unresolved question (4Parekh A.B.

Such S-nitrosylation-mediated effects are direct and independent of activation of guanylyl cyclase, which is a major target for NO and a frequent mediator of the actions of NO (13Bredt D.S.

Because of the reactivity of thiols toward NO, the sphere of influence of NO can be highly restricted and, rather than diffusion-dependent, NO (or an equivalent of the nitrosonium ion, NO+) may be donated and exchanged between neighboring protein thiols by local transnitrosation events (7Stamler J.S. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 9Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 951-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).We recently utilized a combination of membrane-permeant NO donors and alkylators to probe the role of S-nitrosylation in the process of Ca2+ entry and its relationship to Ca2+ pool depletion (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A novel class of lipophilic NO donors, including the oxatriazole-5-imine derivative, GEA3162, activated Ca2+ entry independent of the well defined NO target, guanylyl cyclase. Strikingly similar Ca2+ entry induced by cell permeant alkylators indicated that this Ca2+ entry process was activated through thiol modification. Significantly, Ca2+ entry activated by NO donors or alkylators was stimulated by Ca2+ pool depletion, which increased the rate and size of the Ca2+ response and the sensitivity to thiol modifiers. These results led us to postulate that S-nitrosylation may underlie activation of an important store-operated Ca2+ entry mechanism. Here we have examined the relationship between store-operated Ca2+ entry occurring independently of S-nitrosylation and Ca2+ entry activated in response toS-nitrosylation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur previous results revealed that NO donors including nitroprusside, nitrite, and the lipophilic donor, GEA3162, were effective in directly inducing Ca2+ entry (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A highly similar entry of Ca2+ was induced with alkylators including NEM and 4-vinylpyridine, indicating that the activation of Ca2+ entry resulted from thiol modification, either nitrosylation or alkylation (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ entry observed with NO donors or with alkylators, in both cases, was substantially enhanced by emptying Ca2+ pools before administration of the activator. Pool emptying increased three parameters of thiol modifier-induced Ca2+ entry: the time-dependence of entry, the size of the Ca2+ entry response, and the sensitivity to thiol modifier (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The most prominent of these effects was the time dependence. Thus, in normal cells with filled pools, there was a pronounced lag in the Ca2+ entry response to thiol modifiers of at least 1 min; after pool emptying, the Ca2+entry response was extremely rapid, suggesting that pool emptying had allowed the Ca2+ entry channel to alter its configuration to expose a thiol group that was important in modifying channel activity (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The question of whether this putative entry channel was indeed the store-operated Ca2+ channel was important to address.Store-operated Ca2+ entry channels display a further important characteristic. In many cells, the entry of Ca2+, activated after pool depletion, becomes deactivated with time, and transient removal and readdition of extracellular Ca2+ is a well described means for reactivating the entry mechanism (24Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6440-6447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Missiaen L. DeSmedt H. Parys J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14807-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effect is frequently referred to as the Ca2+ “overshoot” response, since it results in a transiently high reactivation of Ca2+ entry, which then deactivates once again with time (24Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6440-6447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Missiaen L. DeSmedt H. Parys J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5817-5823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1 reveal that transient removal of external Ca2+ has a dramatic enhancing effect on the operation of Ca2+ entry activated by GEA3162. Untreated DDT1MF-2 cells exposed briefly to nominally Ca2+-free medium then returned to medium containing normal Ca2+ showed no change in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). The addition of GEA3162 at 25 μm, a submaximal concentration under normal conditions (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in the continued presence of external Ca2+ induced a modest rise of Ca2+ after a lag of approximately 2 min. If external Ca2+ was removed before the addition of 25 μmGEA3162 (Fig. 1 B), no significant change in Ca2+occurred for several minutes, confirming the lack of any effect of the NO donor on release of internal Ca2+. However, upon readdition of external Ca2+, a rapid entry of Ca2+ occurred, resulting in a considerably larger peak of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B) than that observed in the continuous presence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). Thus the removal and readdition of Ca2+ considerably enhanced the effectiveness of GEA3162. Control experiments revealed that prolonged (10 min) removal of external Ca2+ did not cause any release of Ca2+ from pools and that following such prolonged external Ca2+ removal, no entry of Ca2+ was observed upon the readdition of Ca2+in the absence of GEA3162. The stimulatory effect of transient Ca2+ removal on the action of GEA3162 was further characterized as shown in Fig. 2. In this experiment external Ca2+ was transiently removed after the addition of different GEA3162 concentrations. After adding GEA3162 at 1 μm, a 3-min period of external Ca2+ removal resulted in only a very slight entry of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A). However, after the addition of 10 μmGEA3162, the transient removal of external Ca2+ triggered a much more significant and rapid increase in Ca2+ following Ca2+ readdition (Fig. 2 B). Under normal conditions of external Ca2+, GEA3162 at 10 μmwas below its effective threshold and induced almost no Ca2+ entry (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the entry of Ca2+observed after the brief removal of external Ca2+represents a real potentiation of the effect of GEA3162. The resultant increase in Ca2+ was rapid but transient and began to decline after 1 min. Removal of Ca2+ prevented any further entry of Ca2+, and the Ca2+ level fell rapidly. After a further 3 min, readdition of Ca2+ resulted again in a rapid and transient entry of Ca2+. The entry of Ca2+ could be repeatedly reactivated by transient removal of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). Although the peak size of the response to 10 μm GEA3162 after the initial transient Ca2+ depletion was smaller, the peaks following subsequent brief periods of Ca2+ removal were larger and approached the maximal size attainable. Thus, external Ca2+ removal followed by the readdition in the presence of 25 μmGEA3162 (Fig. 2 C) resulted in a rapid and maximal activation of Ca2+ entry. Again, the activation rapidly deactivated with time, and cycling of reactivation of Ca2+ entry in response to transient Ca2+ removal could be repeated several times in succession.FIG. 2Repeated transient Ca2+ depletion induces a large potentiation of Ca2+ entry activated by varying concentrations of the NO donor, GEA3162 , in DDT1MF-2 cells. Bars indicate times of replacement of medium with nominally Ca2+-free medium (no Ca2+). GEA3162 (GEA) was added at either 1 μm (A), 10 μm (B), or 25 μm (C) at the times indicated (arrows) and maintained at these levels throughout the remainder of traces.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This pattern of deactivation and reactivation by transient removal of Ca2+ is highly similar to the operation of store-operated Ca2+ entry channels. As shown in Fig. 3 A, after thapsigargin-induced pool emptying in the absence of external Ca2+, readdition of Ca2+ caused a large increase in cytosolic Ca2+, reflecting a high level of store-operated Ca2+ entry. The entry of Ca2+ rapidly deactivated with time, and subsequent removal of external Ca2+ prevented any further Ca2+ entry. Upon the readdition of external Ca2+, maximal store-operated Ca2+ entry was restored. This overshoot response pattern classically reflects the operation of store-operated Ca2+entry and is believed to represent the function of Ca2+-binding sites, which negatively control store-operated Ca2+ entry (24Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6440-6447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Missiaen L. DeSmedt H. Parys J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14807-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). According to such a model, as Ca2+ increases in the cytosol, binding of Ca2+to such regulatory sites inhibits entry; transient external Ca2+ removal prevents Ca2+ entry, allowing cytosolic Ca2+ to fall rapidly as Ca2+ is pumped out of the cell. As a result, Ca2+ dissociates from the regulatory site, permitting the channel to become fully reactivated; upon readdition of Ca2+, a high level of Ca2+ entry is again observed. As shown in Fig. 3 A, this process could be repeated many times. However, it is important to reiterate that the entry observed was completely dependent on pool depletion. Thus, transient removal of Ca2+ at the beginning of the trace before pools were emptied induced no entry of Ca2+. Indeed, in experiments with normal, pool-filled cells, repeated transient removal and readdition of Ca2+ over a period of 30 min induced no change in cytosolic Ca2+ (not shown). The means of activation, the appearance, and the size of the overshoot responses after pool emptying were all remarkably similar to those described above, activated in response to the NO donor. Yet in the case of the NO donor, pools were not emptied. This point is reinforced from the data shown in Fig. 3 B. Thus addition of 15 μmGEA3162 before thapsigargin had no effect on the size of the Ca2+ pool released by subsequent addition of thapsigargin. Moreover, in this experiment the size of overshoots induced after application of both GEA3162 and thapsigargin was not measurably different from that induced by each agent alone. Also, addition of 15 μm GEA3162 to cells after pool depletion with thapsigargin resulted in little significant change in the size of overshoots induced by repeated transient Ca2+ removal (Fig. 3 A). Thus, thapsigargin and NO donor induced similar shaped and sized overshoots that did not appear to be additive. This suggested they were activating either the same or a closely coupled entry mechanism.FIG. 3Thapsigargin-induced pool emptying in DDT1MF-2 cells induces overshoots of store-operated Ca2+ entry, which are similar to and nonadditive with the effects of GEA3162 . Bars indicate times of replacement of medium with nominally Ca2+-free medium (no Ca 2+ ). A, 2 μmthapsigargin (TG) and 15 μm GEA3162 (GEA) were added at the times shown. B, as forA except 15 μm GEA3162 was added before 1 μm thapsigargin. In each case, thapsigargin and GEA3162, once added, were maintained throughout the experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As described above and earlier (20Favre C.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thiol modification by either nitrosylation or alkylation activated a very similar entry of Ca2+. We therefore examined whether the stimulatory action of transient Ca2+ removal also activated Ca2+entry induced by alkylators. Experiments utilized the DC-3F fibroblast cell line in which responses to NO donors and alkylators were similar to DDT1MF-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the addition of the alkylator, NEM, at 10 μm induced only a slight increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A). However, if extracellular Ca2+ was transiently removed for just a short (2 min) period, a substantial entry of Ca2+ immediately followed the readdition of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). As with DDT1MF-2 cells, transient Ca2+ removal without alkylator or NO donor present had no effect on cytosolic Ca2+ in DC-3F cells (24Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6440-6447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The shape and time dependence of the transient Ca2+ removal-induced entry response seen after NEM treatment (Fig. 4 B) and after pool emptying (24Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6440-6447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were impressively similar in the DC-3F cells. NEM-induced entry of Ca2+ into DDT1MF-2 cells was similarly potentiated by transient removal of Ca2+ (data not shown).FIG. 4Transient Ca2+ depletion induces a large potentiation of N-ethylmaleimide-activated Ca2+ entry in DC-3F cells. A, 10 μm NEM was added under standard external conditions.B, 10 μm NEM addition was followed by replacement of medium with nominally Ca2+-free medium for 2 min as shown by the bar (no Ca 2+ ) followed by return of standard external Ca2+ medium. NEM was maintained after the addition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Taken together, the above results and those published previously (20Favre C.J. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Stone M.R. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30855-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) revealed that Ca2+ entry activated byS-nitrosylation was stimulated by both Ca2+ pool depletion and transient external Ca2+ removal, the two primary conditions for activating store-operated Ca2+ entry channels. From this it could be concluded thatS-nitrosylation was affecting a process closely linked with store-operated Ca2+ entry. However, other approaches to determining the relationship between the Ca2+ entry mechanisms have revealed some interesting differences. In recent work, we determined that the operation of store-operated Ca2+entry appears to involve trafficking of the ER toward the plasma membrane (32Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). One of the approaches to this work was to utilize the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, which in two distinct cell types induced a profound redistribution of actin resulting in the formation of a tight ring of cortical actin filaments subjacent to the plasma membrane. This cortical actin appeared to act as a physical barrier to prevent close interaction between the ER and plasma membrane (32Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Under this condition, the activation of store-operated Ca2+entry by pool emptying with thapsigargin was blocked in both cell types. We therefore compared the action of calyculin A on Ca2+ entry activated by thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ pool depletion with its effects on Ca2+entry activated by NO donor.As shown in Fig. 5, we were able to directly observe the two means of Ca2+ entry activation in a single trace. In normal DDT1MF-2 cells, typical activation of Ca2+ entry via pool depletion and application of GEA3162 is shown in Fig. 5 A. After the addition of 2 μm thapsigargin, rapid release of Ca2+ from pools was observed. The slower secondary peak was due to entry of Ca2+ dependent on pool depletion; this became deactivated with time, and cytosolic Ca2+ decreased to a reduced level. The basal Ca2+ level reached was slightly higher than normal resting Ca2+, reflecting a small level of residual Ca2+ entry. After removal of external Ca2+, this low level of entry was abolished, and upon subsequent readdition of Ca2+, the typical large overshoot of Ca2+entry was observed, consistent with that described above. After the store-operated entry had once again deactivated, the addition of a 100 μm GEA3162 clearly activated a large increase in Ca2+ entry, and this entry again deactivated with time. In similar experiments, lower GEA3162 concentrations also induced entry of Ca2+, although the entry was less prolonged (not shown). Note that in these experiments, deactivation of store-operated Ca2+ entry occurred for a longer period of time compared with that in Fig. 3, and there was no further removal of external Ca2+. Thus, if GEA3162 was activating the same Ca2+ entry pathway as pool emptying, then this result would suggest that GEA3162 was able to reverse the deactivation process occurring as a result of Ca2+ inhibition.FIG. 5Calyculin A treatment blocks store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to thapsigargin-induced pool emptying in DDT1MF-2 cells but does not block Ca2+ entry activated by the NO donor, GEA3162 . Bars indicate times of replacement of medium with nominally Ca2+-free medium (no Ca 2+ ). A, 2 μm thapsigargin (TG) and 100 μm GEA3162 (GEA) were added at the times shown. B, cells were initially treated with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (CalyA) at 100 nm for 10 min before the addition of 2 μmthapsigargin and 100 μm GEA3162 at the times indicated by the respective arrows. Each of the agents was maintained in medium after addition throughout successive changes of medium with or without Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Clearly, the picture was very different in the presence of 100 nm calyculin A. The experiment shown in Fig. 5 Bincluded a 10-min pretreatment with the phosphatase inhibitor that was sufficient to rearrange cortical actin into a tight band closely associated with the plasma membrane (32Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

https://openalex.org/W1985063069,"Abstract The adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) is believed to transfer unesterified fatty acids (FA) to phospholipid membranes via a collisional mechanism that involves ionic interactions between lysine residues on the protein surface and phospholipid headgroups. This hypothesis is derived largely from kinetic analysis of FA transfer from AFABP to membranes. In this study, we examined directly the binding of AFABP to large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of differing phospholipid compositions. AFABP bound LUV containing either cardiolipin or phosphatidic acid, and the amount of protein bound depended upon the mol % anionic phospholipid. TheK a for CL or PA in LUV containing 25 mol % of these anionic phospholipids was approximately 2 × 103 m −1. No detectable binding occurred when AFABP was mixed with zwitterionic membranes, nor when acetylated AFABP in which surface lysines had been chemically neutralized was mixed with anionic membranes. The binding of AFABP to acidic membranes depended upon the ionic strength of the incubation buffer: ≥200 mmNaCl reduced protein-lipid complex formation in parallel with a decrease in the rate of FA transfer from AFABP to negatively charged membranes. It was further found that AFABP, but not acetylated AFABP, prevented cytochrome c, a well characterized peripheral membrane protein, from binding to membranes. These results directly demonstrate that AFABP binds to anionic phospholipid membranes and suggest that, although generally described as a cytosolic protein, AFABP may behave as a peripheral membrane protein to help target fatty acids to and/or from intracellular sites of utilization."

It is a round or oval-shaped structure bounded by a single membrane, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0-μm in diameter. Peroxisomes commonly contain catalase and at least one enzyme which generates hydrogen peroxide. The major roles of peroxisomes, however, change dynamically depending on the species of organisms as well as the physiological environments: e.g. β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids and ether lipid synthesis in mammals; fatty acid β-oxidation in fatty seedlings, whereas photorespiration in green leaves of plants; and assimilation of carbon sources such asn-alkane, fatty acids, and methanol in yeasts, depending on the carbon sources given.

In humans, deficiency of one of the PEX genes causes peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),1 such as Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease (8Shimozawa N.

Patients of Zellweger syndrome lack functional peroxisomes and exhibit severe symptoms in various organs including the central nervous system, and death usually occurs in early childhood. On the other hand, patients of milder forms of PBDs seem to have leaky mutations in the corresponding PEX genes, which can often be characterized by temperature sensitivity in peroxisome assembly (10Imamura A.

A peroxisomal membrane protein, PMP70, is present in these membranes, but peroxisomal matrix proteins such as catalase and β-oxidation enzymes are not contained. Similar peroxisome-related abnormal membrane structures are found in peroxisome-deficient mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and yeasts (9Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imamura A. Kondo N.

It is an interesting issue whether the peroxisomes in these events are formed from the preexisting ghosts by taking up the matrix proteins from the cytosol, or are newly formed from other structures. This question is closely linked to the long-standing question of where peroxisomes come from (1Lazarow P.B. Robbi M. Fujiki Y. Wong L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar): preexisting peroxisomes or other structures such as endoplasmic reticulum?

When green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached with PTS-1 was microinjected into the mutant cells together with recombinant Pex5p, the fluorescence gathered to particulate structures, being colocalized with PMP70, even in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Hence, the ghosts serve as precursors of peroxisomes upon functional complementation, at least in thePEX5-defective mutant. HumanPEX5 cDNA (long form) (15Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A.

ThePEX5-coding sequence was inserted in pQE30 vector (QIAGEN), yielding pQEPEX5L. This vector encodes Pex5p, His6-tagged at the amino terminus. The protein expressed in Escherichia coli was purified with Ni-NTA resin, as recommended by the manufacturer. As a visible peroxisomal marker protein, we used GFPSKL, a fusion protein of GFP(105) and the carboxyl-terminal 25 residues of rat acyl-CoA oxidase (18Miyazawa S. Hayashi H. Hijikata M. Ishii N. Furuta S. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8131-8137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter sequence contains a Ser-Lys-Leu-COOH tripeptide motif, a typical PTS-1, at the carboxyl terminus (19Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ohno K. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell.

GFP(105) is a GFP variant containing S65T/F64L/V163A/S175G mutations and exhibits a much improved fluorescence intensity, particularly at higher temperatures (21Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Bioimages. 1998; 6: 1-7Google Scholar). Both GFP(105) and GFPSKL were expressed as His6-tagged proteins using the pQE30 vector and were purified as described above. A PEX5-deficient CHO cell mutant ZP102 (14Tsukamoto T. Bogaki A. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Fujiki Y. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used throughout the study. The mutant cells or wild-type CHO cells (1 × 105/dish) were seeded in 35-mm tissue culture dishes with a glass bottomed microwell (Met Tek, No. 1.5). Each well was coated with 5 μl of mouse type IV collagen solution (0.5 mg/ml) and dried before use. The cells were cultured in F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum overnight, and the medium was changed with that containing or not containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 h before microinjection. Hepes/NaOH (pH7.3) was added to each dish just before the injection at a final concentration of 25 mm. Injection was performed using Eppendorf microinjector 5246 and micromanipulator 5171, at the settings of injection pressure 50 hPa, compensation pressure 35 hPa, and injection time 0.1 s. The sample for injection contained 0.38 mg/ml Pex5p or bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.1 mg/ml GFPSKL or GFP(105). After microinjection, the cells were cultured for up to 24 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. These were carried out essentially as described (22Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Nakai T. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Fujiki Y. Sakai F. Bogaki A. Yasumo H. Osumi T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. After washing with PBS three times, blocking was performed with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Cells were then treated for 1 h with anti-rat PMP70 rabbit antiserum diluted 1000-fold in 1% BSA/PBS. After washing with PBS three times, the samples were kept overnight in PBS at 4 °C to remove the nonspecifically bound antibody as much as possible. The samples were further washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with Cy3-labeled goat antibody to rabbit IgG (diluted 20,000-fold in 1% BSA/PBS). After washing five times, 5 min each time, the samples were mounted in 90% glycerol/PBS containing 25 mg/ml of an antibleaching reagent, 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)octane, by successive changes of mounting solutions containing increasing concentrations of glycerol. For fluorescence microscopic observation, an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope was used. For counting the numbers of peroxisomal ghosts and peroxisomes, the images recorded on photofilms were read with a film scanner, and analyzed by a software package, NIHImage. Human Pex5p (long form), GFP(105), and its SKL-derivative (GFPSKL) were expressed in E. coli as His6-tagged proteins and purified by Ni-NTA-agarose column chromatography. The purified preparation of Pex5p exhibited a major band of approximately 80 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A), being consistent with a previous report (23Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Minor bands were seen in the lower molecular weight region. These bands appeared even when protease inhibitors were added during the disruption of bacteria. This seemed to be because of degradation products generated by endogenous proteases in the bacterial cells, or metal-chelating bacterial proteins. GFP(105) and GFPSKL gave bands of expected sizes on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B), with minor contaminants. Some proteolytic cleavage was apparent for GFPSKL. The functional integrity of recombinant GFPSKL was assessed by microinjection to wild-type CHO cells. Within 24 h the injected GFPSKL exhibited particulate green fluorescence which was localized to peroxisomes, as revealed by colocalization with the peroxisomal marker, PMP70 (Fig. 2, A andB), whereas GFP(105) itself was not imported to peroxisomes (Fig. 2 C). Thus, GFPSKL was translocated to peroxisomes in a signal-dependent manner. As described previously (14Tsukamoto T. Bogaki A. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Fujiki Y. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the PEX5-deficient CHO mutant ZP102 lacks functional peroxisomes. When GFPSKL was injected into ZP102 cells, the GFP fluorescence diffusely distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 2 D), being consistent with the inability of this mutant to import peroxisomal matrix proteins. ZP102, however, contained peroxisomal ghosts that were stainable with anti-PMP70 antibody (Fig. 2 E). The ghosts were less in number and less sharply stained than peroxisomes of normal CHO cells. When ZP102 cells were injected with both GFPSKL and Pex5p, punctate fluorescence of GFP was observed within 24 h, being superimposable with the PMP70 staining (Fig. 2, F and G). If GFP(105) was used instead of GFPSKL, no punctate fluorescence was observed (data not shown). Thus, upon microinjection of the recombinant Pex5p, the mutant cells were complemented with the ability to translocate PTS-1 proteins. Next we questioned whether GFPSKL is directly targeted to the ghosts or is transported there via an indirect pathway in the complementation process of ZP102 cells. To answer this, we carried out the experiment in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, where ghosts were not expected to be newly formed. GFPSKL exhibited a particulate distribution when Pex5p was co-injected, even though cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added (Fig. 2 H), and this pattern well accorded with that of PMP70 (Fig. 2 I). This import process was through recognition of PTS-1 by Pex5p because punctate fluorescence was not observed when BSA was injected in place of Pex5p (Fig. 2 J) or GFP(105) instead of GFPSKL (Fig. 2 K). Translocation of GFP-SKL to peroxisomes also occurred in the wild-type CHO cells at indistinguishable efficiencies in either the absence or presence of cycloheximide (data not shown). To assess the effectiveness of cycloheximide, we compared the cellular number of PMP70-positive particles in the presence and absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, both in the wild-type as well as the mutant CHO cells. We first examined the effect of cycloheximide on cell growth (Table I). Both CHO and ZP102 cells proliferated over 2.5-fold within 24 h, and cycloheximide blocked the growth completely for both strains. The number of ghosts or peroxisomes per cell was nearly constant before and after 24 h either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, though the average number of PMP70-positive particles per cell was significantly larger in the wild-type CHO than in ZP102. A lower abundance of ghosts was also reported in the fibroblasts from human PBD patients, as compared with that of peroxisomes in normal subjects (24Chang C.C. South S. Warren D. Jones J. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, net increase in the number of ghosts or peroxisomes, as represented by their number per dish, did not occur in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas the number increased in proportion to the increase in cell number in the absence of cycloheximide. We also observed that the above concentration of cycloheximide suppressed the incorporation of radioactive methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable materials by 98% during 5 h of incubation, in both wild type CHO and ZP102. These findings indicate that cycloheximide of the concentration used in the present study was fully effective in inhibiting de novo protein synthesis, and most importantly, de novo formation of peroxisomes or ghosts.Table ICycloheximide completely inhibits de novo synthesis of peroxisomes or ghostsCHOZP1020 h24 h, +CHX24 h, −CHX0 h24 h, +CHX24 h, −CHXCell number (×105/dish)1.63 ± 0.02 (3)1.64 ± 0.02 (3)6.39 ± 0.46 (3)1.25 ± 0.04 (3)1.21 ± 0.03 (3)3.83 ± 0.19 (3)Number of peroxisomes or ghosts (per cell)45.6 ± 15.9 (11)40.9 ± 11.2 (11)43.9 ± 7.3 (11)16.1 ± 6.6 (22)16.4 ± 5.8 (18)18.0 ± 6.4 (25)Number of peroxisomes or ghosts (×106/dish)7.40 ± 2.586.72 ± 1.8528.1 ± 4.62.02 ± 0.831.99 ± 0.706.90 ± 2.44 Open table in a new tab The peroxisome recovery process in ZP102 upon microinjection of Pex5p was followed in living cells (Fig. 3). Particulate distribution of GFPSKL appeared as early as 1 h after injection and proceeded with time. Cytosolic fluorescence of GFPSKL could still be observed 5 h after injection, whereas incorporation into peroxisomes was almost completed by 24 h (compare Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, the translocation of GFPSKL to the ghosts (or recovering peroxisomes) continued over many hours. The deficiency in the import of a PTS-1 protein to peroxisomes in the PEX5-defective mutant, ZP102 was complemented by injecting a normal PEX5 gene product. This process was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, which effectively blocked de novo protein synthesis and formation of PMP70-positive particles. Therefore, at least in the PEX5mutant, the ghosts are ready to import the peroxisomal matrix proteins from the cytosol, simply upon the supply of Pex5p. Thus, from a functional point of view, the ghosts are empty peroxisomes, accommodating all the necessary sets of components for taking up peroxisome matrix proteins, other than Pex5p. Our results have implications regarding the question of the intracellular origin of peroxisomes. For many years, peroxisomes have been thought to be derived from preexisting peroxisomes (25Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). They may be enlarged by importing newly synthesized peroxisomal proteins directly from the cytosol and may proliferate by fission. Recent studies, however, suggest the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum in peroxisome assembly, at least for some integral membrane components (26Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R299-R302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain yeast Pex proteins accumulate in endoplasmic reticulum when overexpressed (27Baerends R.S. Rasmussen S.W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In a yeast species, the proteins involved in the secretory pathways and peroxisome assembly seem to be functionally overlapping (29Titorenko V.I. Ogrydziak D.M. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5210-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ADP-ribosylation factor and coatomers known to be important in membrane vesicle formation also seem to be involved in peroxisome biogenesis (30Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The functions of these factors were discussed in terms of both vesicle formation from the endoplasmic reticulum and the fission of preexisting peroxisomes (30Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it is again a current question as to whether peroxisomes are formed from preexisting peroxisomes or endoplasmic reticulum. In the peroxisome recovery process in the PEX5 mutant, net protein transfer from endoplasmic reticulum is probably not required because de novo synthesis of such vesicular components is not likely to occur in the presence of cycloheximide. Most feasible is the interpretation that the ghosts take up the cytosolic GFPSKL directly, not involving intermediate structures, though possible involvement of recycling transport vesicles should not be ignored. We also observed that peroxisomal translocation of GFPSKL occurs in normal CHO cells in the presence of cycloheximide, in accordance with a previous report (31Hill P.E. Walton P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 198: 1469-1476Google Scholar). Thus, in normal cells, mature peroxisomes that are equipped with a complete set of Pex machineries would incorporate matrix proteins from the cytosol and may proliferate through division, as suggested (32South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results, however, do not necessarily conflict with the possible involvement of vesicular transport derived from the endoplasmic reticulum or other structures. Indeed, peroxisome-deficient cells of several complementation groups do not contain cytochemically detectable ghosts (9Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imamura A. Kondo N. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y.

Western analyses and in vitro kinase assays indicate that this inhibition is not due to either down-regulation of STAT3 protein expression nor inactivation of upstream-located JAK1 and JAK2. Blocking the new RNA and protein syntheses antagonized the inhibitory effect of PE on IL-6-activated STAT3, suggesting synthesis of an inhibitory factor(s) is involved. The inhibitory effect of PE on IL-6 activation of STAT3 was also abolished by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate, indicating involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, preincubation of the cells with the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 or a dominant negative MEK1 reversed the inhibitory effect of PE, and expression of constitutively activated MEK1 alone abolished IL-6-activated STAT3. Taken together, these data indicate that PE inhibits IL-6 activation of STAT3 in hepatic cells by a p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism, and tyrosine phosphatases are involved. This inhibitory cross-talk between the α1BAR and IL-6 signaling pathways implicates the α1BAR involvement in regulating the IL-6-mediated inflammatory responses.

In addition to such short term metabolic effects, stimulation of α1ARs can influence hepatocyte growth and differentiation; it results in increased DNA synthesis (8Cruise J.L. Houck K.A. Michalopoulos G.K. Science. 1985; 227: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and has a co-mitogenic role in the early phases of the regenerative response after hepatic injury or partial hepatectomy (9Cruise J.L.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions in the hematopoietic, immune, neuronal, and hepatic systems (10Akira S. Int. J. Biochem.

Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). In the liver, IL-6 stimulates hepatocytes to produce a variety of acute-phase proteins, including serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, complement C3, fibrinogen, and macroglobulin. Recent evidence from knock-out mice suggests that IL-6-induced STAT3 activation is a critical component of the regenerative response (15Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis P.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of the IL-6 gene have impaired liver regeneration characterized by liver necrosis and failure. Treatment of the IL-6-deficient mice with a single dose of IL-6 before partial hepatectomy returned STAT3 binding, gene expression, and hepatocyte proliferation to levels seen in control animals following partial hepatectomy as well as prevented liver damage in these mice. The role of IL-6 in the liver inflammatory response and regeneration is believed to be linked through the gp130 protein. The interaction of IL-6 with the IL-6Rα induces homodimerization of gp130, which is followed by activation of the receptor-associated Janus kinases, known as JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2. This receptor-kinase complex interacts with and activates the SH2-containing cytoplasmic STAT3 transcription factor, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of many target genes such as c-jun, c-myc, JunB, cyclin D1, C/EBP, p21 waf1/cip1 , and acute-phase genes (10Akira S.

Stress has been implicated as a modulator of gastrointestinal inflammation in both animal and human studies (16Collines S.M. Barbara G. Vallance B. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 1999; 13: 47-49Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Basbaum A.I. Levine J.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We wondered whether activation of α1BAR, an important component mediating the sympathoadrenal response to acute metabolic stress, modulates the major inflammatory cytokine IL-6 signaling pathway in the liver. Our data showed that activation of α1BAR markedly attenuated IL-6-activated STAT3 and IL-6-induced serum amyloid A mRNA expression in normal hepatocytes and transfected HepG2 cells. Further studies suggest that this inhibition is p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent, and tyrosine phosphatases may be involved. STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) was obtained from New England Biolabs. PD98059, SB203850, SB202190, wortmannin, actinomycin D, puromycin, MG132, lactacystin, and bisindolylmaleimide I (GF109203X) were purchased from Calbiochem. Radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. HepG2 human hepatocellular cells were supplied by ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured as directed. HepG2 cells were stably transfected with α1BAR to generate TFG2 cells, as described previously (18Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was described previously (19Gao B. Jiang L. Kunos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5997-6008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFG2 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatant (protein fraction) was calculated using the Bio-Rad protein assay. An aliquot of 40 μg of protein was mixed with an equivalent volume of 2× protein loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min before loading onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally, and the portal vein was cannulated under aseptic conditions. Liver cells were isolated by a collagenase perfusion protocol as described earlier (19Gao B. Jiang L. Kunos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5997-6008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cells were washed twice and resuspended with Ca2+ plus Krebs-Henseleit solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose) containing 1.5% gelatin and further treated with PE and/or IL-6. For cell cultures, the isolated cells were washed twice with hepatocyte medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 × 10−8mdexamethasone, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 67 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and plated onto rat tail collagen-coated culture dishes in hepatocyte medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After 2 h, the medium was changed to hepatocyte medium containing 0.5% serum and then stimulated with appropriate concentrations of PE and/or IL-6. DNA mobility gel shift assay was described previously (20Gao B. Spector M.S. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5614-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation was determined by DMSA using oligonucleotide m67 (a high affinity serum-induced element m67) (5′ GTG CAT TTC CCG TAA ATC TTG TCT ACA 3′), as described previously (21Chen J.P. Bao H.F. Sawyer S. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR was described previously (20Gao B. Spector M.S. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5614-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The following primer pairs were used: forward primer (5′ CGA AGC TTC TTT TCG TTC CTT 3′) and reverse primer (5′ CAG GCC AGC AGG TCG GAA GTG 3′) for human serum amyloid A. TFG2 cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum were washed with DMEM and then were infected with either null recombinant adenovirus or with dominant negative MEK1 recombinant adenovirus in a total volume of 1 ml and at a multiplicity of infection of 200 as described previously (18Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 8 h, the cells were washed with DMEM and cultured for a further 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The constitutively activated MEK1 plasmid DNA was transfected into the cells by adenovirus lysine-mediated procedure as described previously (22Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-DNA complexes were prepared by incubating lysine-modified adenovirus with a constitutively activated MEK1 (S218D/S222D double mutant) expression vector (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark, followed by a 30-min incubation with polysine at a molar concentration equivalent to 125 times the molar plasmid DNA concentrations. Adenovirus-DNA-lysine complex was then added to the cells and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with media to remove the virus and cultured for a further 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. p42/44 MAP kinase was described previously (4Spector M. Auer K. Jarvis W. Ishac E. Gao B. Kunos G. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3556-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and then lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Beads were washed twice with 500 μl of stop buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) and then boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. The solubilized proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Comparison was performed using one-way analysis of variance and a two-tailed t test. Differences with ap value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Experiments shown are the means of 3–6 individual experiments ± S.E. performed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, IL-6 (20 ng/ml) treatment for 30 min caused significant STAT3 activation in primary cultured hepatocytes (2nd lane). The identity of STAT3 was proved by supershift assay as described previously (21Chen J.P. Bao H.F. Sawyer S. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Preincubation with 10−5m PE for 1 h did not significantly inhibit this activation, while treatment with PE for 2–4 h markedly attenuated the IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. This result indicates that PE is able to inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in cultured hepatocytes. Fig. 1 B demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of PE on IL-6 induced STAT3 activation was also observed in suspension of freshly isolated hepatocytes. PE alone did not activate STAT3 in hepatocytes (data not shown). The effect of PE on IL-6-induced STAT3 activation was also examined in the transfected HepG2 cells (TFG2 cells). As shown in Fig. 2 A, stimulation of TFG2 cells with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 30 min significantly induced STAT3 activation (2nd lane). The identity of STAT3 was proved by supershift assay (data not shown). The pretreatment of TFG2 cells with PE within 1.5 h did not significantly affect IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, while pretreatment 2–4 h markedly attenuated this activation. PE alone did not activate STAT3 in TFG2 cells (data not shown). To confirm further the inhibitory effect of PE, the effect of PE on the kinetics of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation was studied. TFG2 cells were treated with 10−5m PE for 2 or 3 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 for various times. As shown in Fig. 2 B, IL-6 treatment caused a rapid activation of STAT3 that peaked at 30 min (1st to 4th lanes). Preincubation with 10−5m PE for 2 and 3 h almost completely abolished this activation (5th to8th and 9th to 12th lanes). Fig. 2 C showed that PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 was completely prevented by preincubation with prazosin (10−5or 10−4m), a specific α1AR antagonist, suggesting that the effect of PE is α1AR-mediated. Next, we examined whether PE was able to inhibit IL-6-induced acute-phase protein (e.g. serum amyloid A) expression. TFG2 cells were treated with 10−5m PE for 3 h and then stimulated with IL-6 for 2 h. The total RNA was isolated and used for RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2 D, IL-6 significantly stimulated serum amyloid A mRNA expression (2nd lane), and these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with PE for 3 h (3rd lane). Fig. 3 D also showed that PE treatment alone did not affect basal serum amyloid A mRNA expression (4th lane). To check whether PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT activation is due to down-regulation of STAT3 protein expression or due to inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, Western blot analyses were conducted by using anti-STAT3 or anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibodies. TFG2 cells were stimulated with 10−5m PE for various times, and then cell extracts were isolated and subjected to DMSA or Western analyses. As shown in Fig. 3, PE treatment for 2–4 h markedly inhibited IL-6-activated STAT3 binding to m67 probe, as demonstrated by DMSA in the top panel. The same treatment significantly attenuated IL-6-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (middle panel) but did not inhibit rather than enhanced STAT3 protein expression. These data suggest that PE inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3 is due to inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and is not due to STAT3 protein degradation. To examine whether PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT activation is due to blocking the upstream-located JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 activation, autophosphorylation assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, a 5-min IL-6 treatment rapidly induced JAK1 or JAK2 activation (2nd lane in Aand B), and preincubation with PE for 3 h did not significantly affect this activation (3rd lane inA and B). On the contrary, preincubation of TFG2 cells with PMA for 10 min significantly inhibited IL-6-induced JAK2 activation. These results indicate that PE does not inhibit IL-6 activation of JAKs. PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation only occurred after preincubation of cells for 2 h, suggesting that this inhibition may require synthesis of a new negative regulator. To test this hypothesis, actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor, and puromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, were used. As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation with actinomycin D or puromycin alone did not affect IL-6-activated STAT3 (4th and6th lanes) but significantly antagonized PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation (5thand 7th lanes). These results suggest that PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation requires a newly synthesized factor(s) that contributes to the inhibition. PE inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation could be due to inactivation of kinases responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 or, alternatively, to activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates STAT3 (10Akira S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Ihle J.N. Thierfelder W. Teglund S. Stravapodis D. Wang D. Feng J. Parganas E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

To examine the latter possibility, TFG2 cells were pretreated with sodium orthovanadate, a non-selective tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min stimulation with IL-6. Cell lysates were then subjected to DMSA and Western analyses to quantify STAT3 binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6 A, 1 mm sodium vanadate alone did not stimulate STAT3 binding (2nd lane, top panel) nor tyrosine phosphorylation (2nd lane, middle panel) but instead significantly enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 protein binding (3rd lane, top panel) and phosphorylation (3rd lane, middle panel). Sodium vanadate also significantly prevented the PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 binding (6th lane, top panel) and tyrosine phosphorylation (6th lane, middle panel). The bottom panel indicated that these treatments did not significantly affect STAT3 protein expression. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphatases may be involved in PE inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in down-regulation of activated STATs (23Kim T.K. Maniatis T.

We wondered whether this pathway was also involved in PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 6 B, pretreatment of TFG2 cells with the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 or lactacystin, did not significantly antagonize PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is not involved. It has been shown that PE can activate many signaling pathways, such as the p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and PI3-kinase (4Spector M. Auer K. Jarvis W. Ishac E. Gao B.

To check whether these signaling pathways are involved in PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, TFG2 cells were incubated with the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, the p42/44 MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580, or the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin for 30 min and were then incubated with 10−5m PE for 3 h, followed by a 30-min stimulation with IL-6. The cell extracts were then isolated and subjected to DMSA for detection of STAT3 activation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, IL-6 treatment caused a rapid STAT3 activation (2nd lane), whereas preincubation with PE for 3 h significantly inhibited this activation (3rd lane). Pretreatment with PD98059 significantly reversed the PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. Pretreatment with SB202190 or SB203580 also slightly reversed this inhibitory effect of PE, whereas pretreatment with GF109203X or wortmannin did not affect PE inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT activation. These results suggest that activation of p42/44 MAP kinase is involved in PE inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT 3. To confirm further the role of p42/44 MAP kinase in the inhibitory effect of PE, TFG2 cells were infected with a dominant negative MEK1 recombinant adenovirus to block the activation of p42/44 MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 7 B, infection with MEK1 dominant negative adenovirus but not with control virus almost completely reversed PE inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3, which further suggests that p42/44 MAP kinase is involved. Because the above data suggest that p42/44 MAP kinase is involved in PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3, we wondered whether EGF and insulin, the major activators of p42/44 MAP kinase, inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. As shown in Fig. 8 A, preincubation of TFG2 cells with EGF or insulin for 2 h did not significantly affect IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, whereas PE completely abolished this STAT3 activation. To explain why EGF and insulin do not have the same inhibitory effect as PE, we compared the p42/44 MAP kinase activation profile of PE, EGF, insulin, and IL-6. Treatment of TFG2 cells with EGF or insulin caused a transient p42/44 MAP kinase activation, the peak (4-fold) effect occurring at 20 min, with activity declining toward control levels after 60 min. 2V.-A. T. Nguyen and B. Gao, unpublished observations. On the contrary, PE treatment caused a sustained p42/44 MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 8 B, PE rapidly induced high levels of MAP kinase activity (7-fold at 10 min), which remained 4-fold for up to 3 h. IL-6 has been shown to activate p42/44 MAP kinase in certain cell types (10Akira S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, IL-6 does not significantly activate basal p42/44MAP kinase in TFG2 cells and does not affect PE-induced p42/44 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 8 B). To confirm further the inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 by a sustained activation of p42/44 MAP kinase in TFG2 cells, TFG2 cells were transfected with either a control expression vector or a vector encoding constitutively activated MEK1. As shown in Fig. 8 C, IL-6 significantly activated STAT3 (2nd lane), and transfection of constitutively activated MEK1 (3rd lane) but not control vector (4th lane) significantly attenuated IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, suggesting that constitutive activation of p42/44 MAP kinase inhibited IL-6 activation of STAT3 in hepatic cells. In the present paper we provide the first evidence of cross-talk between α1BAR and IL-6 signaling pathways in hepatic cells. Our results show that activation of α1BAR by PE significantly inhibits IL-6-induced STAT3 binding and tyrosine phosphorylation in normal hepatocytes and transfected HepG2 cells by a p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. It is well established that the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 receptor α chain induces homodimerization of the signaling transducing β chain gp130, followed by activation of the receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases. This receptor-kinase complex then interacts with and activates target SH2-containing cytoplasmic STAT3 transcription factor (10Akira S. Int. J. Biochem.

However, relatively little is known about the inactivation of IL-6-activated STAT3. Several mechanisms responsible for inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway have been proposed. For example, activated JAK-STAT can be attenuated by 1) dephosphorylation (26Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), protein kinase A (27David M. Petricoin III, E. Larner A.C. J. Biol.

Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whether these inhibitory pathways are involved in PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 is discussed below. Dephosphorylation of the JAK-STAT by tyrosine phosphatases is an important mechanism involved in down-regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Several tyrosine phosphatases, including SHP1 and SHP2 (12Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 36You M. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been implicated in down-regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Evidence suggests that tyrosine phosphatases are involved in UV light (37Aragane Y. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11490-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and phorbol ester (35Petricoin III, E.. David M. Igarashi K. Benjamin C. Ling L. Goelz S. Finbloom D. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)-mediated inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 was partially antagonized by pretreatment with vanadate, a nonselective protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, suggesting that a tyrosine phosphatase(s) may be involved in the inhibitory effect of PE. Since vanadate significantly enhanced IL-6-activated STAT3, we cannot rule out that partial reversal of PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 by vanadate is due to stabilization of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Further experiments are required to clarify the role of tyrosine phosphatases in PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3. Proteolytic degradation of phosphorylated STAT has been shown to be another mechanism for down-regulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (23Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in down-regulation of interferon-γ-activated STAT1, as evidenced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which stabilized the down-regulation of the phosphorylated STAT1 (23Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Our data showed that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin did not prevent PE inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is not involved in PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3. Blocking RNA synthesis and protein synthesis abolished PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, suggesting that PE induced an inhibitory protein(s) that inhibits IL-6 signaling pathway. The identity of this inhibitory protein(s) remains unclear. Two different families of inhibitory regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathway have recently been identified. The first family of proteins, named JAB, SOCS, or CIS, is induced by cytokines (29Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 30Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D.

The second family of protein is protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) that can bind to activated STAT and down-regulate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (32Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar,33Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Our data show that PE inhibits IL-6-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation but does not affect JAK phosphorylation. This suggests that JAB/SOCS/SSI proteins were probably not involved in PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3, because JAB/SOCS/SSI proteins exert their function by preventing phosphorylation of JAKs (38Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Treatment of TFG2 cells with PE for 3 h completely abolished IL-6-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. This indicates that PIAS is probably not involved in PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3, because PIAS does not inhibit STAT tyrosine phosphorylation (13Chen E.H. Gadina M. Galon J. Chen M. O'Shea J.J. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 338-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Several protein kinases, including p42/44 MAP kinase (34Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), protein kinase A (27David M. Petricoin III, E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (35Petricoin III, E.. David M. Igarashi K. Benjamin C. Ling L. Goelz S. Finbloom D. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), have been implicated in down-regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. PE was able to activate p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and PI3-kinase (4Spector M. Auer K. Jarvis W. Ishac E. Gao B. Kunos G. Dent P. Mol. Cell.

Res. 1997; 81: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but did not activate protein kinase C or protein kinase A2 in TFG2 cells. Blocking p42/44 MAP kinase but not p38 MAP kinase or PI3-kinase significantly antagonized PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3, suggesting that p42/44 MAP kinase is involved. Inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 by PE-activated p42/44 MAP kinase is slow (only occurring after 2 h of addition of PE in hepatocytes and TFG2 cells) and requires new protein synthesis, which is similar to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-mediated inhibition of IL-6 signaling pathway (39Sengupta T.K. Schmitt E.M. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, this is different from PMA- or ionomycin-activated p42/44 MAP kinase inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3, which is rapid (occurring within 5 min of addition of PMA or ionomycin). The mechanism for p42/44 MAP kinase-mediated rapid and slow inhibition of IL-6 activation STAT3 remains unclear. Although EGF and insulin also significantly activate p42/44 MAP kinase in TFG2 cells, they do not have the same inhibitory effect as PE. Comparison of p42/44 MAP kinase activation profile showed that PE induced a sustained p42/44 MAP kinase activation, whereas EGF or insulin induced transient p42/44 MAP kinase activation. It has been reported that the sustained activation and transient activation of p42/44 MAP kinase caused different end responses (40Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believed that PE inhibition of IL-6-activated STAT3 is mediated by a sustained activation of p42/44 MAP kinase. This was further confirmed by that constitutive activation of p42/44 MAP kinase by transfection of constitutively activated MEK1 can inhibit IL-6-activated STAT3 in the absence of PE in Fig. 8 C. Pretreatment of TFG2 cells with 5 μm p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB202190 or SB203580 also slightly reversed PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6 activation STAT3, suggesting that p38 MAP kinase may also be involved. Five μm SB202190 or SB203580 significantly inhibited (by 90%) the activation of p38 MAP kinase but also partially blocked (by 20%) p42/44 MAP kinase,2 so we cannot rule out that the effects of SB202190 and SB203580 are due to inhibition of p42/44 MAP kinase. Further experiments are required to clarify the role of p38 MAP kinase in PE-mediated inhibition of IL-6 activation of STAT3. In summary, our data described here demonstrated that stimulation of α1BAR attenuated IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in hepatocytes and TFG2 cells by a p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism and a protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) may be involved. Interestingly, we also found that activation of β2AR also rapidly inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in the liver.2 This suggests that catecholamines can inhibit IL-6 signaling pathway in the liver by activation of both α1BAR and β2AR. The inhibitory cross-talk between the catecholamines and IL-6 signaling pathway may play an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis in the liver. The serum levels of IL-6 and catecholamines are both dramatically elevated in many severe clinical situations such as burns, endotoxemia, meningitis, and sepsis (41Gool J. Vugt H. Helle M. Aarden L.A. Clin. Immun. Immunopath. 1990; 57: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 42Nysten M.W.N. de Groot E.R. ten Duis H.J. Klasen H.J. Hack C.E. Aarden L.A.

Immunol. 1989; 142: 2321-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Although IL-6-induced acute phase response is the defense reaction, long stimulation by IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and malignant disorders including hepatitis, cirrhosis in liver (44Elias J.A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 120: 672-674PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the role of inhibition of IL-6-induced signal transduction by catecholamines through activation of α1BAR and β2AR in stress reaction is to maintain the autocrine and paracrine balance of positive and negative factors to prevent its potential progress to liver diseases. Indeed, there is evidence that interaction between many stress mediators including epinephrine and IL-6 play an important role in inducing the hypermetabolic stress state in the liver after major injuries (45Zupke C.A. Stefanovich P. Berthiaume F. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 58: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Drs. George Kunos and Stephen Sawyer for helpful discussions and Dr. Edward Ishac for critical reading of the manuscript."

Gene products regulated by NGF in PC12 cells include several G-protein coupled receptors, such as the M4 muscarinic, secretin, and adenosine A2A receptors (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using gene expression profiling (expressed sequence tags) coupled with Northern analysis, a decrease in A2AAR mRNA could be demonstrated as early as 3 days (3 d) posttreatment with NGF and levels remained depressed for up to 12 d (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization with an A2AAR oligonucleotide probe detected a 50% decrease in the number of grains per cell in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, confirming that NGF decreases A2AAR mRNA levels (26Arslan G. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the changes in mRNA levels, immunoreactive A2AAR protein declines by more than half after 7 d of NGF treatment, and the number of binding sites for the A2AAR selective antagonist, [3H]SCH 58261, decreases by 3-fold (26Arslan G. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When PC12 cells are treated with A2AAR agonists, a transient down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein occurs (27Saitoh O. Saitoh Y. Nakata H. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1317-1320PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the specific cellular mechanisms regulating A2AAR mRNA levels have not been thoroughly delineated. In this study, we provide the first insights into the downstream pathways employed by NGF to control A2AAR expression in PC12 cells. Such pathways may likewise play an important role in the regulation of A2AAR expression during brain development. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture collection (Manassas, VA). PC12nnr5, clone 106, and srcDN2 cells were a generous gift from Gordon Guroff at NICHD, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). The dominant-negative Ras cell line, 17.26, was obtained from Robert Maue at Dartmouth Medical Center (Hanover, NH). PC12 cell lines were maintained on rat tail collagen, Type IV (Upstate Biotechnology, Saranac Lake, NY) as described previously (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SrcDN2, 17.26, and clone 106 were cultured in the presence of 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were treated with PD98059 or SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and mouse 2.5S NGF (Promega, Madison, WI) as described below. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated, fractionated through a denaturing agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (NEN Life Science Products) essentially as described previously (12Lee N.H. Malek R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22317-22325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A32P-labeled 2.3-kilobase pairSstI/XhoI fragment from a rat A2AcDNA clone and a 1.2-kilobase pair EcoRI/XhoI fragment from a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA were used as probes (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Expression levels of A2AAR mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. Blots were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. At the times indicated, total RNA was isolated from PC12nnr5 cells. An RNase protection assay was performed essentially as described by Lee et al. (28Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of plasmid 118GAPDHpSP73 for generating an antisense riboprobe of the GAPDH mRNA was described previously (12Lee N.H. Malek R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22317-22325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmid 296A2ApSP72 for generating an antisense riboprobe template of the A2AAR mRNA was constructed by subcloning anEcoRI/PvuII restriction fragment of 296 nucleotides into pSP72 (Promega). Riboprobes transcribed fromEcoRI-linearized 296A2ApSP72 correspond to nucleotides 596–891 of the A2AAR cDNA clone in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Authenticity of the plasmid construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing. PC12 cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes, grown to 70–80% confluency, and transiently transfected with 5 μg of SAPKβ(K55A) in expression vector pCMV5 (29Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or an empty expression vector with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 18–24 h after transfection, cells were treated with PD98059 and/or NGF, and they were harvested for total RNA at the indicated times. PC12 cells were plated onto 35-mm collagen-coated tissue culture dishes at 90% confluency and incubated 24 h. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Serum starved monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were harvested/lysed in 95 °C SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10.8 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were placed on ice during sonication and reheated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were processed for Western analysis as described by the New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) protocol supplied with the antibodies. Phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) antibody, phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody, p44/42 MAP kinase antibody, SAPK/JNK antibody, and p38 MAP kinase antibody were from New England Biolabs. Phospho-JNK (G-7) monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-TrkA (Ab-1) monoclonal antibody was from Calbiochem. Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) allowed detection of proteins by the ECL+Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Treated cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in immune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm sodium fluoride) and disrupted by aspiration through a 21 gauge needle. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with anti-p38 antibody (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with immune precipitation buffer equilibrated protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with immune precipitation buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-ATF-2 substrate. Reactions were incubated 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Crude membrane preparations were obtained as described recently (30Nie Z. Mei Y. Ramkumar V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 125I-ZM241358, an A2AAR-specific antagonist was used to measure specific binding to A2AARs in crude membrane preparations. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n independent determinations. To assess the contribution of individual components of the NGF signal transduction pathway leading to regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein, PC12 sublines lacking functional TrkA or overexpressing dominant-inhibitory forms of Ras or Src were used. The role of the three MAP kinase family members p38, ERK1/ERK2, and SAPK/JNK in NGF-mediated regulation of A2AAR mRNA was also determined. Earlier experiments have concentrated on the effects of long term (7–12 days) NGF treatment on A2AAR expression in PC12 cells (7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Arslan G. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, shorter periods of treatment were examined to define initial pathways responsible for NGF regulation. Steady state A2AAR mRNA declined to 62 and 43% of untreated control cells following 1 and 3 d of NGF treatment, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Correspondingly, binding of the A2AAR antagonist 125I-ZM241358 to PC12 cells decreased by 50 and 45% following 1 and 3 d of NGF treatment, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Thus, NGF-induced down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein is apparent as early as 24 h following NGF treatment, with a further decrease in A2AAR mRNA occurring at 3 d. The contribution of TrkA and p75 to the regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein were examined in PC12nnr5 cells, which are a PC12 subline that expresses p75, lacks functional TrkA receptors, and does not differentiate in response to NGF (31Green S. Rydel R. Connolly J. Greene L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 803-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As the basal steady-state level of A2AAR mRNA is reduced in PC12nnr5 cells, a ribonuclease protection assay was performed to quantitate A2AAR mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1, NGF failed to down-regulate both A2AAR mRNA and protein levels. For comparison, the effects of NGF on A2AAR expression were studied in clonal cell line 106. Clone 106, derived from PC12nnr5 cells stably transfected with TrkA, has levels of 125I-NGF binding similar to those in native PC12 cells and differentiates in response to NGF (32Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movesesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When cultures of clone 106 were treated with NGF for 1 or 3 d, both A2AAR mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated to the same extent as native PC12 cells (Fig. 1). Because TrkA is implicated in A2AAR mRNA and protein regulation, potential roles for TrkA-associated signaling components, Src and Ras, were examined. As oncogenic Src mimics NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and phosphorylation of a similar set of cellular substrates, a role for Src in the signal transduction pathway initiated by NGF has been implicated (33Thomas S.M. Hayes M. D'Arcangelo G. Armstrong R.C. Meyer B.E. Zilberstein A. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4739-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of NGF on A2AAR mRNA and protein were examined in srcDN2 cells that overexpress a dominant-negative, kinase-defective Src mutant (34Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S. Brugge J. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Upon treatment of srcDN2 cells with NGF for 1 or 3 d, down-regulation of steady-state mRNA was not observed (92 and 100% of untreated cells, respectively) (Fig. 2). Likewise, A2AAR protein levels remained near control levels following 1 and 3 d of NGF treatment (110 and 81%, respectively). Thus, Src appears to be critical for NGF-induced down-regulation of both A2AAR mRNA and protein. PC12 cells undergo a Ras-dependent transient induction of several immediate-early genes within minutes of NGF treatment that precedes neurite outgrowth (35Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The delayed response genes are transcriptionally active hours to days following NGF treatment (6Halegoua S. Armstrong R. Kremer N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 1 65: 119-170Google Scholar, 7Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the induction of several genes, such as agrin, tau, transin, and SCG10, has been shown to be Ras-dependent (8Smith M.A. Fanger G.R. O'Connor L.T. Bridle P. Maue R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15675-15681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Sadot E. Jaaro H. Seger R. Ginzburg I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcriptional down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor requires Ras activity (36Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6878-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that NGF can also mediate down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA in a Ras-dependent manner. In 17.26 cells expressing a dominant-negative Ras mutant (35Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), steady state mRNA levels following 1 and 3 d of NGF treatment were 88 and 81% of untreated control cells, respectively, which is a less dramatic decrease than that seen in native PC12 (compare Figs. 1 A and3 A). A similar impairment of NGF-induced down-regulation of protein was observed in 17.26 cells (compare Figs. 1 B and3 B). The loss of NGF-mediated down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein in 17.26 and srcDN2 cells was not due to a loss of TrkA receptor levels. As determined by Western analysis using an anti-TrkA antibody, expression of TrkA protein in srcDN2 and 17.26 cells was comparable to that found in native PC12 cells (data not shown). In agreement with our findings, srcDN2, 17.26, and native PC12 cells exhibited similar levels of 125I-NGF binding to TrkA (32Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movesesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that both Src and Ras are necessary TrkA-signaling components that regulate A2AAR mRNA and protein levels. Ras has multiple downstream effectors that activate divergent signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 37Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), such as Raf-1 and MAP kinase kinase kinase (22Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly described Ras activated pathway is the Raf-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2 (38Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 39Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). More recently, Raf-independent Ras-activated MAP kinase pathways have been identified. For example, the Ras effector MAP kinase kinase kinase 1 activates SEK, which in turn activates SAPK/JNK and p38 (40Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 41Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 42Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 43Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). As such, the activity of p38, ERK1/ERK2, and SAPK/JNK was examined in PC12, srcDN2, and 17.26 cells. NGF activation of p38, ERK1/ERK2, and SAPK/JNK was assessed with phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). In native PC12 cells, NGF activated p38 and ERK1/ERK2 at early time points (15 and 30 min), whereas SAPK/JNK was not activated until 3 d. In agreement with previous reports, expression of dominant-negative Ras in 17.26 cells inhibited NGF activation of ERK1/ERK2 (18Wood K.W. Sarneck C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 20Thomas S. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and SAPK/JNK (22Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), confirming that growth factor activation of these two MAP kinases is Ras-dependent. Likewise, activation of p38 above basal levels in NGF-treated 17.26 cells was not observed. As demonstrated previously (34Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S. Brugge J. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), ERK1/ERK2 was activated in srcDN2 cells albeit to a slightly lesser extent than native PC12 cells. Moreover, NGF did not effectively activate p38 or SAPK/JNK in srcDN2 cells (Fig. 4). These findings demonstrate that Src is required for the full activation of the MAP kinases. As these kinases are distal components of the NGF signal transduction pathway, and their activation was impaired or inhibited by dominant-negative signaling components more proximal to TrkA, it is possible that one or more of these MAP kinase family members plays a role in mediating the effects of NGF on A2AAR mRNA. Notably, a recent report demonstrated that two MAP kinase family members, JNK and ERK1/ERK2, had opposing effects on tau promoter activity and affected promoter activity over different time frames (10Sadot E. Jaaro H. Seger R. Ginzburg I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine potential roles of the individual MAP kinases in affecting down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA by NGF, the synthetic compound SB203580 was used to inhibit p38 (44Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Although p38 activation was impaired in srcDN2 and 17.26 cells, this kinase does not appear to be involved in A2AAR mRNA regulation as SB203580 failed to inhibit NGF-induced down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA in native PC12 cells (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, another p38 inhibitor, SB202190, also failed to inhibit A2AAR mRNA down-regulation (data not shown). Inhibition of p38 activity in PC12 cells was verified by an in vitroimmunocomplex kinase assay. Whereas p38 from lysates of NGF-stimulated cells phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-ATF-2 (4-fold above basal levels), p38 from NGF-stimulated cells pretreated with SB203580 did not appreciably phosphorylate its substrate (data not shown). ERK1/ERK2 activity was inhibited by employing the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (45Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Salteil A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Cells co-treated with NGF and PD98059 demonstrated significantly less down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA than cells treated with NGF alone, suggesting that ERK1/ERK2 plays at least a partial role in controlling A2AAR mRNA steady state levels (compare Figs. 5 B and 1 A). As reported previously (45Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Salteil A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), PC12 cells pretreated with PD98059 did not extend neurites following 3 d NGF as did cells treated with NGF alone (data not shown). Western analysis also confirmed that PD98059 inhibited ERK1/ERK2, but not p38 and SAPK/JNK, activity in PC12 cells treated with NGF (data not shown). To inhibit SAPK/JNK, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with SAPKβ(K55A), a kinase-defective construct of SAPKβ/JNK3. Following 1 and 3 d of NGF treatment, PC12 cells expressing SAPKβ(K55A) did not extend neurites, whereas empty vector-transfected PC12 cells extended neurites to the same extent as nontransfected cells (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with studies demonstrating that differentiation of PC12 cells requires the SAPK/JNK signal transduction pathway (46Kita Y. Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, PC12 cells expressing SAPKβ(K55A) did not undergo NGF-induced down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA following 1 d of treatment (102% of untreated cells). After 3 d of NGF incubation, SAPKβ(K55A) transfectants had a slight decrease in A2AAR mRNA (79% of untreated cells) that was not as great as that of empty vector-transfected cells. When kinase-defective SAPKβ transfectants were co-incubated with PD98059 and NGF for 3 d, down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA was completely blocked (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, when cells transfected with an empty vector were treated for 3 d with NGF alone, A2AAR mRNA was down-regulated to the same extent (42%) as wild-type PC12 cells (Fig. 1 A). As inhibition of either ERK1/ERK2 or SAPK/JNK individually results in partial inhibition of A2AAR mRNA regulation, these results indicate that ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK are both required for complete down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA. The capacity of NGF to down-regulate A2AAR mRNA following inhibition of the different MAP kinases was mimicked at the protein level (Fig. 6). It will be of interest in the future to determine whether NGF utilizes other mechanisms (besides mRNA regulation) to down-regulate A2AAR protein (e.g. ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation). To summarize, the data presented here demonstrate that NGF-induced down-regulation of A2AAR mRNA and protein levels is TrkA-, Src-, and Ras-dependent. Furthermore, the MAP kinase family members ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK are distal signal transduction components activated by NGF and are implicated here as having important roles in mediating regulation of A2AAR mRNA. Recent reports have demonstrated a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase family members in regulating mRNA stability. NGF-induced stabilization of the M4 muscarinic receptor mRNA requires ERK1/ERK2 (12Lee N.H. Malek R.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2090410351,"Urea-induced unfolding of lipoxygenase-1 (LOX1) at pH 7.0 was followed by enzyme activity, spectroscopic measurements, and limited proteolysis experiments. Complete unfolding of LOX1 in 9m urea in the presence of thiol reducing or thiol modifying reagents was observed. The aggregation and oxidative reactions prevented the reversible unfolding of the molecule. The loss of enzyme activity was much earlier than the structural loss of the molecule during the course of unfolding, with the midpoint concentrations being 4.5 and 7.0 m for activity and spectroscopic measurements, respectively. The equilibrium unfolding transition could be adequately fitted to a three-state, two-step model (N ↔ I ↔ U) and the intermediate fraction was maximally populated at 6.3 m urea. The free energy change (ΔG H2O) for the unfolding of native (N) to intermediate (I) was 14.2 ± 0.28 kcal/mol and for the intermediate to the unfolded state (U) was 11.9 ± 0.12 kcal/mol. The ANS binding measurements as a function of urea concentration indicated that the maximum binding of ANS was in 6.3 m urea due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups; this intermediate showed significant amount of tertiary structure and retained nearly 60% of secondary structure. The limited proteolysis measurements showed that the initiation of unfolding was from the C-terminal domain. Thus, the stable intermediate observed could be the C-terminal domain unfolded with exposed hydrophobic domain-domain interface. Limited proteolysis experiments during refolding process suggested that the intermediate refolded prior to completely unfolded LOX1. These results confirmed the role of cysteine residues and domain-domain interactions in the reversible unfolding of LOX1.

Dahlen S.E. Lindren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). These metabolites are the important group of signaling molecules that mediate a number of biological processes (2Sigal E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L13-L28PubMed Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, asthma, and other immune system disorders are all influenced by the activities and products of the lipoxygenase enzymes (3Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Grechkin A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 317-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Both plant and animal lipoxygenases are monomeric polypeptides with closely related primary structures (5Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 6Yamamato S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenases in soybean exist in the form of three isozymes: LOX1,1 LOX2, and LOX3 (5Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Recently, the structures of LOX1 and LOX3 have been solved (7Gaffney B, J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 431-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Minor W. Steczko J.

Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The overall fold of LOX1 has two domains with 839 amino acid residues. The first 146 N-terminal amino acid residues form an eight-stranded β-barrel and remaining 693 amino acid residues form a C-terminal domain that consists of 23 helices and 8 β structures. Very recently, the x-ray structure of mammalian 15-lipoxygenase revealed a previously unrecognized N-terminal β domain and a larger C-terminal domain, which was shown to be predominantly α-helical (10Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of LOX1 has indicated that the interior of N-terminal barrel is densely packed with hydrophobic chains and the gross structure of the N-domain is superficially similar to a number of proteins/domains that bind hydrophobic molecules (11Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-terminal domain is totally separate from the rest of the molecule and makes only a loose contact with the C-terminal domain (12Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Since all the amino acid residues responsible for LOX1 catalysis are located in the C-terminal domain, the role of N-terminal domain in LOX1 molecule is still a matter of investigation. It has been reported previously that the generation of truncated LOX1, wherein residues 2–140 is replaced by five residues, yielded an inactive enzyme (13Steczko J. Donoho G.P. Clemens J.C. Doxon J.E. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4053-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which suggested the importance of N-terminal domain for catalysis. Our recent studies have demonstrated that chymotryptically derived nicked LOX1 can be separated into proteolytic domains at pH 4.0 (14Sudharshan E. Appu Rao A.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The limited proteolysis experiments have shown that the cleavage does not occur in the linking region between the two domains as is common for multidomain proteins, even though there are as many as 12 potential trypsin sites in the span. The isolated fragments do not have any catalytic activity, and the reconstitution of active enzyme from the resolved fragments has not been achieved. Furthermore, the solution conformational analysis of LOX1 suggested that the domains in LOX1 were held by extensive hydrophobic interdomain interactions. LOX1 is a very large molecule, which does not have any disulfide bridge. Whether in this context, the domains are intrinsically stable, or domain interactions contribute to the overall stability, is still unknown. The importance in the expression of their functions or folding of the molecule is yet to be defined. Previously, we had reported the unfolding of LOX1 by urea and guanidine hydrochloride was a multistep process, which indicated the multidomain nature of LOX1 (15Srinivasulu S. Appu Rao A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The kinetics of unfolding had shown the presence of stable intermediates during the unfolding process (15Srinivasulu S. Appu Rao A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Wu Y. Wang Z.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since measurements were made at pH 9.0, the pH optima of LOX1, the unfolding was irreversible due to aggregation and strong tendency of free thiol groups for oxidative reaction. The present study was focussed on the involvement of free thiol groups and interdomain interaction in the reversible unfolding of LOX1. The results of the present study demonstrate that the modification of cysteine residue is essential for rapid refolding of LOX1, and none of the four free cysteine residues in LOX1 is essential for activity. From the limited proteolysis experiments and equilibrium unfolding measurements, we suggest a folding model for LOX1 molecule. LOX1 from soybean was purified by the method of Axelrod et al. (17Axelrod B. Cheesbrough T.M. Laakso S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 441-451Crossref Scopus (859) Google Scholar), with some modifications as reported previously (14Sudharshan E. Appu Rao A.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 200–220 units/mg protein. Linoleic acid was purchased from Nuchek Prep. Inc.; 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate (ANS) was from Aldrich; fluorescein mercuric acetate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), urea (Sigma Ultra), iodoacetamide (IAM), andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were from Sigma; 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (MIANS) was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. All other buffer salts were of analytical grade. LOX1 activity was measured according to the method of Axelrodet al. (17Axelrod B. Cheesbrough T.M. Laakso S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 441-451Crossref Scopus (859) Google Scholar) by following the increase in absorbance at 234 nm due to the formation of conjugated diene fatty acid hydroperoxide. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of product/min at 25 °C under the assay conditions. The protein concentration was determined using a value of A280 nm0.1% = 1.4 and a molecular mass of 94,262 (12Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). LOX1 was unfolded at various concentrations of urea at 25 °C for 12 h. The residual activity was measured by adding an aliquot of denatured enzyme into the assay solution, which contained 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, and 100 μm sodium linoleate. The product formation was measured at 234 nm. Urea-induced unfolding of LOX1 was also monitored by urea-gradient gel electrophoresis, essentially as described previously (18Goldenberg D.P Chreighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar). Briefly, slab gels were prepared containing a transverse gradient of 0–10 m urea with an inverse gradient of 5–9% acrylamide in order to compensate for the electrophoretic effect of urea. Unfolding of LOX1 was monitored using 50 mmTris-acetate, pH 8.0. Protein sample prepared in the same buffer and containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol was electrophoresed at 25 °C for 3 h at 9 mA constant current. Pre-electrophoresis was performed for 1 h. Protein was visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. In order to check the reversibility of unfolding of LOX1, the enzyme was unfolded in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing various concentrations of urea and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol or 0.1 mm IAM. Stock solution of 10m urea in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, was used to prepare various concentrations with the buffer containing 10% glycerol and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm IAM. The protein sample was allowed to unfold for 2 h. Pre-electrophoresis was done for 1 h. Samples were then loaded on non-denaturing Laemmli polyacrylamide gels, which contained 12% acrylamide in the stacking gel. Gels were also prepared containing detergents like Brij 35 or Triton X-100 and were stained separately for activity with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The activity staining was done as reported previously (19Andre J.C. Funk M.O. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The thiol groups exposed during the course of unfolding of LOX1 by urea were quantified by measuring their reactivities with DTNB as a function of the urea concentration. The assays were performed in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Thiol concentrations were estimated in a buffer solution containing the appropriate concentration of urea and 1 mm DTNB using an ε412 of 12,500m−1 cm−1 (20Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The number of thiols of LOX1 reacted with IAM were also estimated by initially incubating the LOX1 (1 mg/ml) with IAM (0.1 mm) for 2 h. The excess reagents and urea were removed by passing the mixture through Sephadex G-25 column. The remaining free thiols were estimated in the presence of 2% SDS. The thiol groups of LOX1 exposed during the denaturation were identified by modifying with FMA. To the solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm FMA and various urea concentrations, LOX1 (1 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. The excess reagents were removed by passing the mixture into Sephadex G-25 column, equilibrated and eluted with 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The labeled LOX1 was subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin. The cleavage conditions were followed as reported previously (21Ramachandran S. Carroll R.T. Dunham W.R. Funk Jr., M.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7700-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The proteolytic domains were separated by standard SDS-acrylamide (12%) gel elecrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). The samples treated with 2% SDS and 10% glycerol without β-mercaptoethanol were heated for 90 s before loading on the gel. The gels were photographed with UV illumination to observe the fluorescence. The environment around the cysteine residues of LOX1 was probed by modifying the thiols with MIANS. Samples containing 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, with various concentrations of urea and 0.1 mm MIANS were incubated with LOX1 (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 h, and the excess reagent and urea were removed by passing the sample into Sephadex G-25 column. The fluorescence spectra of the labeled LOX1 were recorded by exciting the sample both at 283 nm for aromatic amino acid residues and 328 nm for ANS. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were recorded as described previously (15Srinivasulu S. Appu Rao A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The light path length of the cell used was 1 mm in the far-UV region and 10 mm in the near-UV region. The protein concentrations were 0.2–1.0 mg/ml. The samples were prepared in varying concentrations of urea in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm IAM. All the samples were incubated for 12 h at 25 °C before the measurements were made. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ]MRW, was calculated using a value of 112 for mean residue weight for LOX1. The emission spectra of intrinsic protein fluorescence were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5000 automatic recording spectrofluorimeter. The temperature of the cell was maintained at 25 °C by circulating the water through the thermojacketed holder from a circulating water bath. The excitation wavelength was set at 283 nm, and emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. All unfolding measurements were made with the same concentration of LOX1 (30 μg/ml). The unfolding measurements were made in two different buffer solutions,i.e. 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm IAM; and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The stock solutions of protein and urea were prepared using the respective buffer solutions. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 12 h before the measurements were made. During the course of incubation, there was no carbamylation of protein as confirmed by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoretic measurements. The pI of the native LOX1 and urea-treated LOX1 were same. The equilibrium unfolding data for LOX1 was obtained in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm IAM. Two stock solutions of native LOX1 in buffer and unfolded LOX1 in buffered 10 m urea solutions were prepared at the same protein concentration (30 μg/ml). Appropriate ratios of the native and unfolded stocks were mixed to prepare samples at intermediate urea concentrations. All samples were then incubated for 24 h at 25 °C before the measurements. To test for reversibility, a solution of protein in the post-transition region of the denaturation curve was diluted with protein and buffer in the pre-transition region, and fluorescence intensity was then measured directly. Enzyme activity was also used as a measure of reversibility; for this, an aliquot in the transition regions was passed into Sephadex G 25 column, equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. LOX1 activity was measured using the standard assay method (17Axelrod B. Cheesbrough T.M. Laakso S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 441-451Crossref Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Samples from urea denaturation series were assayed for hydrophobic surface exposure by incubation with 50-fold molar excess of ANS for 6 h at 25 °C in the dark, followed by measuring fluorescence emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. Appropriate blank spectra of ANS in the corresponding urea concentrations were subtracted to obtain the fluorescence enhancement caused by dye adsorption to the protein. Samples of LOX1 (0.25 mg/ml) unfolded at different urea concentrations in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.1 mm IAM and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h were proteolyzed with 2% trypsin (w/w). LOX1 (5 mg/ml) unfolded in various urea concentrations with the same buffer was diluted into a buffer solution containing 2% (w/w) trypsin. Proteolysis reaction was allowed for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by SDS-sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was run in a 1.5-mm-thick gel format using 12% resolving gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. In the present study, the unfolding measurements were made at pH 7.0 in buffer solutions. In order to check for the complete unfolding of LOX1 by urea, the denaturation by urea-gradient elecrophoresis was followed. It was found that the complete unfolding of LOX1 occurred only after 8 m urea (Fig. 1). Therefore, we used 10 m urea containing 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol to ensure complete unfolding of LOX1 for refolding experiments. The renaturation experiments by dilution method or dialysis showed little or no reactivation of LOX1 denatured in 10m urea when refolding was attempted, even at a protein concentration of 1 μg/ml. Attempts were made to refold the protein unfolded at different concentrations of urea with β-mercaptoethanol by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unfolded LOX1 was subjected to PAGE at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Activity staining was used to check the presence of renatured LOX1 (Fig. 2 A). LOX1 was refolded at all concentrations of urea with a transition at 6 m. The refolding process was slow, as it took more than 12 h for complete detection of activity on gels. Similarly, these experiments were made by blocking the available cysteine residues during unfolding with IAM. The refolding of thiol-blocked LOX1 was similarly subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activity bands in these gels (Fig. 2 B) appeared immediately (∼15 min) after transferring the gel into the activity stain solution, suggesting that the refolding of thiol-blocked and unfolded LOX1 was faster than the one unfolded in the presence of reducing agents (compared on time scale basis: 15 min versus 12 h).FIG. 2Renaturation of unfolded LOX1 by gel electrophoresis. LOX1 (300 μg/ml) unfolded at various urea concentrations containing 0.1 mm IAM or 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol was elecrophoresed on the native polyacrylamide gel. Each well was loaded with 10 μg of sample. Bromphenol blue was used as tracking dye. LOX1 unfolded in the presence of 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stained for activity (A). LOX1 unfolded in the presence of 0.1 mm IAM and stained for activity (B). The number in each lane denotes the corresponding molar urea concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The attempts to refold the protein using protein refolding assisting agents like lauryl maltoside, Triton X-100, Brij 35, and phosphatidylcholine micelles were not successful. The refolding experiments were made in the presence of non-ionic detergents like Triton X-100 using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). LOX1 that had been exposed to different concentrations of urea were refolded to 4 m urea, beyond which aggregates were seen on the gels. These results suggested the binding of Triton X-100 with the refolding intermediates, which could be due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups on the intermediates. Refolding of completely denatured LOX1 in the polyacrylamide gels could possibly be due to the prevention of aggregation during refolding. When the denatured molecules were subjected to electrophoretic mobility in the pores of polyacrylamide gel, the intermolecular interactions were minimized, thus leading to the protein refolding. At higher concentration of urea, the aggregation could be minimized by small volumes and less protein concentration (results are not shown). This refolding phenomenon on polyacrylamide gels could also be extrapolated on gel permeation chromatography. A small quantity of LOX1 (10 μg in 0.5 ml) unfolded in 10 murea in the buffer solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm IAM) was loaded on Sephadex G 25 column (1 cm × 30 cm), which was previously equilibrated with the same buffer without IAM and was eluted with the same buffer. The extent of renaturation was measured by LOX1 activity in eluted protein fractions. We could recover about 20% of control initially loaded on the column. These results suggest the reversible unfolding of LOX1. LOX1 contains 4 cysteines: Cys-127, located in the N-terminal domain; and Cys-357, Cys-492, and Cys-679, associated with the C-terminal domain (7Gaffney B, J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 431-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). None of them was accessible to DTNB under native conditions. Therefore, accessibility of thiols to DTNB in the presence of urea should reflect urea-induced structural changes in LOX1. The accessibility of thiols of LOX to DTNB as a function of the urea concentration is shown in Fig. 4. The unfolding curve showed a biphasic transition, the first transition ending at 3 m urea and the second transition starting at 6m urea to be complete at 9.0 m urea. The initial exposure of two thiols was complete at 6.0 m urea, and the remaining two were exposed at 9.0 m urea. In the present work, attempts were made to identify the first two thiols exposed during the unfolding process. Previously it has been shown that LOX1 could be cleaved by trypsin into 30-kDa N-terminal and 60-kDa C-terminal proteolytic domains (21Ramachandran S. Carroll R.T. Dunham W.R. Funk Jr., M.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7700-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify the first cysteine residue, which contributed for the reaction with DTNB, LOX1 was labeled with FMA in the presence of various urea concentrations and was subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin; the fragments separated on SDS-PAGE were visualized under UV illumination (Fig. 5). Initially, at 1 m urea, the label was found mainly in the N-terminal 30-kDa fragment. At higher urea concentrations, the fluorescence label appeared in 60-kDa C-terminal fragment, and at 6 m urea both the domains were equally labeled. These observations indicated that the first cysteine exposed during the early stage of unfolding of LOX1 was mainly Cys-127 of N-terminal domain.FIG. 5SDS-PAGE of proteolytic domains of LOX1 labeled with FMA . LOX1 labeled with FMA in the presence of various concentrations of urea were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The samples were subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin (100:2 w/w) ratio in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; after 30 min, the reaction was stopped by 0.1 mm PMSF and the solution was diluted to two volumes using SDS-sample buffer containing 0.1 mm IAM and heated for 90 s. 30 μg of protein was layered on the gel and run on the Laemmli gel system. The gels were photographed with UV illumination. The number in each lane indicates the molar urea concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further, the environment around cysteine residues was probed using MIANS. This reagent reacts covalently with cysteine residues and exhibits fluorescence only when they are placed in the hydrophobic environment. Therefore, LOX1 was labeled with MIANS in the presence of different concentrations of urea. The unreacted MIANS was removed by passing through Sephadex G-25 column. However, beyond 6 murea, the labeling was not possible due to aggregation at high protein concentration (1 mg/ml) after passing through the column. The emission spectra of labeled LOX1 at different concentrations of urea are shown in Fig. 6 A. Initially, the fluorescence emission was checked after exciting at 328 nm for ANS fluorescence. The relative fluorescence intensity at 425 nm increased with increasing concentrations of urea, which suggested the hydrophobicity of cysteine residues. Further, to check the proximity of these cysteine residues to aromatic amino acid side chains of LOX1, the samples were also excited at 283 nm. There were two fluorescence emission maxima: one at 333 nm and other at 425 nm (Fig. 6 B). The emission intensity at 425 nm was due to bound ANS, which increased with increase in urea concentrations. Thus, there was an efficient energy transfer from aromatic amino acid side chains to ANS. In case of LOX1, labeled at 6 m urea energy transfer was maximum. The decreased area of the first peak was equally compensated in the second peak, suggesting maximum energy transfer efficiency (∼90%). These observations indicate that cysteine residues exposed at 6 m was in close proximity to aromatic side chains in the C-terminal domain of LOX1. The low efficiency of energy transfer observed at low urea concentrations of urea (2 and 4m) suggested that the environment around initially exposed cysteine residues is hydrophilic in nature. Thus, the N-terminal cysteine residue, Cys-127, is in a less hydrophobic environment compared with C-terminal cysteine residues. To assess the state of cysteine residues during the course of unfolding in the absence of reducing agents or thiol blocking agents, LOX1 was unfolded at 3, 6, and 9 m urea at 25 °C for 2 h and the thiol content of the unfolded species was assayed using DTNB. In case of native LOX1, none of the cysteine residues was accessible for DTNB; therefore, the assays were made in 2% SDS. The native LOX1 3.8 ± 0.3 thiols were accessible to DTNB after unfolding in 2% SDS. In case of LOX1 unfolded in 3, 6, and 9 m urea concentrations, the number of cysteine residues assayed in the presence of 2% SDS were 3.3 ± 0.3, 2.7 ± 0.2, and 1.9 ± 0.2, respectively. These results suggest that the thiol groups in LOX1 become oxidized during the course of unfolding. The decrease in cysteine content could be due to the formation of disulfide bridge or could be due to the oxidation to sulfite. This was checked by electrophoretic mobility of the modified residues on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (results not shown). The absence of higher aggregates clearly pointed to the absence of disulfide linkage and the likely formation of sulfite. The effects of increasing urea concentrations on the tertiary and secondary structures of LOX1 were studied by measuring CD spectra in the near- and far-UV regions, respectively. The characteristic pattern of positive bands in the near-UV region, caused by the asymmetric environment of Trp, Tyr, and Phe residues in the native structure, disappeared with increase in urea concentration (Fig. 7 A), indicating the disruption of native tertiary structure. However, at a urea concentration of approximately 2 m, the tyrosine band at 280 nm increased. There were no significant changes in the near-UV CD bands up to 4m urea, while there was significant reduction in near-UV CD bands at 6 m urea concentration. In the far-UV regio"

Structural modeling showed that this region encompasses both a Sushi-like and an epidermal growth factor-like domain, the flexible arrangement of which was putatively stabilized by calcium. The recombinant peptide was found to contain the previously identified conformational thyroperoxidase autoepitope. The occurrence of a calcium-induced conformational change was confirmed using a recombinant peptide monoclonal antibody, the decrease of which in binding to calcium-saturated thyroperoxidase was reversed by a chelating agent. The disease specificity of recombinant peptide, which was more frequently recognized by Hashimoto's than by Graves' patients, adds to its potential value as a diagnostic and preventive tool in the context of B-cell autoimmunity.

It is a heme-containing membrane enzyme which is expressed at the apical pole of thyrocytes facing the colloid space (1Taurog A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid. 7th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 47-84Google Scholar). TPO belongs to the mammalian peroxidase family, the members of which include myelo-, lacto-, eosinophil, and salivary peroxidases (2Banga J.P. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diab. 1998; 5: 275-281Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Human TPO contains 933 amino acids (aa), and shows a large extracellular region consisting of 848 aa and five potential glycosylation sites, a short membrane-spanning region, and a 61-aa cytoplasmic tail. Most of the extracellular region of TPO shows a high degree of homology with myeloperoxidase (aa 1–739). The extracellular region close to the membrane anchorage domain shows homologies with the C4b complement component (aa 739–794) and EGF (aa 794–842) (3Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of TPO is not yet known, and elucidating this point constitutes an important task for scientists investigating the peroxidase family and for immunologists focusing on autoimmunity questions because TPO is a major thyroid autoantigen. Autoantibodies (aAb) to TPO are the most sensitive and specific serological markers available for diagnosing autoimmune thyroid diseases. Like most antibodies to exogenous antigens, TPO aAb are produced by B lymphocytes via a T-cell-dependent mechanism involving specific cellular receptors and soluble cytokines. At the molecular level, however, the specificity of the autoimmune reaction relies on the recognition of TPO epitopes by T and B-cells (4Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 3: 96-102Google Scholar). T-cell receptors recognize linear epitopes from processed TPO associated with class II molecules belonging to the major histocompatibility complex, which are co-expressed at the surface of antigen-presenting cells. By contrast, B-cell receptors, which are membrane-bound immunoglobulins, usually have a more stringent specificity and recognize conformational epitopes, i.e. they are highly dependent on the three-dimensional structure of the TPO molecule (5Livingstone A.M. Fathman C.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1987; 5: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Davies D.R. Padlan E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 7Laver W.G. Air G.M. Webster R.G. Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). T-cell epitopes are rather cryptic because they are buried in the core of the molecule, whereas B-cell epitopes are surface markers. Consequently, T-cell epitopes may act at the onset of the disease when they are appropriately processed, and B-cell epitopes may provide highly specific targets for pathogenic aAb. Elucidating the molecular structures of these epitopes may help to prevent and cure autoimmune thyroid diseases. The data published so far on T-cell epitopes are unconclusive and cannot be used to draw up a specific therapeutic strategy as previous authors proposed to do (8Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1993; 260: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); whereas in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is associated with tissue-destructive events, TPO aAb may fix the complement and mediate aAb-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (9Bogner U. Schleusener H. Wall J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Wadeleux P. Winand-Devigne J. Ruf J. Carayon P. Winand R.

A specific B-cell epitope therapy that might block the destructive autoimmune process without affecting the immune system as a whole would stop thyroid cell death and do away with the need for conventional substitutive hormone therapy. TPO aAb are known to be restricted to two immunodominant regions containing different but adjacent surface epitopes (13Ruf J. Toubert M.-E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, neither the respective positions of these regions on the molecule nor the epitope structures targeted by the aAb of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease have yet been established. We recently located a conformational B-cell epitope at the C-terminal end of TPO near the membrane anchorage domain of the molecule (aa 742–848); this epitope was found to involve at least one of the three tyrosine residues present in this region (14Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present manuscript, some insights on the structure of this part of the molecule were provided by performing sequence alignment and modeling studies, which yielded information that was useful when subsequently analyzing the function of this conformational TPO B-cell epitope. After cloning the cDNA that encodes this TPO peptide by deleting the N-terminal part of the molecule showing homologies with myeloperoxidase, we expressed the recombinant peptide (r-pep) in plasmid-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The r-pep was found to contain the relevant TPO epitope previously identified in the native protein. In Western blot experiments, this epitope was recognized significantly more frequently by patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis rather than by those with Graves' disease. The two domains of TPO studied here (CCP domain, aa 742–795; calcium binding EGF domain, aa 796–839) were scanned for similarity against Protein Data Bank sequence entries using the BLAST algorithm (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). The sequences obtained were aligned with the Clustal W multiple alignment algorithm (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). For the molecular modeling, the alignment of the TPO domains with their homologous sequences and the known three-dimensional structures of these homologous sequences were used to calculate interatomic distances and dihedral angles. Three-dimensional structures were generated from this set of constraints with the X-PLOR Version 3.85 software program (17Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar) using the default parameter sets, except for some minor modifications performed to increase the duration of the molecular dynamic simulations and the number of energy minimization steps. All the sequence analysis procedures were carried out at the Pôle Bio-Informatique Lyonnais, a WWW server dedicated to protein sequence analysis located in Lyon, France. Structure superimpositions, three-dimensional graphic displays and manipulations were carried out using the ANTHEPROT 2.0 software program (18Geourjon C. Deléage G. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The full-length human TPO cDNA (19Magnusson R.P. Chazenbalk G.D. Gestautas J. Seto P. Filetti S. DeGroot L.J. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was cloned into HindIII andXbaI sites of the transfer vector pcDNA3 (20Niccoli P. Fayadat L. Panneels V. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29487-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A 710 nucleotides cDNA fragment corresponding to a peptide sequence around the 192 C-terminal aa of TPO was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the TPO-pcDNA3 construction. Oligonucleotides, 5′-ACTACCGCTCGAGCGACGACAAGTGTGGCTTCC, and, 3′-GATTTACCCGTGTTGGG, were used as primers. The 710-base pair amplified cDNA containing theXhoI and SplI restrictions sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the DNA fragment, respectively, were cleaved by the corresponding enzymes. The resulting 634-nucleotide cDNA fragment (ΔTPO) was cloned into XhoI and SplI sites of the TPO-pcDNA3 construction. This new construction (ΔTPO-pcDNA3) made it possible to conserve the TPO nucleotides coding for the signal peptide. The nucleotide sequence of the ΔTPO cDNA fragment was determined by performing sequencing to ascertain that the ΔTPO-pcDNA3 construct was correctly engineered. ΔTPO-pcDNA3 construct was transfected into the CHO cell line using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere under 7.5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stable transfectants were selected with 400 μg/ml GeneticinTM G418 sulfate during 6 weeks. Surviving cells were cloned by limiting dilutions and then grownin vitro in the presence of 10 mm n-butyric acid to enhance the expression of TPO r-pep. Stably transfected CHO cells grown in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3. Wild-type CHO cells grown under the same conditions were used in the control experiments. Cells were solubilized by adding 800 μl of electrophoresis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.02% G-250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue) to each dish. The cells were scraped and homogenized by vortexing and sonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was analyzed by performing the Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method (14Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ten μl of sample per lane, two lanes per test (transfected and wild-type CHO cells), were electrophoresed either without or with denaturation (2% β-mercaptoethanol, heated) on a 16.5% acrylamide, 80 × 100-mm minigel 0.5-mm thick and directly electrotransferred onto a 0.2-μm Trans-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Western blot experiments were performed by incubating patients' sera (500 μl per test) or TPO monoclonal antibody (mAb) 54 (100 μg) in 5 ml of PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking after previous saturation of the membrane with PBS containing 3% BSA. The membrane was then washed three times for 10 min in PBS. The second, anti-human or anti-mouse antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase was incubated for 2 h in PBS, 3% BSA at room temperature under shaking. After several additional washes, the blots were developed with 4-chloro 1-naphthol as a substrate. mAb 47 and 54 were previously produced by immunizing mice with purified human TPO (13Ruf J. Toubert M.-E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). mAb 47 were found to be directed against a linear epitope, aa 713–721, on TPO (21Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but the epitopic location of mAb 54 is not known to date. Both TPO mAb were produced in the form of mouse ascitic fluid and then purified by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. Wells of microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were filled with PBS containing 300 ng of human TPO purified as described previously (22Czarnocka B. Ruf J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). After being incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified atmosphere, the TPO coated wells were washed and filled with either PBS alone, PBS + CaCl2 (8 × 10−6m), and PBS + CaCl2 (8 × 10−6m) + EDTA (1.6 × 10−4m). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed again, saturated with BSA and filled with various amounts of TPO mAb in PBS, 1% BSA for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Wells filled with PBS, 1% BSA without mAb served to evaluate the nonspecific binding. Unbound mAb were then removed by extensive washing and mAb binding was detected by anti-mouse antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the substrate. The optical density was read at 405 nm. Sera were obtained from 24 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 18 patients with Graves' disease. Diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory criteria. The pathological sera were positive for TPO aAb as assessed by Dynotest (BRAHMS diagnostica, Berlin, Germany). Twenty sex- and age-matched normal controls had no clinical evidence or past history of thyroid disorder; they were negative for TPO aAb. The three-dimensional structure of TPO has not yet been elucidated, whereas that of myeloperoxidase has been described (23Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and was subsequently used to predict the structure of the part of TPO that showed homologous sequences (24Nishikawa T. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the B-cell autoepitope we previously detected was mapped at the C-terminal end of the extracellular part of TPO (aa 742–848), which is located outside the region homologous to myeloperoxidase. This region was previously reported to consist of two juxtaposed gene modules belonging to the C4b-β2 glycoprotein and EGF/LDL-receptor gene families (25Doolittle R.F. Feng D.F. Johnson M.S. McClure M.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Davie E.W. Ichinose A. Leytus S.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 509-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of more recent data, the C4b receptor-like domain was found to be a complement control protein repeat (CCP) which is present in the complement receptor type 1 (27Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in the Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) (28Wiles A.P. Shaw G. Bright J. Perczel A. Campbell I.D. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 19: 253-265Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and in the human Factor H (29Barlow P.N. Steinkasserer A. Norman D.G. Kieffer B. Wiles A.P. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 268-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,30Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 20: 717-725Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This short consensus repeat is formed by two disulfide bonds having features characteristic of a Sushi domain, i.e. the first cysteine in the aa sequence is connected to the third one and the second cysteine to the fourth (31Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The VCP and the factor H have a known three-dimensional structure that has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (32Abola E.E. Manning N.O. Prilusky J. Stampf D.R. Sussman J.L. J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. 1996; 101: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VCP entries 1VVD and 1VVE showed the closest homologies with the Sushi domain of TPO (aa 741 to 795). In addition, the EGF-like domain of TPO, which contains six conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds (33Savage C.R.J. Inagami T. Cohen S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7612-7621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also contains five aa that constitute a consensus sequence for calcium binding: D/N-x-D/N-E/Q-xm-D/N*-xn-Y/F, in which the asterisk might be a β-hydroxylated residue (34Rees D.J.G.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This domain of TPO acquired a higher score of homology from aa 794 to aa 839 with the homologous domain of human fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein found in connective tissue (37Handfort P.A. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of calcium binding to proteins containing this structural element are not yet known, but it was suggested that calcium may stabilize the structure of fibrillin-1 in a rod-like arrangement (38Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and may protect the molecule from proteolytic degradation (39Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human clotting factor IX which shows a calcium-binding EGF-like domain suggests that calcium may be involved in maintaining the conformation of the N-terminal region of the domain but, more importantly, proves that calcium is able to directly mediate protein-protein interactions (40Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Browlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The Sushi domain of VCP and the calcium binding EGF-like domain of fibrillin-1 require a specific internal arrangement of the numerous disulfide bonds that we used to model the membrane proximal TPO region. These two TPO domains were aligned with the 1VVD and 1VVE sequences in the case of the Sushi domain and with the 1EMO sequence in that of the EGF domain (Fig. 1). These two alignments show a reasonably high degree of similarity and in particular, all the cysteines involved in disulfide bonds were found to be conserved: C742-C782 and C768-C794for the Sushi domain; C800-C814, C808-C823, and C825-C838 for the EGF domain. In addition, the calcium-binding consensus sequence D/N-x-D/N-E/Q-xm-D/N*-xn-Y/F is conserved in the second alignment. A molecular model was generated for this peptide based on the three-dimensional structure of 1VVD and 1VVE for the Sushi domain and 1EMO for the EGF-like domain. The coordinates of these proteins were used to calculate the corresponding distance constraints and dihedral angles to generate the three-dimensional model as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the structures generated satisfy these constraints: there are no violations of the distance or dihedral constraints, no distance deviations >0.5 Å, and no dihedral deviations >5° (data not shown). The peptide contains three tyrosine residues at positions 766, 772, and 829. At least one of these tyrosines is involved in the B-cell epitope because we previously observed that the peptide binding to aAb is susceptible to iodination (14Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These three tyrosines obtained very different scores with regard to their accessibility to solvent, as calculated with the X-PLOR Version 3.85 software program (17Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar, 41Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar): 0.07Å2 (ς = 0.07 Å2) for Tyr766, 12.99 Å2(ς = 3.9 Å2) for Tyr772, and 6.37 Å2 (ς = 2 Å2) for Tyr829. Tyrosine 829 obtained a high accessibility score, but one should remember that it is located near the transmembrane region beginning at amino acid 849 and that the membrane was not included in the model. As shown in Fig. 2, the most accessible tyrosine was located at position 772, near the linking region between the highly structured cores of the two modules. Consequently, the two modules may belong to and together form a unique B-cell autoepitope. The arrangement of the two domains may be stabilized by calcium ligation of the EGF domain and interdomain hydrophobic packing interactions, as previously found to occur in the case of the EGF domain pair (38Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and the TB-EGF domain pair (42Kettle S. Yan X.

The tyrosine 772, which seems to expose its side-chain at the hinge area, may therefore be involved in interdomain hydrophobic packing interactions. The epitopic specificity of TPO in comparison with other peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase might be because of this original construction, which would explain what purpose these gene modules serve and how they are maintained in evolution. Moreover, the location of a major TPO autoepitope outside the region showing homologies with myeloperoxidase is liable to prevent autoimmune cross-reactions from occurring with this other autoantigen which is implicated in systemic vasculitis and idiopathic necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis (43Falk R.J. Jenette J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). CHO cell lines were transfected with ΔTPO-pcDNA3 construct, selected with GeneticinTM, and cloned for homogeneity. Clones of CHO cells were grown in the presence of butyrate and screened for TPO r-pep expression in Western blot experiments using a pool of sera from patients previously found to be reactive with the native, proteolytic TPO peptide (14Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several positive clones were obtained, and one of the most productive was selected for further use. Fig. 3 A shows that transfected but not wild-type CHO cells contained a peptide of the expected molecular weight (about 20 kDa) which was recognized by aAb present in the pool of sera from the patients. As expected, the targeted B-cell epitope was conformational, i.e. it consisted of juxtaposed aa occurring at intervals in the sequence but brought closely together by the three-dimensional folding of the molecule because the immunoreactivity was lost after the reduction of the disulfide bridges with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3 B). The antigenic specificity was proved by pre-absorption experiments showing that relevant TPO (Fig. 3 C) but not irrelevant thyroglobulin (Fig. 3 D) inhibited the binding of TPO aAb to r-pep. From the 66 murine TPO mAb we previously produced (13Ruf J. Toubert M.-E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), only one, mAb 54, was found to react with the r-pep in Western blot experiments (Fig. 4 A). The mAb 54 binding to the r-pep was lost (i) after previous treatment of the r-pep with a reducing agent, confirming the recognition of a disulfide bridge-dependent epitope (Fig. 4 B), and ii) after previous absorption of the r-pep with the pool of sera from the patients, indicating that mAb 54 and TPO aAb are directed to the same TPO domain (Fig. 4 C). To determine the effects of calcium on the B-cell epitope conformation of r-pep, we tested the binding behavior of mAb 54 to native, purified TPO saturated with calcium. The presence of calcium on TPO was found to greatly decrease its ability to bind to mAb 54. The calcium-induced inhibition was reversed by chelating calcium with EDTA before adding it to TPO (Fig. 5 A). The TPO binding of mAb 47, which recognized a linear TPO peptide (aa 713–721) not present in the r-pep, was not affected by calcium treatment of TPO (Fig. 5 B).FIG. 5Calcium-induced effect on TPO r-pep immunoreactivity.

They came from patients with Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which are two well characterized autoimmune thyroid diseases with positive TPO aAb. To date, TPO aAb assay does not discriminate between these two diseases. Only a rise in the normal background of TPO aAb is taken to be a sign of thyroid autoimmune attack. The serological diagnosis of Graves' disease may be ascertained by the presence of aAb against the thyrotropin receptor. Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is based on histological examination of diffuse lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis of thyroid gland rather than aAb determination. However, positive thyroid aAb can alert physicians to the patient's risk of developing thyroid dysfunction associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis as well as Graves' disease. As shown in Table I, 79.2% of the patients in the Hashimoto's group were positive for TPO r-pep, as compared with only 27.8% of patients with Graves' disease. The latter cases may have reached a transient state in the course of thyroid disease before evolving to overt Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Surprisingly, 6.7% of the normal subjects tested were positive and were therefore candidates for developing thyroiditis. These results are of special interest because this is the first time a single TPO aAb has been found to clearly distinguish between the two main autoimmune thyroid disorders. It is worth noting that the presence of aAb against TPO r-pep was not found to be correlated with the TPO titer of the sera in the two groups of patients (Fig. 6). This is the first direct evidence showing that TPO aAb are directed to at least two different epitopes, in agreement with what was previously suggested by the results of competitive binding studies on TPO between mAb and aAb (13Ruf J. Toubert M.-E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.-M. Ferrand M. Carayon P.

Open table in a new tab In the present study, we propose a structural model for the proximal membrane region of TPO, which provides new insights into the autoimmune role of gene modules assembled and conserved during evolution in large proteins. One particularly noteworthy finding was that the B-cell epitope is coded by two gene modules which are closely juxtaposed after the MPO-like coding sequence and before the membrane spanning region. In the model, this epitope is located near the tyrosine 772 and the calcium binding site. This model provides information which will be of use in further studies, which may lead to the development of a specific therapeutic strategy for preventing the disease from occurring in subjects liable to undergo an autoimmune attack. A recurrent question in the field of autoimmunity relates to the heterogeneity of aAb of the patient, which are often restricted to some epitopic structures. Elucidating the immunodominant B-cell epitopes may help to understand the mechanisms responsible for loss of self-tolerance in organ-specific autoimmune diseases. The proximal membrane region of TPO produced as a peptide in eucaryotic system was used here to characterize a specific B-cell epitope recognized by aAb from Hashimoto's patients. The corresponding TPO region may be critically involved in the development of the disease. Its diagnostic value now requires confirmation by performing large-scale clinical tests.

However, the mechanism by which a specific G-protein is selected by a GPCR is not known. In the current model of GPCR activation, agonist binding modulates helix-helix interactions, which is necessary for fully determining G-protein specificity and stimulation of GDP/GTP exchange. In this study, we report that a single-residue deletion in transmembrane helix IV leads the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor chimera CR17 to retain GTP-sensitive high affinity for the agonist angiotensin II but results in complete inactivation of intracellular inositol phosphate production. The agonist dissociation profile of CR17 in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate suggests that the activation-induced conformational changes of the chimeric receptor itself remain intact. Insertion of an alanine at position 149 (CR17▿149A) in this chimera rescued the inactive phenotype, restoring intracellular inositol phosphate production by the chimera. This finding suggests that in the wild-type AT1 receptor the orientation of transmembrane helix IV-residues following Cys149 is a key determinant for effectively distinguishing among various structurally similar G-proteins. The results emphasize that the contacts within the membrane-embedded portion of transmembrane helix IV in the AT1 receptor is important for specific G-protein selection.

Two distinct integral membrane receptors, type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2), belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, mediate the intracellular response to Ang II. The predicted secondary structures of AT1 and AT2are characterized by seven transmembrane α-helical segments (TM-I through TM-VII), three connecting loops on either side of the membrane, an extracellular N terminus, and a cytoplasmic C terminus. The extracellular loops and the transmembrane domain are involved in binding Ang II, whereas the cytoplasmic loops form the site for binding the G-protein (guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein) upon activation. The AT1 receptor is a prototypical GPCR, mediating most known functions of Ang II, and the mechanism for the functions of the AT1 receptor are relatively well studied (3Catt K.J. Robertson J.I.S.

Notably, the binding of the agonist Ang II to the AT2 receptor is insensitive to analogues of GTP, and second-messenger assays for detection of AT2 receptor activation have been unsuccessful in various recombinantly expressed surrogate cell systems (10Miura S.

However, a chimera in which AT1 receptor residues 99–359 have been replaced with a topologically identical segment from the AT2 receptor was inactive, whereas a chimera with residues 165–359 replaced with a segment from the AT2 receptor was fully active (Fig. 1). Members of the GPCR family are believed to have the same basic molecular architecture. Therefore, one can construct chimeras that retain distinct subtype-specific functions or exhibit functions of both parent subtypes simultaneously or that display unique defects. The study of chimeric receptors helps us understand the signal transduction mechanism. To gain potentially important insight into the mechanism of G-protein recruitment in Ang II signaling, we analyzed several chimeras containing portions of AT2 receptor segments. The results indicate that the integrity of TM-IV of the AT1 receptor is critical for specific G-protein coupling. The monoclonal antibody 1D4 was supplied by the Cell Culture Center, Endotronic Inc.

Briefly, membranes expressing receptors were incubated with 0.3 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and 0.03 to 3.0 nm127I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in assay buffer for the competition binding study. For the saturation binding study, a 10-fold higher concentration of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II than theK d value of the receptor was used to get >90% bound form of the receptor. Nonspecific binding (which was <5% of total binding in our experiments) to the membranes was determined from125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding in the presence of 10−5m cold127I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. All binding studies were performed at 22 °C for 1 h unless specifically indicated. The binding reaction was stopped by filtering under vacuum (Brandel Type M-24R) on FP-200 GF/C filters (Whatman Inc.). Filter-bound125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was quantitated in a gamma-counter (Packard). Equilibrium binding kinetics were determined using the computer program Ligand. TheK d values represent the mean ± S.E. of three or more independent determinations. To measure the competitive dissociation of 125I-Ang II from the receptors in the presence and absence of G-protein activation receptor bound radioligand was challenged with cold Ang II or a mixture of cold Ang II and GTPγS. To ensure that the 125I-Ang II binding reaction reached equilibrium, the radioligand and membrane were mixed for 30 min at 22 °C. After this time, either cold Ang II or a mixture of cold Ang II and GTPγS (100 μm) was added, and the incubation was allowed to continue for another 60 min at 22 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the membranes were collected by filtration and washed, and the bound radioactivity was determined. In a typical experiment, the total 125I-Ang II per tube was 330,000 cpm, of which specific binding without any competitor and GTPγS added was 28,000 cpm and the nonspecific binding in the presence of 10−4m Ang II was 960 cpm. To measure the effect of GTPγS on Ang II binding, membrane samples (10–15 μg of protein) were incubated with 300 pm125I-Ang II in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of GTPγS. Dissociation of the radioligand was initiated by adding 10−6m cold127I-Ang II. The dissociation constants were calculated by nonlinear regression using single or double exponential decay equations. Transfected COS1 cells were cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes for 24 h after transfection, then labeled for 24 h with [3H]myoinositol (1.5 μCi/Petri dish), specific activity 22 Ci/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. At 48 h after transfection, the labeled cells were washed with serum-free medium three times and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 20 min; agonists were added, and incubation was continued for another 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and total soluble IP was extracted from the cells by the perchloric acid extraction method, as described previously (8Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P.

Expression, in each case, was measured by immunoblotting with the C-terminal epitope-directed monoclonal antibody 1D4 (data not shown), followed by125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding and competition binding to subtype-specific antagonists (Table I) and then by second-messenger production to measure function. The affinity of the expressed AT1 and AT2 receptors were 0.3 ± 0.09 and 0.21 ± 0.05 nm, respectively, for the nonselective peptide antagonist125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, and 11.8 ± 1.7 and 17.2 ± 6.4 nm, respectively, for losartan and PD123319. The K d values of the AT1 receptor for the agonists [Sar1]Ang II and Ang II were 0.33 ± 0.07 and 3.1 ± 0.33 nm, respectively. The B max values estimated for the two receptors were very similar (∼5 pmol/mg). Scatchard plot analysis indicated a single affinity class for both receptors. Competition binding studies employing Ang II, [Sar1]Ang II, losartan, and PD123319 demonstrated that the receptors expressed in COS1 cells preserve the selectivity and affinity profiles previously described for native tissue receptors as well as recombinantly expressed receptors. The protein expression of all the mutants described in this report was within 25% of the level of the expression of the wild-type receptor (Table I). The variation in cell surface receptor number, estimated by acid labile binding of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in intact cells, was 1.3–1.7 × 105 sites per cell in this study.Table IBinding affinity for rat AT 1 and AT 2 wild-type and chimera receptorsReceptorK dB max[Sar1,Ile8]Ang IILosartanAng IIPD123319nmpmol/mg proteinAT1WT0.3 ± 0.0911.8 ± 1.73.1 ± 0.33>1075.4 ± 0.12AT2WT0.21 ± 0.05>1071.2 ± 0.1217.2 ± 6.45.2 ± 0.14CR53.81 ± 1.30>106ND112 ± 285.0 ± 0.13CR76.32 ± 1.84>105ND>1044.3 ± 0.16CR83.51 ± 1.22>107ND672 ± 394.1 ± 0.11CR172.32 ± 0.6445.2 ± 4.64.9 ± 0.51>1074.9 ± 0.28CR5∇149A3.78 ± 1.20>106ND120 ± 274.7 ± 0.21CR7∇149A6.40 ± 1.81>105ND>1045.1 ± 0.19CR17∇149A2.14 ± 0.6142.3 ± 5.43.4 ± 0.41>1074.2 ± 0.23 Open table in a new tab The ability of AT1 receptor to activate IP production in COS1 cells has been described before by our laboratory (5Noda K.

The basal IP production in transfected COS1 cells without [Sar1]Ang II treatment is 5 ± 0.5% (∼4000 cpm) when compared with the maximal IP response elicited by [Sar1]Ang II concentration >10 7m (taken as 100%). This value is significantly higher than that measured in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Alterations in the functional activity of different mutant receptors could be accurately measured in the COS1 cells, because the maximal IP response elicited by the AT1 receptor is very high (∼50,000 cpm/107 cells). The wild-type AT2 receptor does not elicit an IP response or any other second-messenger response in COS1 cells, as reported earlier in other surrogate cell systems (Fig. 2) (11Mukoyama M. Nakajima M.

We constructed 25 chimeras of AT1 and AT2 receptors to elucidate the molecular basis of the Ang II receptor subtype-specific functions. A chimera containing the AT1 receptor in which residues 99–359 had been replaced with a topologically identical segment from the AT2 receptor was inactive, whereas a chimera with residues 165 through 359 replaced with that of AT2 receptor was fully active. Both of these chimeras express well and bind Ang II with high affinity. 2Y.-H. Feng and S. S. Karnik, unpublished results. Analysis of chimeras CR5, CR7, CR8, and CR17 (Fig. 1) suggests that the dominant loss of function is linked to the TM-IV segment derived from the AT2 receptor. These chimeras were constructed to individually evaluate the role of TM-III, TM-IV, and the interhelical cytoplasmic loop connecting the two helices that include residues 99–165 of the AT1 receptor. The expression levels of the chimeras were comparable to that of the wild-type AT1receptor (Table I). The affinity of [Sar1Ile8]Ang II was slightly reduced, and the affinity of losartan was reduced more than 100,000-fold in all of the chimeras. The affinity of PD123319 varied between chimeras. Chimeras CR5 and CR7 were inactive (Fig. 2), suggesting that neither the second cytoplasmic segment (CR5) nor the TM-III and the second cytoplasmic segment (CR7) from the AT1 receptor could rescue the function. The chimera CR8, which contains TM-III from the AT2 receptor but the second cytoplasmic loop and TM-IV segment of the AT1 receptor, demonstrated increased (12%) basal activity and was fully activated by [Sar1]Ang II. The putative mechanism of constitutive activity of CR8 has been fully described previously (9Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Restoration of function in CR8 (which contains TM-IV and the adjacent loop segment of the AT1receptor) implies that the defect in CR5 and CR7 function is related to the TM-IV segment derived from the AT2 receptor. This conclusion is further supported by results from the CR17 chimera, in which the TM-IV region in the AT1 receptor (Lys146–Ile166 shown within the box in Fig. 1 A) was replaced by a topologically identical 19-residue segment (Tyr162–Tyr180) of the AT2receptor. Although chimera CR17 expressed well and its ligand affinity profile is comparable to that of the wild-type receptor (Table I), it did not activate IP production upon Ang II stimulation (Fig. 2). Because a larger segment exchange (i.e. residues 166–359) between the two receptors yielded functional chimeras, the lack of function in CR17 indicates incompatibility of TM-IV helices in the two Ang II receptors. The inability of CR17 to stimulate IP production could be caused by the lack of Ang II-induced isomerization to the active state or by the inability of the activated form of the receptor to interact with G-proteins. To distinguish between these two possibilities, G-protein interaction with receptor was evaluated by measuring the dissociation rate of 125I-Ang II from wild-type and CR17 chimeric receptors in the presence and absence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS (Fig. 3 A). In the absence of added GTPγS, the higher affinity of the125I-Ang II in the ternary agonist-receptor-G-protein complex is indicated from 6–10-fold higher molar concentration of the cold Ang II at which the radioligand binding is inhibited. The magnitude of the GTP-induced affinity shift is more pronounced with the CR17 chimera than with the wild-type receptor, perhaps suggesting that different G-proteins are responsible for the shift observed in each. This suggestion needs further confirmation. In the presence of the added GTPγS, the dissociation of 125I-Ang II is faster from both wild-type and CR17 chimeric receptors, suggesting the existence of a low affinity binary agonist-receptor complex. This implies that CR17 chimera is capable of stimulating GDP/GTP exchange in G-protein bound to the receptor. The GTPγS-dependent destabilization of the ternary complex implies that the binding and dissociation of G-protein from the agonist-activated receptor is intact. Fig. 3 B shows that the dissociation kinetics exhibited by the CR17 chimera is comparable to that exhibited by the wild-type receptor, suggesting that the CR17 receptor interacted productively with a G-protein, even though the IP formation was completely defective. These observations suggest that the ligand activated CR17 chimeric receptor couples to a G-protein from a family other than the phospholipase C (PLC) activating Gq family of G-proteins. Pertussis toxin treatment did not unmask PLC activation in CR17-transfected cells. 3S. Chang and S. S. Karnik, unpublished observations. Exposure to pertussis toxin, which uncouples receptors from Gi/Go, the abundant pool of G-proteins in the cell, is expected to unmask nonspecifically coupled receptors, as has been shown previously (16Noda K.

The lack of an increase in IP formation from this treatment indicates that Gi/Go did not block coupling to Gq and that the G-protein specificity of CR17 is not relaxed but altered. However, there was no alteration in the intracellular concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, calcium, and arachidonic acid in CR17-transfected cells following [Sar1]Ang II stimulation.2 Thus, the identity of the G-protein coupled to CR17 and of the downstream signal activated is currently unknown.

Biotech. Biochem. 62, 2155–2160). The apoenzyme produced was very unstable, and therefore, after complexation with methylcobalamin, the functional holoenzyme was purified to homogeneity. The specific activity and apparent Km values for substrates were in good agreement with those obtained with purified rat liver enzyme. The electronic spectrum of the purified recombinant enzyme resembled that of cob(II)alamin and changed to a methylcobalamin-like one upon incubation of the enzyme with titanium(III) andS-adenosylmethionine. The rate of oxidative inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine was slower with a stronger reducing agent like titanium(III). The nucleotide moiety, especially the phosphodiester group, was shown to play an important role in the binding of the coenzyme to apoprotein and thus for catalysis. Upon incubation with the apoenzyme in the absence of a reducing agent, cyano- and aquacobalamin were not effective or were effective only slightly in reconstituting holoenzyme. Ethyl- and propylcobalamin formed inactive complexes with apoenzyme, which were converted to holoenzyme by photolytic activation. Adenosylcobalamin was not able to form a complex with apoenzyme, which was convertible to holoenzyme by photoirradiation.

MeCbl is involved as an intermediate in the two-step methyl transfer reactions, that is, cob(I)alamin is first methylated by MeH4F forming MeCbl and H4F, and MeCbl is successively demethylated by homocysteine forming methionine and regenerating cob(I)alamin. Because intermediate cob(I)alamin is a supernucleophile and easily oxidizable, the enzyme undergoes oxidative inactivation under aerobic conditions (1Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For reactivation of the inactivated enzyme, AdoMet and a one-electron reducing system are required. The physiological partners transferring a reducing equivalent from NADPH to the enzyme are two flavoproteins in Escherichia coli (2Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that at least two auxiliary redox proteins are needed for physiological reactivation of mammalian enzyme with NADPH (3Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S.

That is, upon binding to apoenzyme, the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ligand coordinating to the cobalt atom in the free cofactor is displaced from the cobalt atom, and instead, the imidazole group of a certain histidine residue of the protein is ligated to it. Unique motifs for cobalamin binding in the so-called “base-off” mode as well as that for AdoMet binding were also reported (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L.

All the motifs for the Cbl and AdoMet binding are completely conserved in the rat enzyme, and amino acid sequences around these motifs are also highly conserved. These suggest that mammalian methionine synthases also bind Cbl in the base-off mode with histidine ligation and catalyze the reaction by essentially the same mechanism as that for the E. coli enzyme, although slight differences between the E. coli (12Taylor R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mammalian (13Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol.

Because the mammalian tissues contain the enzyme only in an extremely low level, we attempted to establish a method for high level expression of recombinant rat methionine synthase in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (10Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2155-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report heterologous expression, purification, and enzymological properties of recombinant rat methionine synthase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCrystalline MeCbl and AdoCbl were a gift from Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). aqCbl was prepared by photolysis of AdoCbl. EtCbl and PrCbl were prepared by reactions of cob(I)alamin with ethyl bromide andn-propyl iodide, respectively, and MeCbi was prepared by reaction of cob(I)inamide with methyl iodide (14Smith E.L. Mervyn L. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 2p-3pGoogle Scholar). Cyanoaquacobinamide methyl phosphate synthesized as reported previously (15Ishida A. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was converted to MeCbiP-Me by the same method. Titanium(III) citrate was prepared from TiCl3 (Nacalai tesque) according to the method of Zehnder and Wuhrmann (16Zehnder A.J.B. Wuhrmann K. Science. 1976; 194: 1165-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). [methyl-14C]MeH4F was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. MeH4F (barium salt) and AdoMet (chloride salt) were obtained from Sigma. Homocysteine was purchased from Aldrich.Expression of Rat Methionine Synthase cDNA in E. coli Cells Using a T7 Expression SystemThe cDNA containing the coding region of rat methionine synthase (10Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2155-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was inserted into plasmid vector pRK172 (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) downstream of T7 promoter. The resulting plasmid was transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3), and expression of the methionine synthase cDNA was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the growing culture.Expression of Rat Methionine Synthase in Insect Cells Using Baculovirus Expression SystemSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf21 and Sf9) insect cells were maintained at 27.5 °C without supplementation of CO2. The recombinant baculovirus containing the coding region of rat methionine synthase cDNA was used as reported previously (10Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2155-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The media used for insect cell growth were Sf-900 II SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and EXCELL 400 (JRH Bioscience). Antibiotics, such as gentamicin sulfate and amphotelicin B, were added to the medium. Both monolayer culture and spinner culture were used for expression of recombinant rat methionine synthase. Sf21 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus were cultured with or without added CN-Cbl. The maximal production of the recombinant protein was usually obtained in 3 days post-infection for monolayer culture and in 3–4 days for spinner culture. The Sf cells harvested were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C until use.Enzyme and Protein AssaysMethionine synthase activity was determined by two methods: a standard assay and an anaerobic assay. The standard assay according to the method of Frasca et al. (18Frasca V. Banerjee R.V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8458-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. The mixture contained 0.56 mm homocysteine, 40 μm AdoMet, 25 mm DTT, 50 μmaqCbl, an appropriate amount of enzyme, and 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After the mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, reaction was started by adding 0.16 mm[14C]MeH4F (specific activity, 2,000 dpm/nmol) to a final volume of 250 μl. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by quick chilling and dilution with 2 volumes of ice-cold water. The amount of methionine produced was determined by passing through a Dowex 1(Cl−) column and counting14C radioactivity. The anaerobic assay was performed as described by Chen et al. (19Chen Z. Chakraborty S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19246-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using Ti(III) citrate as a reducing agent. The conditions were the same as the standard assay, except that Ti(III) citrate was added to a final concentration of 2 mm instead of aqCbl/DTT, and that the reaction was carried out under a H2 atmosphere. One unit of methionine synthase was defined as the amount of enzyme activity that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of methionine/min at 37 °C. The total activity and holoenzyme activity were determined with and without added MeCbl, respectively. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot AnalysisSDS-PAGE was performed on a 5% acrylamide gel as reported by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). The protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-methionine synthase antiserum was used as primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. The bands were visualized by reaction of alkaline phosphatase with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in the presence of nitroblue tetrazolium.Purification of Recombinant Rat Methionine SynthaseA method for purifying the recombinant enzyme was developed on the basis of the purification of the enzyme from rat liver (22Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Kawata T. Wada M. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1997; 43: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All the procedures were performed at 0–4 °C, except otherwise noted.Step 1: Preparation of Crude ExtractThe recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells from 500 ml of culture were disrupted by sonication in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05 m KCl. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 10 μm MeCbl. This solution was used as the crude extract.Step 2: Batch Chromatography on DE-52 (DEAE-cellulose)20 ml of DE-52 (Whatman), which was preliminarily equilibrated with the same buffer, was added to the crude extract. After the suspension was gently stirred for 30 min, the resin was packed into a column. After washing the column with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05 m KCl, the enzyme was eluted by 0.3 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.3m KCl.Step 3: Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation90% saturated solution of ammonium sulfate adjusted to pH 7.0 was added to the enzyme solution to a final concentration of 45% of saturation. After 20 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The precipitate was redissolved in 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5m KCl.Step 4: Hydroxyapatite Column ChromatographyThe enzyme solution was loaded on to a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 6 cm) that was equilibrated with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m KCl. After washing the column with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with 0.25m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 40 volumes of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5).Step 5: DEAE-TOYOPEARL Column ChromatographyThe dialyzate was loaded on to a DEAE-TOYOPEARL column (1 × 3 cm) that was equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). After washing the column with 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m KCl, the enzyme was eluted with 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 mKCl.Step 6: Mono-Q Column ChromatographyThe enzyme was loaded on to a Mono-Q 5/5 column that was equilibrated with 0.02 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m KCl. The FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The enzyme was eluted by 30 ml of a linear gradient of KCl from 0.2 to 0.35 m in 0.02m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The recombinant enzyme was separated into two peaks of activity upon Mono-Q column chromatography, like the rat liver enzyme (22Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Kawata T. Wada M. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1997; 43: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The first peak of enzyme activity was predominant.DISCUSSIONCharacterization of mammalian methionine synthase has been hampered by its low content in tissues. We obtained only 35 μg of homogeneous methionine synthase from 600 g of rat livers (22Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Kawata T. Wada M. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1997; 43: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The gene engineering techniques permitted us to get a recombinant protein in much higher quantity. We isolated the coding region of rat methionine synthase cDNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (10Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2155-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Production of recombinant methionine synthase in procaryotic cells was first attempted, because the primary structure of the rat enzyme is very similar to that of the E. coli enzyme (11Banerjee R.V. Johnston N.L. Sobeski J.K. Datta P. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13888-13895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of the functional enzyme was not successful, the inactive methionine synthase polypeptide was produced in E. coli cells using a T7 expression system. The antiserum against the rat enzyme was raised using this polypeptide as antigen and used for detecting methionine synthase protein by Western blot analysis.We then attempted heterologous expression of the recombinant enzyme in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. As expected, the recombinant rat enzyme was obtained in a catalytically active form. The amount of recombinant rat methionine synthase purified from 500 ml of culture was almost comparable with that of the enzyme purified from approximately 2 kg of rat livers, indicating how efficiently the insect cells produce active mammalian enzyme. Specific activity as well as apparent K m values for substrates obtained with the recombinant enzyme were almost the same as those obtained with the rat liver enzyme (22Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Kawata T. Wada M. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1997; 43: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Although the recombinant baculovirus was constructed using a single coding region of rat methionine synthase cDNA, two peaks of the enzyme activity were obtained upon Mono-Q column chromatography. These peaks of activity appeared in the same positions as those of the rat liver enzyme (22Yamada K. Tobimatsu T. Kawata T. Wada M. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1997; 43: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) upon elution from the Mono-Q column. Therefore, it is likely that the two peaks of enzyme activity observed upon purification of the enzyme from rat livers are derived from the single gene product. But we do not know at present how they were different.The recombinant enzyme expressed in the insect cells grown without added Cbl was largely in the form of apoenzyme. This was very useful for studying the corrinoid specificity in catalysis and in holoenzyme formation. In general, resolution of holomethionine synthase into the apoenzyme accompanies a significant loss of activity (12Taylor R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The apoenzyme was extremely unstable and therefore used without purification.X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Cbl-binding domain of theE. coli methionine synthase revealed that Cbl is bound to the enzyme with the nucleotide ligand displaced from the cobalt atom and accommodated in the binding pocket as an extended tail and with the imidazole group of a certain histidine residue of the protein ligated to the cobalt atom (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Cobinamide was reported to be an inactive coenzyme for the E. coli enzyme and ineffective in holoenzyme formation (12Taylor R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting the necessity of the nucleotide moiety for reconstituting holoenzyme. Our results reported here also showed that MeCbi was essentially inactive as coenzyme for the recombinant rat enzyme and did not form a stable complex with apoenzyme. In contrast, Kolhouse et al. (13Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23010-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that aquacobinamide is capable of activating human apoenzyme fully at a lower concentration than that of aqCbl, when they are reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol. It would be reasonable to assume that the properties and the mechanism of action of the mammalian enzymes would be very similar to those of the bacterial enzyme, because both enzymes exhibited high similarity in the deduced amino acid sequences (7Chen L.H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13888-13895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ishida et al. (25Ishida A. Kanefusa H. Fujita H. Toraya T. Arch. Microbiol. 1994; 161: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar) reported that MeCbl analogs in which thed-ribose of the nucleotide moiety is replaced by a di- to pentamethylene group and a trimethylene analog containing imidazole instead of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole are partially or fully active coenzymes for the E. coli enzyme. We demonstrated here with the recombinant rat enzyme that the phosphate moiety of Cbl is necessary for the binding by the apoenzyme and thus for catalytic activity. However, the enzyme·MeCbiP-Me complex may be dissociable, because the enzyme activity decreased upon dilution (data not shown). Such a decrease upon dilution was not observed with the enzyme·Cbl complex. It is therefore evident that the nucleotide moiety of Cbl is needed for the tight binding by the enzyme.The ability of Cbls to form holoenzyme was dependent upon its upper ligand. Alkylcobalamins with a small alkyl group formed tight but inactive complexes with the apoenzyme, which were converted to holoenzyme by photoirradiation. Such a photolytic activation indicates that the inhibitory alkyl group on the cobalt atom can be removed by photolysis but not in the dark by transalkylation to homocysteine. This is consistent with the data obtained with the E. colienzyme, except that the E. coli apoenzyme forms holoenzyme with EtCbl without photolysis (26Weissbach H. Taylor R. Fed. Proc. 1966; 25: 1649-1656PubMed Google Scholar). CN-Cbl and aqCbl were not effective or effective only slightly in reconstituting holoenzyme. Because these Cbls reconstituted active holoenzyme with apoenzyme very efficiently under the conditions of the anaerobic assay with Ti(III) (data not shown), it is evident that the reduced form(s) of Cbls are also effective in the holoenzyme formation. The lengths of the Co-N bond in CN-Cbl and aqCbl are 2.01 and 1.93 Å, respectively (27Kräutler B. Konrat R. Stupperich E. Färber G. Gruber K. Kratky C. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 4128-4139Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Kratky C. Färber G. Gruber K. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Nolting H-F. Konrat R. Kräutler B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4654-4670Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which are shorter than those of alkylcobalamins (approximately 2.2 Å) (29Rossi M. Glusker J.P. Randaccio L. Summers M.F. Toscano P.J. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 1729-1738Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). pK values for the base-on ⇄ base-off equilibrium for CN-Cbl and aqCbl are 0.1 and −2.4, respectively (30Hayward G.C. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Vanston N.J. Williams R.J.P. J. Chem. Soc. 1965; : 6485-6493Crossref Google Scholar), which are much lower than those for simple alkylcobalamins (2.7–3.9) (31Hogenkamp H.P.C. Rush J.E. Swenson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3641-3644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Co-N bond length and the pK value for cob(II)alamin are 2.16 Å (32Kräutler B. Keller W. Kratky C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8936-8938Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and ∼2.5 Å (33Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A. 1965; 288: 352-358Crossref Google Scholar), respectively. Cob(I)alamin is known to exist in the base-off form (34Beaven G.H. Johnson E.A. Nature. 1955; 176: 1264-1265Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the coordination of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole to the cobalt atom in alkylcobalamins, cob(II)alamin, and cob(I)alamin is much weaker than that in CN-Cbl and aqCbl. Because the replacement of the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ligand with the imidazole group of the enzyme must take place upon binding of Cbl to apoenzyme (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable that the weaker coordination of the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ligand to the cobalt atom favors the formation of complexes with alkylcobalamins. AdoCbl did not form a complex with apomethionine synthase. This is consistent with the result obtained with the E. coli enzyme (26Weissbach H. Taylor R. Fed. Proc. 1966; 25: 1649-1656PubMed Google Scholar) and may be due to the bulkiness of its upper ligand, because the x-ray analysis of the Cbl-binding domain of the E. coli enzyme showed the presence of a cap-like structure above the upper axial ligand (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Methionine synthase (5-methyltetrahydrofolate: homocysteine methyltransferase) is a Cbl1(B12)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the methyl transfer reaction from MeH4F to homocysteine forming H4F and methionine. MeCbl is involved as an intermediate in the two-step methyl transfer reactions, that is, cob(I)alamin is first methylated by MeH4F forming MeCbl and H4F, and MeCbl is successively demethylated by homocysteine forming methionine and regenerating cob(I)alamin. Because intermediate cob(I)alamin is a supernucleophile and easily oxidizable, the enzyme undergoes oxidative inactivation under aerobic conditions (1Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For reactivation of the inactivated enzyme, AdoMet and a one-electron reducing system are required. The physiological partners transferring a reducing equivalent from NADPH to the enzyme are two flavoproteins in Escherichia coli (2Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that at least two auxiliary redox proteins are needed for physiological reactivation of mammalian enzyme with NADPH (3Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human cDNA for methionine synthase reductase has been cloned (4Leclerc D.

A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of Cbl- and AdoMet-binding domains of theE. coli methionine synthase were recently analyzed using respective fragments obtained by partial digestion with trypsin (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 6Dixon M.M. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M. Structure. 1996; 4: 1263-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was revealed that Cbl undergoes a marked conformational change upon binding to the enzyme (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). That is, upon binding to apoenzyme, the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ligand coordinating to the cobalt atom in the free cofactor is displaced from the cobalt atom, and instead, the imidazole group of a certain histidine residue of the protein is ligated to it. Unique motifs for cobalamin binding in the so-called “base-off” mode as well as that for AdoMet binding were also reported (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2047475785,"The structural organization of the (αβγδ)4 phosphorylase kinase complex has been studied using the yeast two-hybrid screen for the purpose of elucidating regions of α subunit interactions. By screening a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library with residues 1–1059 of the α subunit of phosphorylase kinase, we have isolated 16 interacting, independent, yet overlapping transcripts of the α subunit containing its C-terminal region. Domain mapping of binary interactions between α constructs revealed two regions involved in the self-association of the α subunit: residues 833–854, a previously unrecognized leucine zipper, and an unspecified region within residues 1015–1237. The cognate binding partner for the latter domain has been inferred to lie within the stretch from residues 864–1059. Indirect evidence from the literature suggests that the interacting domains contained within the latter two, overlapping regions may be further narrowed to the stretches from 1057 to 1237 and from 864 to 971. Cross-linking of the nonactivated holoenzyme withN-(γ-maleimidobutyroxy)sulfosuccin-imide ester produced intramolecularly cross-linked α-α dimers, consistent with portions of two α subunits in the holoenyzme being in sufficient proximity to associate.

Acta. 1991; 1094: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The catalytic γ subunit of this complex oligomer is allosterically controlled through alterations in quaternary structure initiated by the regulatory α, β, and δ subunits, the latter being an intrinsic molecule of calmodulin (3Cohen P.

Studies have shown that activation of PhK by multiple effectors occurs concomitantly with common conformational changes in the α and β subunits (4Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the α and β subunits of PhK impose steric constraint upon γ that, when removed, leads to activation of the kinase (7Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol.

We have chosen to study the largest of the regulatory subunits, α, because relatively few studies have been devoted to understanding its role in the structure and function of PhK. Previous studies using electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy have suggested that the α subunit is peripherally located in the holoenzyme (11Hinrichsen A. Bockl J.J. Schramm H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson D.A. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Norcum M.T. Hainfeld J.F. Seyer J.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is consistent with its high susceptibility to proteolysis by a wide variety of proteases (5Trempe M.R. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4333-4340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the probable exposed location of α within the PhK hexadecamer, we hypothesized that this subunit may interact with other muscle proteins and investigated potential PhK α interactions by screening a skeletal muscle cDNA library for potential binding partners of α using the yeast two-hybrid system. The two-hybrid system is based on the modularity of eukaryotic transcription factors possessing functionally separate DNA binding and activation domains that need not be covalently linked to activate transcription (reviewed in Ref. 13Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This attribute has been exploited to directly evaluate potential interactions between proteins fused to either DNA binding domain (BD) or activation domain (AD) modules. For positive associations, coexpression of the chimeric proteins in yeast results in positioning of the transcriptional domains in sufficient proximity to direct the activation of a phenotypically detectable downstream reporter gene. In this study, by screening residues 1–1059 of the α subunit of PhK against a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library for possible binding partners, we identified many independent, overlapping C-terminal transcripts of the α subunit of PhK, the majority of which possess a previously unidentified leucine zipper dimerization motif. Additional mapping of the domains giving rise to self-association of α identified a second region, along with its implicit cognate binding partner. Although intramolecular, cross-linked α-α dimers have previously been reported to be formed during cross-linking of PhK under conditions in which it is activated (14Lambooy P.K. Steiner R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop-LEU2) (CLONTECH) was used for all two-hybrid analyses (16Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell.

All plasmid manipulations were performed according to standard protocol in the Escherichia colistrain DH5α unless otherwise specified (17Ausembel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Constructs α305C, α470C, and α650C were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers (Operon Technologies, Inc.) to yield cDNAs flanked both 5′ and 3′ withEcoRI restriction sites: sense strand oligonucleotide (5′-AGAATTCATGAGGAGCCGGAGTAA-3′) and antisense strand oligonucleotides α305C (5′-GAATTCTTATTTAGGGGTTTTATACCC-3′), α470C (5′-GAATTCTTAGGGGTATACCTCAGCA-3′), and α650C (5′-GAATTCTTATGAATTGTAACCATCCATC-3′). All fragments were ligated to theEcoRI site of either pLexA (CLONTECH), a 2 μ HIS3 plasmid, to generate a fusion protein consisting of the DNA BD (amino acids 1–202) of LexA fused to PhK α or pB42AD (CLONTECH), a 2 μ TRP1 plasmid, to produce a B42 AD protein fused to PhK α. A longer α construct, α863C, was prepared by removing a C-terminalXhoI–XhoI fragment from a full-length α cDNA cloned into pUC18 and subsequently subcloning the fragment into both two-hybrid vectors using EcoRI–XhoI restriction sites. To generate the α1059C and full-length α (αFL) constructs, a cDNA corresponding to either amino acids 863–1059 or amino acids 863–1237 of α was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers and cloned into both the pLexAα 863C and pB42ADα 863C constructs at the XhoI site: sense strand oligonucleotide (5′-GAGCCTCGAGAAAAGACCATC-3′) and antisense strand oligonucleotides α1059C (5′-GATCTCGAGTTATGTGTGATGACCAGG-3′) and αFL (5′-GATCTCGAGTCATTGCATGGCACAGA-3′). Correct LexA and B42 α fusion proteins were verified by dideoxy sequencing and/or restriction mapping. Yeast library transformants were generated by a modified lithium acetate procedure (21Geitz D.

Yeast strain EGY48, already containing the pSH18–34 lacZ reporter plasmid and the pLexAα1059C bait plasmid, was transformed with the rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library and grown on synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose but lacking histidine, tryptophan, and uracil (SD −His−Trp−Ura). The transformation efficiency of the library was 104 colony-forming units/μg of DNA with a total of 6.4 × 106 library clones being amplified. All transformants were pooled and stored at −80 °C. To induce the expression of the library proteins under the control of the Gal1 promoter, an aliquot of the amplified library was diluted and grown for 3 h in synthetic complete medium containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose but lacking histidine, tryptophan, and uracil (SD Gal/Raf −His−Trp−Ura). A final concentration of 6 × 107transformants (10 cells/amplified clone) was plated onto SD Gal/Raf −His−Trp−Ura−Leu medium in the presence of 80 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) in order to simultaneously screen for galactose-dependentlacZ expression and leucine prototrophy of colonies expressing cDNA-encoded proteins that interact with the α1059 bait protein. After colonies were grown at 30 °C for 3 days, putative primary lacZ +/Leu+ colonies were replica-plated onto master SD −His−Trp−Ura plates and stored at 4 °C for secondary analysis. Primary positive colonies were restreaked onto SD −His−Trp−Ura plates to allow segregation of multiple AD library plasmids. Additionally, duplicate library clones were sorted by AluI restriction analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified inserts. Positive AD library plasmid DNA was isolated from a single colony, rescued in KC8 cells, and reintroduced into the original selection strain and into a second strain expressing the nonspecific Drosophila Bicoid-LexA fusion protein to test for the specificity of the interaction. Specific interactor cDNAs, those that interacted with the α1059 LexA fusion but not the Bicoid-LexA protein, were identified via dideoxy sequencing. To screen for binary α-α interactions, a series of C-terminal deletions of the α subunit were assayed for interactions as LexA and B42 fusion proteins in all possible combinations. Yeast strain EGY48, possessing the pSH18–34 lacZ reporter plasmid, was transformed as described previously, and transformants were grown at 30 °C on SD −His−Trp−Ura medium for 3 days. Positive associations between α constructs were monitored by transcriptional activation of theLEU2 gene by growth on defined media lacking leucine (−Leu) and activation of the lacZ reporter gene, resulting in expression of β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity of all positive α-α interactors, as determined by the previously described in vivo plate assays, was subsequently quantified by liquido-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside spectroscopic assays (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were grown on SD −His−Trp−Ura plates for 3–5 days at 30 °C. Several colonies from each plate were scraped into 5 ml of liquid SD −His−Trp−Ura medium and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. From the liquid culture, 1 ml was removed and diluted into 5 ml of induction medium (SD Gal/Raf −His−Trp−Ura−Leu) and grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 of 0.5–0.7). Optical density measurements at 600 nm were taken in order to normalize β-galactosidase activity to yeast cell density. A 1-ml aliquot of each yeast culture was briefly centrifuged to pellet the cells and resuspended in 1 ml of Z-buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 38 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). After the addition of 50 μl of chloroform and 50 μl of 0.1% SDS, the cell suspension was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. Samples were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C, and β-galactosidase assays were initiated by the addition of 200 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 400 μl of 1m Na2CO3. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and theA 420 was measured for each supernatant. PhK was isolated from fast twitch skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (23King M.M. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11058-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mAbs against the α, β, and γ subunits of PhK were produced in mice using holoenzyme as antigen and have been previously characterized (12Wilkinson D.A. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Norcum M.T. Hainfeld J.F. Seyer J.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Wilkinson D.A. Norcum M.T. Fitzgerald T.J. Marion T.M. Tillman D.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the anti-CaM mAb was from Signal Transduction Laboratories. All other detection conjugates were purchased from Southern Biotechnology. Prior to cross-linking, PhK was preincubated for 2 min at 30 °C, and the cross-linking reactions were initiated with sulfo-GMBS (Pierce) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The final concentrations in the standard cross-linking reaction were as follows: 3.07–3.21 μm αβγδ protomer of PhK, 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.8), 1.0 mm EDTA, and 10 μm cross-linker. Reactions were quenched by dilution with an equal volume of SDS buffer (0.125 m Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS). After heating for 5 min at 90 °C, all samples (30 μg/lane) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (6%) (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained in 40% methanol plus 10% acetic acid (2 h) and 7% acetic acid plus 4% methanol (15 h). In order to identify the cross-linked species, apparent molecular masses of the cross-linked conjugates were determined by comparison with the migration of protein standards (the β (125-kDa) and α (138-kDa) subunits of PhK, myosin (200 kDa), and cross-linked αβ dimer from PhK (264 kDa)). The subunit composition of each cross-linked species was verified by Western blotting with subunit-specific mAbs following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4% bisacrylamide gels (cross-linking ratio 80:1). Samples were transferred by a semidry technique to nitrocellulose and blotted as described previously (12Wilkinson D.A. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Norcum M.T. Hainfeld J.F. Seyer J.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Wilkinson D.A. Norcum M.T. Fitzgerald T.J. Marion T.M. Tillman D.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In order to further define the epitope of the anti-α mAb (mAb157), several recombinant histidine-tagged peptides were cloned and expressed (Table IV). To construct the clone for peptide P1, cDNA encoding α subunit amino acids 1097–1237 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the following synthetic primers using αD1 as a template: 5′-ACTGCAGCATGCACTTTCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-AAAGCTTCATTGCATGGCACAG-3′. The product was cloned into thePstI and HindIII sites of plasmid expression vector pQE-31 (Qiagen). The clone for peptide P2, residues 1097–1185, was prepared by linearizing the clone for P1 with restriction enzymesHindIII and EcoRV, filling in theHindIII overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and religating the cDNA. Clones for P5 (residues 1193–1237), P3 (residues 1132–1237), and P4 (residues 1132–1194) were generated by digesting the construct for P1 with appropriate restriction enzymes (P5, BamHI and HindIII; P3, KpnI andHindIII; and P4, KpnI and BamHI, respectively) and ligating their purified restriction fragments into pQE-31. A fusion protein of the amino-terminal domain of DHFR and α amino acids 1132–1237 was generated by ligating the 318-base pairKpnI/HindIII fragment into expression plasmid pQE-41 (Qiagen). To generate the clone encoding a fusion protein of amino-terminal DHFR and α residues 1188–1202 (P6), complementary synthetic oligomers 5′-GATCTATCATGTTGTTGGCAAAGGATCCTGCATCTGGCATCTGTACTCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCAGAAGAGTACAGATGCCAG ATGCAGGATCCTTTGCCAACATGATA-3′ were hybridized and ligated into the pQE-40 expression plasmid (Qiagen). The DNA sequence and correct reading frame were verified for all clones by dideoxy chain termination sequencing.Table IVThe epitope of anti-α mAb 157Test peptideCorresponding amino acids in αRelative binding to mAb 157P11097–12370.55P21097–11850.00P31132–12370.05P41132–11940.00P51193–12370.00P61188–12020.00 Open table in a new tab Bacterial expression of the clones was induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the expressed, histidine-tagged fusion proteins were purified over Talon affinity resin (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. An ELISA was used to evaluate the binding of mAb 157 to each expressed His-tagged α peptide, PhK holoenzyme, and DHFR. Briefly, each test antigen was diluted with plating buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) to 5 μg/ml, and 0.1 ml was added to the wells of Immulon I microtiter plates (Dynatech). Unbound protein was removed by washing the plates with ELISA buffer (plating buffer plus 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) followed by blocking of nonspecific binding sites with plating buffer plus 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v). Each well was then incubated with monoclonal anti-α antibody (mAb 157), diluted 50-fold in ELISA buffer, or with ELISA buffer alone. Wells were washed three times with ELISA buffer and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 500-fold in ELISA buffer). After three additional washes, the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (1 mg/ml in 0.9 m diethanolamine, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 9.8) was detected by absorbance at 405 nm. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to investigate potential protein interactions of the α subunit of PhK. Given that the α subunit is farnesylated at Cys-1234 (26Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Serwe M. Weber C. Metzger J. Hoffman-Posorske E. Meyer H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6558-9554Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), potentially directing it to membranes, we chose to use only amino acids 1–1059 of α fused to the LexA DNA BD protein (α1059C-BD) as a molecular bait for screening a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library, in order to improve the chances for nuclear import of the bait. The site of C-terminal truncation at residue 1059 was chosen so as not to disrupt predicted secondary structure domains. Complete characterization of our bait protein prior to library screening demonstrated that it was correctly expressed, as determined by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody directed to the LexA protein; that it possessed no intrinsic transcriptional activation of theLEU2 and lacZ reporter genes independently or in the presence of an empty activation domain vector; and that it was properly transported to the nucleus, as measured by a β-galactosidase repression assay (27Golemis E.A. Brent R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 43-72Google Scholar). Of the approximately 6 × 107 library transformants screened, more than 300 primary positive colonies were obtained that showed galactose-dependent leucine prototrophy andlacZ expression. Of these initial positives, 80 were selected for further secondary and tertiary analyses, ultimately resulting in 23 library cDNAs being identified by dideoxy sequencing. Sequencing results identified 16 of the 23 clones as independent, overlapping transcripts of the α subunit of PhK containing its carboxyl terminus but varying in amino-terminal start sites (Table I). Moreover, 12 of the sequences contained a region of α having a previously unrecognized leucine zipper motif from residues 833–854 (Fig. 1). Leucine zippers form parallel coiled-coil α-helices via the interactions of hydrophobic side chains, and while initially identified as dimerization domains in transcription factors, they have subsequently been shown to exist in other classes of proteins (28Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland, New York1999: 175-203Google Scholar).Table IPositive library α clones detected by α1059C-BDCloneRegion in αα591N591–1237α598N598–1237α627N627–1237aResidues 654–712 are deleted in the construct, as in the isozyme, α′ (48).α628N628–1237α629N629–810+bWe were unable to sequence through the C terminus of the construct; however, the size of the transcripts, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, indicates the library insert extends through the termination codon and contains part of the 3′-untranslated region.α717N717–1237α730N730–1237α732N732–900+bWe were unable to sequence through the C terminus of the construct; however, the size of the transcripts, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, indicates the library insert extends through the termination codon and contains part of the 3′-untranslated region.α735N735–897+bWe were unable to sequence through the C terminus of the construct; however, the size of the transcripts, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, indicates the library insert extends through the termination codon and contains part of the 3′-untranslated region.α741N741–1237α743N743–1237α840N840–1237α969N969–1237α976N976–1237α1013N1013–1237α1015N1015–1237a Residues 654–712 are deleted in the construct, as in the isozyme, α′ (48Harmann B.

Open table in a new tab Because four α clones (α969N, α976N, α1013N, and α1015N) that were identified in our screen contained only the extreme C terminus of α and did not possess any portion of the leucine zipper, we investigated the role of the region distal to the leucine zipper by assaying three representative library AD fusion proteins (α591N, α730N, and α1015N) against a series of α C-terminal deletion mutants fused to the DNA binding domain (Fig. 2). To further evaluate the role of the leucine zipper in α-α associations, we also made an AD fusion protein from clone α730N (α730–863) lacking the C terminus of α but maintaining the leucine zipper. None of the three AD library clones screened interacted with the BD construct containing the first 305 residues of PhK α (Table II), suggesting that the amino and carboxyl termini between two α subunits do not interact with each other. However, the addition of amino acids 306–863 of α to the BD construct (i.e. α863C) produced strong interactions with library clones α591N and α730N (6.2 and 22.0 Miller units, respectively) but not with clones α 1015N, lacking the leucine zipper, or α 730–863, lacking the C terminus. Upon the addition of residues 864–1059 of α , interactions were observed between this construct, α1059C, and all four library clones, although the β-galactosidase activity between α1059C and α730–863 was 76–89% less than the activity measured with the other three constructs. Interactions between α1059C and clones α591N, α730N, and α1015N had the highest β-galactosidase activity of any constructs and may contain the regions of highest affinity between α subunits, given that the measured strength of protein associations discriminated in vivo by two-hybrid analyses has been reported to correlate with the corresponding binding affinities determined in vitro (16Estojak J.

Open table in a new tab The sum of the results from Tables I and II is consistent with the involvement of at least three domains, two identified and one implicit, in the self-association of PhK's α subunit. The first of these is the newly identified leucine zipper between residues 833 and 854, which would be expected to interact with the same region of another α subunit. The second association domain directly identified is contained within the stretch from 1015 to 1237, present in all library clones detected by α1059C (Table I). The final and implicit association domain, that recognized by the domain within residues 1015–1237, has been only indirectly identified. That α1015N interacts with α1059C, but not with α863C (Table II), suggests that the cognate partner for the second domain lies somewhere within residues 864–1059, a unique region not found in the otherwise 80% homologous β subunit of PhK (29Kilimann M.W.

https://openalex.org/W2085245739,"The binding of nucleotides to three different nucleotide-binding proteins and to a control protein was studied by means of nano-electrospray mass spectrometry applied to aqueous nondenaturing solutions. The method leads to unambiguous identification of enzyme complexes with substrates and products but does not allow the determination of dissociation constants or even stoichiometries relevant to the binding in solution. For guanylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.8), the transfer of HPO3 between nucleotides was observed whenever a ternary complex with adenylate or guanylate nucleotides was formed. Guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate was generated after prolonged incubation with GDP or GTP. Mg2+ binding was considerably enhanced in functional high affinity complexes, such as observed between guanylate kinase and its bisubstrate inhibitorP 1-(5′-guanosyl)-P 5-(5′-adenosyl) pentaphosphate or with the tight nucleotide-binding protein p21 ras and GDP. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) itself was phosphorylated in accordance to its known ping-pong mechanism. All nucleotide-binding proteins were shown to bind sulfate (SO42−) with presumably high affinity and slow exchange rate. The binding of phosphate (PO43−) could be inferred indirectly from competition with SO42−."
