Here we report markedly increased nicotine intake in mice with a null mutation in Chrna5. This effect was ‘rescued’ in knockout mice by re-expressing α5 subunits in the medial habenula (MHb), and recapitulated in rats through α5 subunit knockdown in MHb. Remarkably, α5 subunit knockdown in MHb did not alter the rewarding effects of nicotine but abolished the inhibitory effects of higher nicotine doses on brain reward systems. The MHb extends projections almost exclusively to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). We found diminished IPN activation in response to nicotine in α5 knockout mice. Further, disruption of IPN signalling increased nicotine intake in rats. Our findings indicate that nicotine activates the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway through α5-containing nAChRs, triggering an inhibitory motivational signal that acts to limit nicotine intake. Genetic association studies implicate variation in CHRNA5, the gene for the α5 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit, in susceptibility to tobacco dependence, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mechanisms linking this gene to behaviour are unknown. Using knockout mice, lentiviral rescue and RNAi knockdown in rats, Fowler et al. show that manipulating the levels of this subunit alters the drive to obtain nicotine, particularly at high doses. Altering activity levels in the habenulo-interpeduncular tract of the brain, where this subunit is highly expressed, changes the amount of nicotine the animals consume. This work identifies α5-containing nAChRs as potential targets for smoking-cessation therapies. In humans, vulnerability to tobacco addiction has been linked to variations in the gene encoding the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, but the functional mechanisms linking gene to behaviour are unknown. Using a combination of knockout mice, lentiviral rescue, and RNAi knockdown in rats, this study shows that manipulating the levels of this subunit alters the drive to obtain nicotine, particularly at high doses that are aversive to wild-type animals. Furthermore, these subunits are implicated in the projection between medial habenula and interpeduncular nucleus in integrating negative side effects of high doses of nicotine and reward signals. It is proposed that this projection provides a negative motivational signal that limits nicotine consumption."

Now, Ryuichiro Atarashi and colleagues have discovered an assay that can identify prions in human cerebrospinal fluid. This assay could allow for diagnosis of disease in living humans. The development of technologies for the in vitro amplification of abnormal conformations of prion protein (PrPSc) has generated the potential for sensitive detection of prions. Here we developed a new PrPSc amplification assay, called real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QUIC), which allows the detection of ≥1 fg of PrPSc in diluted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) brain homogenate. Moreover, we assessed the technique first in a series of Japanese subjects and then in a blind study of 30 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from Australia, which achieved greater than 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These findings indicate the promising enhanced diagnostic capacity of RT-QUIC in the antemortem evaluation of suspected CJD."
https://openalex.org/W2015512041,"There is a strong rationale to therapeutically target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway in breast cancer since it is highly deregulated in this disease and it also mediates resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. However, initial studies with rapalogs, allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, have resulted in limited clinical efficacy probably due to the release of a negative regulatory feedback loop that triggers AKT and ERK signaling. Since activation of AKT occurs via PI3K, we decided to explore whether PI3K inhibitors prevent the activation of these compensatory pathways. Using HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells as a model, we observed that PI3K inhibitors abolished AKT activation. However, PI3K inhibition resulted in a compensatory activation of the ERK signaling pathway. This enhanced ERK signaling occurred as a result of activation of HER family receptors as evidenced by induction of HER receptors dimerization and phosphorylation, increased expression of HER3 and binding of adaptor molecules to HER2 and HER3. The activation of ERK was prevented with either MEK inhibitors or anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Combined administration of PI3K inhibitors with either HER2 or MEK inhibitors resulted in decreased proliferation, enhanced cell death and superior anti-tumor activity compared with single agent PI3K inhibitors. Our findings indicate that PI3K inhibition in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer activates a new compensatory pathway that results in ERK dependency. Combined anti-MEK or anti-HER2 therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be required in order to achieve optimal efficacy in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. This approach warrants clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W1973468287,"Here the authors describe a set of new optogenetic tools for use in primates that are meant to address the unique constraints of working with this species. They characterize opsin expression, the reliability of optogenetic stimulation and its effect on behavior, and methods for determining localization and expression levels prior to the completion of experiments. Optogenetics is a technique for controlling subpopulations of neurons in the intact brain using light. This technique has the potential to enhance basic systems neuroscience research and to inform the mechanisms and treatment of brain injury and disease. Before launching large-scale primate studies, the method needs to be further characterized and adapted for use in the primate brain. We assessed the safety and efficiency of two viral vector systems (lentivirus and adeno-associated virus), two human promoters (human synapsin (hSyn) and human thymocyte-1 (hThy-1)) and three excitatory and inhibitory mammalian codon-optimized opsins (channelrhodopsin-2, enhanced Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin and the step-function opsin), which we characterized electrophysiologically, histologically and behaviorally in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We also introduced a new device for measuring in vivo fluorescence over time, allowing minimally invasive assessment of construct expression in the intact brain. We present a set of optogenetic tools designed for optogenetic experiments in the non-human primate brain."
https://openalex.org/W2011162627,"Triptolide (1) is a structurally unique diterpene triepoxide isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, contraceptive and antitumor activities. Its molecular mechanism of action, however, has remained largely elusive to date. We report that triptolide covalently binds to human XPB (also known as ERCC3), a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, and inhibits its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which leads to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and likely nucleotide excision repair. The identification of XPB as the target of triptolide accounts for the majority of the known biological activities of triptolide. These findings also suggest that triptolide can serve as a new molecular probe for studying transcription and, potentially, as a new type of anticancer agent through inhibition of the ATPase activity of XPB."

https://openalex.org/W2156333779,"The corollaries of the obesity epidemic that plagues developed societies are malnutrition and resulting biochemical imbalances. Low levels of essential n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been linked to neuropsychiatric diseases, but the underlying synaptic alterations are mostly unknown. We found that lifelong n-3 PUFAs dietary insufficiency specifically ablates long-term synaptic depression mediated by endocannabinoids in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex and accumbens. In n-3-deficient mice, presynaptic cannabinoid CB(1) receptors (CB(1)Rs) normally responding to endocannabinoids were uncoupled from their effector G(i/o) proteins. Finally, the dietary-induced reduction of CB(1)R functions in mood-controlling structures was associated with impaired emotional behavior. These findings identify a plausible synaptic substrate for the behavioral alterations caused by the n-3 PUFAs deficiency that is often observed in western diets."

To test this idea directly, we functionally removed parvalbumin-positive interneurons selectively from hippocampal CA1 in mice. We found that parvalbumin-positive interneurons are dispensable for spatial reference, but are essential for spatial working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2085098316,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several other catabolic conditions are characterized by increased circulating inflammatory cytokines, defects in IGF-1 signaling, abnormal muscle protein metabolism, and progressive muscle atrophy. In these conditions, no reliable treatments successfully block the development of muscle atrophy. In mice with CKD, we found a 2- to 3-fold increase in myostatin expression in muscle. Its pharmacological inhibition by subcutaneous injections of an anti-myostatin peptibody into CKD mice (IC50 ~1.2 nM) reversed the loss of body weight (≈5–7% increase in body mass) and muscle mass (~10% increase in muscle mass) and suppressed circulating inflammatory cytokines vs. results from CKD mice injected with PBS. Pharmacological myostatin inhibition also decreased the rate of protein degradation (16.38±1.29%;P<0.05), increased protein synthesis in extensor digitorum longus muscles (13.21±1.09%; P<0.05), markedly enhanced satellite cell function, and improved IGF-1 intracellular signaling. In cultured muscle cells, TNF-α increased myostatin expression via a NF-κB-dependent pathway, whereas muscle cells exposed to myostatin stimulated IL-6 production via p38 MAPK and MEK1 pathways. Because IL-6 stimulates muscle protein breakdown, we conclude that CKD increases myostatin through cytokine-activated pathways, leading to muscle atrophy. Myostatin antagonism might become a therapeutic strategy for improving muscle growth in CKD and other conditions with similar characteristics.—Zhang, L., Rajan, V., Lin, E., Hu, Z., Han, H.Q., Zhou, X., Song, Y., Min, H., Wang, X., Du, J., Mitch, W.

https://openalex.org/W2010265726,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a massive proinflammatory phenotype in the lung arising from profound expression of inflammatory genes, including interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have previously reported that IL-8 mRNA is stabilized in CF lung epithelial cells, resulting in concomitant hyperexpression of IL-8 protein. However, the mechanistic link between mutations in CFTR and acquisition of the proinflammatory phenotype in the CF airway has remained elusive. We hypothesized that specific microRNAs (miRNAs) might mediate this linkage. To identify the potential link, we screened an miRNA library for differential expression in ΔF508-CFTR and wild type CFTR lung epithelial cell lines. Of 22 differentially and significantly expressed miRNAs, we found that expression of miR-155 was more than 5-fold elevated in CF IB3-1 lung epithelial cells in culture, compared with control IB3-1/S9 cells. Clinically, miR-155 was also highly expressed in CF lung epithelial cells and circulating CF neutrophils biopsied from CF patients. We report here that high levels of miR-155 specifically reduced levels of SHIP1, thereby promoting PI3K/Akt activation. However, overexpressing SHIP1 or inhibition of PI3K in CF cells suppressed IL-8 expression. Finally, we found that phospho-Akt levels were elevated in CF lung epithelial cells and were specifically lowered by either antagomir-155 or elevated expression of SHIP1. We therefore suggest that elevated miR-155 contributes to the proinflammatory expression of IL-8 in CF lung epithelial cells by lowering SHIP1 expression and thereby activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These data suggest that miR-155 may play an important role in the activation of IL-8-dependent inflammation in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2063695715,"The eukaryotic 26S proteasome controls cellular processes by degrading specific regulatory proteins. Most proteins are targeted for degradation by a signal or degron that consists of two parts: a proteasome-binding tag, typically covalently attached polyubiquitin chains, and an unstructured region that serves as the initiation region for proteasomal proteolysis. Here we have characterized how the arrangement of the two degron parts in a protein affects degradation. We found that a substrate is degraded efficiently only when its initiation region is of a certain minimal length and is appropriately separated in space from the proteasome-binding tag. Regions that are located too close or too far from the proteasome-binding tag cannot access the proteasome and induce degradation. These spacing requirements are different for a polyubiquitin chain and a ubiquitin-like domain. Thus, the arrangement and location of the proteasome initiation region affect a protein's fate and are important in selecting proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2016704496,"Therapeutic proteins contain a large number of post-translational modifications, some of which could potentially impact their safety or efficacy. In one of these changes, pyroglutamate can form on the N terminus of the polypeptide chain. Both glutamine and glutamate at the N termini of recombinant monoclonal antibodies can cyclize spontaneously to pyroglutamate (pE) in vitro. Glutamate conversion to pyroglutamate occurs more slowly than from glutamine but has been observed under near physiological conditions. Here we investigated to what extent human IgG2 N-terminal glutamate converts to pE in vivo. Pyroglutamate levels increased over time after injection into humans, with the rate of formation differing between polypeptide chains. These changes were replicated for the same antibodies in vitro under physiological pH and temperature conditions, indicating that the changes observed in vivo were due to chemical conversion not differential clearance. Differences in the conversion rates between the light chain and heavy chain on an antibody were eliminated by denaturing the protein, revealing that structural elements affect pE formation rates. By enzymatically releasing pE from endogenous antibodies isolated from human serum, we could estimate the naturally occurring levels of this post-translational modification. Together, these techniques and results can be used to predict the exposure of pE for therapeutic antibodies and to guide criticality assessments for this attribute."
https://openalex.org/W2058328925,"Gliomas are associated with high mortality because of their exceedingly invasive character. As these tumors acquire their invasiveness from low-grade tumors, it is very important to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms of invasion onset. Recent evidences suggest the significant role of microRNAs in tumor invasion. Thus, we hypothesized that deregulation of microRNAs may be important for the malignant progression of gliomas. We found that the aberrant expression of miR-21 is responsible for glioma invasion by disrupting the negative feedback circuit of Ras/MAPK signaling, which is mediated by Spry2. Upregulation of miR-21 was triggered by tumor microenvironmental factors such as hyaluronan and growth factors in glioma cells lacking functional phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), but not harboring wild-type PTEN. Consistently with these in vitro results, Spry2 protein levels were significantly decreased in 79.7% of invasive WHO grade II–IV human glioma tissues, but not in non-invasive grade I and normal tissues. The Spry2 protein levels were not correlated with their mRNA levels, but inversely correlated with miR-21 levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of Spry2 by miR-21 has an essential role on the malignant progression of human gliomas. Thus, Spry2 may be a novel therapeutic target for treating gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2066946468,"Biodegradation of plant biomass is a slow process in nature, and hydrolysis of cellulose is also widely considered to be a rate-limiting step in the proposed industrial process of converting lignocellulosic materials to biofuels. It is generally known that a team of enzymes including endo- and exocellulases as well as cellobiases are required to act synergistically to hydrolyze cellulose to glucose. The detailed molecular mechanisms of these enzymes have yet to be convincingly elucidated. In this report, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to image in real-time the structural changes in Valonia cellulose crystals acted upon by the exocellulase cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) from Trichoderma reesei. Under AFM, single enzyme molecules could be observed binding only to one face of the cellulose crystal, apparently the hydrophobic face. The surface roughness of cellulose began increasing after adding CBH I, and the overall size of cellulose crystals decreased during an 11-h period. Interestingly, this size reduction apparently occurred only in the width of the crystal, whereas the height remained relatively constant. In addition, the measured cross-section shape of cellulose crystal changed from asymmetric to nearly symmetric. These observed changes brought about by CBH I action may constitute the first direct visualization supporting the idea that the exocellulase selectively hydrolyzes the hydrophobic faces of cellulose. The limited accessibility of the hydrophobic faces in native cellulose may contribute significantly to the rate-limiting slowness of cellulose hydrolysis.

The limited accessibility of the hydrophobic faces in native cellulose may contribute significantly to the rate-limiting slowness of cellulose hydrolysis. Natural cellulose is a bundle of linear β-1,4-linked glucan chains held tightly in a crystalline structure by the cumulative effect of many inter- and intrachain hydrogen bonds. Cellulose produced by higher plants is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, accounting for 40–60% by dry weight of plant cell walls. In addition to the traditional uses of cellulose in the paper, food, and textile industries, the new concept of biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass is considered a promising route to sustainable energy production. Unfortunately, lignocellulosic material is intrinsically recalcitrant to chemical and enzymatic breakdown to simple sugars that can be fermented to liquid fuels. A deeper understanding of biomass recalcitrance will be required for the potential of lignocellulosic biofuels to be realized (1Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Johnson D.K. Adney W.S. Nimlos M.R. Brady J.W. Foust T.D. Science. 2007; 315: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). In native plant cell walls, cellulose exists as nanometer scale microfibril networks embedded in matrices of other biopolymers such as hemicelluloses, pectins, and lignins. Chemical pretreatment processes are often required to remove or relocate these “other” matrix polymers, thereby exposing the cellulose to a follow-up enzymatic hydrolysis to produce glucose. The cellulases are a class of enzymes, produced mainly by cellulolytic fungi and bacteria, that catalyze hydrolysis of the β-1,4-glucosidic bonds that link the glucosyl units of cellulose. Cellulases have been classified on the basis of their modes of action on the substrate into three distinct classes that react synergistically: (i) the endo-β-(1,4)-glucanases that cleave the cellulose chain at internal positions to produce new chain ends (2Reese E.T. Siu R.G. Levinson H.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 59: 485-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the exo-β-(1,4)-d-glucanases that cleave successive cellobiosyl units from the ends of cellulose, and (iii) the β-d-glucosidases that hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose. Among these types of cellulases, the exoglucanases appear to catalyze most of the bond-cleavages in the saccharification of crystalline cellulose and are usually the major component of cellulase preparations, especially in the case of current fungus-derived commercial enzymes. Cellulose substrates isolated from different sources, though all composed of linear β-1,4-linked glucose polymers, differ significantly in structure as measured in terms of amorphous content, crystallinity, and size and shape of crystallites (3Montanari S. Rountani M. Heux L. Vignon M.R. Macromolecules. 2005; 38: 1665-1671Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar); these structural differences may substantially affect susceptibility to cellulase action. In addition, depending on variations of the patterns of inter- and intrachain hydrogen bonds, cellulose may form different crystalline allomorphs (e.g. cellulose Iα, Iβ, II, III, and IV), upon which the binding and activities of cellulases may be different. Endoglucanases acting alone may attack the non-crystalline regions effectively, but effective attack on the crystalline portion of cellulose requires in addition the synergistic action of the exoglucanases. The fact that cellulose structure affects cellulase activities has long been documented (4Fan L.T. Lee Y.H. Beardmore D.H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1980; 22: 177-199Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar), but experimental data presented in the literature have been subject to considerable uncertainty in interpretation of the relationships between cellulose structure and cellulase activities due to disagreements in identification and quantification of cellulose structure by different analytical methods (5Park S. Baker J.O. Himmel M.E. Parilla P.A. Johnson D.K. Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2010; 3: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar).

The cellulase system produced by the filamentous fungus T. reesei is widely used as a commercial enzyme mixture in industry. This system contains two exoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases CBH I and CBH II, which belong to glycoside hydrolase families 7 and 6 respectively, along with five endoglucanases (I–V). It is generally believed that hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose to cellobiose is the rate-limiting step of cellulose degradation, which requires at least two type of synergistic reactions, endo-exo cooperation between endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases (CBHs), and exo-exo cooperation between CBH I and II, which remove cellobiosyl residues from, respectively, the reducing and nonreducing ends of cellulose chains (6Henrissat B. Driguez H. Viet C. Schülein M. Bio/Technology. 1985; 3: 722-726Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Among the enzymes present in the cellulase preparation from T. reesei, CBH I is the most abundant component, accounting for >60% of the total protein (7Enari T.M. Niku-Paavola M.L. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1987; 5: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CBH I is structurally modular, consisting of a family 7 glycoside hydrolase catalytic module and a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (TrCBM1), connected by a proline- and threonine-rich, highly glycosylated linker peptide. In a proposed (8Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) mechanism for the action of CBH I on crystalline cellulose, the surface-binding family 1 CBM first binds to the planar surface of cellulose. The reducing end of one cellulose chain is then threaded into the active site tunnel of the catalytic module. The cellulose chain is advanced “processively” through the tunnel, two glucosyl residues at a time, as catalytic residues in the tunnel catalyze the hydrolysis of every second β-1,4-glucosidic bond to depolymerize the chain to free cellobiose units. This last proposed feature is based primarily on the analytical finding that CBH I produces mainly cellobiose, as well as on the structure of the catalytic module (8Divne C. Ståhlberg J.

It has been demonstrated that AFM is a powerful analytical tool that can be used to obtain highly accurate images of the cellulose surface under physiological conditions with nanometer resolution (22Baker A.A.

The sample can be imaged without physical (freezing) or chemical (fixation) treatments; the images thus obtained therefore reflect “native” structures. However, up until now, limited information has been obtained by real-time observation of biological events in time frames long enough to capture significant effects of cellulase action. In the present study, we use AFM to image in real-time the morphological changes occurring in single crystals of Valonia cellulose as a result of hydrolysis by T. reesei CBH I. The Valonia cellulose I has mostly an Iα structure and is a widely accepted native crystalline cellulose standard. Our objective was to learn how the enzyme affects the cellulose morphology at the nanometer scale. CBH I was purified from a seven-day broth of T. reesei grown on Sigmacell 50 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) as carbon source. The detailed protocol of CBH I purification has been described elsewhere (24Baker J.O. Mitchell D.J. Grohmann K. Himmel M.E. Leatham G.F. Himmel M.E. Enzymes in Biomass Conversion.

The cell culture of the green alga V. ventricosa was purchased from UTEX (The Culture Collection of Algae at The University of Texas at Austin) and was grown in enriched seawater medium (UTEX) at 23 °C under a photo regime of 16-h light at 80–100 foot candles of intensity alternated with 8-h periods in the dark. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and were stored at −20 °C. Frozen whole Valonia cells were fixed and embedded using the following protocol, with all steps performed in a microwave at 30 °C under vacuum except where noted. Samples were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed 3× with PBS, fixed in 1% (w/v) OsO4 in PBS, washed 3× with distilled H2O, and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 60%, 90%, 3 × 100%, diluted in distilled H2O). Fixed cells were then infiltrated with EMbed 812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in increasing concentrations of resin (7%, 15%, 30%, 60%, 90%, 3 × 100% resin, diluted in ethanol), with the last two resin exchanges lasting for 48 h each on a rotator at room temperature. The samples were transferred to flat-bottomed BEEM-type capsules (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and the resin was polymerized by heating to 60 °C for 72 h in a nitrogen-purged vacuum oven. The samples were then sectioned to ∼240 nm thickness with a Diatome diamond knife (Electron Microscopy Sciences) on a Leica EM UTC ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were collected on freshly cleaved mica disks for AFM. The cellulose crystals were isolated from Valonia cells using the previously described method (25Imai T. Putaux J.L. Sugiyama J. Polymer. 2003; 44: 1871-1879Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified Valonia cellulose crystals were stored at −20 °C. Freshly cleaved mica coated with an amine polymer, poly-l-lysine, provided a flat, smooth, and stationary substrate on which the cellulose crystals were firmly immobilized to overcome the forces applied by the AFM probe and to permit high resolution of the sample structure. Five μl of poly-l-lysine solution (0.1% w/v in water, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to freshly cleaved mica. After 5 min of incubation, the excess poly-l-lysine solution was removed using a spin coater (Model KW-4A, Chemat Technology, Northridge, CA) operated at 500 rpm for 30 s followed by 4000 rpm for 30 s. After that, 5 μl of a suspension of cellulose crystals (1 mg/ml in water) was added, followed by incubation and spin coating as in the above procedure. The coated mica was then dried in an oven at gentle heat (45 °C) overnight. AFM was operated in tapping mode in buffer and in air. We found that application of a 150-μl liquid droplet (enzyme solution or buffer) to the cellulose-coated mica provided a sample in aqueous environment that was sufficient for imaging for at least 10 h without significant artifacts caused by water evaporation. CBH I (1 mg/ml) was applied to the cellulose-coated mica in acetate buffer (20 mm acetate, 0.02% NaN3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.0): the same buffer, without CBHI, was used for buffer-control imaging. AFM measurements were conducted using a Multi-ModeTM scanning probe microscope with NanoScope V controller (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). To ensure absolute stability, the AFM was located in a specially designed laboratory with acoustic and vibration isolation. A customized Nikon optical microscope with deep focus (800× magnification) was used to aid in positioning of the AFM tip to the desired location. Silicon nitride probes and sharp nitride lever probes (Veeco) were used in tapping mode to image cellulose fibers in liquid, and DP18/HI'RES/Al BS probes (MikroMasch, San Jose, CA) were used in air. Images of cross section and roughness were analyzed using Nanoscope software (version 7.30). Surface roughness was evaluated by flattening the images (second order) and calculating mean roughness (Ra) and root mean squared roughness (Rq). Ra is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the surface height deviations measured from the mean plane, expressed as follows in Equation 1. Ra=1N∑j=1N|Zj|(Eq. 1) In contrast, Rq is root mean square average of height deviations taken from the mean image data plane, expressed as follows in Equation 2. Rq=Σ(Zi)2N(Eq. 2) The green alga V. ventricosa produces large cellulose fibrils. Cross-sections of Valonia cellulose crystallites appear square with sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm as observed by TEM (26Chanzy H. Henrissat B. Vuong R. Revol J.F. Holzforschung. 1986; 40: 25-30Google Scholar, 27Revol J.F. Carb. Polymers. 1982; 2: 123-134Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The negative staining method used in those studies measured the crystallites as nonstaining objects, and it was expected that the measured size of the crystallite could be smaller than that of the actual microfibril due to staining effects and resolution limitation. In the current study, the cross-section of the Valonia cell wall was imaged by AFM, with height (Fig. 1A), phase (Fig. 1B), and amplitude (Fig. 1C) images being taken simultaneously. By analyzing these images, the contours of each microfibril could be seen clearly. The shape of each microfibril is hexagonal (Fig. 1D); because the microfibrils are mostly irregular with two narrow sides, they can appear pentagonal in low resolution images (Fig. 1, A–C). The sizes of individual microfibrils range from 10 to 50 nm, with maximum frequency near 35 nm. The isolated cellulose crystals were also imaged (Fig. 1, E and F). Several crystals often form small bundles, and single crystals were measured in the cross-section profile of height images as being 15 to 40 nm in height with maximum frequency of 25 nm, and the length was measured as 200 nm to 2 μm with maximum frequency of 1 μm. The reason that the measured size of single isolated crystals was slightly smaller than that in native cell wall could be one of the following: 1) the measured cross-sections may not be perfectly perpendicular to the long axis of the microfibril, which would result in larger size measured than the actual one; 2) although we used a sharp tip (1 nm in apex) for the AFM imaging to minimize the tip broadening effect, it would be difficult to deconvolute such effects; or 3) the preparation process used to isolate the cellulose crystal could also be expected to cause surface damage and peeling. Nevertheless, the shape of Valonia cellulose observed is an irregular hexagon with two narrow sides. Incidentally, subunits corresponding to the 3–5 nm elementary fibril reported previously (28Gardner K.H. Blackwell J. J. Polymer Sci. Part C: Polymer Symposia. 1971; 36: 327-340Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were not observed in this study. Fig. 2 shows a single cellulose crystal imaged in acetate buffer (as “zero-time control,” Fig. 2A) and at 171, 179, 188, 196, 205, 214, and 222 min, respectively, (Fig. 2, B–H) after addition of CBH I. With the same scanning size and area, we observed that cellulose fibers had well defined ridges and relatively clean surfaces in buffer. After addition of CBH I, there were some new features (right side of cellulose) showing up on the cellulose crystal. These new features could be explained as CBH I enzymes binding to the cellulose surface. These new features were observed over a period of time (222 min), as shown in Fig. 2 (B–H). The apparent size of these features is approximately a quarter of the AFM measured height (25 nm) of the cellulose crystal. Based on published crystal structures for the CBH I catalytic domain (8Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), and on small-angle x-ray scattering structures for the intact enzyme (29Abuja P.M. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Esterbauer H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1988; 15: 339-342Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), projection of a bound CBH I molecule away from the cellulose surface may be inferred to be between 5 and 10 nm. A productively bound molecule (bound through both CBM and a catalytic module “threaded” upon a cellulose chain) will have a “projection height” closer to the smaller size, whereas an enzyme molecule bound to the cellulose only by the CBM might have projection heights ranging up to ∼10 nm. Therefore, we propose that the new features appearing on cellulose are most likely to be CBH I enzymes. Although the AFM time-resolution (frame rate ∼ 1 frame/(8 min)) used in this study is not capable of demonstrating processive motion of specific, individual CBH I molecules, the observed new features were similar to those tracked in a recent high speed AFM report (10Igarashi K. Koivula A. Wada M. Kimura S. Penttilä M. Samejima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36186-36190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows that these features change relative locations on the cellulose surface over the time imaged. Because there are apparently two different sizes of features, with their relative distances changing during the observed time frames (Fig. 2, C and D), we further speculate that the two size categories represent two different kinds of modules (i.e. catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules) and that the observed changes in intermodule distance reflect conformational changes in the entire CBH I molecule as CBH I catalyzes bond cleavage and moves along on a cellulose chain. Rigorous statistical analysis of continuous real-time imaging using AFM will be required to confirm this speculation. AFM is capable of measuring the surface structure at atomic resolution. We analyzed the structural changes in the cellulose surface concomitant with the action of CBH I. One of the features obtained from AFM measurements is the degree of roughness, which can be used to analyze changes in the surface brought about by friction, adhesion, and catalytic activity. There are many mathematical approaches to calculating surface roughness from AFM images, including probability height distribution, fractal analysis, mean roughness (Ra), and root-mean-squared roughness (Rq). Ra and Rq are the most commonly reported of the measures of surface roughness that can be extracted from AFM images. Fig. 3 represents roughness measurement of the cellulose crystal shown in Fig. 2. We found that cellulose surface roughness increased (in both Ra and Rq cases) by ∼0.3 nm after addition of CBH I, which further confirms that the apparent morphological changes of cellulose observed by AFM were the results of CBH I reaction. The roughness remained almost constant during a subsequent 274 min of measurement in the presence of CBH I (Fig. 3). Valonia celluloses are known to be primarily Iα in crystalline form (30Sugiyama J. Vuong R. Chanzy H. Macromolecules. 1991; 24: 4168-4175Crossref Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The distance between Iα cellulose sheets (d110) is 0.39 nm, which is similar to the measured surface roughness increases resulting from CBH I action, indicating that CBH I enzymes affect only the surface layer of cellulose crystals. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the TrCBM1 binds to the hydrophobic faces (1 1 0) of cellulose (21Liu Y.S. Zeng Y. Luo Y. Xu Q. Himmel M.E. Smith S.J. Ding S.Y. Cellulose. 2009; 16: 587-597Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Lehtiö J. Sugiyama J. Gustavsson M. Fransson L. Linder M. Teeri T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 32Xu Q. Tucker M.P. Arenkiel P. Ai X. Rumbles G. Sugiyama J. Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Cellulose. 2009; 16: 19-26Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and these faces are as narrow as 2–4 nm (14Ding S.Y. Xu Q. Ali M.K. Baker J.O. Bayer E.A. Barak Y. Lamed R. Sugiyama J. Rumbles G. Himmel M.E. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Xu Q. Tucker M.P. Arenkiel P. Ai X. Rumbles G. Sugiyama J. Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Cellulose. 2009; 16: 19-26Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Presumably the hydrophobic faces consist of more than one cellulose chain, thus the roughness change may indicate that the cellulose chains are hydrolyzed individually. Continuous images of cellulose were taken in real-time during incubation with either buffer or CBH I solution. The size and shape of the cellulose crystal were analyzed by plotting the cross-section profiles of each image frame (Fig. 4, A and B). No change was observed during an 11-h incubation in buffer (Fig. 4A). After addition of CBH I, on the other hand, Fig. 4B shows size reduction of the observed area taken from the average of two successive frames with 50 cross-section lines in each frame (based on 512 × 512 scan lines), which demonstrated that the average width of the cellulose crystal decreased, but the average height remained relatively constant. The apparent reduction of cellulose specifically on one side of the crystal may imply that the CBH I tends to hydrolyze cellulose from certain surfaces. It has been previously reported that the family 1 CBM from CBH I binds only to certain faces of cellulose crystal, i.e. the (1 1 0) faces (or the hydrophobic faces) in the case of Valonia Iα cellulose (28Gardner K.H. Blackwell J. J. Polymer Sci. Part C: Polymer Symposia. 1971; 36: 327-340Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It could be further speculated that CBH I hydrolysis also occurs only on the hydrophobic faces as discussed below. The cross-section area of each single cellulose crystal was further integrated based on AFM image section profiles, and a size reduction of 20% was estimated based on 11 h of measurement (Fig. 4C), whereas there was no change observed for the same period of time in buffer (Fig. 4A). The hydrolysis rate of CBH I could not be calculated, because 1) it is not known how many CBH I molecules are involved in the period of 11 h hydrolysis, and 2) it is difficult to estimate how many cellulose chains are hydrolyzed in the 20% size reduction. Fig. 5 shows a schematic diagram of an anisotropic hexagonal cellulose crystal and predictions of scanning profiles produced during AFM imaging. In this diagram, the cellulose crystal is initially 25 nm in width and is shaped based on the cellulose Iα structure with two hydrophobic faces (1 1 0) both 3-nm wide. Most likely, the broader hydrophilic faces will attach to the mica surface when a single cellulose crystal makes contact with the mica surface during AFM sample preparation. The schematic of the AFM tip is generated based on a 1-nm radius for the tip apex and the general shape provided by the manufacturer. According to this proposed orientation of the crystal on the mica surface, both hydrophobic (1 1 0) and (−1 −1 0) faces, are exposed and susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis. AFM, however, can probe only the surfaces geometrically accessible to the tip, so for the situation shown in Fig. 5, only the hydrolytic removal of material from the (1 1 0) face will show up in scan profiles as a difference between scans taken before and after CBH I hydrolysis. The schematic diagram shown in Fig. 5 therefore provides a quite likely explanation for the one-sided reduction of the cellulose crystal width in Fig. 4B. In addition, Fig. 5 illustrates a reasonable explanation for the observation that no significant changes in measured crystal height are detected during enzyme hydrolysis, contrasted with substantial changes in crystal width. It has been documented that CBH I carries out exoattack on cellulose from its reducing end generating sharpened tips (16Boisset C. Fraschini C. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Chanzy H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows a succession of real-time AFM amplitude images (9 min per scan) of the end of the same cellulose crystal, beginning (”zero time” in the figure legend) 6 h after the addition of CBH I. The amplitude mode yields clear images with high contrast. During the course of the enzyme hydrolysis, we observed various shape changes at the end of the cellulose crystal, such as from smooth (Fig. 6A, 0 min), to sawtoothed (Fig. 6B, 9 min), and then to nicked (Fig. 6C, 26 min). The fiber end appeared smooth again in Fig. 6G (249 min), but with a sharper angle than that in Fig. 6A. The observed tip sharpening is similar to that reported previously (16Boisset C. Fraschini C. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Chanzy H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) where CBH I erodes bacterial cellulose and renders the reducing end pointed in TEM images. We extend the results of the earlier work by providing real-time images of irregularities produced in cellulose-crystal tips by CBH I-catalyzed hydrolytic erosion. For the same reason illustrated in Fig. 5, AFM only detects one side of sharpening, whereas TEM image can show sharpening from both sides. In this study, operating AFM in an aqueous environment allows us to image the process under physiological conditions without intervening chemical/physical treatments. The observed phenomenon is thus closer to that occurring in nature. A control experiment was done by imaging cellulose fiber ends exposed to acetate buffer only. A series of real-time AFM amplitude images were taken starting at 6 h after adding acetate buffer solution rather than CBH I solution. No observable changes were found in either a short time (0 to 34 min with ∼9 min frame rate) or a long time scale (360 min) (Fig. 7). The ends of isolated cellulose crystals sometimes appear to be nicked branches (Fig. 7), which could have resulted from the harsh preparation conditions (strong acid/base or high temperature) of cellulose isolation.FIGURE 7“Buffer only” control for the experiment in Fig. 6. The cellulose crystal end shows no change in acetate buffer either in the short time scale (A–E) or in the long time scale (F). AFM amplitude images were taken 0 min (A), 9 min (B), 17 min (C), 26 min (D), 34 min (E), and 360 (F) min after the end of 6 h of initial exposure to acetate buffer.

We demonstrated structural changes including decrease in width, increases of surface roughness, and changes in shape of fiber ends. We have observed that the cross-section of Valonia cellulose crystal is apparently an irregular hexagon with two narrow hydrophobic faces that are binding surfaces for TrCBM1, and are likely to be the surfaces from which CBH I-catalyzed reactions remove cellulose chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of CBH I hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose that supports the hypothesis that CBH I hydrolyzes only the hydrophobic faces of cellulose. We further speculate that development of pretreatment approaches aimed at modification of cellulose to increase the accessibility of the hydrophobic planes to enzyme catalyst may lead to further improvements in the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification of biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2138404467,"In late mitosis and G1, Mcm2-7 are assembled onto replication origins to license them for initiation in the upcoming S phase. After initiation, Mcm2-7 provide helicase activity to unwind DNA at the replication fork. Here we examine the structure of Mcm2-7 on chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts. We show that prior to replication initiation, Mcm2-7 is present at licensed replication origins in a complex with a molecular mass close to double that of the Mcm2-7 hexamer. This complex has approximately stoichiometric quantities of the 6 Mcm2-7 proteins and we conclude that it consists of a double heterohexamer. This provides a configuration potentially capable of initiating a pair of bidirectional replication forks in S phase. We also show that after initiation, Mcm2-7 associate with Cdc45 and GINS to form a relatively stable CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) complex. The CMG proteins also associate less strongly with other replication proteins, consistent with the idea that a single CMG complex forms the core of the replisome."

https://openalex.org/W1992754261,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a major component of the immune cell infiltrate observed in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Factors present in the TME, including tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β), allow tumors to circumvent host-mediated immune responses to promote tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved are not clear. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important mediators of innate immune responses by immune cells, whose activation triggers the production of molecules required for anti-tumoral responses. Interleukin (IL) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M is an inactive serine/threonine kinase, predominantly expressed in macrophages and is a potent negative regulator of TLR signaling. In this study, we show that TAMs express significantly higher levels of IRAK-M compared with peritoneal macrophages in a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer. Subcutaneous implantation of Lewis lung carcinoma cells in IRAK-M−/− mice resulted in a five-fold reduction in tumor growth as compared with tumors in wild-type (WT) animals. Furthermore, compared with WT TAMs, TAMs isolated from IRAK-M−/− mice displayed features of a classically activated (M1) rather than alternatively activated (M2) phenotype, as manifest by greater expression of IL-12, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Human lung cancer cells induced IRAK-M expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) when co-cultured together. Tumor cell-induced expression of IRAK-M was dependent on the activation of TGF-β pathway. Similarly, treatment of human PBMCs or mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.4, with TGF-β, induced IRAK-M expression. Interestingly, IRAK-M gene expression in 439 human lung adenocarcinoma tumors correlated with poor survival in patients with lung cancer. Together, our data demonstrates that TGF-β-dependent induction of IRAK-M expression is an important, clinically relevant mechanism by which tumors may circumvent anti-tumor responses of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2166237781,"Cartilage tissue engineering aims to replace damaged or diseased tissue with a functional regenerate that restores joint function. Scaffolds are used to deliver cells and facilitate tissue development, but they can also interfere with the structural assembly of the cartilage matrix. Biodegradable scaffolds have been proposed as a means to improve matrix deposition and the biomechanical properties of neocartilage. The challenge is designing scaffolds with appropriate degradation rates, ideally such that scaffold degradation is proportional to matrix deposition. In this study, we developed a bioresponsive hydrogel with cell-mediated degradation aligned to the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We identified matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) as an enzyme with a temporal expression pattern that corresponded with cartilage development. By embedding MMP7 peptide substrates within a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate backbone, we built MMP7-sensitive hydrogels with distinct degradation rates. When MMP7-sensitive scaffolds were compared with nondegradable scaffolds in vitro, photoencapsulated hMSCs produced neocartilage constructs with more extensive collagenous matrices, as demonstrated through immunohistochemistry and biochemical quantification of matrix molecules. Furthermore, these changes translated into an increased dynamic compressive modulus. This work presents a practical strategy for designing biomaterials uniquely tuned to individual biological processes."

HRNR shares features with filaggrin, a key protein for keratinocyte differentiation, but conflicting reports have been published concerning its expression in the epidermis, and its role is still unknown. To analyze HRNR expression and function in the epidermis, anti-HRNR antibodies were produced and used in Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical, confocal, and immunoelectron microscopy analyses of human skin and of cornified cell envelopes purified from plantar stratum corneum. We also tested whether HRNR was a substrate of transglutaminases. In the epidermis, HRNR was detected at the periphery of keratohyalin granules in the upper granular layer and at the corneocyte periphery in the whole cornified layer. Detected in Western blot analysis as numerous bands, HRNR was relatively insoluble and only extracted from epidermis with urea and/or reducing agents. The presence of HRNR in the purified envelopes was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and by Western blot analysis after V8-protease digestion. HRNR was shown to be a substrate of transglutaminase 3. These data demonstrate that HRNR is a component of cornified cell envelopes of human epidermis. Its reduced expression in AD may contribute to the epidermal barrier defect observed in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033167307,"Notch signaling is active in many sites, and its diverse activities must require tissue-specific intermediaries, which are largely unknown. In the intestinal epithelium, Notch promotes crypt cell proliferation and inhibits goblet cell differentiation. Pharmacologic studies suggest that the latter effect occurs through the transcription factor Math1/Atoh1, which specifies all intestinal secretory cells. We tested this hypothesis using mouse mutants. Genetic loss of the Notch effector RBP-Jκ alone increases all intestinal secretory lineages, with variation between proximal and distal gut segments. This secretory cell excess observed with RBP-Jκ loss was blocked in the absence of Math1 in RBP-Jκ(Fl/Fl);Math1(Fl/Fl);Villin-Cre((ER-T2)) mice. Loss of both factors also restored progenitor replication, proving that Math1 is epistatic to Notch signaling in both secretory cell differentiation and crypt cell proliferation. Investigating mechanisms downstream of Math1, we found that expression of the known Notch effector protein Hes1 was predictably lost in RBP-Jκ(-/-) mice but surprisingly recovered in RBP-Jκ;Math1 compound conditional mutants. Furthermore, the cell cycle inhibitors p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2) were selectively overexpressed in duodenal and ileal crypts, respectively, in RBP-Jκ-deficient mice. Regional activation of these products was completely abrogated in the absence of Math1. Thus, all intestinal Notch effects channel through the tissue-restricted factor Math1, which promotes secretory differentiation and cell cycle exit by regionally distinct mechanisms. Our data further suggest that, besides transmitting Notch signals, the transcription factor Hes1 acts downstream of Math1 to regulate expression of cell cycle inhibitors and intestinal crypt cell replication."
https://openalex.org/W2082808697,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinase involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. Overexpression of ILK in epithelial cells leads to anchorage-independent growth with increased cell cycle progression. Previously, we have shown that ILK upregulation strongly correlates with melanoma progression, invasion and inversely correlates with 5-year survival of melanoma patients. However, the molecular mechanism by which ILK enhances melanoma progression is currently unknown. In the present study, we found that proangiogenic molecule interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the downstream target of ILK in melanoma cells. ILK overexpression increased IL-6, whereas silencing of ILK suppressed IL-6 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels. ILK also altered the activity and subcellular localization of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) subunit p65. We further found that ILK enhanced the IL-6 gene transcription by promoting the binding of NF-κB p65 to IL-6 promoter. Moreover, ILK overexpression in melanoma cells enhanced the tube-forming ability of endothelial cells in vitro and microvessel formation in vivo. ILK-induced tube and blood vessel formation of endothelial cells was significantly reduced upon IL-6 inhibition in ILK-overexpressing melanoma cells. To delineate the mechanism by which ILK-induced IL-6 production can enhance angiogenesis, further analysis of the downstream targets of IL-6 signaling showed an increased activity of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in ILK-overexpressing cells. As STAT3 binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter, we found that VEGF levels were elevated in ILK-overexpressing cells and declined upon transfection of IL-6 small interfering RNA, suggesting that ILK may regulate VEGF expression through IL-6 pathway by activating STAT3."

We provided evidence that NBA1 interacts with BRE through a C-terminal conserved motif of the NBA1 protein and a C-terminal UEV domain of the BRE protein.

Knockdown of NBA1 or BRE leads to decreased levels of components of the two BRCC36-containing complexes. We provided evidence that NBA1 interacts with BRE through a C-terminal conserved motif of the NBA1 protein and a C-terminal UEV domain of the BRE protein. Furthermore, the NBA1-BRE interaction is required for cellular resistance to ionizing irradiation and NBA1's role in recruiting BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. Together, these studies reveal critical interactions required for the formation and function of BRCC36-containing DUB complexes.

In response to ionizing irradiation, ubiquitination occurs at DNA damage sites in a central DNA damage kinases ATM/ATR-dependent manner (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol.

Ubiquitin Lys63 (K63) polyubiquitin chain linkages play important roles in the recruitment of repair factors in the DNA damage response (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol.

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are assembled through a conserved heterodimer of an E2 complex composed of a catalytically active Ubc13 subunit and its inactive sequence homolog Mms2 that lacks the enzymatic active site (4Hofmann R.M.

The formation of K63-polyubiquitins at DNA damage sites depends on two E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol.

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub from Ub-conjugated substrate proteins and it has become increasingly obvious that Ub deconjugation plays important roles in regulating Ub-dependent pathways (8Love K.R.

It plays an important role in recruiting BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, as BRCC36 deficiency leads to decreased BRCA1 accumulation at DNA damage sites (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). BRCC36 is a component of the BRCA1 A complex (13Sobhian B. Shao G. Lilli D.R. Culhane A.C. Moreau L.A. Xia B. Livingston D.M. Greenberg R.A. Science. 2007; 316: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 17Feng L. Huang J. Chen J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Wang B. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20759-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The BRCA1 A complex contains at least five different components, Abraxas, NBA1/MERIT40, BRE, Rap80, and BRCC36. It associates with BRCA1 through an interaction of Abraxas with the BRCA1 C-terminal BRCT domains (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The BRCA1 A complex plays a critical role in the DNA damage-induced ubiquitin signaling that recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. DNA damage-induced ATM/ATR phosphorylation on S139 of histone H2AX directly recruits MDC1 through MDC1's BRCT domains. The subsequent MDC1 phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of ubiquitin ligases RNF8/Ubc13 and RNF168/UBC13 generates K63 Ub chains on the damaged chromatin that creates docking sites for the BRCA1 A complex for recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of damage (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of each component of this complex compromises the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, leading to increased cell sensitivity to irradiation (IR) and inability of cells to arrest the cell cycle. In the BRCA1 A complex, Abraxas protein mediates the interaction of the complex with BRCA1 C-terminal BRCT domains via a phospho-SPXF motif. BRCC36 dimerizes with Abraxas forming an MPN+/MPN-domain-containing protein pair that is also observed in the lid of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle and the COP9 signalosome (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The MPN+ domain displays DUB activity while the MPN-domain lacks the critical residues for DUB activity. Rap80 contains two ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) domains that specifically bind to K63-linked Ub chains, which is critical for BRCA1 recruitment to DNA damage sites (3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). In addition, BRE contains two ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domains and the NBA1 protein contains a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain that is homologous to the VWA domain of the proteasome subunit Rpn10/S5A/PSMD4 (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the BRCA1 A complex contains multiple ubiquitin binding domains and shares similarities with the lid complex of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the complex is assembled to facilitate its functions. BRCC36 was also identified as a member of a cytoplasmic BRISC complex (BRCC36 isopeptidase complex) for cleavage of K63 Ub chains (14Cooper E.M. Cutcliffe C. Kristiansen T.Z. Pandey A. Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It appears that the BRISC complex contains a paralog of Abraxas, ABRO1, as well as NBA1, BRE, and BRCC36. In the BRISC complex, the ABRO1 and BRCC36 interaction is minimally required for the K63-specific DUB activity of BRCC36 (19Cooper E.M. Boeke J.D. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10344-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to the BRCA1 A complex, it is not clear how the multiple components are arranged in the complex to contribute to the integrity and activity of the complex. NBA1 is a novel protein that contains a VWA domain that is similar to the Rpn10 subunit of the lid of the 19S regulatory subunit (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). NBA1 deficiency leads to decreased levels of Abraxas, BRE, and BRCC36 (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Feng L. Huang J. Chen J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Shao G. Lilli D.R.

In this study, we found that NBA1 and BRE interaction plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of both of the BRCC36-containing complexes. In the BRCA1 A complex, the NBA1 and BRE interaction is required for recruiting BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage and maintaining a proper DNA damage response. Rabbit anti-NBA1 and anti-BRE antibodies were generated with human GST-NBA1 and GST-BRE fusion proteins. The rabbit anti-Abraxas and anti-ABRO1 antibodies were generated as previously described (21Wang B. Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Zhang D. Smogorzewska A. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Science. 2007; 316: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were BRCC36 antibodies (ProSci Incorporated); Rap80 antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories); BRCA1 antibodies (D9, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies); GFP antibodies (Invitrogen); α-tubilin antibodies (The University of Iowa); mouse anti-HA antibodies (Covance). U2OS cells were grown in the McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. NBA1-deficient and BRE-deficient stable cell lines were generated by infecting U2OS cells with retrovirus of MSCV vectors (22Schlabach M.R. Luo J. Solimini N.L. Hu G. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Zhao Z. Smogorzewska A. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. Westbrook T.F. Liang A.C. Chang K. Hackett J.A. Harper J.W. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2008; 319: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) containing shRNAs against NBA1 or BRE sequences with selection of puromycin (0.8 μg/ml) for 1 week. For NBA1- or BRE-deficient cells rescued with expression of wild type or mutants of NBA1 or BRE, U2OS cells were first infected with retroviruses expressing wild type or mutants of NBA1 or BRE. Stable cell lines expressing these proteins were then infected with retroviruses containing the appropriate shRNAs that target the 3′-UTR sequence of the corresponding genes. To prepare doxycyclin inducible shNBA1 stable cell lines, U2OS cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs against the NBA1 gene expressed under a tetracycline-inducible promoter and selection was performed with puromycin (0.8 μg/ml). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3.6% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeablized with 0.5% Triton X-100 solution and incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h followed by appropriate Alexa 488-conjugated (green; Invitrogen) and Cy3-conjugated (red; Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibodies. For immunostaining of cells expressing GFP-NLS-NBA1 or NBA1 mutants, cells were first treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS prior to fixation to extract soluble NBA1 or its mutant proteins. All images were obtained with a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera. As previously described (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), cells were lysed in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40] with protease inhibitors and protein phosphatase inhibitors, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out in the same buffer with appropriate antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. FLAG IP was carried out using Flag (M2) beads (Sigma). U2OS cells, untreated or treated with 10 Gy IR, were cultured at 37 °C for 2 h, trypsinized, and collected. Total cell extracts (TCE) were prepared by resuspending cells directly in Laemmli buffer (3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris) followed by sonication. For fractionation experiments, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease cocktails) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated on ice for 5 min for permeabilization. Cells were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected for preparation of cytoplasmic proteins, while pellets were further processed for nuclear proteins. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and insoluble aggregates and the supernatants (S2 fraction; cytoplasmic proteins) were collected. The pellets were first washed with ice-cold buffer A, then resuspended in buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, a protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants (S3 fraction, soluble nucleoplasmic protein) were collected. The final chromatin pellet (P3) was washed with buffer B and resuspended in Laemmli buffer and sonicated for 15 s before analysis. U2OS stable cell lines were seeded at low density and irradiated with 4 Gy ionizing irradiation using a 137Cs source. The cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 14 days to allow colonies to form. Colonies were stained with 2% methylene blue/50% ethanol. Colonies containing 50 or more cells were counted. Statistical data were analyzed by the t test. Retroviral expression constructs for HA-FLAG-NBA1, GFP-BRE, or GFP-NBA1 were made using MSCV vectors carrying HA-FLAG or GFP tag at the N terminus as described (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GFP-NLS-NBA1 wild type or mutants were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNA fragments into a MSCV vector containing GFP tag and a SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS). Deletion mutants of NBA1 or BRE were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNA fragments into the above retroviral vectors. All site mutants of NBA1 or BRE were generated with the QuickChangeII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The shRNAs against NBA1 and BRE were cloned into a MSCV vector under a mir30 sequence context as described (22Schlabach M.R. Luo J. Solimini N.L. Hu G. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Zhao Z. Smogorzewska A. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. Westbrook T.F. Liang A.C. Chang K. Hackett J.A. Harper J.W. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2008; 319: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The shRNAs against NBA1 were shNBA1#1 CCTTCAATCTGGAAGGACT (targeting to the 3′-UTR of NBA1 mRNA) and shNBA1#2 CTCAATGTCTCCCAGAAGA. The shRNAs against BRE were shBRE#1 CACAAATTATGGTGCAGTA (targeting to the 3′-UTR of BRE mRNA) and shBRE#2 GCTACAAACTGTTTGAGGA. The shNBA1#1 sequence was also cloned into a lentiviral construct with shRNA expression regulated by a doxcyclin-inducible promoter. From tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry analysis of NBA1-associated proteins, we found that NBA1 associates with a protein that is a paralog of the Abraxas protein, termed ABRO1 (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Previously, we have described that ABRO1 is 39% identical to Abraxas at the N-terminal region of the protein (21Wang B. Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Zhang D. Smogorzewska A. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Science. 2007; 316: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Both ABRO1 and Abraxas contain an MPN domain at the N terminus and a coiled-coil domain at the central region of the protein. While Abraxas contains the phospho-SPXF motif at its C terminus that associates with the BRCT domains of the BRCA1 protein, ABRO1 does not contain this motif (Fig. 1A). We tested the association of NBA1 with endogenous ABRO1 using antibodies against ABRO1 protein for immunoprecipitations. Indeed, we found that ABRO1 associates with the endogenous NBA1. In addition, ABRO1 also associates with BRE and BRCC36 of the BRCA1 A complex (Fig. 1B). However, the BRCA1 A complex component, Rap80, failed to interact with ABRO1 (Fig. 1B). In addition, as ABRO1 lacks the phospho-SPXF motif that binds to the BRCT domain of BRCA1, it does not interact with BRCA1 as expected (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether ABRO1 binds to NBA1, BRE, and BRCC36 in a similar manner as Abraxas protein, we made deletion mutants of ABRO1 and tested their binding to different components of the BRCA1 A complex. We found that, similar to Abraxas (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Wang B. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20759-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the N terminus ABR domain of ABRO1 binds to NBA1 and BRE, and that the coiled-coil domain is required for binding to BRCC36 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, Abraxas does not interact with ABRO1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the Abraxas complex (BRCA1 A complex) and the ABRO1 complex (BRISC complex) represent two distinct complexes consisting of the common components NBA1, BRE, and BRCC36. To further understand the nature of these two complexes, we examined the localization of these two complexes using cell fractionation. We found that while Abraxas/Rap80 are mostly localized in the nuclear chromatin fraction, ABRO1 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). NBA1, BRE, and BRCC36 are mostly localized in the cytoplasm, similar to ABRO1, thus suggesting that most of the NBA1, BRE, and BRCC36 protein in the cells are present in the ABRO1 complex. We also examined the localization of ABRO1 using immunofluoresence with ABRO1 antibodies or a GFP-tagged ABRO1 protein. We found that ABRO1 mainly localized in the cytoplasm with some localization in the nucleus as well (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1). The localization of ABRO1 did not appear to change in response to IR (Fig. 1E). Previously, we and others have found that NBA1 is required for cells to maintain proper levels of Abraxas, BRE, and BRCC36 (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Feng L. Huang J. Chen J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Shao G. Patterson-Fortin J. Messick T.E. Feng D. Shanbhag N. Wang Y. Greenberg R.A. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We found that NBA1 is also required for maintaining the levels of ABRO1 protein (Fig. 2). In the NBA1 shRNA-treated U2OS cells, the levels of ABRO1 protein were decreased, similar to Abraxas, BRE and BRCC36 (Fig. 2A). When we expressed an NBA1 cDNA lacking the shRNA target site in U2OS cells treated with NBA1 shRNA#1, the protein levels of Abraxas, BRE and BRCC36, as well as the levels of ABRO1, were rescued (Fig. 2B). We then established a stable U2OS cell line that allowed us to inducibly knock down NBA1 using an inducible expression construct of shRNA#1 against NBA1 gene. Upon knockdown of NBA1 by expression of shRNA against NBA1 (from day 2–3), the protein levels of Abraxas, ABRO1, BRE or BRCC36 were quickly decreased, correlating to decreased levels of NBA1. However, the levels of Rap80 took a much longer time to decrease (more than 7 days) (Fig. 2C). We also observed that NBA1 is required for maintaining levels of component proteins in the BRCA1 A complex and the ABRO1 complex in human normal fibroblast BJ cells and human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (supplemental Fig. S2). The decrease of protein levels was not due to the decrease of mRNA levels for genes encoding these proteins based on RT-PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S3). Upon treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132, protein levels of Abraxas, ABRO1, or Rap80 were restored to some extent in stable cell lines with NBA1 knockdown or inducible NBA1 knockdown, suggesting that the decreased protein level is at least partly due to the proteasomal degradation (supplemental Fig. S4). We also attempted to measure protein stability following cycloheximide (CHX) treatment in cells. All of the component proteins were quite stable when NBA1 was present, however, levels of these proteins greatly decreased when NBA1 was absent (supplemental Fig. S5). Because NBA1 plays a critical role in maintaining the levels of components of the Abraxas/BRCA1 A complex and the ABRO1 complex, thus maintaining the integrity of these complexes, we decided to examine how NBA1 interacts with the other components in the complex. We generated a series of mutants of NBA1 and determined their interactions with other components of the complex (Fig. 3). We have previously found that NBA1 contains a VWA domain spanning 94–298 amino acids of the protein (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, its N terminus contains multiple serine residues that were reported phosphorylated in large-scale proteomic analysis for phosphorylation sites on the proteins (24Dephoure N. Zhou C. Villén J. Beausoleil S.A. Bakalarski C.E. Elledge S.J. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10762-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 25Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M.

Its C-terminal 310–314 amino acids have been suggested to be important for its localization to DNA damage sites (23Shao G. Patterson-Fortin J. Messick T.E. Feng D. Shanbhag N. Wang Y. Greenberg R.A. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated deletion mutants for the N terminus and C terminus of the NBA1 protein, as well as point mutants in the VWA-domain for amino acids that are conserved either among various VWA domains or among NBA1 proteins from different species (16Wang B. Hurov K. Hofmann K. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed HA-Flag-tagged NBA1 appeared as two bands in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). The slower migrating form of NBA1 disappeared when the lysates were treated with a protein phosphatase indicating a phosphorylation modification (supplemental Fig. S6). We found that while the N-terminal deletion mutants and VWA point mutants of NBA1 appeared to interact with Rap80, BRE, BRCC36, Abraxas, and ABRO1, similarly as the wild type NBA1, the C-terminal deletion mutants, Δ299–329, and Δ306–329 were defective in their ability to associate with components of the Abraxas/BRCA1 A complex and the ABRO1 complex (Fig. 3A, lanes 10 and 14). We then further analyzed the sequence of the C terminus of the NBA1 protein and generated NBA1 Δ315–329 and Δ323–329 mutants as controls. We noticed that a PXXR motif exists at the C terminus of NBA1 protein with the two amino acids proline (Pro-302) and arginine (Arg-305) completely conserved in a line-up of the NBA1 sequences from different species (Fig. 3B). Mutation of these two amino acids to alanine (PR mutant) revealed that the PXXR motif is required for the binding of NBA1 with BRE, BRCC36, Rap80, Abraxas, and ABRO1 (Fig. 3C). To further analyze the requirement of the PXXR motif for these interactions, we also generated the single mutants, P302A and R305A, for comparison. While the mutation of P302 did not appear to greatly affect the binding of NBA1 to the other components, the R305A mutant did, although to a lesser extent compared with the PR mutant of NBA1 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that although both proline 302 and arginine 305 are important for these interactions, arginine 305 plays a more critical role in the binding. We also generated and examined a R305K mutant of NBA1 in which the arginine 305 residue is replaced with a similarly positively charged lysine residue. Although the R305K mutant was defective in binding to BRCC36, BRE, and ABRO1, it appeared to bind to Rap80 and Abraxas quite similarly to the wild-type NBA1 protein (Fig. 3D). To investigate how NBA1 is involved in maintaining the integrity of the Abraxas/BRCA1 A complex and the ABRO1 complex, we established stable NBA1-knockdown cells expressing shRNA-resistant cDNA encoding various NBA1 mutants. We found that mutant Δ299–329 which abolished binding to the other components of the complexes also failed to rescue the levels of the component proteins (Fig. 4A, lane 13). On the contrary, the NBA1 mutants that retained the ability to bind rescued the levels of BRE, BRCC36, Rap80, Abraxas, and ABRO1 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the C terminus PXXR motif appeared to be required for NBA1's role in maintaining protein levels of the members of the Abraxas/BRCA1 A and ABRO1 complexes. While expression of wild-type NBA1 or a mutant that retained binding ability (Δ315–329) could rescue the protein levels of various components in the NBA1 shRNA-treated cells, expression of a NBA1 PR mutant could not (Fig. 4B). Previously, it was shown that NBA1 directly interacts with BRE (23Shao G. Patterson-Fortin J. Messick T.E. Feng D. Shanbhag N. Wang Y. Greenberg R.A.

The tissue-specific pattern of exon 8/8a splicing leads to differences in symptoms between patients with exon 8 or 8a mutations. Elucidating the mechanisms controlling the exon 8/8a splicing choice will be important in understanding the spectrum of defects associated with the disease. We found that the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) mediates a switch from exon 8 to 8a splicing. PTB and its neuronal homolog, nPTB, are widely studied splicing regulators controlling large sets of alternative exons. During neuronal development, PTB expression is down-regulated with a concurrent increase in nPTB expression. Exon 8a is largely repressed in embryonic mouse brain but is progressively induced during neuronal differentiation as PTB is depleted. This splicing repression is mediated by the direct binding of PTB to sequence elements upstream of exon 8a.

Nothing is known about fetal-placental signaling in response to increased fetal demand in the situation of overgrowth. Here, we examined this question using the H19Δ13 mouse model, shown previously to result in elevated levels of Igf2. Fetal and placental weights in H19Δ13 were increased by 23% and 45%, respectively, at E19, when compared with wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, we found that disproportionately large H19Δ13 placentas transport 20–35% less (per gram placenta) glucose and system A amino acids and have similar reductions in passive permeability, despite a significantly greater surface area for nutrient exchange and theoretical diffusion capacity compared with wild-type mice. Expression of key transporter genes Slc2a3 and Slc38a4 was reduced by ~20%. Decreasing the overgrowth of the H19Δ13 placenta by genetically reducing levels of IgβPO resulted in up-regulation of system A activity and maintenance of fetal overgrowth. Our results provide direct evidence that large placentas can modify their nutrient transfer capacity to regulate fetal nutrient acquisition. Our findings are indicative of fetal-placental signaling mechanisms that limit total demand for maternal nutrients.—Angiolini, E., Coan, P. M., Sandovici, I., Iwajomo, O. H., Peck, G., Burton, G.

Here the authors examine the structure of learning at a millisecond timescale, suggesting that reinforcement can also guide learning of continuous action trajectories. Reinforcement signals indicating success or failure are known to alter the probability of selecting between distinct actions. However, successful performance of many motor skills, such as speech articulation, also requires learning behavioral trajectories that vary continuously over time. Here, we investigated how temporally discrete reinforcement signals shape a continuous behavioral trajectory, the fundamental frequency of adult Bengalese finch song. We provided reinforcement contingent on fundamental frequency performance only at one point in the song. Learned changes to fundamental frequency were maximal at this point, but also extended both earlier and later in the fundamental frequency trajectory. A simple principle predicted the detailed structure of learning: birds learned to produce the average of the behavioral trajectories associated with successful outcomes. This learning rule accurately predicted the structure of learning at a millisecond timescale, demonstrating that the nervous system records fine-grained details of successful behavior and uses this information to guide learning."
https://openalex.org/W1965354428,"Induction of a senescent phenotype in tumor cells has been linked to anticancer immune response, however, the molecular mechanisms mediating these phenomenon have not yet been determined. In this study, we present evidence that induction of premature senescence in human cancer cell lines induces Fas expression, and loss of resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Triggering of Fas by using the agonistic antibody CH11 or the recombinant ligand APO010, activates an apoptotic pathway responsible for cell death. Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the senescent cells, particularly TNF-α and IFN-γ, mediates Fas upregulation. Indeed, treatment of proliferating cancer cell lines with TNF-α and IFN-γ, upregulates Fas expression, while blocking TNF-α and IFN-γ by using neutralizing antibodies, decreases Fas expression in senescent cells. We also demonstrate that NF-κB has a central role in controlling the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) by the premature senescent cells, and that TNF-α and IFN-γ, transcriptionally controlled by NF-κB, are the main mediators of Fas upregulation. Our data suggest the existence of an NF-κB-dependent autocrine loop, mediated by TNF-α and IFN-γ, responsible for expression of Fas on the surface of senescent cells, and for their killing."
https://openalex.org/W2055922484,"The first step of the shikimate pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). Thermotoga maritima DAH7PS (TmaDAH7PS) is tetrameric, with monomer units comprised of a core catalytic (β/α)(8) barrel and an N-terminal domain. This enzyme is inhibited strongly by tyrosine and to a lesser extent by the presence of phenylalanine. A truncated mutant of TmaDAH7PS lacking the N-terminal domain was catalytically more active and completely insensitive to tyrosine and phenylalanine, consistent with a role for this domain in allosteric inhibition. The structure of this protein was determined to 2.0 Å. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, this enzyme is dimeric. Wild-type TmaDAH7PS was co-crystallized with tyrosine, and the structure of this complex was determined to a resolution of 2.35 Å. Tyrosine was found to bind at the interface between two regulatory N-terminal domains, formed from diagonally located monomers of the tetramer, revealing a major reorganization of the regulatory domain with respect to the barrel relative to unliganded enzyme. This significant conformational rearrangement observed in the crystal structures was also clearly evident from small angle X-ray scattering measurements recorded in the presence and absence of tyrosine. The closed conformation adopted by the protein on tyrosine binding impedes substrate entry into the neighboring barrel, revealing an unusual tyrosine-controlled gating mechanism for allosteric control of this enzyme."

First, we tested this antibody-based TR-FRET assay in NIH/3T3 cell lines that express EGFR and/or HER2 and in various tumor cell lines. Then, we used the antibody-based TR-FRET assay to evaluate in vitro the effect of different targeted therapies on EGFR/HER2 heterodimers in the ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV-3. A simultaneous incubation with Cetuximab (anti-EGFR) and Trastuzumab (anti-HER2) disturbed EGFR/HER2 heterodimers resulting in a 72% reduction. Cetuximab, Trastuzumab or Pertuzumab (anti-HER2) alone induced a 48, 44, or 24% reduction, respectively. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Erlotinib and Lapatinib had very little effect on EGFR/HER2 dimers concentration. In vivo, the combination of Cetuximab and Trastuzumab showed a better therapeutic effect (median survival and percentage of tumor-free mice) than the single mAbs. These results suggest a correlation between the extent of the mAb-induced EGFR/HER2 heterodimer reduction and the efficacy of such mAbs in targeted therapies. In conclusion, quantifying EGFR/HER2 heterodimers using our antibody-based TR-FRET assay may represent a useful method to predict the efficacy and explain the mechanisms of action of therapeutic mAbs, in addition to other commonly used techniques that focus on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phosphorylation, and cell proliferation.

As attenuated tumour-selective oncolytic vaccinia viruses (VV) are already undergoing clinical evaluation, the goal of this study is to determine whether HDI can also enhance the potency of these poxviruses in infection-resistant cancer cell lines. Multiple HDIs were tested and Trichostatin A (TSA) was found to potently enhance the spread and replication of a tumour selective vaccinia virus in several infection-resistant cancer cell lines. TSA significantly decreased the number of lung metastases in a syngeneic B16F10LacZ lung metastasis model yet did not increase the replication of vaccinia in normal tissues. The combination of TSA and VV increased survival of mice harbouring human HCT116 colon tumour xenografts as compared to mice treated with either agent alone.

We found that TCTP (a) induces Src release from Na,K-ATPase α subunit and Src activation; (b) phosphorylates tyrosine residues 845, 992, 1086, 1148 and 1173 on anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); (c) activates PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase )–AKT, Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK1/2, Rac–PAK1/2, MKK3/6–p38 and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ pathways; (d) enhances NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; (e) stimulates cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility and (f) upregulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 and 13.

Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world with ∼500 million cases each year and one to three million deaths (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The disease has an enormous burden on human health and causes decreased productivity and economic growth and increased poverty (2Sachs J. Malaney P. Nature. 2002; 415: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). The lack of an effective vaccine, the emergence of resistance to first-line drugs such as chloroquine and antifolates and recent reports of clinical cases of reduced susceptibility to artemisinin in Cambodia (reviewed in Ref. 3White N.J. Science. 2008; 320: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), combined with the small number of suitable new drugs against the malaria parasite demonstrate the need to identify potential new targets. The malaria-infected erythrocyte is under constant attack from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These are produced exogenously by the host immune system in response to infection, or endogenously by the generation of redox-active by-products resulting from the high metabolic rates of the multiplying parasite and the degradation of large quantities of hemoglobin (4Becker K. Tilley L. Vennerstrom J.L. Roberts D. Rogerson S. Ginsburg H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The ability of Plasmodium falciparum to protect itself against oxidative damage is thus critical and the parasite possesses multiple biochemical pathways able to mediate antioxidant defense and redox regulation (5Hunt N.H. Stocker R. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 499-526PubMed Google Scholar, 6Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). P. falciparum lacks catalase and a genuine glutathione peroxidase and therefore relies heavily on peroxiredoxins for the reduction of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (7Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7397-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are a family of thiol-dependent peroxidases known to reduce and scavenge hydroperoxides and thus form an important part of the cellular antioxidant machinery. Most peroxiredoxins contain at least one cysteine residue in their active site and because of its ability to react with the peroxide substrate it is referred to as the peroxidatic cysteine. This residue is the defining feature of this class of enzymes also referred to as AhpC-TSA 5The abbreviations used are: AhpCalkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase CTSAthiol-specific antioxidantIFAimmunofluorescence assay. family (8Wood Z.A.

Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar) The reaction results in the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate that is usually reduced by the resolving cysteine present in the 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. The inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond formed can be reduced by thioredoxin, glutaredoxin or glutathione depending on the substrate specificity of the respective peroxiredoxin. For instance, mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxin 1 can only react with thioredoxin and does not accept glutaredoxin or thioredoxin as substrates (9Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. J. Biol.

Apart from their role as antioxidants, the proteins are also known to function as redox sensors in response to oxidative stress. They have also been implicated in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation (11Butterfield L.H. Merino A. Golub S.H. Shau H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 1999; 1: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This functional diversity can be attributed to their structural flexibility, which leads to the association of the dimers to high Mr oligomeric proteins or vice versa, the susceptibility of one of their active site cysteines to hyperoxidation by their peroxide substrates and their high abundance in the cell (12Cox A.G. Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 474: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that the phosphorylation of peroxiredoxins affects their subcellular distribution and enzymatic activity (13Zykova T.A. Zhu F. Vakorina T.I. Zhang J. Higgins L. Urusova D.V. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; Google Scholar). Usually organisms contain more than one peroxiredoxin, which are found in different subcellular locations such as cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and nucleus (8Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). This is also the case for Plasmodium.

P. falciparum also possesses several proteins belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily, which provide reducing equivalents to the peroxiredoxins (reviewed in Ref. 6Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition to the five characterized peroxiredoxins, the malaria parasite possesses an additional protein with a conserved AhpC-TSA domain called MCP1 (merozoite capping protein-1, PF10_0268) (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Hudson-Taylor D.E. Dolan S.A. Klotz F.W. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Koonin E.V. Miller L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MCP1 was described as a cytosolic protein localizing to the invasion tight junction, a zone of tight apposition between the merozoite and the red blood cell membrane formed during the invasion process (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the AhpC-TSA domain of MCP1 is functional (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Hudson-Taylor D.E. Dolan S.A. Klotz F.W. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Koonin E.V. Miller L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, MCP1 has two other defined domains with a negatively charged middle region enriched in glutamate and a C-terminal positively charged section enriched in lysine. It was speculated from the solubility properties of MCP1 and the C-terminal lysine-rich domain that this region may be required for binding to the cytoskeleton within the invading merozoite (21Hudson-Taylor D.E. Dolan S.A. Klotz F.W. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Koonin E.V. Miller L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that MCP1 is a peroxiredoxin with unusual biochemical characteristics. As this enzyme exclusively localizes to the nucleus (in contrast to previous reports) we renamed it PfnPrx (P. falciparum nuclear peroxiredoxin). In addition, we demonstrate that PfnPrx is associated with the chromatin of the parasite in a genome-wide manner, suggesting a potentially essential role in the protection of nuclear DNA against oxidative stress. P. falciparum asexual stage parasites were maintained in human erythrocytes (blood group O+) at a hematocrit of 4% with 0.5% (w/v) AlbumaxTM (Invitrogen) (22Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were originally obtained from David Walliker at Edinburgh University. Cultures were synchronized as described previously (23Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Rabbit and mouse antibodies were generated against PfnPrx1–100, containing the conserved oxidoreductase domain, from a GST fusion protein expressed from a plasmid construct using the following primers: PfnPrxF (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCTCAATTAGCAGAAAATAC-3′) and PfnPrxR (5′-CCGCTCGAGTAAGGAAGTTCTAGCTTTTC-3′. PCR products were digested with BamH1/Xho1 (underlined letters in primers), purified and cloned into the plasmid pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblots, saponin-lysed parasite pellets from highly synchronous 3D7 parasites were separated in sample buffer on 4–12% (w/v) SDS-NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Affinity purified PfnPrx rabbit anti-serum and anti-PfnPrx mouse monoclonal were diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20-phosphate-buffered saline with 1% (w/v) skim milk. Appropriate secondary antibodies were used, and immunoblots were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For the time course of expression analysis, proteins extracted from an equal number of cells were used for each time point. Fluorescence images of parasites were captured using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a PCO Sensicam and Axiovision software (version 2). For immunofluorescence assays of free and/or invading merozoites, highly synchronous schizont stage 3D7 parasites in the process of rupture/reinvasion were smeared and fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C. After blocking in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma), the cells were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate antisera: rabbit anti-PfRON4 (1/200) (24Richard D. Kats L.M. Langer C. Black C.G.

Bound antibodies were then visualized with Alexa Fluor 488/594 anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000. Parasites were mounted in Vectashield (Vecta Laboratories) containing DAPI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Parasites for electron microscopy immunolabeling were fixed and prepared as described previously (26Rug M. Wickham M.E. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was the rabbit anti-PfnPrx. Samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to 15-nm colloidal gold (BB International). Samples were then post-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate then 5% triple lead and observed at 120 kV on a Philips CM120 BioTWIN Transmission Electron Microscope. To create the plasmid used for the integration of GFP at the 3′ end of the nPrx gene by single crossover, a PCR fragment containing exon 3 of nPrx without a stop codon was cloned into the BglII-AvrII sites of the pARL1-GFP vector (27Gilberger T.W. Thompson J.K. Reed M.B. Good R.T. Cowman A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Przyborski J.M. Miller S.K. Pfahler J.M. Henrich P.P. Rohrbach P. Crabb B.S. Lanzer M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2306-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Parasites were transfected, and integrants were selected as described previously (27Gilberger T.W. Thompson J.K. Reed M.B. Good R.T. Cowman A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Integration was monitored by Southern blots according to standard procedures. A PCR fragment containing nucleotides 1 to 492 of PfnPrx was amplified from P. falciparum cDNA and cloned in the BamH1-Xho1 site of the pET-45b expression vector (Novagen). The latter directs expression of the protein with an N-terminal His6 tag to facilitate purification of the recombinant protein. Generation of the nPrxC56S mutant was performed by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit from Agilent Technologies. Induction and purification of His6-nPrx1–164 were performed according to standard procedures. P. falciparum TrxR and PfTrx1 were generated as described (29Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J.

P. falciparum glutaredoxin 1 (PfGrx1, PFC0271c) was amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA and cloned in the BamH1-Xho1 site of the pET-45b expression vector (Novagen). Induction of the protein was performed at 27 °C overnight. The overall antioxidant activity of PfnPrx was estimated by analyzing its ability to protect Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (Sigma) from inactivation by a thiol-metal catalyzed oxidation system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (31Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P. falciparum nPrx kinetic parameters were determined (30Akerman S.E. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using a spectrophotometric assay to determine the initial rates of the peroxidase reaction as described previously for Toxoplasma gondii Trx-Px2 (30Akerman S.E.

For the assays using the thioredoxin system, the reaction mix contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 units of P. falciparum thioredoxin reductase, 2 μm PfnPrx, 200 μm NADPH, varying concentrations of P. falciparum cytosolic thioredoxin PfTrx1 (20–100 μm) at a constant concentration of 20 μm hydrogen peroxide. For assays using the GSH system with P. falciparum Grx1, the reaction mix contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 units glutathione reductase, 1 mm GSH, 2 μm PfnPrx, 200 μm NADPH, varying concentrations of P. falciparum cytosolic glutaredoxin PfGrx1 (1–30 μm) at a constant concentration of 20 μm hydrogen peroxide or varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (1–50 μm) and cumene hydroperoxide (1–100 μm) at a constant concentration of 10 μm PfGrx1. No NADPH oxidation was observed without addition of PfGrx1 indicating that PfnPrx cannot be reduced by GSH itself. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADPH oxidation was determined over 30 s with time points taken every 10 ms. Assays were performed at 25 °C. The linear rates were determined and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graphit (version 5.0; Erithracus). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of nPrx-GFP from formaldehyde cross-linked and sonicated chromatin was performed as described (33Flueck C. Bartfai R. Volz J. Niederwieser I. Salcedo-Amaya A.M. Alako B.T. Ehlgen F. Ralph S.A. Cowman A.F. Bozdech Z. Stunnenberg H.G. Voss T.S. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000569Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using an anti-GFP antibody (AbCam 290). Immunoprecipitated as well as input chromatin was decross-linked at 45 °C in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and tested by quantitative PCR (for primer list, see supplemental Table 1) or used for Illumina sequencing library preparation according to the linear amplification protocol (34Bártfai R. Hoeijmakers W.A. Salcedo-Amaya A.M. Smits A.H. Janssen-Megens E. Kaan A. Treeck M. Gilberger T.W. Françoijs K.J. Stunnenberg H.G. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001223Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Sequencing libraries were loaded on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and sequenced for 36 cycles from one side of the fragments. The quality filtered 35-bp sequence reads were mapped against the P. falciparum genome assembly (PlasmoDB version 6.1) using the standard Illumina pipeline. Coverage plots were generated using uniquely mapped sequence reads by counting the number of overlapping tags in 100-bp windows and visualized in SignalMap (NimbleGen). The ratio track was obtained by dividing the ChIP-seq tag counts with the input tag counts and displayed on a log2 scale. For generation of average gene profile the coding body of all “normal size” genes (1–10 Kb) were divided into 20 equal size windows and five 150-bp windows immediately up- or downstream represented flanking sequences. The ratios of the tag counts in the ChIP versus input data set has been computed in each individual windows and averaged in the corresponding window of all genes. For scatter plot analysis, the ratios of ChIP and input tag counts have been calculated in the coding body of each gene have been plotted against the RNAseq tag density (tag/1000 bp transcript) of an independent 3D7 schizont population (34Bártfai R. Hoeijmakers W.A. Salcedo-Amaya A.M. Smits A.H. Janssen-Megens E. Kaan A. Treeck M. Gilberger T.W. Françoijs K.J. Stunnenberg H.G. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001223Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PfnPrx (MCP1) in the merozoite invasion process, we generated an antibody against the conserved oxidoreductase domain (Fig. 1A) (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blots on schizont stage protein extracts showed a single specific band of ∼55 kDa, which was slightly higher than the predicted 45 kDa (Fig. 1B, 48 h lane) and is in agreement with previous results (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of the other P. falciparum peroxiredoxins having sizes between 22 and 28 kDa, we can be confident that our antibody is not cross-reacting with any of them. We next performed a time course analysis for expression of PfnPrx (MCP1) using parasite protein extracts taken at 8-h intervals throughout the erythrocytic asexual cycle. The PfnPrx (MCP1) protein was present as a single 55 kDa band in all samples analyzed with the highest expression between 32 to 48 h (Fig. 1B) which corresponds to the schizont stage where the parasite undergoes nuclear division and also when proteins involved in merozoite invasion are expressed. This pattern is also in agreement with the RNA expression analyses published previously (35Bozdech Z. Llinás M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D. Zhu J. DeRisi J.L. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of the PfnPrx (MCP1) protein, we performed immunofluorescence assays on parasites from different stages of the erythrocytic cycle. The anti-nPrx (MCP1) monoclonal antibody overlapped almost completely with the DAPI-stained parasite DNA in rings, trophozoites, and schizonts, suggesting that PfnPrx was located in the nucleus (Fig. 2A), a subcellular localization different to that described previously (20Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein sequence with the PredictProtein software (36Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar) also revealed a potential nuclear localization signal in the C terminus of PfnPrx (KKPAKKVVKKK). To analyze the subcellular localization of PfnPrx (MCP1) in more detail, we performed immunofluorescence experiments on merozoites during erythrocyte invasion in which we observed that PfnPrx also localized to the nucleus of the parasite. No anti-PfnPrx (MCP1) signal was found at the tight junction, visualized by staining with an antibody against the RON4 protein, a well characterized marker of this transient structure (25Richard D. MacRaild C.A. Riglar D.T. Chan J.A. Foley M. Baum J. Ralph S.A. Norton R.S. Cowman A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14815-14822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine whether this localization was due to our antibody recognizing a protein other than PfnPrx (MCP1), we engineered a parasite line in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was integrated by single crossover at the 3′ end of the PfnPrx (MCP1) gene leading to the production of a fluorescent PfnPrx (MCP1) (Fig. 3, A and B). Western blot analysis showed that PfnPrx (MCP1) was detected as an 80-kDa protein with both the PfnPrx (MCP1) mouse monoclonal antibody or an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody confirming expression of the chimeric protein and providing additional evidence for the specificity of our mouse monoclonal anti-nPrx antibody (Fig. 3C). To determine the localization of the PfnPrx-GFP fusion, the 3D7 PfnPrx-GFP line was analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3D, the PfnPrx-GFP fluorescence overlaps with the DAPI-stained parasite DNA in rings, trophozoites, and schizonts confirming that nPrx (MCP1) is found in the nucleus of the parasite throughout the blood stage cycle. To determine more precisely the localization of PfnPrx in the nucleus, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on P. falciparum schizont stage sections. PfnPrx localizes predominantly to the more electron dense regions at the nuclear periphery, and this is believed to represent heterochromatin (Fig. 2C) (37Ralph S.A. Scheidig-Benatar C. Scherf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5414-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consequently, because of the nuclear localization and functional data presented below, we renamed this protein PfnPrx (P. falciparum nuclear peroxiredoxin).FIGURE 3Endogenously tagging nPrx confirms its status as a nuclear protein.

X-over; crossover.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PfnPrx possesses an N-terminal conserved AhpC-TSA domain. To investigate its functionality, the N-terminal portion of the protein (amino acids 1–164) was recombinantly expressed and purified (Fig. 4A), and its potential peroxidase activity was assessed using various enzymatic assay systems. Initially, we determined whether the protein protects glutamine synthetase from inactivation by a thiol-metal catalyzed oxidation system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (31Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4.5 μg of the recombinant peroxiredoxin-like domain of PfnPrx rescues glutamine synthetase activity by 50% (Fig. 4B), confirming that the AhpC-TSA domain was catalytically active, therefore suggesting that PfnPrx has antioxidant capacity. The specificity of this catalytic activity was further investigated by exchanging the predicted active site cysteine residue at position 56 by serine, which totally abolished the glutamine synthetase protection activity of the recombinant protein (Figs. 1A and 4B). The fact that the recombinant AhpC-TSA domain of PfnPrx showed the ability to protect glutamine synthetase activity is presumably attributable to its capacity to reduce hydrogen peroxide. This suggests that this part of the protein acts as a peroxidase that might potentially protects nuclear components such as DNA from oxidative insults. To identify its natural reducing substrate, the catalytic activity of PfnPrx was analyzed in the presence of P. falciparum thioredoxin 1, glutathione, and glutaredoxin 1. PfnPrx had the ability to reduce hydrogen peroxide, and this activity increased with increasing concentrations of PfTrx1 without reaching saturation at concentrations as high as 100 μm (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that is most likely not the favored reductant of the enzyme. In addition to the thioredoxin system, P. falciparum possesses a functional glutathione system, and we studied the possibility that it could be involved in the reduction of PfnPrx. No PfnPrx peroxidase activity on hydrogen peroxide was detected when using GSH as a reductant, whereas addition of glutaredoxin 1 (PfGrx1 (15Rahlfs S. Becker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1404-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) to the assay mix supported the reduction of PfnPrx with saturation kinetics (Fig. 4C) and a reasonable reaction rate. At a concentration of 20 μm H2O2, the apparent Km for PfGrx1 was determined to be ∼4 μm, showing that it was an excellent reductant for PfnPrx. When looking at the affinity of PfnPrx for H2O2, an apparent Km of 14 μm was calculated when 10 μm of PfGrx1 was used (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that H2O2 was a good substrate for PfnPrx and corroborating the results obtained with the glutamine synthetase protection assay. In addition, PfnPrx was able to reduce cumene hydroperoxide with an apparent Km of ∼30 μm (Fig. 4E). The specific activity of the recombinant protein was in the range of 6 μmol/min/mg protein, which is low compared with the activity of other Plasmodium peroxiredoxins (16Boucher I.W. McMillan P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2040081530,"Positive and negative regulation of neurotransmitter receptor aggregation on the postsynaptic membrane is a critical event during synapse formation. Acetylcholine (ACh) and agrin are two opposing signals that regulate ACh receptor (AChR) clustering during neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development. ACh induces dispersion of AChR clusters that are not stabilized by agrin via a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-mediated mechanism, but regulation of Cdk5 activation is poorly understood. We found that the intermediate filament protein nestin physically interacts with Cdk5 and is required for ACh-induced association of p35, the co-activator of Cdk5, with the muscle membrane. Blockade of nestin-dependent signaling inhibited ACh-induced Cdk5 activation and the dispersion of AChR clusters in cultured myotubes. Similar to the effects of Cdk5 gene inactivation, knockdown of nestin in agrin-deficient mouse embryos substantially restored AChR clusters. These results suggest that nestin is required for ACh-induced, Cdk5-dependent dispersion of AChR clusters during NMJ development."

Previous studies have demonstrated attenuation of CD4+ T cell activation by minocycline, but a specific mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of minocycline on the activity of three key transcription factors regulating CD4+ T cell activation: NF-κB, AP-1 (activator protein 1), and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T) cells. Our data demonstrate that minocycline selectively impairs NFAT-mediated transcriptional activation, a result of increased phosphorylation and reduced nuclear translocation of the isoform NFAT1. Minocycline increased the activity of the NFAT kinase GSK3 and decreased intracellular Ca2+ flux, both of which facilitate NFAT1 phosphorylation. These findings provide a novel mechanism for minocycline induced suppression of CD4+ T cell activation and may better inform the application of minocycline as an immunomodulatory agent.

The tetracycline family of antibiotics is known to have multiple biological activities distinct from their antimicrobial function.

T cell activation contributes to disease pathogenesis by creating an inflammatory environment that leads to cellular damage and death as well as decreased immune function. Minocycline has been found to be therapeutic in multiple diseases whose pathogenesis is significantly T cell driven by modulating cellular activation and function. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, minocycline significantly improved clinical symptoms and increased the frequency of remissions leading to its usage as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (7Tilley B.C.

Despite numerous studies demonstrating suppressive effects of minocycline on CD4+ T cell activation, a specific mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Classical T lymphocyte activation is characterized by changes in gene expression in response to two signals: 1) an antigen-specific signal through the T cell receptor (TCR) 2The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell receptorERendoplasmic reticulumCRACCa2+ release-activated Ca2+PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateSOCEstore-operated calcium entryGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3. complex when it binds antigen:MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, and 2) a co-stimulatory signal delivered through a molecule such as CD28 binding a B7-family member on the antigen presenting cell surface (17Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). These signals activate diverse signaling pathways, including those mediated by the second messengers calcium (Ca2+) and diacylglycerol. These pathways converge on the activation of three major transcription factor families to modulate gene expression: NF-κB, AP-1 (activator protein 1), and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). To better understand the effects of minocycline in CD4+ T cells, we investigated its impact on the activity of these three transcription factors. Here, we show that minocycline mediates selective suppression of NFAT-mediated transcriptional activation in primary human CD4+ T cells using a luciferase reporter assay. Minocycline increases rephosphorylation of NFAT1 which reduces its nuclear translocation after several hours of activation. Treatment with minocycline enhances the activity of GSK3 and attenuates intracellular [Ca2+] by reducing extracellular Ca2+ influx. These findings demonstrate a novel and specific mechanism of action for minocycline in CD4+ T cells that is critical to understanding its immunomodulatory properties.

Whole blood from healthy human donors was isolated in syringes with heparin. Informed consent was obtained under a Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on Ficoll (GE Healthcare). Purified CD4+ T cells were isolated using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec); purity was routinely >95% CD3+CD4+ by flow cytometry. Cells were cultured in R10 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, HEPES, gentamicin) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. CD4+ T cells (1 × 106) were cultured in 96-well plates and pretreated with minocycline (0–80 μg/ml) for 3 h before activation using either 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma), PMA and 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma), or ionomycin. NFAT and AP-1 luciferase reporters were obtained from Dr. Joel Pomerantz. pNF-κB-luciferase was obtained from Stratagene. CD4+ T cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation with 8 μg reporter plasmid and 200 ng pRL TK Renilla (Promega) using a human T cell Nucleofector kit (Amaxa). After transfection, cells were resuspended in warm R10 and incubated overnight. After pretreatment and activation as above, cells were spun down and washed, and luciferase activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega). Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Marligen Nuclear Extraction kits were used for isolation of nuclei, followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were run on Bio-Rad Criterion 10% Tris-HCl. Antibodies used: NFAT1 (Abcam), GAPDH, transcription factor II B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p38 Thr-180/Tyr-182, p38, GSK3α, GSK3β, phospho-GSK3α/β S21/9 (Cell Signaling). Calcineurin activity was measured following the manufacturer's protocol using Calcineurin Phosphatase Assay (Enzo Life Sciences). Minocycline (20 or 40 μg/ml) was added to some reactions prior to addition of calcineurin and maintained throughout the duration of the assay. CD4+T cells were loaded using Fluo-4 AM direct assay (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocol. After 30 min at 37 °C, aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were diluted to 500 μl in 1x Ca2+ assay buffer (Invitrogen) with or without 40 μg/ml minocycline. Cells were left at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. In some samples, 5 μl of 1 m EGTA (10 mm final) was added immediately before samples were run on a BD LSRFortessa. A 30-s baseline was recorded followed by addition of 5 μl of stimuli and vortexing. Stimuli used were ionomycin (10 nm and 100 nm final) and thapsigargin (100 nm final) in DMSO. Fluorescence was measured in linear mode in FL1 channel, and data were analyzed in Flowjo (Treestar). Upon TCR recognition of antigen or cross-linking the TCR with antibodies, phospholipase C γ is activated leading to phophatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate cleavage into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (17Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate binds to the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store, subsequently activating the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane and raising intracellular Ca2+ levels. This pathway can be triggered with the release of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (18Yoshida S. Plant S. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol activates the Ras MAPK and protein kinase C θ cascades, and these pathways can be specifically activated by the diacylglycerol analog PMA (19Niedel J.E. Kuhn L.J. Vandenbark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). These signals result in changes in gene expression through the activation of three major transcription factor families: NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1. To determine which pathways contributed to the suppressive effect of minocycline on activation, primary human CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase responsive to NF-κB, NFAT, or AP-1, along with a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase under herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were pretreated with minocycline and then stimulated with PMA alone or in combination with ionomycin. After 4 h, the effect of minocycline pretreatment on transcriptional activation was assessed by measuring luciferase activity. Minocycline pretreatment did not significantly impact transcriptional activation mediated by NF-κB or AP-1 when cells were activated by PMA alone or PMA with ionomycin (Fig. 1, A and B). Transcriptional activity of the Ca2+-dependent NFAT was induced only by PMA in combination with ionomycin, and not PMA alone (Fig. 1C). Minocycline significantly decreased NFAT activity stimulated by PMA and ionomycin by ∼5-fold relative to stimulated untreated control (Fig. 1C, untreated mean fluorescence intensity, 19.47 versus treated mean fluorescence intensity, 3.793; p = .0313). The transcriptional activity of NFAT is strictly regulated by phosphorylation (20Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NFAT is maintained in a constitutively phosphorylated state in the cytoplasm. Upon T cell stimulation that initiates a rise in intracellular Ca2+, NFAT is dephosphorylated by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates to the nucleus where it forms homo- or heterodimers to activate gene transcription (21Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). As intracellular Ca2+ returns to resting levels, calcineurin is deactivated, and NFAT kinases rephosphorylate NFAT to facilitate its nuclear export. NFAT1 is the NFAT family member predominantly expressed in primary human CD4+ T cells; this isoform has also been shown to represent the majority of NFAT DNA-binding activity in the first 4 h after activation by PMA and ionomycin (22Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that minocycline impairs NFAT activity by reducing nuclear translocation of NFAT1. Primary human CD4+ T cells were pretreated for 3 h with minocycline (20 or 40 μg/ml) and activated by PMA and ionomycin. Nuclear lysates were isolated for analysis by Western blot. Minocycline pretreatment mediated a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear translocation of NFAT1 relative to untreated, activated controls at both 2 and 4 h post-activation (Fig. 2A). In minocycline-treated samples, the NFAT1 band had a higher apparent molecular mass compared with untreated samples (Fig. 2A). Previous studies have demonstrated that NFAT1 can migrate as a phosphorylated band with apparent molecular mass ∼140 kDa and a dephosphorylated band with mass ∼120 kDa (23Shaw K.T. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because NFAT1 is exported from the nucleus upon phosphorylation, we hypothesized that minocycline-mediated nuclear export of NFAT results from increased phosphorylation of NFAT1. To investigate this possibility, primary human CD4+ T cells were pretreated with minocycline and then activated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. Whole cell lysates were isolated and analyzed by Western blot. Minocycline mediated a dose-dependent shift favoring the higher molecular mass, phosphorylated form of NFAT1 (Fig. 2B). At the highest dose (80 μg/ml), all detectable NFAT1 shifted to its higher molecular mass, a phosphorylated, deactivated form that results in nuclear export. Loh et al. (24Loh C. Carew J.A. Kim J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3945-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that after TCR cross-linking with antibodies, NFAT1 activation progresses through two phases: a rapid, calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation in minutes followed by a gradual, slow deactivation and rephosphorylation taking place over hours. This contrasts with ionomycin-stimulated NFAT1 activation, which persists for several hours with relatively little rephosphorylation. When cells are stimulated with both PMA and ionomycin, early activation of NFAT1 remains unaffected, but late deactivation is facilitated. Because we observed that minocycline mediated a slow decline in nuclear NFAT1 levels over the course of hours, we hypothesized that early activation of NFAT1 was not affected, but rather that minocycline acts by facilitating gradual rephosphorylation and deactivation. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that minocycline did not alter NFAT1 dephosphorylation in whole cell lysates of CD4+ T cells after 1 h of activation by PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2C). Instead, minocycline accelerated the shift to phosphorylated NFAT1. In treated cells, the phosphorylated band appears at 2 and 4 h post-activation, whereas in untreated cells, the phosphorylated form does not appear until 4 h post-activation (Fig. 2C). Cells stimulated with ionomycin alone (Fig. 2D) had much less phosphorylated NFAT1 after 4 h of activation compared with cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2C). Minocycline treatment took relatively longer to elicit NFAT1 deactivation when stimulated by ionomycin alone: only the highest dose (40 μg/ml) resulted in detectable rephosphorylation of NFAT1 after 2 h of activation (Fig. 2D). At 4 h post-activation with ionomycin, a low dose minocycline (20 μg/ml) resulted in incomplete rephosphorylation, whereas a high dose (40 μg/ml) resulted in complete rephosphorylation and deactivation. In contrast, both doses resulted in complete rephosphorylation at 4 h post-activation with PMA and ionomycin. These data support a mechanism for minocycline acting directly on Ca2+ signaling and demonstrates that its effect is synergistic with negative NFAT1 regulation by PMA. The extent of NFAT1 dephosphorylation, and the corresponding length of NFAT1 nuclear residency, is dependent on two opposing forces: dephosphorylation by the phosphatase calcineurin and rephosphorylation by kinases (both constitutive and inducible) that restore and maintain phosphorylation to facilitate NFAT1 export (20Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Multiple immunosuppressive agents target NFAT activation by acting on the phosphatase calcineurin, preventing binding and activation by the Ca2+-dependent protein calmodulin (25Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S40-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the ability of minocycline to suppress T cell proliferation may be related to chelation of Ca2+, but others were unable to demonstrate that minocycline altered intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (10Kloppenburg M. Verweij C.L. Miltenburg A.M. Verhoeven A.J. Daha M.R. Dijkmans B.A. Breedveld F.C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 102: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We utilized an in vitro phosphatase assay to determine whether the effects of minocycline on NFAT dephosphorylation could be explained by direct chelation of available Ca2+ reducing calcineurin activity or a direct interaction between minocycline and calcineurin, thereby inhibiting its activity (Fig. 3A). We found that minocycline (up to 40 μg/ml) did not significantly affect the activity of calcineurin on a phosphopeptide substrate in a cell-free assay. EGTA treatment, a calcium-chelating control, decreased phosphatase activity to below the limit of detection (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the effect of minocycline on NFAT1 cannot be explained by direct chelation of available Ca2+ or direct molecular interaction of calcineurin and minocycline. We hypothesized that minocycline may mediate increased phosphorylation and nuclear export of NFAT1 by increasing the activity of NFAT kinases. NFAT1 can be phosphorylated by p38, an activation-inducible kinase, and GSK3, a constitutive kinase that is inhibited by activation (26Okamura H. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Martinson H. Qin J. Virshup D.M. Rao A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4184-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Gómez del Arco P. Martínez-Martínez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Pérez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After activation with PMA and ionomycin, p38 is activated by phosphorylation; it has been shown that NFAT1 is a p38 substrate, and activation-induced p38 has been hypothesized to be a negative regulator of NFAT1 (27Gómez del Arco P. Martínez-Martínez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Pérez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At 1 h post-activation, minocycline pretreatment did not alter p38 activation; by 2 and 4 h post-activation, minocycline decreased p38 activation (Fig. 3B). This indicates that minocycline does not mediate increased NFAT1 phosphorylation through p38 activation. GSK3 is a constitutively active kinase that assists in keeping NFAT1 deactivated in resting cells (26Okamura H. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Martinson H. Qin J. Virshup D.M. Rao A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4184-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Gwack Y. Sharma S. Nardone J. Tanasa B. Iuga A. Srikanth S. Okamura H. Bolton D. Feske S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Upon activation of CD4+ T cells, GSK3 isoforms are inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of serine residues (29Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Minocycline treatment did not affect inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 at 1 or 2 h post activation (Fig. 3B). However, by 4 h, post-activation minocycline treatment reduced the level of phosphorylated GSK3α and -β, suggesting that minocycline treatment may enhance NFAT1 rephosphorylation through increased GSK3 activity. Although this observation suggests one potential mechanism for minocycline-mediated increases in NFAT1 phosphorylation at 4 h post-activation, this does not explain increased NFAT1 phosphorylation at 2 h post-activation. NFAT is known to be a sensitive integrator of Ca2+ signaling in T lymphocytes. Intracellular Ca2+ responds to strong stimulation or artificial store depletion in a biphasic manner; the first, peak phase consists of a transient rise in concentration representing the rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (specifically the ER) followed by a second, plateau phase of extracellular Ca2+ influx through STIM1-mediated activation of store-operated CRAC/Orai1 channels at the plasma membrane, sometimes termed capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (30Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Rao A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 491-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that NFAT-driven gene expression requires 1) intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at or above 3-fold resting levels and 2) sustaining elevated Ca2+ for a minimum of 25 min, optimally ∼2 h (31Negulescu P.A. Shastri N. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of NF-kB is dependent on the initial rapid Ca2+ transient from intracellular store release, not sustained Ca2+ (33Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 34Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). In light of our data showing that 1) minocycline does not inhibit early activation of NFAT1, 2) minocycline does not reduce transcriptional activity of NF-κB, and 3) the direct chelation of minocycline of Ca2+ does not affect calcineurin activity, we hypothesized that minocycline acts by suppressing SOCE in CD4+ T cells. We utilized the intracellular Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-4 to measure the effect of minocycline on intracellular Ca2+ flux induced by ionomycin. It has been previously reported that concentrations of ionomycin <100 nm are sufficient to release the majority of intracellular Ca2+ stores without significantly permeabilizing the plasma membrane to Ca2+ entry (35Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ flux initiated by 100 nm ionomycin generates the expected biphasic response consisting of a fast peak followed by a slowly decaying plateau phase, and minocycline treatment reduces peak and plateau levels of Ca2+ in response to ionomycin (Fig. 4A, solid versus dashed black traces). Similar effects are seen on Ca2+ flux initiated by 10 nm ionomycin (Fig. 4A, solid versus dashed blue traces). In the presence of EGTA, extracellular Ca2+ is chelated, enabling analysis of Ca2+ flux released from intracellular stores. Stimulating with 10 nm ionomycin in the presence of EGTA, intracellular Ca2+ peak and plateau are both suppressed, and minocycline treatment has no effect on them (Fig. 4A, solid versus dashed red traces). In the presence of EGTA, peak Ca2+ is reached earlier (t ∼ 75s) followed by the slowly decaying plateau phase. This indicates that the portion of the ionomycin-induced Ca2+ response after this time requires extracellular Ca2+. These data strongly suggest that minocycline acts at the level of SOCE through the plasma membrane and not by reducing the release of Ca2+ stores or their Ca2+ content. Intracellular Ca2+ levels during SOCE are determined by rates of influx through plasma membrane CRAC channels, efflux across the plasma membrane via plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and reuptake into the ER and mitochondria by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, respectively. We utilized the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor thapsigargin to irreversibly empty ER stores and determine whether minocycline decreases intracellular Ca2+ levels by enhancing Ca2+ reuptake (36Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with 100 nm thapsigargin, intracellular Ca2+ levels"
https://openalex.org/W2014338584,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) plays a central role in regulating intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and myocardial contractility. Several studies show that improving Ca(2+) handling in hypertrophied rodent hearts by increasing SERCA activity results in enhanced contractile function. This suggests that SERCA is a potential target for gene therapy in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. However, it raises the issue of increased energy cost resulting from a higher ATPase activity. In this study, we determined whether SERCA overexpression alters the energy cost of increasing myocardial contraction in mouse hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy using (31)P NMR spectroscopy. We isolated and perfused mouse hearts from wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing the cardiac isoform of SERCA (SERCA2a) 8 weeks after ascending aortic constriction (left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)) or sham operation. We found that overexpressing SERCA2a enhances myocardial contraction and relaxation in normal mouse hearts during inotropic stimulation with isoproterenol. Energy consumption was proportionate to the increase in contractile function. Thus, increasing SERCA2a expression in the normal heart allows an enhanced inotropic response with no compromise in energy supply and demand. However, this advantage was not sustained in LVH hearts in which the energetic status was compromised. Although the overexpression of SERCA2a prevented the down-regulation of SERCA protein in LVH hearts, TG-LVH hearts showed no increase in inotropic response when compared with WT-LVH hearts. Our results suggest that energy supply may be a limiting factor for the benefit of SERCA overexpression in hypertrophied hearts. Thus, strategies combining energetic support with increasing SERCA activity may improve the therapeutic effectiveness for heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2048346753,"Chronic exposure to elevated levels of glucose and fatty acids leads to dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells by mechanisms that are only partly understood. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is an important regulator of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and has been shown to protect against lipid-induced β-cell dysfunction. We and others have previously shown that expression of the PPARα gene in β-cells is rapidly repressed by glucose. Here we show that the PPARα gene is transcribed from five alternative transcription start sites, resulting in three alternative first exons that are spliced to exon 2. Expression of all PPARα transcripts is repressed by glucose both in insulinoma cells and in isolated pancreatic islets. The observation that the dynamics of glucose repression of PPARα transcription are very similar to those of glucose activation of target genes by the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) prompted us to investigate the potential role of ChREBP in the regulation of PPARα expression. We show that a constitutively active ChREBP lacking the N-terminal domain efficiently represses PPARα expression in insulinoma cells and in rodent and human islets. In addition, we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated knockdown of ChREBP abrogates glucose repression of PPARα expression as well as induction of well established ChREBP target genes in insulinoma cells. In conclusion, this work shows that ChREBP is a critical and direct mediator of glucose repression of PPARα gene expression in pancreatic β-cells, suggesting that ChREBP may be important for glucose suppression of the fatty acid oxidation capacity of β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980762494,"Actin-related proteins (Arps) are a highly conserved family of proteins that have extensive sequence and structural similarity to actin. All characterized Arps are components of large multimeric complexes associated with chromatin or the cytoskeleton. In addition, the human genome encodes five conserved but largely uncharacterized ""orphan"" Arps, which appear to be mostly testis-specific. Here we show that Arp7A, which has 43% sequence identity with β-actin, forms a complex with the cytoskeletal proteins Tes and Mena in the subacrosomal layer of round spermatids. The N-terminal 65-residue extension to the actin-like fold of Arp7A interacts directly with Tes. The crystal structure of the 1-65(Arp7A)·LIM2-3(Tes)·EVH1(Mena) complex reveals that residues 28-49 of Arp7A contact the LIM2-3 domains of Tes. Two alanine residues from Arp7A that occupy equivalent apolar pockets in both LIM domains as well as an intervening GPAK linker that binds the LIM2-3 junction are critical for the Arp7A-Tes interaction. Equivalent occupied apolar pockets are also seen in the tandem LIM domain structures of LMO4 and Lhx3 bound to unrelated ligands. Our results indicate that apolar pocket interactions are a common feature of tandem LIM domain interactions, but ligand specificity is principally determined by the linker sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2043580764,"We characterized the effect of histone acetylation on the structure of a nucleosome and the interactions between two nucleosomes. In this study, nucleosomes reconstituted with the Selex “Widom 601” sequence were acetylated with the Piccolo NuA4 complex, which acetylates mainly H4 N-terminal tail lysine residues and some H2A/H3 N-terminal tail lysine residues. Upon the acetylation, we observed directional unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA that accompanies topology change of the DNA. Interactions between two nucleosomes in solution were also monitored to discover multiple transient dinucleosomal states that can be categorized to short-lived and long-lived (∼1 s) states. The formation of dinucleosomes is strongly Mg2+-dependent, and unacetylated nucleosomes favor the formation of long-lived dinucleosomes 4-fold as much as the acetylated ones. These results suggest that the acetylation of histones by Piccolo NuA4 disturbs not only the structure of a nucleosome but also the interactions between two nucleosomes.

A nucleosome core particle comprising ∼147-bp DNA wrapped in ∼1.65 superhelical turns around a histone octamer core is the basic subunit of chromatin (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Individual nucleosome core particles are connected to its neighbors through a ∼10–50-bp linker DNA fragment forming beads-on-a-string nucleosomal arrays, which fold into 30-nm-thick fibers and can oligomerize to form extensively condensed chromatin (2Robinson P.J.

U.S.A. 1976; 73: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the structure and structural dynamics of nucleosomes and chromatin are tied to gene regulation. A core histone octamer is composed of two H2A-H2B dimers and a (H3-H4)2 tetramer. Histones are targets for several post-translational modifications that are linked to various gene regulatory activities (4Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Most of these modifications are found on the unstructured tail regions of histones that account for ∼28% of an octamer core and are extremely basic because of the high content of lysine and arginine residues (7Luger K.

The N-terminal tails of histones are of particular interest because they may be in contact with DNA as well as with other histones across nucleosomes and consequently contribute to nucleosome packaging in chromatin (8Arya G. Schlick T. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2009; 113: 4045-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Bertin A. Renouard M. Pedersen J.S. Livolant F. Durand D. Biophys.

Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). All four histone tails contain highly conserved lysine residues serving as targets for various histone acetyltransferases, which transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the nitrogen atom of the amine group in a lysine residue (11Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 12Hansen J.C. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. Stargell L.A. J. Cell Physiol. 2010; 224: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Piccolo NuA4 is a subcomplex of nucleosome acetyltransferases of H4, which is the only histone acetyltransferase required for cell viability in yeast (13Boudreault A.A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R.T. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The role of H4 acetylation has been under extensive study, and the prevailing consensus is that it is involved in gene activation mechanisms (14Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 15Pogo B.G. Allfrey V.G. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

NuA4 is also linked to transcription regulation and DNA damage repair and likely responsible for the global acetylation of H4 in yeast (17Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Selleck W. Fortin I. Sermwittayawong D. Côté J. Tan S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 5535-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Piccolo NuA4 complex consists of three subunits, Epl1, Yng2, and Esa1, and acetylates all four lysine residues of H4 N-terminal tail and one lysine residues of H2A and H3 tails in both naked histones and nucleosomes (17Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Kan P.Y. Caterino T.L. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A mutagenesis study has found that all four lysine residues in the H4 tail are involved in maintaining the genome integrity (20Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Smith M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, acetylation of H4 tails on newly synthesized histone H4 is conserved between Drosophila and humans (21Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays an important role in nucleosome assembly during replication. Acetylation of some H4 tail residues is associated with the regulation of chromatin structure. In particular, most of the genome in budding yeast showed decondensed chromatin state with over 80% of H4K16 acetylated (22Suka N. Luo K. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 23Durrin L.K. Mann R.K. Kayne P.S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1023-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and acetylation of H4K16 led to the disruption of H4 tail-mediated oligomerization of nucleosomes in vitro (9Bertin A. Renouard M. Pedersen J.S. Livolant F. Durand D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2633-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Robinson P.J. An W. Routh A. Martino F. Chapman L. Roeder R.G. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the H4 tail is involved in internucleosomal interactions that can control the chromatin structure and eventually regulate the activity of genes. There are two predominant hypotheses for the mechanism of gene activation by histone acetylation (25Choi J.K. Howe L.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). First, acetylated residues serve as binding sites for regulatory proteins including histone chaperones, chromatin modification enzymes, and transcriptional regulatory proteins (12Hansen J.C. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. Stargell L.A. J. Cell Physiol. 2010; 224: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Cosgrove M.S. Wolberger C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Second, histone acetylation alters the structure and/or structural dynamics of nucleosomes and/or chromatin, resulting in increased DNA accessibility (12Hansen J.C. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. Stargell L.A. J. Cell Physiol. 2010; 224: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 28Anderson J.D. Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the proposed mechanisms to explain the structural changes induced by histone acetylation implicates the reduction of DNA-histone contacts by neutralizing the positive charges on histones upon acetylation of the lysine residues. Although multiple studies have reported that histone acetylation induces small changes in the structure of nucleosomes based on ensemble-averaging measurements, the nature of the structural changes has never been clearly addressed. The basic N-terminal tails of histone H4 (residues 14–19) from one nucleosome interact with acidic patches of another nucleosome mainly on the H2A (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar, 10Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19Kan P.Y. Caterino T.L. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Sinha D. Shogren-Knaak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16572-16581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that acetylation of H4 tails will have an impact on internucleosomal interactions between two nucleosomes and consequently on the structure of chromatin. There are several models proposed for the structure of chromatin that can be categorized into two groups: one-start helices and two-start helices (30Staynov D.Z. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Tremethick D.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In both groups of models, interactions between two nucleosomes are the starting points of nucleosome packaging in chromatin. Thus, studying the interactions between two nucleosomes with and without H4 acetylation is an essential step toward the understanding of chromatin structure and changes in chromatin structure upon H4 acetylation. Mapping of internucleosomal protein-DNA interactions in dinucleosomes using a photoactivated cross-linker has been reported by Zheng and Hayes (32Zheng C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24217-24224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the dynamics of interactions between two nucleosomes or the effect of histone acetylation on the dynamics of internucleosomal interactions has never been reported to date. This deficiency is largely due to the difficulty associated with constructing an experimental system with which one can monitor the dynamic and transient dinucleosomal states in solution. In this article, we report the effect of histone acetylation by the Piccolo NuA4 complex on (i) the structure of nucleosomes and (ii) the dynamic interactions between two nucleosomes using single molecule FRET and ensemble fluorescence anisotropy. We also propose a structural model for a dinucleosomal state in solution. Our results make a unique and valuable contribution to the understanding of the structure and structural dynamics of chromatin and how they are altered by histone acetylation. A fluorescently labeled 147-bp dsDNA fragment with an additional 10-base linker sequence was generated by ligation using T4 DNA ligase. Several pieces of oligonucleotides (36–78-mer) were designed to contain biotin and Cy3 or Cy5 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coraville, IA) near the 5′ terminus. The oligonucleotides were annealed to dsDNA by heating and cooling down from 95 to 5 °C for 18 min followed by purification using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The annealed dsDNA is treated with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) for 16 h at 16 °C. The ligated 147-bp DNA fragment after purification with a PCR purification kit was used to assemble nucleosomes. A control 147-bp DNA fragment was prepared by enzyme digestion of a plasmid containing a Widom 601 sequence with EcoRV restriction sites at both ends (Integrated DNA Technologies) (supplemental materials). The restriction product 147-bp control DNA was purified before use. For DNA denaturing gel electrophoresis, DNAs were denatured in 7 m urea for 2 min at 90 °C and subsequently loaded on a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× TBE buffer. DNAs were run on the gel for 60 min at 100 V. His6-yeast NAP1 histone chaperone (yNAP1) was expressed and purified by nickel affinity as described in Ref. 33Tóth K.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, and Xenopus laevis histone octamer core particles were provided by Dr. Song Tan (Penn State University). Histone octamers and yNAP1 were incubated at 30 °C for 4 h before adding labeled DNA fragment and incubating them for an additional 4 h at 30 °C. The reactions were analyzed with 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer. The Piccolo NuA4 complex composed of Esa1, Yng2, and Epl1 was coexpressed and purified using the polycistronic expression system developed by Tan et al. (34Tan S. Kern R.C. Selleck W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 40: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, the complex was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS grown in LB medium to A600 = 0.7. The expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and purified with a nickel affinity column in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm imidazole. Further purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol to remove excess imidazole. The activity of the purified Piccolo NuA4 complex in the presence of radioactively labeled acetyl-CoA and histone octamers was confirmed using a filter binding assay as described (35Berndsen C.E. Denu J.M. Methods. 2005; 36: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assays were performed either in 1× TBA (50 mm Tris, 50 mm Bis-Tris, and 100 mm sodium acetate) at pH 7.0 or in the imaging buffer, which is used for single molecule measurements of nucleosome structure (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 3% glycerol). Both reactions contained 0.1–0.4 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA, 0.5 μm of Piccolo NuA4, and 1 μg of histone octamers and displayed the same level of activity as previously reported. To observe the acetylation effect on the structure of nucleosomes, purified Piccolo NuA4 complexes were incubated (0.5 μm) with the surface immobilized nucleosomes for 30 min in the imaging buffer supplemented with 0.5 μm acetyl-CoA. On the other hand, to prepare the acetylated histones to reconstitute acetylated nucleosomes, 20 μg of histone octamers were acetylated with 5 μm of Piccolo NuA4 in 1× TBA buffer in the presence of 10 μm acetyl-CoA for 30 min incubation at 30 °C to be tetra-acetylated on H4 and mono-acetylated on either H3 or H2A as previously reported (17Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This mixture was then loaded on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washed twice with the same buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The acetylated histones were eluted with 2 m NaCl. We repeated the acetylation with [3H]acetyl-CoA instead of unlabeled acetyl-CoA and confirmed that eluted histones were acetylated based on the radioactive filter binding assay. The acetylated histones eluted with 2 m NaCl were diluted to 250 mm NaCl and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon filter; Millipore) at 7500 × g for 80 min at 4 °C. The reconstituted 601A or 601B nucleosomes (∼40 nm) were incubated with or without Piccolo NuA4 complex (0.4 μm) and acetyl-CoA(4 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 3% glycerol. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured at excitation/emission 532 nm/570 nm for Cy3, 600/670 for Cy5, and 532/670 for Cy5 excited via FRET using a commercial fluorimeter (Fluoromax4; Horiba). The anisotropy r = (IVV − GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH) was calculated from the parallel IVV and perpendicular IVH polarized fluorescence intensities with the correction factor G for the setup. The surface of a quartz microscope slide was silanized and subsequently coated with PEG (Laysan Bio, Arab, AL). One of 100 PEG molecules is biotinylated (Laysan Bio). We passivated the surface with BSA before immobilizing nucleosomes on the surface via streptavidin-biotin conjugation. To observe the acetylation effect on the structure of nucleosomes, FRET donor (Cy3)- and acceptor (Cy5)-labeled nucleosomes were immobilized on a surface-treated slide through streptavidin-biotin conjugation followed by incubation with purified Piccolo NuA4 complexes (0.5 μm) for 30 min in the imaging buffer, and 0.5 μm acetyl-CoA. To observe nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, Cy3-labeled nucleosomes (601C; see Fig. 5A) were immobilized on a surface-treated slide, and Cy5-labeled nucleosomes (601D or 601E; see Fig. 5, B and C) were injected onto the slide. To prevent Cy5-labeled nucleosomes from binding on the surface, we fully blocked biotin-binding sites of the streptavidin by incubating excess biotin on the surface before injecting Cy5-labeled nucleosomes. The fluorescence signals were taken within 1 h after nucleosome immobilization to avoid unfolding of nucleosomes. A protocatechuate dioxygenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and protocatechuic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) mixture in addition to Trolox (2 mm) was used to elongate the dye photobleaching lifetime and stabilize the emission. Fluorescence signals from single Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores were imaged on an electron multiplying CCD camera (EMCCD, iXon+897; Andor Technology, Belfast UK) in a prism coupled total internal reflection geometry based on a commercial microscope (TE2000; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with modifications. The excitation of the FRET donor Cy3 was achieved with a laser beam at 532 nm (Laser Quantum) that is perpendicularly polarized along the total internal reflection incidence. Fluorescence emission from FRET pairs (Cy3 and Cy5) were spectrally separated into two regions (550–645 and 645–750 nm) with a dichroic mirror, and the two spectrally separated images of Cy3 and Cy5 at single nucleosomes were projected on a single EMCCD chip to simultaneously collect fluorescence signals from the two fluorophores in a time-resolved manner by recording a series of fluorescence images at a frame rate of 135 ms (i.e. a movie in which each frame is a fluorescence image with 35 ms of signal integration time). The intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence at a given time point are the brightness of the corresponding pixels on the movie frame at the time point. The time series of fluorescence intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 were obtained from the series of fluorescence images contained in a movie and were plotted against the elapsed time (see Fig. 6A). FRET efficiency at each time point was calculated with a formula, Icy5/(Icy3 + Icy5). To construct the FRET efficiency distribution histogram of a FRET state, we manually selected regions in the FRET time traces that show non-zero FRET efficiencies as carefully as possible. The FRET efficiency values in the selected regions were combined together to build a histogram that shows the distribution of FRET efficiency values. To construct the lifetime histogram of a FRET state (a dinucleosomal state), we manually selected regions in a FRET time trace that represent a dinucleosomal state. We measured the durations of each selected region and counted one selected region as one event with the measured duration. These events with their measured durations were constructed as the lifetime histogram of a dinucleosomal state. A 147-bp DNA fragment was labeled with a FRET pair: a Cy3 (donor fluorophore) around where the DNA contacts H2A/H2B and a Cy5 (acceptor fluorophore) around where the DNA contacts H3/H4. The two dyes are 65–83 bp apart within the DNA fragment. We designed two nucleosomal DNA fragments based on the Widom 601 sequence: 601A DNA fragment labeled at the 60th and 22th bases from each termini, respectively, and 601B DNA fragment labeled at the 53th and 11th bases from each termini, respectively (Fig. 1). Based on a crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1AOI), their intrinsic FRET efficiencies are approximately in the range of 0.5–0.7, which is appropriate for detecting DNA motion. To construct the nucleosomal DNA, we ligated several 40–80 base oligonucleotides, two of which are labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (Integrated DNA Technologies). The ligation was confirmed with denaturing DNA-PAGE (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows one major single-stranded DNA for the ligated DNAs and the control DNA (lanes 2–4). Multiple major bands were observed for the annealed but unligated DNA (lane 1). Some of the single-stranded DNAs in the ligated DNAs and the control DNA were renatured during electrophoresis because the running buffer did not contain urea. The double band for the dsDNA region of the control DNA (lane 4) might be due to two different conformations of dsDNA created during the renaturation process in the gel. The slightly slow migration of ligated DNAs as compared with the control DNA is due to the extra 10 oligonucleotides at the end and the fluorophores attached to the DNAs. The ligation products were purified with a PCR purification kit before nucleosome reconstitution. The purified DNA ligation products were reconstituted into nucleosomes using yNAP1 histone chaperone and analyzed in a 5% native-PAGE (Fig. 3) (36Choy J.S. Wei S. Lee J.Y. Tan S. Chu S. Lee T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 1782-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes containing the 147-bp DNA displayed one major band, some minor amounts of higher molecular weight species, and free DNAs. The existence of only one major band indicates no significant positioning heterogeneity. Free DNA without histones does not yield any FRET because the distance between Cy3 and Cy5 is longer than 10 nm for each DNA construct. To filter out signal from oligomer nucleosomes, we analyzed data only from nucleosomes with single photobleaching steps of the two fluorophores (i.e. Cy3 and Cy5). A single photobleaching step in a fluorescence intensity time trace is a signature of a single fluorophore. Similar intensities of the major bands were observed for both constructs, indicating that the reconstitution efficiencies in the two sequences were similar. Fig. 4 (A and C) shows the FRET efficiency distributions of the two nucleosomes (601A and 601B). Consistent with the native PAGE analysis, both 601A and 601B nucleosomes showed one major intrinsic FRET state, whose average FRET efficiency is 0.69 and 0.55 for 601A and 601B, respectively. We observed some other minor FRET states whose FRET efficiencies are far from the major FRET state. These minor states may represent noncanonical nucleosomal states or nonstandard translational settings. Data from these populations and data with a low signal-to-noise ratio (lower than 5.0) were excluded from the analysis. To examine whether histone acetylation by Piccolo NuA4 modulates the nucleosome structure, nucleosomes were acetylated by incubating the nucleosomes with the Piccolo NuA4 complex in the presence of acetyl-CoA for 30 min. The efficiency of acetylation reaction was verified separately by an independent radioactivity assay (35Berndsen C.E. Denu J.M. Methods. 2005; 36: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After the acetylation, the FRET efficiency of 601A decreased from 0.69 to 0.65, whereas the FRET efficiency of 601B increased from 0.55 to 0.58. There are two possible scenarios to account for these FRET changes. The first is directional unwrapping of DNA without changes in DNA topology, and the second scenario is partial detachment of DNA from the histone core that likely accompanies DNA unwrapping and/or DNA topology changes. A major difference between the two scenarios is the change in DNA topology. The first scenario does not yield any changes in the DNA topology, whereas the second scenario does. Any topology changes of DNA would be seen as the relative dipole orientation changes of the FRET pair in our system. This is because the cyanine dyes in our system do not rotate freely (experimental justification is following) and consequently maintain a fixed dipole orientation with respect to DNA. To monitor the dipole orientation of the fluorophores, we measured fluorescence anisotropy values of Cy3 and Cy5 in 601A and 601B nucleosomes before and after the acetylation. The results are listed in Table 1. Cy3 and Cy5 in 601A or 601B showed much higher anisotropy than free dyes, and their anisotropy values are close to the maximum possible value 0.4, both of which strongly suggest that the dyes do not rotate on DNA and maintain fixed dipole orientation to the DNA (more discussion in supplemental materials). The anisotropy of Cy3 or Cy5 in 601A or 601B does not change upon the acetylation within the precision of our measurements. However, acetylated 601A nucleosomes displayed decreased anisotropy of Cy5 excited via FRET compared with the control 601A nucleosomes, which are unacetylated nucleosomes or nucleosomes treated with Piccolo NuA4 in the absence of acetyl-CoA (CTL-NUC and CTL-PCL). Based on the anisotropy change, the change in the angle between Cy3 and Cy5 dipoles upon the acetylation was calculated to be 4.6° (42.4–37.8 = 4.6; Table 1 and supplemental materials for the detailed explanation and calculation procedure). This result indicates that the acetylation induces a change in the DNA topology such as DNA twist or writhe. The relative dipole orientation of Cy3 and Cy5 with each other (β in Table 1) is related to the orientation factor κ2 in FRET. Taking this factor into account, we can calculate how much FRET change we can expect solely from the DNA topology change induced by the acetylation (detailed calculation procedure in supplemental materials). By comparing the observed FRET change to the calculated FRET change induced by DNA topology change, we can deduce whether the observed FRET change is solely from DNA topology change or whether it also includes effect of FRET distance change that can be attributed to DNA unwrapping. Because we have too many unknown parameters to calculate the absolute distances between FRET pairs, we calculated only the ratio between FRET distances (r1/r2) in the 601A nucleosomes before (r1) and after (r2) acetylation. As shown in Table 2, r1/r2 for 601A was below 1, indicating that the distance between Cy3 and Cy5 increased upon the acetylation. This change suggests DNA unwrapping upon the acetylation.TABLE 1Fluorescence anisotropy of Cy3 and Cy5 labeled at the 601A and 601B nucleosomesEx/Em601A601B532/570 (Cy3)600/670 (Cy5)532/670 (Cy5 via FRET)β532/570 (Cy3)600/670 (Cy5)532/670 (Cy5 via FRET)βFree0.200 ± 0.0030.130 ± 0.0040.200 ± 0.0030.130 ± 0.004CTL-NUC0.314 ± 0.0110.329 ± 0.0090.140 ± 0.01137.8 ± 1.00.338 ± 0.0100.328 ± 0.0150.078 ± 0.00845.7 ± 0.5CTL-PCL0.321 ± 0.0080.343 ± 0.0130.144 ± 0.01137.9 ± 1.00.337 ± 0.0140.337 ± 0.0130.078 ± 0.01145.7 ± 0.9PCL0.319 ± 0.0100.347 ± 0.0120.105 ± 0.01042.4 ± 0.90.347 ± 0.0150.331 ± 0.0140.078 ± 0.01245.8 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2FRET efficiencies of acetylated and unacetylated nucleosomes and the FRET distance ratio (r1/r2) of unacetylated nucleosomes (r1) to acetylated nucleosomes (r2)E2E1E2 − E1r1/r2601A0.65 ± 0.0010.69 ± 0.001−0.04 ± 0.0010.992 ± 0.006601B0.58 ± 0.0010.55 ± 0.0010.03 ± 0.0011.021 ± 0.007 Open table in a new tab These results suggest partial detachment of DNA from histones through unwinding that results in DNA unwrapping and DNA topology change.

Glycine increased current and significantly increased fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner. The GlyR Cl(-) channel antagonist strychnine significantly blocked the effects of glycine on potentiometric fluorescence in ASM cells. Guinea pig airway ring relaxation of ACh-induced contractions by isoproterenol was significantly left-shifted in the presence of glycine. This effect of glycine was blocked by pretreatment with the GlyR Cl(-) channel antagonist strychnine. Glycine treatment during tachykinin- and acetylcholine-induced contractions significantly decreased the maintenance of muscle force compared to control.

We found previously that pretreatment of human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) with SABA impaired subsequent β(2)-agonist-induced bronchodilation, which occurred independently of changes in receptor quantities. Here we provide evidence that prolonged exposure of cultured human airway smooth muscle (HuASM) cells to β(2)-agonists directly augments procontractile signaling pathways elicited by several compounds including thrombin, bradykinin, and histamine. Such treatment did not increase surface receptor amounts or expression of G proteins and downstream effectors (phospholipase Cβ and myosin light chain). In contrast, β-agonists decreased expression of regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5), which is an inhibitor of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. RGS5 knockdown in HuASM increased agonist-evoked intracellular calcium flux and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which are prerequisites for contraction. PCLS from Rgs5(-/-) mice contracted more to carbachol than those from WT mice, indicating that RGS5 negatively regulates bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Repetitive β(2)-agonist use may not only lead to reduced bronchoprotection but also to sensitization of excitation-contraction signaling pathways as a result of reduced RGS5 expression."

The 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), which is an essential enzyme in the isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis pathway, catalyzes ATP-dependent phosphorylation of 4-diphospho-cytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME) to 4-diphos-phocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate and plays a crucial role in M. tuberculosis survival. Therefore, IspE is characterized as an attractive and potential target for antimicrobial drug discovery. However, no experimental structure of M. tuberculosis IspE has been reported, which has hindered our understanding of its structural details and mechanism of action. Here, we report the expression and purification of fully active full-length M. tuberculosis IspE and solve the high-resolution crystal structures of IspE alone and in complex with either the substrate CDP-ME or nonhydrolyzable ATP analog or ADP. The structures present a characteristic galactose/homoserine/mevalonate/phosphomevalonate kinase superfamily α/β-fold with a catalytic center located in a cleft between 2 domains and display clear substrate and ATP binding pockets. Our results also indicate distinct differences in ligand binding of M. tuberculosis IspE with other reported IspEs.

By using a novel thiazolidinedione-derived ERMA, CG-12 (Wei, S., Kulp, S. K., and Chen, C. S. (2010) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 285, 9780–9791), <i>vis-à-vis</i> 2-deoxyglucose and glucose deprivation, we obtain evidence that epigenetic activation of the tumor suppressor gene Kruppel-like factor 6 (<i>KLF6</i>) plays a role in ERMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. KLF6 regulates the expression of many proapoptotic genes, and shRNA-mediated KLF6 knockdown abrogated the ability of ERMAs to induce apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that this <i>KLF6</i> transcriptional activation was associated with increased histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation occupancy at the promoter region. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the enhancing effect of ERMAs on these active histone marks was mediated through transcriptional repression of histone deacetylases and H3 lysine 4 demethylases by down-regulating Sp1 expression. First, putative Sp1-binding elements are present in the promoters of the affected histone-modifying enzymes, and luciferase reporter assays indicate that site-directed mutagenesis of these Sp1 binding sites significantly diminished the promoter activities. Second, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp1 mimicked the repressive effect of energy restriction on these histone-modifying enzymes. Third, ectopic Sp1 expression protected cells from the repressive effect of CG-12 on these histone-modifying enzymes, thereby abolishing the activation of KLF6 expression. Together, these findings underscore the intricate relationship between energy restriction and epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor gene expression, which has therapeutic relevance to foster novel strategies for prostate cancer therapy."

However, imatinib-resistant patients already harboring mutations have a higher likelihood of developing further mutations under the selective pressure of potent ABL TKIs. NVP-AUY922 (Novartis) is a novel 4,5-diaryloxazole adenosine triphosphate-binding site heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor, which has been shown to inhibit the chaperone function of HSP90 and deplete the levels of HSP90 client protein including BCR–ABL. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of AUY922 and nilotinib on random mutagenesis for BCR–ABL mutation (Blood, 109; 5011, 2007). Compared with single agents, combination with AUY922 and nilotinib was more effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant cell clones. No outgrowth was observed in the presence of 2 μM of nilotinib and 20 nM of AUY922. The observed data from the isobologram indicated the synergistic effect of simultaneous exposure to AUY922 and nilotinib even in BaF3 cells expressing BCR–ABL mutants including T315I. In vivo studies also demonstrated that the combination of AUY922 and nilotinib prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with mixture of BaF3 cells expressing wild-type BCR–ABL and mutant forms. Taken together, this study shows that the combination of AUY922 and nilotinib exhibits a desirable therapeutic index that can reduce the in vivo growth of mutant forms of BCR–ABL-expressing cells."

During acute infection and inflammation, PMN sense chemoattractant signals and swiftly migrate across the microvasculature and underlying tissues to accumulate at inflammatory foci, where these cells execute forceful antimicrobial and tissue-damaging functions. Therefore, the timely and precise response of PMN constitutes an essential first line defense against invading microbials. On the other hand, PMN-mediated inflammation is also a central component of many pathophysiological processes and diseases in which dysregulated PMN transmigration and activation often result in severe tissue injuries and organ dysfunction (1Kobayashi S.D. Voyich J.M. DeLeo F.R. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Butterfield T.A. Best T.M. Merrick M.A. J. Athl. Train. 2006; 41: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar).Different from most of other cell types, PMN contain a highly granular cytoplasm. At least four types of granules and vesicles have been classified in PMN, including peroxidase-positive primary granules (also termed azurophil granules), peroxidase-negative secondary and tertiary granules (also termed as specific and gelatinase granules, respectively), and a group of highly mobilizable secretory vesicles (3Borregaard N.

These various granules and vesicles in PMN constitute an important reservoir of antimicrobial peptides, proteases, respiratory burst oxidases, and many membrane-bound receptors and adhesion molecules. PMN functions in response to inflammatory stimuli are largely dependent on the mobilization and release (degranulation) of these cytoplasmic granules and vesicles. In general, the secretory vesicles have the highest propensity for extracellular release. These vesicles provide the PMN cell surface with essential but low levels of receptors and molecules that are important in PMN sensing and triggering activation (3Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Borregaard N. Sørensen O.E. Theilgaard-Mönch K.

Degranulation of secondary granules also releases the anti-pathogen protein lactoferrin. Tertiary granules have a high content of gelatinases; release of these collagenolytic metalloproteases plays a critical role in degradation of the extracellular matrix during PMN extravasation. In addition to these granules/vesicles, studies have also found that certain primary granules are also released during PMN activation and that some of the primary granule components, such as elastase, are indispensable for PMN migration in the tissues.The molecular mechanisms that control PMN degranulation are, however, still unclear. The signaling events elicited by chemoattractant stimulation leading to PMN degranulation of each type of granule are complex and are only inadequately understood. In other cell types, the Ras family small GTPase Ral has been shown to be required in intracellular vesicle transportation, including both endocytosis and exocytosis (15Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report our experimental findings, which reveal for the first time that Ral controls PMN release of secondary granules. In particular, our studies suggest that active Ral serves as an essential gatekeeper that prevents secondary granule release. Disruption of Ral regulation, either by inhibition of Ral activity in resting PMN or overexpression of a constitutively active Ral during chemoattractant stimulation, results in dysregulation of secondary granule mobilization and impairment of PMN chemotactic function.DISCUSSIONAs a type of highly specialized and fast responsive cells, PMN store a large number of functionally important molecules in the intracellular granules and vesicles. Upon stimulation, PMN promptly mobilize these granules/vesicles and rapidly release arrays of cell adhesion molecules, receptors, and proteases to the cell surfaces to facilitate PMN adhesion, chemotaxis, and microbial killing. At least four types of granules and vesicles varied in size/shape and content have been identified in PMN (1Kobayashi S.D. Voyich J.M. DeLeo F.R. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Butterfield T.A. Best T.M. Merrick M.A. J. Athl. Train. 2006; 41: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanisms that control their mobilization and release during PMN response to inflammatory stimulation remain largely undefined. Among these granules and vesicles, secondary granules are defined as being mostly rich in leukocyte integrins and adhesive receptor-like proteins. Degranulation of secondary granules thus serves as a major means to furnish the cell surface plasma membrane with the essential cell adhesion and migration molecules. Here, we report our studies of PMN degranulation, which reveal, for the first time, that the Ras family member Ral is a critical regulator specifically in the degranulation of secondary granules.As shown by our results, Ral exits as an active GTPase in freshly isolated PMN, and its activity plays a key role in keeping secondary granules in the cell. Inhibition of Ral in resting PMN by damnacanthal, a Ras family GTPase inhibitor with unclear mechanism (40Hiramatsu T. Imoto M. Koyano T. Umezawa K. Cancer Lett. 1993; 73: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Hiwasa T. Kondo K. Hishiki T. Koshizawa S. Umezawa K. Nakagawara A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 238: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), causes “premature” liberation of secondary granules in the absence of chemoattractant stimulation. However, this dysregulated degranulation has no benefit to but instead impeded PMN function. As we observed, although damnacanthal increased cell surface integrins and adhesive molecules, these up-regulated molecules failed to mediate effective PMN interactions, adhesion, and migration. In particular, our results (Fig. 2) showed that, in contrast to fMLF-induced CD47 on the cell surface that mediates binding interactions with its extracellular ligand, damnacanthal-induced CD47 on PMN were incapable of binding interaction. Similarly, damnacanthal-mediated increased cell surface CD11b/CD18 did not appear to mediate strong extracellular interactions, which count, in part, for the decrease of PMN adhesion and spreading in response to fMLF. Thus, these results suggest that a critical mechanism, which is elicited by chemoattractant stimulation, controls secondary granule degranulation, and also converts essential cell surface proteins to be functional. These studies thus further signify the important role of Ral in PMN. By preventing irregular degranulation in the absence of stimuli, the Ral-mediated mechanism preserves PMN functional capability for potent and effective response during inflammation.In this study, we also obtained the important finding that chemoattractant induces a rapid deactivation of Ral in PMN, which explains a dynamic regulation required for secondary granule release. In contrast, experimental overexpression of a constitutively active Ral, Ral23V (15Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.F. Chasserot-Golaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29921-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Hinoi T. Kishida S. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Hypertension. 2003; 41: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), into PMN to sustain Ral activity even in the presence of fMLF resulted in prohibition of secondary granule release and hence hampered PMN chemotactic transmigration. Although its role in secondary granule mobilization is evident, Ral has no control of the mobilization of primary and tertiary granules, and both damnacanthal and Ral23V only had an effect on the degranulation of secondary granules.The mechanism by which Ral regulates secondary granule storage and release is, however, unclear. By subcellular fractionation, we found that Ral is associated with the plasma membrane under resting conditions, whereas chemoattractant stimulation triggers a translocation of Ral to secondary granules. Presumably, chemoattractant-induced cell surface endocytosis plays an important role in Ral intracellular translocation and thus PMN degranulation. Because PMN chemoattractant receptors are G protein-coupled and clathrin-coated pits are generally employed to internalize these receptors after ligand binding, one possible hypothesis would be that Ral is in complex with the chemoattractant receptor and assembled into the clathrin pits after chemoattractant stimulation. However, testing this hypothesis using two reagents, dynasore and an AP-2-binding Eps15 peptide, both specifically blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis, failed to inhibit Ral translocation to the pool of secondary granules. Interestingly, several other inhibitors that generally inhibit endocytosis, vesicle transportation, and/or cytoskeleton structures blocked Ral intracellular translocation in the experiments.In other cell types, Ral has been extensively implicated in different vesicle transportations, including both endocytosis and exocytosis (15Vitale N.

A guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, RalGDS, was also shown to activate Ral, and such regulation involves Ras. In particular, RalGDS was shown to directly bind to Ras, suggesting that Ral acts as a downstream effector in the Ras network (36Hinoi T. Kishida S. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

However, we found that in PMN, Ral has a completely different activity profile from that of Ras, suggesting a dissociation of Ral from the Ras pathway. Although it is important to render Ral activation, our study suggests that the mechanism that deactivates Ral is crucial for PMN degranulation and conversion of PMN to be functional inflammatory leukocytes. In addition to Ral, other small GTPases, such as Ras family members Ras and Rap, and Rho family members Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are also expressed in PMN (55Makino A. Glogauer M. Bokoch G.M. Chien S.

Thus, detailed investigation of these small GTPases in PMN and correlation of their activity changes with PMN activation and degranulation will shed new light on the understanding of PMN inflammatory functions. Given the critical role of PMN in innate immunity and inflammation, our findings illustrate a novel mechanism that modulates PMN inflammatory response, which may provide a potential drug design for treatment against various inflammatory conditions.

Therefore, the timely and precise response of PMN constitutes an essential first line defense against invading microbials.

At least four types of granules and vesicles have been classified in PMN, including peroxidase-positive primary granules (also termed azurophil granules), peroxidase-negative secondary and tertiary granules (also termed as specific and gelatinase granules, respectively), and a group of highly mobilizable secretory vesicles (3Borregaard N.

These various granules and vesicles in PMN constitute an important reservoir of antimicrobial peptides, proteases, respiratory burst oxidases, and many membrane-bound receptors and adhesion molecules. PMN functions in response to inflammatory stimuli are largely dependent on the mobilization and release (degranulation) of these cytoplasmic granules and vesicles. In general, the secretory vesicles have the highest propensity for extracellular release. These vesicles provide the PMN cell surface with essential but low levels of receptors and molecules that are important in PMN sensing and triggering activation (3Borregaard N. Cowland J.B.

Upon chemoattractant stimulation, secondary and tertiary granules are released, and this vital degranulation process enables PMN to adhere to and migrate across vascular endothelium and tissue layers (3Borregaard N.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), all of which are required for PMN adhesion and chemotaxis. Degranulation of secondary granules also releases the anti-pathogen protein lactoferrin. Tertiary granules have a high content of gelatinases; release of these collagenolytic metalloproteases plays a critical role in degradation of the extracellular matrix during PMN extravasation. In addition to these granules/vesicles, studies have also found that certain primary granules are also released during PMN activation and that some of the primary granule components, such as elastase, are indispensable for PMN migration in the tissues.The molecular mechanisms that control PMN degranulation are, however, still unclear. The signaling events elicited by chemoattractant stimulation leading to PMN degranulation of each type of granule are complex and are only inadequately understood. In other cell types, the Ras family small GTPase Ral has been shown to be required in intracellular vesicle transportation, including both endocytosis and exocytosis (15Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J.

In particular, our studies suggest that active Ral serves as an essential gatekeeper that prevents secondary granule release. Disruption of Ral regulation, either by inhibition of Ral activity in resting PMN or overexpression of a constitutively active Ral during chemoattractant stimulation, results in dysregulation of secondary granule mobilization and impairment of PMN chemotactic function."
