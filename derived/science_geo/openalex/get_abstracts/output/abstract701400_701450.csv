https://openalex.org/W4297143350,"Bacterial colonies composed of genetically identical individuals can diversify to yield variant cells with distinct genotypes. Variant outgrowth manifests as sectors. Here, we show that Type VI secretion system (T6SS)-driven cell death in Vibrio cholerae colonies imposes a selective pressure for the emergence of variant strains that can evade T6SS-mediated killing. T6SS-mediated cell death occurs in two distinct spatiotemporal phases, and each phase is driven by a particular T6SS toxin. The first phase is regulated by quorum sensing and drives sectoring. The second phase does not require the T6SS-injection machinery. Variant V. cholerae strains isolated from colony sectors encode mutated quorum-sensing components that confer growth advantages by suppressing T6SS-killing activity while simultaneously boosting T6SS-killing defenses. Our findings show that the T6SS can eliminate sibling cells, suggesting a role in intra-specific antagonism. We propose that quorum-sensing-controlled T6SS-driven killing promotes V. cholerae genetic diversity, including in natural habitats and during disease."
https://openalex.org/W4297488788,"Five-factor model personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness) are thought to be relatively impervious to environmental demands in adulthood. The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to examine whether personality changed during a stressful global event. Surprisingly, two previous studies found that neuroticism decreased early in the pandemic, whereas there was less evidence for change in the other four traits during this period. The present research used longitudinal assessments of personality from the Understanding America Study (N = 7,109; 18,623 assessments) to examine personality changes relatively earlier (2020) and later (2021–2022) in the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. Replicating the two previous studies, neuroticism declined very slightly in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels; there were no changes in the other four traits. When personality was measured in 2021–2022, however, there was no significant change in neuroticism compared to pre-pandemic levels, but there were significant small declines in extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The changes were about one-tenth of a standard deviation, which is equivalent to about one decade of normative personality change. These changes were moderated by age and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, but not race or education. Strikingly, younger adults showed disrupted maturity in that they increased in neuroticism and declined in agreeableness and conscientiousness. Current evidence suggests the slight decrease in neuroticism early in the pandemic was short-lived and detrimental changes in the other traits emerged over time. If these changes are enduring, this evidence suggests population-wide stressful events can slightly bend the trajectory of personality, especially in younger adults."
https://openalex.org/W4297459150,"Identification of 3D cephalometric landmarks that serve as proxy to the shape of human skull is the fundamental step in cephalometric analysis. Since manual landmarking from 3D computed tomography (CT) images is a cumbersome task even for the trained experts, automatic 3D landmark detection system is in a great need. Recently, automatic landmarking of 2D cephalograms using deep learning (DL) has achieved great success, but 3D landmarking for more than 80 landmarks has not yet reached a satisfactory level, because of the factors hindering machine learning such as the high dimensionality of the input data and limited amount of training data due to the ethical restrictions on the use of medical data. This paper presents a semi-supervised DL method for 3D landmarking that takes advantage of anonymized landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed. The proposed method first detects a small number of easy-to-find reference landmarks, then uses them to provide a rough estimation of the all landmarks by utilizing the low dimensional representation learned by variational autoencoder (VAE). The anonymized landmark dataset is used for training the VAE. Finally, coarse-to-fine detection is applied to the small bounding box provided by rough estimation, using separate strategies suitable for the mandible and the cranium. For mandibular landmarks, patch-based 3D CNN is applied to the segmented image of the mandible (separated from the maxilla), in order to capture 3D morphological features of mandible associated with the landmarks. We detect 6 landmarks around the condyle all at once rather than one by one, because they are closely related to each other. For cranial landmarks, we again use the VAE-based latent representation for more accurate annotation. In our experiment, the proposed method achieved a mean detection error of 2.88 mm for 90 landmarks using only 15 paired training data."
https://openalex.org/W4297456960,"Background Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy globally. Recent studies have reported associations between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and neurobehavioral problems in children, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. Little research has investigated these associations in preschool-age children or the potential confounding effects of prenatal stress. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and offspring neurobehavioral problems at the age of 3 years, with a focus on the potentially confounding effects of prenatal stress. Methods We used data from the First Baby Study, a prospective cohort study conducted in Pennsylvania, USA, with 2,423 mother-child pairs. Women reported medication use and completed a prenatal stress inventory during their third trimester. Child behavioral problems were measured at the age of 3 years, using the 7 syndrome scale scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for ages 1 ½ to 5. Results There were 1,011 women (41.7%) who reported using acetaminophen during pregnancy. Children who were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy scored significantly higher on 3 of the 7 CBCL syndrome scales: withdrawn, sleep problems and attention problems. Scores on all 7 of the CBCL syndrome scales were significantly associated with prenatal stress. After adjustment for prenatal stress and other confounders, 2 syndrome scales remained significantly higher in children exposed to acetaminophen: sleep problems (aOR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.01–1.51) and attention problems (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.01–1.45). Conclusions These findings corroborate previous studies reporting associations between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and attention problems in offspring and also show an association with sleep problems at age 3 years. Because use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is common, these results are of public health concern and suggest caution in the use of medications containing acetaminophen during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4297460029,"Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) provides an assessment of the brain's vascular reserve and has been postulated to be a sensitive marker in cerebrovascular diseases. MRI-based CVR measurement typically employs alterations in arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) level while continuously acquiring Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) images. CO2-inhalation and resting-state methods are two commonly used approaches for CVR MRI. However, processing of CVR MRI data often requires special expertise and may become an obstacle in broad utilization of this promising technique. The aim of this work was to develop CVR-MRICloud, a cloud-based CVR processing pipeline, to enable automated processing of CVR MRI data. The CVR-MRICloud consists of several major steps including extraction of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) curve from raw CO2 recording, alignment of EtCO2 curve with BOLD time course, computation of CVR value on a whole-brain, regional, and voxel-wise basis. The pipeline also includes standard BOLD image processing steps such as motion correction, registration between functional and anatomic images, and transformation of the CVR images to canonical space. This paper describes these algorithms and demonstrates the performance of the CVR-MRICloud in lifespan healthy subjects and patients with clinical conditions such as stroke, brain tumor, and Moyamoya disease. CVR-MRICloud has potential to be used as a data processing tool for a variety of basic science and clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4297476635,"Some individuals seek support around loneliness on social media forums. In this work, we aim to determine differences in the use of language by users—in different age groups and genders (female, male), who publish posts on Twitter expressing loneliness. We hypothesize that these differences in the use of language will reflect how these users express themselves and some of their support needs. Interventions may vary depending on the age and gender of an individual, hence, in order to identify high-risk individuals who express loneliness on Twitter and provide appropriate interventions for these users, it is important to understand the variations in language use by users who belong to different age groups and genders and post about loneliness on Twitter. We discuss the findings from this work and how they can help guide the design of online loneliness interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4297143351,"Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) convert the stochastic choice of one of >1,000 olfactory receptor (OR) genes into precise and stereotyped axon targeting of OR-specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates both the glomerular coalescence of like axons and the specificity of their projections. Subtle differences in OR protein sequences lead to distinct patterns of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during OSN development, converting OR identity into distinct gene expression signatures. We identify the transcription factor Ddit3 as a key effector of PERK signaling that maps OR-dependent ER stress patterns to the transcriptional regulation of axon guidance and cell-adhesion genes, instructing targeting precision. Our results extend the known functions of the UPR from a quality-control pathway that protects cells from misfolded proteins to a sensor of cellular identity that interprets physiological states to direct axon wiring."
https://openalex.org/W4297461354,"In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), governments worldwide have introduced multiple restriction policies, known as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, the relative impact of control measures and the long-term causal contribution of each NPI are still a topic of debate. We present a method to rigorously study the effectiveness of interventions on the rate of the time-varying reproduction number Rt and on human mobility, considered here as a proxy measure of policy adherence and social distancing. We frame our model using a causal inference approach to quantify the impact of five governmental interventions introduced until June 2020 to control the outbreak in 113 countries: confinement, school closure, mask wearing, cultural closure, and work restrictions. Our results indicate that mobility changes are more accurately predicted when compared to reproduction number. All NPIs, except for mask wearing, significantly affected human mobility trends. From these, schools and cultural closure mandates showed the largest effect on social distancing. We also found that closing schools, issuing face mask usage, and work-from-home mandates also caused a persistent reduction on Rt after their initiation, which was not observed with the other social distancing measures. Our results are robust and consistent across different model specifications and can shed more light on the impact of individual NPIs."
https://openalex.org/W4297459385,"Obesity can result from excess intake in response to environmental food cues, and stress can drive greater intake and body weight. We used a novel fMRI task to explore how obesity and stress influenced appetitive responses to relatively minimal food cues (words representing food items, presented similarly to a chalkboard menu). Twenty-nine adults (16F, 13M), 17 of whom had obesity and 12 of whom were lean, completed two fMRI scans, one following a combined social and physiological stressor and the other following a control task. A food word reactivity task assessed subjective food approach (wanting) as well as food avoidant (restraint) responses, along with neural responses, to words denoting high energy-density (ED) foods, low-ED foods, and non-foods. A multi-item ad-libitum meal followed each scan. The obese and lean groups demonstrated differences as well as similarities in activation of appetitive and attention/self-regulation systems in response to food vs. non-food, and to high-ED vs. low-ED food words. Patterns of activation were largely similar across stress and non-stress conditions, with some evidence for differences between conditions within both obese and lean groups. The obese group ate more than the lean group in both conditions. Our results suggest that neural responses to minimal food cues in stressed and non-stressed states may contribute to excess consumption and adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W4297476771,"Vaccines are the most effective means at combating sickness and death caused by COVID-19. Yet, there are significant populations within the United States who are vaccine-hesitant, some due to ideological or pseudo-scientific motivations, others due to significant perceived and real costs from vaccination. Given this vaccine hesitancy, twenty state governors from May 12th to July 21st 2021 implemented some form of vaccination lottery aiming to increase low vaccination rates. In the aftermath of these programs, however, the critical question of whether these lotteries had a direct effect on vaccination remains. Previous literature on financial incentives for public health behaviors is consistent: Financial incentives significantly increase incentivized behaviors. Yet, work done specifically on state vaccine lotteries is both limited in scope and mixed in its conclusions. To help fill this gap in the literature, we use synthetic control methods to analyze all 20 states and causally identify, for eighteen states, the effects of their lotteries on both first-dose and complete vaccination rates. Within those eighteen states, we find strong evidence that all but three states’ lotteries had positive effects on first-dose vaccination. We find for complete vaccinations, however, over half the states analyzed had negative or null effects. We explore possibilities related to these mixed results including the states’ overall partisanship, vaccine hesitancy, and the size of their lotteries finding null effects for each of these explanations. Therefore, we conclude that the design of these programs is likely to blame: Every state lottery only incentivized first-doses with no additional or contingent incentive based on a second dose. Our findings suggest that the design of financial incentives is critical to their success, or failure, but generally, these programs can induce an uptake in vaccination across diverse demographic, ideological, and geographic contexts in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W4297488452,"By introducing a novel risk to human interaction, COVID-19 may have galvanized interest in uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But was the pandemic a large enough catalyst to change public attitudes about the costs and benefits of autonomous systems whose operations increasingly rely on AI? To answer this question, we use a preregistered research design that exploits variation across the 2018 and 2020 waves of the CCES/CES, a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States. We compare support for autonomous cars, autonomous surgeries, weapons, and cyber defense pre- and post-the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that, despite the incentives created by COVID-19, the pandemic did not increase support for most of these technologies, except in the case of autonomous surgery among those who know someone who died of COVID-19. The results hold even when controlling for a variety of relevant political and demographic factors. The pandemic did little to push potential autonomous vehicle users to support adoption. Further, American concerns about autonomous weapons, including cyber defense, remain sticky and perhaps exacerbated over the last two years. These findings suggest that the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of many of these systems is far more nuanced and complex than headlines may suggest."
https://openalex.org/W4297489872,"There are increasing efforts to scale up services globally for families raising children with developmental disabilities (DDs). Existing interventions, often developed in high income, Western settings, need substantial adaptation before they can be implemented in different contexts. The aim of this study was to explore perspectives on the role that context plays in the adaptation and implementation of interventions targeting caregivers of children with DDs across settings. The study question was applied to the Caregiver Skills Training (CST) programme of the World Health Organization specifically, as well as to stakeholder experiences with caregiver interventions more broadly. Two focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 15 participants) and 25 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Participants were caregivers of children with DDs and professionals involved in adapting or implementing the CST across five continents and different income settings. Data were analysed thematically. Four main themes were developed: 1) Setting the scene for adaptations; 2) Integrating an intervention into local public services; 3) Understanding the reality of caregivers; 4) Challenges of sustaining an intervention. Informants thought that contextual adaptations were key for the intervention to fit in locally, even more so than cultural factors. The socio-economic context of caregivers, including poverty, was highlighted as heavily affecting service access and engagement with the intervention. Competing health priorities other than DDs, financial constraints, and management of long-term collaborations were identified as barriers. This study validates the notion that attention to contextual factors is an essential part of the adaptation of caregiver interventions for children with DDs, by providing perspectives from different geographical regions. We recommend a stronger policy and research focus on contextual adaptations of interventions and addressing unmet socio-economic needs of caregivers."

https://openalex.org/W4297456991,"The excellent preservation of the waterlogged botanical remains of the multiphase Neolithic pile-dwelling site of Zug-Riedmatt (Central Switzerland) yielded an ideal dataset to delve into the issue of plant economy of a community spanning several decades. The study identified a major change in crops where oil plants played a key role in the site's initial phase before being supplanted over the course of a few decades by naked wheat, barley and pea. Wild plants continued to be gathered albeit in different proportions. In the latest settlement phase, the changes in the local vegetation and in the values of the analyses of carbon stable isotopes suggest a less humid environment. The hypothesis is that the changes perceived in the plant economy represent a resilience strategy adopted by the inhabitants in reaction to short term local climatic alterations. The two types of soil sampling techniques (monolith and bulk) allowed comparing these results. While the density of plant remains appears to be underestimated among the samples collected by the monolith technique, the proportions of economic taxa remain unaffected. The findings thus reveal that when the bulk samplings are distributed carefully throughout multiphase sites and avoid mixing stratigraphical units, and if the samplings are representative of all archaeological features from a whole area, then each of the two techniques offer analogous results."
https://openalex.org/W4297459109,"The aim of this study was to examine if synbiotics present similar efficiency to a common antibiotic used in poultry production under heat stress (HS) conditions. Two hundred and forty-one-day-old male Ross 708 broiler chicks were distributed among 3 treatments with 8 pens per treatment of 80 birds each for a 42-day trial. From day 15, birds were heat stressed (32°C for 9 h daily, HS) and fed the basal diet (CONT), the basal diet mixed with an antibiotic (Bactiracin Methylene Disalicylate) (0.05 g/kg of feed, BMD) or a synbiotic (0.5 g/kg of feed, SYN). The treatment effects on bird behavior, production performance, jejunal histomorphology, and cecal microbial ecology were examined. Behavioral observation was recorded by using instantaneous scan sampling technique. Production parameters were measured on day 14, 28, and 42. Cecal microbial populations of Escherichia coli and Lactobacilli and jejunal histomorphological parameters were measured at day 42. The results showed that, SYN birds exhibited more feeding and preening but less drinking and panting behaviors compared with both BMD and CONT birds (P < 0.05). The SYN birds also had higher body weight (BW) at both day 28 and 42 compared to CONT birds (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the counts of Escherichia coli of SYN birds were at the similar levels of BMD but were lower than that of CONT birds (P < 0.05); while there were no treatment effects on the populations of Lactobacilli (P > 0.05). In addition, SYN birds had greater villus height compared with both CONT and BMD birds (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the dietary synbiotic supplement has significant performance and welfare benefits, with the potential to be used as an alternative to antibiotics for poultry meat production, especially during hot seasons."
https://openalex.org/W4297460854,"Previous research suggests that dogs can detect when humans are experiencing stress. This study tested whether baseline and stress odours were distinguishable to dogs, using a double-blind, two-phase, three-alternative forced-choice procedure. Combined breath and sweat samples were obtained from participants at baseline, and after a stress-inducing (mental arithmetic) task. Participants' stress was validated with self-report and physiological measures recorded via a Biopac MP150 system. Thirty-six participants' samples were presented to four dogs across 36 sessions (16, 11, 7 and 2 sessions, respectively). Each session consisted of 10 Phase One training trials and 20 Phase Two discrimination trials. In Phase One, the dog was presented with a participant's stress sample (taken immediately post-task) alongside two blanks (the sample materials without breath or sweat), and was required to identify the stress sample with an alert behaviour. In Phase Two, the dog was presented with the stress sample, the same participant's baseline sample (taken pre-task), and a blank. Which sample (blank, baseline, or stress) the dog performed their alert behaviour on was measured. If dogs can correctly alert on the stress sample in Phase Two (when the baseline sample was present), it suggests that baseline and stress odours are distinguishable. Performance ranged from 90.00% to 96.88% accuracy with a combined accuracy of 93.75% (N trials = 720). A binomial test (where probability of success on a single trial was 0.33, and alpha was 0.05) showed that the proportion of correct trials was greater than that expected by chance (p < 0.001). Results indicate that the physiological processes associated with an acute psychological stress response produce changes in the volatile organic compounds emanating from breath and/or sweat that are detectable to dogs. These results add to our understanding of human-dog relationships and could have applications to Emotional Support and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) service dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4297461033,"Coexistence of fish populations (= stocks) of the same species is a common phenomenon. In the Baltic Sea, two genetically divergent stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Western Baltic cod (WBC) and Eastern Baltic cod (EBC), coexist in the Arkona Sea. Although the relative proportions of WBC and EBC in this area are considered in the current stock assessments, the mixing dynamics and ecological mechanisms underlying coexistence are not well understood. In this study, a genetically validated otolith shape analysis was used to develop the most comprehensive time series of annual stock mixing data (1977-2019) for WBC and EBC. Spatio-temporal mixing analysis confirmed that the two stocks coexist in the Arkona Sea, albeit with fluctuating mixing proportions over the 43-year observation period. Depth-stratified analysis revealed a strong correlation between capture depth and stock mixing patterns, with high proportions of WBC in shallower waters (48-61% in <20m) and increasing proportions of EBC in deeper waters (50-86% in 40-70m). Consistent depth-specific mixing patterns indicate stable differences in depth distribution and habitat use of WBC and EBC that may thus underlie the long-term coexistence of the two stocks in the Arkona Sea. These differences were also reflected in significantly different proportions of WBC and EBC in fisheries applying passive gears in shallower waters (more WBC) and active gears in deeper waters (more EBC). This highlights the potential for fishing gear-specific exploitation of different stocks, and calls for stronger consideration of capture depth and gear type in stock assessments. This novel evidence provides the basis for improved approaches to research, monitoring and management of Baltic cod stocks."
https://openalex.org/W4297461584,"The ZIP protein ( ZRT , the IRT -like protein) is an important metal transporter that transports Zn, Fe, and other divalent metal ions in plants. In this study, we identified 20 ZIP genes in lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L .). We used bioinformatics methods and renamed them according to their E value in hmmsearch. We also analyzed their gene structure, chromosomal location, constructed a phylogenetic tree, conserved motifs, performed synonymous analysis and responses to abiotic stresses. The results show that these LsZIP genes have 3–11 exons and were distributed unequally on 8 of the 9 chromosomes in lettuce. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the LsZIP gene family can be divided into three subfamilies, and the LsZIP genes within the same subfamily shared similar gene structure. The LsZIP genes contain 12 Motifs, of which Motif1 to Motif8 are widely distributed in group Ⅰ. Furthermore, the LsZIP gene contains numerous hormones and anti-stress response elements. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that most LsZIP genes is up-regulated under the elemental stress in this experiment, indicating that they are positively regulated. But different elemental stressors can induce the expression of LsZIP gene to varying degrees. The LsZIP genes also change in response to different elemental stresses. The present study serves as a basic foundation for future functional studies on the lettuce ZIP family."

https://openalex.org/W4297457480,"Objectives Meditation and mindfulness, though rooted in eastern traditions, have been increasingly embraced in western psychology. However, questions remain regarding the mechanisms through which the beneficial effects of mindfulness occur. The present study aimed to address cognitive fusion as a potential mediator between mindfulness and negative affect and whether the mindfulness-cognitive fusion link is moderated by personality factors in an international sample of frequent meditators. Methods An international sample of 739 frequent meditators completed measures of mindfulness (Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire), cognitive fusion (Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire), negative affect (Brief Symptom Checklist), and personality (Big Five Inventory) in an online survey. Using SPSS Process Macro, cognitive fusion was examined as a mediator between mindfulness and negative affect. Furthermore, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism were investigated as moderators in the mediation model. Results Cognitive fusion was found to be a partial mediator between mindfulness and negative affect ( b = -0.249; 95% CI , [-0.289, -0.203]), whereas the examined personality factors were not found to moderate the present model (E: t (734) = 0.951, p = .342); C: t (734) = -0.042, p = .967; N: t (734) = -2.271, p = .023). Conclusions This study suggests that cognitive fusion plays a significant role in the association between mindfulness and negative affect. These findings indicate the importance of how individuals internally respond and relate to experiences and the instrumental value of mindfulness effects beyond and outside of mindfulness-based interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4297458029,"Although creativity has been measured in various ways (ideas, products, achievements, and personality), the relationships between these measurements remain unclear. The current study examines whether divergent thinking predicts creative behavior (i.e., creative production and achievement) and whether beliefs about own creative personality influences the link between divergent thinking and creative behavior. Eighty-eight undergraduate students were assessed via a divergent thinking test, a creative production test, and a creative achievement questionnaire. The results showed that divergent thinking was positively associated with both creative behaviors (i.e., creative production in fine arts and achievement). In addition, beliefs about own creative personality moderated the relationship between divergent thinking and creative achievements, in that this relationship was stronger when Creative Personality Scale scores were higher. The current findings suggest some associations among creativity indices: divergent thinking promotes creative achievements, and this relation is moderated by beliefs about own creative personality. Further investigation is required to specify the causal relationships among creativity indices."

The study was focused on understanding the associated characteristics of various DEC strains among children and calves, establishing the possible zoonotic transmission, and determining their antibiotic resistance patterns. Samples from 144 acute diarrheic children and 50 diarrheic calves were collected and processed using traditional culture methods. The molecular identification of pathotypes was completed using primer-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting ten virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, aatA, lt, st, ial, hlyA bfpA, and daaE) related to six DEC pathotypes (EPEC, ETEC, EHEC, EAEC EIEC, and DAEC). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Colonies from 74 study subjects (54 diarrheic children and 20 diarrheic calves) were positive for E. coli isolates. Subsequent PCR detection discovered that 77% of children and 85% of calves' isolates were positive for one or more virulence genes typical of particular strains. Among those ETEC [(18%), (26%)] is being the maximum predominant, and [(15%), (15%)] were positive for STEC, [(13%), (8%)] for atypical EPEC, [(6%), (7%)] for EHEC, [(6%), (5%)] for EAEC, and [(6%), (4%)] for EIEC strains in children's and calves, respectively. Of the identified E. coli isolates, about 29% were found to be hybrid isolates. ETEC (66.7%) and STEC (58.9%) strains showed a better detection rate in contact children with diarrheic calves than children with no contacts. Most antibiotic resistances were obtained towards amoxicillin (64.9%), gentamycin (56.8%), and ampicillin (54.1%). Up to sixty-five percent of isolates were resistant to a minimum of three categories of antibiotics. This is the primary report on the wide occurrence of the six-diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains, and ETEC was found to be the predominant pathotype among children and contact calves in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4297458275,"Dysregulation of dopaminergic transmission induced by the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) has been implicated as a central factor in the development of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We have demonstrated that the tyrosine470 residue of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) plays a critical role in Tat-hDAT interaction. Based on the computational modeling predictions, the present study sought to examine the mutational effects of the tyrosine467 residue of the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET), a corresponding residue of the hDAT tyrosine470, on Tat-induced inhibition of reuptake of dopamine through the hNET. Mutations of the hNET tyrosine467 to a histidine (Y467H) or a phenylalanine (Y467F) displayed similar kinetic properties of reuptake of [3H]dopamine and [3H]norepinephrine in PC12 cells expressing wild-type hNET and its mutants. Compared to wild-type hNET, neither of Y467H or Y467F altered Bmax and Kd values of [3H]WIN35,428 binding, whereas Y467H but not Y467F decreased the Bmax of [3H]nisoxetine binding without changes in Kd. Y467H also increased the affinity of nisoxetine for inhibiting [3H]dopamine uptake relative to wild-type hNET. Recombinant Tat1-86 (140 nM) induced a significant reduction of [3H]dopamine uptake in wild-type hNET, which was attenuated in both Y467H and Y467F. Compared to wild-type hNET, neither Y467H or Y467F altered [3H]dopamine efflux in CHO cells expressing WT hNET and mutants, whereas Y467F but not Y467H decreased [3H]MPP+ efflux. These results demonstrate tyrosine467 as a functional recognition residue in the hNET for Tat-induced inhibition of dopamine transport and provide a novel insight into the molecular basis for developing selective compounds that target Tat-NET interactions in the context of HAND."

However, due to the high cost and difficulty of sample collection, the number of available sample types for COVID-19 diagnosis is rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The use of nasal swabs, saliva, and oral fluids as viable sample options for the effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented successfully in different settings since 2020. These alternative sample type provides a plethora of advantages including decreasing the high exposure risk to frontline workers, enhancing the chances of home self-sampling, reducing the cost, and significantly increasing testing capacity. This study sought to ascertain the effectiveness of Saliva samples as an alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis in Nigeria. Demographic data, paired samples of Nasopharyngeal Swab and Drooling Saliva were obtained from 309 consenting individuals aged 8-83 years presenting for COVID-19 testing. All samples were simultaneously assayed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, N, and E genes using the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RT-PCR test kit. Out of 309 participants, only 299 with valid RT-PCR results comprising 159 (53.2%) males and 140 (46.8%) females were analyzed in this study using the R Statistical package. Among the 299 samples analyzed, 39 (13.0%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one specimen type. Both swabs and saliva were positive in 20 (51.3%) participants. Ten participants (25.6%) had swab positive/saliva-negative results and 9 participants (23.1%) had saliva positive/swab-negative results. The percentage of positive and negative agreement of the saliva samples with the nasopharyngeal swab were 67% and 97% respectively with positive and negative predictive values as 69% and 96% respectively. The findings indicate that drooling saliva samples have good and comparable diagnostic accuracy to the nasopharyngeal swabs with moderate sensitivities and high specificities."
https://openalex.org/W4297458683,"Dog aggression is a public health concern because dog bites often lead to physical and psychological trauma in humans. It is also a welfare concern for dogs. To prevent aggressive behaviours, it is important to understand human behaviour towards dogs and our ability to interpret signs of dog aggression. This poses ethical challenges for humans and dogs. The aim of this study was to introduce, describe and pilot test a virtual reality dog model (DAVE (Dog Assisted Virtual Environment)). The Labrador model has two different modes displaying aggressive and non-reactive non-aggressive behaviours. The aggressive behaviours displayed are based on the current understanding of canine ethology and expert feedback. The objective of the study was to test the recognition of dog behaviour and associated human approach and avoidance behaviour. Sixteen university students were recruited via an online survey to participate in a practical study, and randomly allocated to two experimental conditions, an aggressive followed by a non-reactive virtual reality model (group AN) or vice versa (group NA). Participants were instructed to 'explore the area' in each condition, followed by a survey. A Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the closest distance to the dog within and between groups respectively. Participants moved overall significantly closer to the non-reactive dog compared to the aggressive dog (p≤0.001; r = 0.8). Descriptions of the aggressive dog given by participants often used motivational or emotional terms. There was little evidence of simulator sickness and presence scores were high indicating sufficient immersion in the virtual environment. Participants appeared to perceive the dog as realistic and behaved and interacted with the dog model in a manner that might be expected during an interaction with a live dog. This study also highlights the promising results for the potential future use of virtual reality in behavioural research (i.e., human-dog interactions), education (i.e. safety around dogs) and psychological treatment (e.g. dog phobia treatment)."
https://openalex.org/W4297460066,"Background &amp; aims Sleep disturbances are related to hepatic encephalopathy and hyperammonaemia in patients with cirrhosis. The circadian rhythm is regulated by light stimulation of the retina via melanopsin-containing ganglion cells. The study aimed to investigate whether induced hyperammonaemia affects the pupillary light response and sleep efficiency in patients with cirrhosis. Methods The study was a single-blinded crossover trial including nine patients with cirrhosis. Sleep was evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and monitored for twelve nights with wrist accelerometers and sleep diaries. On two experimental days, separated by one week, patients were randomized to ingest either an oral amino acid challenge (AAC) or an isocaloric glucose solution (GS). We measured pupillary light response, capillary ammonia, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and two neuropsychological tests on both experimental days. Results The patients had poor self-assessed sleep quality. The amino acid challenge led to a significant increase in capillary ammonia and KSS. The time spent in bed sleeping after AAC was longer and with a reduced movement index compared to baseline but not different from GS. We found no difference in the pupillary light response or neuropsychiatric tests when comparing the effect of AAC with GS. Conclusions Patients with cirrhosis had impaired sleep quality. Induced hyperammonaemia led to increased sleepiness but had no acute effect on pupillary light response or the neuropsychiatric tests. Trial registration Registration number: NCT04771104 ."
https://openalex.org/W4297460505,"Self-control is often thought to be synonymous with willpower, defined as the direct modulation of impulses in order to do what is best in the long-run. However, research has also identified more strategic approaches to self-control that require less effort than willpower. To date, field research is lacking that compares the efficacy of willpower to strategic self-control for consequential and objectively measured real-world outcomes. In collaboration with the College Board, we surveyed two national samples of high school students about how they motivated themselves to study for the SAT college admission exam. In Study 1 (N = 5,563), compared to willpower, strategic self-control predicted more hours of SAT practice and higher SAT scores, even when controlling for prior PSAT scores. Additionally, the more self-control strategies students deployed, the higher their SAT scores. Consistent with dose-response curves in other domains, there were positive albeit diminishing marginal returns to additional strategies. Mediation analyses suggest that the benefits of self-control strategies to SAT scores was fully explained by increased practice time. These results were confirmed in Study 2, a preregistered replication with N = 14,259 high school students. Compared to willpower, strategic self-control may be especially beneficial in facilitating the pursuit of goals in high-stakes, real-world situations."
https://openalex.org/W4297460935,"Background Previous studies concerning humidified, heated high-flow nasal oxygen delivered in spontaneously breathing patients postulated an increase in functional residual capacity as one of its physiological effects. It is unclear wheter this is also true for patients under general anesthesia. Methodology The sincle-center noninferiority trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT NCT03478774). This secondary outcome analysis shows estimated differences in lung volume changes using electrical impedance tomography between different flow rates of 100% oxygen in apneic, anesthetized and paralyzed adults prior to intubation. One hundred and twenty five patients were randomized to five groups with different flow rates of 100% oxygen: i) minimal-flow: 0.25 l.min -1 via endotracheal tube; ii) low-flow: 2 l.min -1 + continuous jaw thrust; iii) medium-flow: 10 l.min -1 + continuous jaw thrust; iv) high-flow: 70l.min -1 + continuous jaw thrust; and v) control: 70 l.min -1 + continuous video-laryngoscopy. After standardized anesthesia induction with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade, the 15-minute apnea period and oxygen delivery was started according to the randomized flow rate. Continuous electrical impedance tomography measurements were performed during the 15-minute apnea period. Total change in lung impedance (an estimate of changes in lung volume) over the 15-minute apnea period and times to 25%, 50% and 75% of total impedance change were calculated. Results One hundred and twenty five patients completed the original study. Six patients did not complete the 15-minute apnea period. Due to maloperation, malfunction and artefacts additional 54 measurements had to be excluded, resulting in 65 patients included into this secondary outcome analysis. We found no differences between groups with respect to decrease in lung impedance or curve progression over the observation period. Conclusions Different flow rates of humidified 100% oxygen during apnea result in comparable decreases in lung volumes. The demonstrated increase in functional residual capacity during spontaneous breathing with high-flow nasal oxygenation could not be replicated during apnea under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade."
https://openalex.org/W4297461015,"Introduction Despite the efforts and strategies being applied by the government and the partner organizations to increase maternal health service utilization, maternal health service utilization is low in the general population and very low in rural communities of the West Shoa Zone specifically. Objective This study intended to identify and describe barriers contributing to low maternal health service utilization in selected rural districts of the West Shoa Zone of Oromia regional state, Ethiopia, by 2021. Methods The study was conducted from February 01 to April 30/2021 in three districts of the West Shoa Zone. The districts were selected purposively based on the report of their last year’s (2020) performance on maternal health service utilization obtained from the Zonal health office, where the ANC follow-up and Institutional delivery were the lowest among the Districts in the Zone. A community-based qualitative phenomenological approach was used to explore the demand-supply side barriers affecting the utilization of maternal health services. Six Focus Group discussions, 9 In-depth Interviews, and 12 Key Informants Interviews were conducted with women who gave birth at home in the last 12 months and with health care providers at different health offices and health institutions. Data were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and analyzed thematically using MAXQDA software. Results Our findings revealed that though women strongly agree on the importance and advantage of maternal health services utilization, both demand and supply side barriers such as low awareness on when to use the services, not knowing ANC schedule, misinformation about ANC and institutional delivery, not knowing their estimated date of delivery and precipitated labor, shortage of manpower at health institutions, far distance health facilities, and unavailability or un-accessibility of ambulance services during an emergency time, lack of transportation to health facilities were hindering them not to use the services. Conclusion In general, rural women are facing many challenges yet to accessing and utilizing maternal health services. To achieve the SDG targets, addressing barriers prohibiting a woman from using MCH should be critically addressed."

The combination of transparency and digital information has given rise to the concept of Open Government, that increases citizen understanding and monitoring of government actions, which in turn improves the quality of public services and of the government decision making process. With the goal of improving legislative transparency and the understanding of the Brazilian regulatory process and its characteristics, this paper introduces RegBR, the first national framework to centralize, classify and analyze regulations from the Brazilian government. A centralized database of Brazilian federal legislation built from automated ETL routines and processed with data mining and machine learning techniques was created. Our framework evaluates different NLP models in a text classification task on our novel Portuguese legal corpus and performs regulatory analysis based on metrics that concern linguistic complexity, restrictiveness, law interest, and industry-specific citation relevance. Our results were examined over time and validated by correlating them with known episodes of regulatory changes in Brazilian history, such as the implementation of new economic plans or the emergence of an energy crisis. Methods and metrics proposed by this framework can be used by policy makers to measure their own work and serve as inputs for future studies that could analyze government changes and their relationship with federal regulations."
https://openalex.org/W4297457128,"Introduction Mental distress is a collection of mental health abnormalities characterized by symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, forgetfulness, difficulty in concentrating, and somatic symptoms. It affects society as a whole and no group is immune to mental distress; however, students have a significantly high level of mental distress than their community peers. The study is aimed to assess the magnitude of mental distress and associated factors among a school of medicine and college of health sciences students. Objective To assess the magnitude of mental distress and associated factors among a school of medicine and college of health sciences students at Debre Markos University, 2021. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed from March 15–29, 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 475 study participants. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with mental distress. Variables with a p-value less than 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression analysis and a P-Value of less than 0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant association. Result The magnitude of mental distress among students was found to be 35.4%, 95%CI (31%, 40%). Female sex [AOR = 1.95; 95%CI (1.24–3.06)], financial distress[AOR = 1.64; 95%CI (1.062.54)], feeling of insecurity [AOR = 2.49; 95% CI (1.13–3.54)], lack of interest to department [AOR = 2.00; 95%CI (1.75–4.36)] and cumulative grade point average less than expected [AOR = 2.63; 95%CI (1.59–4.37)]were significant variables with mental distress. Conclusion The magnitude of mental distress was high. Sex, financial distress, feeling of insecurity, lack of interest in the department, and cumulative grade point average less than expected were significant variables with mental distress, so special attention on mental health promotion is required from policymakers, college officials, parents, and other Non-Governmental organizations."

Recruitment and follow-up were conducted between September 2016 to December 2018. Gene expression and data processing and analysis from April 2019 to April 2021.Two male Colombian prisons.15 new tuberculin skin test (TST) converters (negative TST at baseline that became positive during follow-up), 11 people that continued with a negative TST after two years of follow-up, and 10 people with pulmonary ATB.Gene expression profile using RNA sequencing from PBMC samples. The differential expression was assessed using the DESeq2 package in Bioconductor. Genes with |logFC| >1.0 and an adjusted p-value < 0.1 were differentially expressed. We analyzed the differences in the enrichment of KEGG pathways in each group using InterMiner.The gene expression was affected by the time of incarceration. We identified group-specific differentially expressed genes between the groups: 289 genes in people with a new LTBI and short incarceration (less than three months of incarceration), 117 in those with LTBI and long incarceration (one or more years of incarceration), 26 in ATB, and 276 in the exposed but non-infected individuals. Four pathways encompassed the largest number of down and up-regulated genes among individuals with LTBI and short incarceration: cytokine signaling, signal transduction, neutrophil degranulation, and innate immune system. In individuals with LTBI and long incarceration, the only enriched pathway within up-regulated genes was Emi1 phosphorylation.Recent infection with MTB is associated with an identifiable RNA pattern related to innate immune system pathways that can be used to prioritize LTBI treatment for those at greatest risk for developing active TB."
https://openalex.org/W4297457691,"Comprehenders frequently need to adapt to linguistic variability between talkers and dialects. Previous research has shown, given repeated exposure to quasi-grammatical structures, comprehenders begin to perceive them as more grammatical (Luka &amp; Barsalou 2005, Luka &amp; Choi 2012). We examined whether grammatical acceptability judgements differ for native versus non-native speech. In an exposure phase, native English speakers listened to, retyped, and rated the grammaticality of quasi-grammatical sentences (e.g., What Emily is thankful for is that she is here ) spoken by a native or non-native speaker. In a subsequent test phase, participants rated additional sentences, some of which had the same structure as exposure sentences. Participants rated native-accented sentences as more grammatical, demonstrating a role for talker identity in perceptions of grammaticality. Furthermore, structures previously heard during the exposure phase were rated as more grammatical than novel unprimed structures, but only for the native speaker. Subset analyses suggest this effect is driven by speaker intelligibility, which holds implications for communication between native and non-native speakers."
https://openalex.org/W4297457883,"Coral reefs species represent one-third of all marine species described in the ocean. They are also responsible for providing habitat and support to different species. Recently, Caribbean coral reefs ecosystems have suffered an alarming decrease in their populations as a result of overexploitation. Madracis auretenra in particular, is a widespread shallow coral in marine protected areas (MPAs) of the Caribbean. Due to the important role of MPAs as a biodiversity conservation tool, this species can be used as a model to estimate its dispersion/migration among Caribbean reefs through the use of informative genetic markers (microsatellites) specifically designed for it. Seventeen new polymorphic microsatellites markers for M. auretenra were developed and tested in 330 samples from Colombia, Guatemala, Curacao and Barbados. The gene diversity (1-D) ranged from 0.482 to 0.903, while the evenness ranged from 0.456 to 0.884 after clone removal. The expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.347 to 0.742, while the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.078 to 0.578. The specificity of our microsatellites shows the potential use of these markers in a-posteriori analysis to detect population structure at different spatial scales, where M. auretenra is reported."

The hygiene hypothesis predicts that an excessively hygienic environment may adversely affect human health.We quantified the effect of COVID-19 on immunological parameters linked to the hygiene hypothesis.We examined age-specific levels of total nonspecific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgE in individuals who visited Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital between 2010 and 2021. Pre-COVID (2010-2019) and COVID (2020-2021) periods were compared.IgG levels steadily decreased throughout Pre-COVID period. IgG levels fell abruptly from the pre-COVID period to the COVID period in all age groups (P = 0.0271, < 0.3 years; P = 0.0096, 0.3-5 years; P = 0.0074, ≥ 5 years). The declines in IgG in < 0.3 years and that in ≥ 5 years accelerated during the COVID period. IgE levels were seasonal, but did not change noticeably from the pre-COVID to COVID period. IgG levels recorded for patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (mean 709 mg/dL) were significantly lower than for matched control subjects (826 mg/dL) (P<0.0001).Hygienic behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak decreased the chance of infection, which may explain the decreases in IgG levels in children and adults. Neonatal IgG declined, possibly because of the decrease in maternal IgG.Hygienic behaviors decreased the IgG levels in all age groups, from neonates to adults. This downturn in IgG may lead to vulnerability to infections as well as to KD."
https://openalex.org/W4297458200,"The introduction and expansion of an invasive non-native species could have important consequences for the genetic patterns and processes of native species, moreover if the new arrival competes strongly for resources and space. This may result in the demographic decline of the native species. Knowing the effects on the levels of genetic diversity and structure in native species is key in terms of their conservation. We analysed temporal (over 50 years) genetic variation of the population of the European polecat ( Mustela putorius ), a species under threat in several European countries, in the Białowieża Primeval Forest (BPF), Poland, before and after the invasion of the American mink ( Neovison vison ). Using 11 microsatellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial control region we show that levels of diversity changed in the polecat population over 53 generations (over the period 1959–2012) and after the invasion of mink. When compared with other threatened European polecat populations, high levels of diversity are observed in the population in BPF in both periods, as well as in other areas in Poland. Our data shows that genetic structure was not present either before or after the mink invasion in BPF. This would suggest that the polecat population in Poland was not affected by invasive species and other negative factors and would be a potential good source of individuals for captive breeding or genetic rescue conservation management actions in areas where such actions are needed, for example the UK."

https://openalex.org/W4297458451,"Based on annual data for 31 emerging and developing economies in the period 2000-2020, this paper explores the impact of global economic policy uncertainty on episodes of extreme international capital inflows. Following previous researches, we identify episodes of surges and stops. The results show that the global economic policy uncertainty can significantly increase the probability of surges and decrease the probability of stops in emerging and developing economies. The heterogeneity tests show that these effects vary with economic growth, financial development, the degree of economic globalization and global liquidity. Above effects are significant in the groups with higher economic growth, higher financial development, higher economic globalization and higher global liquidity. Further analyses show that as global economic policy uncertainty rises, its impact on surges and stops gradually declines. In addition, global economic policy uncertainty has a significant negative effect on the surge in advanced economies, which could confirm the above conclusion to a certain extent."
https://openalex.org/W4297458668,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential co-factor for cellular metabolism and serves as a substrate in enzymatic processes. NAD+ is produced by de novo synthesis or salvage pathways in nearly all bacterial species. Haemophilus influenzae lacks the capacity for de novo synthesis, so it is dependent on import of NAD+ from the external environment or salvage biosynthetic pathways for recycling of NAD+ precursors and breakdown products. However, the actual sources of NAD+ utilized by H. influenzae in the respiratory tract are not well defined. In this study, we found that a variety of bacteria, including species found in the upper airway of humans, released NAD+ that was readily detectable in extracellular culture fluid, and which supported growth of H. influenzae in vitro. By contrast, certain strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus or GAS) inhibited growth of H. influenzae in vitro by secreting NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase), which degraded extracellular NAD+. Conversely, GAS strains that lacked enzymatically active NADase released extracellular NAD+, which could support H. influenzae growth. Our results suggest that many bacterial species, including normal flora of the upper airway, release NAD+ into the environment. GAS is distinctive in its ability to both release and degrade NAD+. Thus, colonization of the airway with H. influenzae may be promoted or restricted by co-colonization with GAS in a strain-specific manner that depends, respectively, on release of NAD+ or secretion of active NADase. We suggest that, in addition to its role as a cytotoxin for host cells, NADase may serve a separate function by restricting growth of H. influenzae in the human respiratory tract."
https://openalex.org/W4297458953,"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are important conduits that deliver oxygen and nutrients, protect parenchyma cells from toxins, and drain wastes to maintain brain homeostasis. Impairment of BECs has been implicated in diverse neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, molecular analysis of BECs is important for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these neurological diseases. Even though many transcriptome analyses for BECs have been developed, mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with the levels of actively translated proteins. Translatome analysis using RiboTag mice, in which Rpl22, a ribosomal component, is tagged by the hemagglutinin epitope under Cre recombinase activation, could serve as an excellent tool that overcomes these caveats. However, implementation of this technique is limited by high noise-to-signal ratios as well as the low yield of mRNAs from BECs, which limits bulk gene expression analysis. In this study, we established a protocol to isolate highly pure mRNAs from BECs in the cortex of eight- to twelve-week-old male Tie2-Cre; Rpl22HA/HA mice by using a cell strainer to trap blood vessels prior to immunoprecipitation. According to the results of RT-PCR, the specificity of the mRNA pools isolated by our protocol was much higher than that of the pools isolated by the standard protocol. We were also able to generate a high-quality cDNA library for RNA-seq with the small amount of mRNA isolated with our protocol. Thus, this optimized method will be useful for future studies of BECs at the molecular level."

This review will describe how, why, for whom, and in what circumstances approaches used by healthcare organisations work to prevent and reduce the use of restrictive practices on adults with learning disabilities.Evidence from the literature will be synthesised using a realist review approach - an interpretative, theory-driven approach to understand how complex healthcare approaches work in reducing the use of restrictive practices in these settings. In step 1, existing theories will be located to explore what approaches work by consulting with key topic experts, holding consultation workshops with healthcare professionals, academics, and experts by experience, and performing an informal search to help develop an initial programme theory. A systematic search will be performed in the second step in electronic databases. Further searches will be performed iteratively to test particular subcomponents of the initial programme theory, which will also include the use of the CLUSTER approach. Evidence judged as relevant and rigorous will be used to test the initial programme theory. In step three, data will be extracted and coded inductively and deductively. The final step will involve using a realist logic of analysis to refine the initial programme theory in light of evidence. This will then provide a basis to describe and explain what key approaches work, why, how and in what circumstances in preventing and reducing the use of restrictive practices in adults with learning disabilities in healthcare settings.Findings will be used to provide recommendations for practice and policymaking.In accordance with the guidelines, this realist review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 4th December 2019 (CRD42019158432)."
https://openalex.org/W4297459101,"Background Screening for latent tuberculosis infection is recommended in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) starting Janus kinase inhibitors (Jaki). Interferon (IFN)-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are increasingly used for this purpose. Jaki tend to decrease the levels of IFNs, questioning the reliability of IGRAs during treatment with these drugs. Objectives To compare the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-P) and QFT Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) in RA patients treated with Jaki. Methods RA patients underwent QFT-P and QFT-GIT at baseline (T0), and after 3 (T3) and 12 months (T12) of treatment with Jaki. The agreement between the two tests was calculated. The agreement between IGRAs and tuberculin skin test (TST) or chest radiography at baseline was also determined. The variability of QTF-P results was longitudinally assessed. Results Twenty-nine RA patients (F/M 23/6; median age/IQR 63/15.5 years; median disease duration/IQR 174/216 months) were enrolled. A perfect agreement was found between QFT-P and QFT-GIT at all times (κ = 1). At T0, no agreement was recorded between IGRAs and TST (κ = -0.08) and between TST and chest radiography (κ = -0.07), a low agreement was found between QFT-P and chest radiography (κ = 0.17). A variation of 33.3% in the results of QFT-P was recorded at T3 vs T0, of 29.4% at T12 vs T0, and of 11.8% at T12 vs T3. The median levels of IFN-γ produced by lymphocytes in response to the mitogen of QFT-P decreased after 3 months followed by an increase after 12 months (not significant). No change in the median number of circulating lymphocytes was documented. Glucocorticoids intake was associated with a higher probability of negative or indeterminate IGRA results at T0 (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion A response to IGRAs is detectable during treatment with Jaki. However, fluctuations in the results of IGRAs have been observed in the absence of correlation with clinical outcomes, thus challenging their interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W4297459133,"The rapid development of modern science nowadays makes it rather challenging to pick out valuable ideas from massive scientific literature. Existing widely-adopted citation-based metrics are not adequate for measuring how well the idea presented by a single publication is developed and whether it is worth following. Here, inspired by traditional X-ray imaging, which returns internal structure imaging of real objects along with corresponding structure analysis, we propose Scientific X-ray, a framework that quantifies the development degree and development potential for any scientific idea through an assembly of 'X-ray' scanning, visualization and parsing operated on the citation network associated with a target publication. We pick all 71,431 scientific articles of citation counts over 1,000 as high-impact target publications among totally 204,664,199 publications that cover 16 disciplines spanning from 1800 to 2021. Our proposed Scientific X-ray reproduces how an idea evolves from the very original target publication all the way to the up to date status via an extracted 'idea tree' that attempts to preserve the most representative idea flow structure underneath each citation network. Interestingly, we observe that while the citation counts of publications may increase unlimitedly, the maximum valid idea inheritance of those target publications, i.e., the valid depth of the idea tree, cannot exceed a limit of six hops, and the idea evolution structure of any arbitrary publication unexceptionally falls into six fixed patterns. Combined with a development potential index that we further design based on the extracted idea tree, Scientific X-ray can vividly tell how further a given idea presented by a given publication can still go from any well-established starting point. Scientific X-ray successfully identifies 40 out of 49 topics of Nobel prize as high-potential topics by their prize-winning papers in an average of nine years before the prizes are released. Various trials on articles of diverse topics also confirm the power of Scientific X-ray in digging out influential/promising ideas. Scientific X-ray is user-friendly to researchers with any level of expertise, thus providing important basis for grasping research trends, helping scientific policy-making and even promoting social development."
https://openalex.org/W4297459565,"Researchers would generally adjust for the possible confounding effect of population structure by considering global ancestry proportions or top principle components. Alternatively, researchers would conduct admixture mapping to increase the power to detect variants with an ancestry effect. This is sufficient in simple admixture scenarios, however, populations from southern Africa can be complex multi-way admixed populations. Duan et al. (2018) first described local ancestry adjusted allelic (LAAA) analysis as a robust method for discovering association signals, while producing minimal false positive hits. Their simulation study, however, was limited to a two-way admixed population. Realizing that their findings might not translate to other admixture scenarios, we simulated a three- and five-way admixed population to compare the LAAA model to other models commonly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We found that, given our admixture scenarios, the LAAA model identifies the most causal variants in most of the phenotypes we tested across both the three-way and five-way admixed populations. The LAAA model also produced a high number of false positive hits which was potentially caused by the ancestry effect size that we assumed. Considering the extent to which the various models tested differed in their results and considering that the source of a given association is unknown, we recommend that researchers use multiple GWAS models when analysing populations with complex ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W4297460328,"The laccase/ABTS system has found several industrial applications ranging from biodeterioration to biodegradation and bioremediation. However, the capability of the laccase/ABTS system varies depending upon the type of substrate used. Voltammetric studies involving two widely used substrates, i.e., veratryl alcohol (VA) and alkali lignin (AL), were performed to gain new insight into the electrochemical behavior of the reactions. The individual electrochemical reactions established the differential nature of the two compounds over a concentration range, along with the mediator ABTS producing a distinguishing effect on their oxidative reactions, which was further studied over a 12hour period. It was followed by the reaction of both the compounds against the laccase/ABTS system that helped verify the role of the enzyme and the mediator in the electron transfer process and elucidate the mediated oxidations carried out by laccase against the phenolic and non-phenolic substrate through the process of cyclic voltammetry."
https://openalex.org/W4297460503,"The objective of this study is to examine associations between state-level breastfeeding support and breastfeeding practices, controlling for women’s status, in the U.S. We used publicly available data on state-level breastfeeding practices and support (international board-certified lactation consultants (IBCLC), births in Baby-Friendly hospitals, and La Leche League Leaders) for births in 2015 from the CDC Breastfeeding Report Card (2018) and other CDC reported data, and indicators of women’s status from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research reports (2015). We conducted an ecological study to estimate incidence rate ratios of exclusive breastfeeding at six months and breastfeeding at 12 months with breastfeeding supports using bivariate and multivariable Poisson regression. Political participation, poverty, and employment and earnings were associated with breastfeeding practices, as was each breastfeeding support in bivariate analyses. After controlling for women’s status, only IBCLCs were positively associated with rates of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months and continued breastfeeding at 12 months. For every additional IBCLC per 1000 live births, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months increased by 5 percent (95% CI 1.03, 1.07) and the rate of breastfeeding at 12 months increased by 4 percent (95% CI 1.02, 1.06). Political participation, poverty, and employment and earnings were associated with breastfeeding practices, indicating a relationship between women’s political and economic status and their breastfeeding practices in the U.S. Given the influence of women’s status, increasing the number of IBCLCs may improve breastfeeding practices."
https://openalex.org/W4297461924,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI or concussion) is receiving increased attention due to the incidence in contact sports and limitations with subjective (pen and paper) diagnostic approaches. If an mTBI is undiagnosed and the athlete prematurely returns to play, it can result in serious short-term and/or long-term health complications. This demonstrates the importance of providing more reliable mTBI diagnostic tools to mitigate misdiagnosis. Accordingly, there is a need to develop reliable and efficient objective approaches with computationally robust diagnostic methods. Here in this pilot study, we propose the extraction of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features from audio recordings of speech that were collected from athletes engaging in rugby union who were diagnosed with an mTBI or not. These features were trained on our novel particle swarm optimised (PSO) bidirectional long short-term memory attention (Bi-LSTM-A) deep learning model. Little-to-no overfitting occurred during the training process, indicating strong reliability of the approach regarding the current test dataset classification results and future test data. Sensitivity and specificity to distinguish those with an mTBI were 94.7% and 86.2%, respectively, with an AUROC score of 0.904. This indicates a strong potential for the deep learning approach, with future improvements in classification results relying on more participant data and further innovations to the Bi-LSTM-A model to fully establish this approach as a pragmatic mTBI diagnostic tool."

Physical closeness to family post-disaster plays a critical role in mental healing and societal sustainability. Nonetheless, little is known about whether and how family colocation alters after a disaster, a topic of immense importance to a post-disaster society. We analyze 1 billion records of population-scale, granular, individual-level mobile location data to quantify family colocation, and examine the magnitude, dynamics, and socioeconomic heterogeneity of the shift in family colocation from the pre- to post-disaster period. Leveraging Hurricane Florence as a natural experiment, and Geographic Information System (GIS), machine learning, and statistical methods to investigate the shift across the landfall (treated) city of Wilmington, three partially treated cites on the hurricane's path, and two control cities off the path, we uncover dramatic (18.9%), widespread (even among the partially treated cities), and enduring (over at least 3 months) escalations in family colocation. These findings reveal the powerful psychological and behavioral impacts of the disaster upon the broader populations, and simultaneously remarkable human resilience via behavioral adaptations during disastrous times. Importantly, the disaster created a gap across socioeconomic groups non-existent beforehand, with the disadvantaged displaying weaker lifts in family colocation. This sheds important lights on policy making and policy communication to promote sustainable family colocation, healthy coping strategies against traumatic experiences, social parity, and societal recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4297489368,"An assessment of debt dynamics and its sustainability is very important in formalizing prudent and effective macroeconomic policies especially for the economies with weak macroeconomic fundamentals and alarming debt levels. Keeping in view the recent debt escalation in Pakistan, this study aims to explore the important factors that influence the public debt dynamics in case of Pakistan and to evaluate its sustainability. This study applies the debt dynamic approach for empirical assessment of drivers of changing debt levels and analysis of public debt sustainability. Furthermore, ARDL approach is utilized to study the short- and long-run debt dynamics using historic data from 1975 to 2021. This study is distinct from already existing work on debt assessment in Pakistan as it examines both important dimensions of public debt (determinants & stability) by employing the novel dynamic debt modelling approach and using most recent data. The study finds a positive and significant impact of fiscal deficit, exchange rate depreciation and interest rate on public debt in Pakistan. The debt sustainability analysis also reveals the instability of public debt for the entire study period except for few years. The regression results corroborate with the findings from stability analysis, and the main driving forces for increasing the debt burden of the country are found to be the fiscal indiscipline along with the rising cost on account of ER depreciation and higher interest rates."
