We looked for similar streams for auditory-prefrontal connections in rhesus macaques by combining microelectrode recording with anatomical tract-tracing. Injection of multiple tracers into physiologically mapped regions AL, ML and CL of the auditory belt cortex revealed that anterior belt cortex was reciprocally connected with the frontal pole (area 10), rostral principal sulcus (area 46) and ventral prefrontal regions (areas 12 and 45), whereas the caudal belt was mainly connected with the caudal principal sulcus (area 46) and frontal eye fields (area 8a). Thus separate auditory streams originate in caudal and rostral auditory cortex and target spatial and non-spatial domains of the frontal lobe, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1966161684,"The large extracellular matrix protein Reelin is produced by Cajal-Retzius neurons in specific regions of the developing brain, where it controls neuronal migration and positioning. Genetic evidence suggests that interpretation of the Reelin signal by migrating neurons involves two neuronal cell surface proteins, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the apoE receptor 2 (ApoER2) as well as a cytosolic adaptor protein, Disabled-1 (Dab1). We show that Reelin binds directly and specifically to the ectodomains of VLDLR and ApoER2 in vitro and that blockade of VLDLR and ApoER2 correlates with loss of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled-1 in cultured primary embryonic neurons. Furthermore, mice that lack either Reelin or both VLDLR and ApoER2 exhibit hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau. Taken together, these findings suggest that Reelin acts via VLDLR and ApoER2 to regulate Disabled-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and microtubule function in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2033822739,"A signaling pathway involving the extracellular protein Reelin and the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) controls cell positioning during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin binds directly to lipoprotein receptors, preferably the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. These data suggest that Reelin directs neuronal migration by binding to VLDLR and ApoER2."
https://openalex.org/W2069312841,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB regulate both short-term synaptic functions and long-term potentiation (LTP) of brain synapses, raising the possibility that BDNF/TrkB may be involved in cognitive functions. We have generated conditionally gene targeted mice in which the knockout of the trkB gene is restricted to the forebrain and occurs only during postnatal development. Adult mutant mice show increasingly impaired learning behavior or inappropriate coping responses when facing complex and/or stressful learning paradigms but succeed in simple passive avoidance learning. Homozygous mutants show impaired LTP at CA1 hippocampal synapses. Interestingly, heterozygotes show a partial but substantial reduction of LTP but appear behaviorally normal. Thus, CA1 LTP may need to be reduced below a certain threshold before behavioral defects become apparent."

https://openalex.org/W1985086416,"The distinction between syntax (sentence form) and semantics (sentence meaning) is fundamental to our thinking about language. Whether and where this distinction is represented at the neural level is still a matter of considerable debate. In the present fMRI study, we examined the neural correlates of syntactic and semantic functions using an innovative activation paradigm specifically designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing. Our findings strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars opercularis) is critically implicated in processing syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of a sentence."
https://openalex.org/W2132346372,The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in guiding actions that ensue seconds after an instruction. We recorded from neurons in area 46 and the frontal eye field (FEF) while monkeys performed a memory-guided eye movement task. A visual cue signaled whether a small or large liquid reward would accompany a correct response. Many neurons in area 46 responded more when the monkey expected a larger reward. Reward-related enhancement was evident throughout the memory period and was most pronounced when the remembered target appeared in the neuron's response field. Enhancement was not present in the FEF. The mixture of neural signals representing spatial working memory and reward expectation appears to be a distinct feature of area 46.
https://openalex.org/W2026242783,"Mutations were introduced into conserved steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)– and SOX9-binding sites within the endogenous mouse Müllerian inhibiting substance (Mis) promoter. Male mice homozygous for the mutant SF1-binding site correctly initiated Mis transcription in fetal testes, although at significantly reduced levels. Surprisingly, sufficient MIS was produced to eliminate the Müllerian ducts. In contrast, males homozygous for the mutant SOX9-binding site did not initiate Mis transcription, resulting in pseudohermaphrodites. These studies suggest an essential role for SOX9 in the initiation of Mis transcription, whereas SF1 appears to act as a quantitative regulator of Mis transcript levels, perhaps for influencing non-Müllerian duct tissues. Comparative studies of Mis expression in vertebrates indicate that the Mis promoter receives transcriptional inputs that vary between species but result in the same functional readout."

https://openalex.org/W2086393257,"Organ asymmetry is thought to have evolved many times independently in plants. In Antirrhinum, asymmetry of the flower and its component organs requires cyc and dich gene activity. We show that, like cyc, the dich gene encodes a product belonging to the TCP family of DNA-binding proteins that is first expressed in the dorsal domain of early floral meristems. However, whereas cyc continues to be expressed throughout dorsal regions, expression of dich eventually becomes restricted to the most dorsal half of each dorsal petal. This correlates with the effects of dich mutations and ectopic cyc expression on petal shape, providing an indication that plant organ asymmetry can reflect subdomains of gene activity. Taken together, the results indicate that plant organ asymmetry can arise through a series of steps during which early asymmetry in the developing meristem is progressively built upon."
https://openalex.org/W1966851583,"Barley Rar1 is a convergence point in the signaling of resistance to powdery mildew, triggered by multiple race-specific resistance (R) genes. Rar1 is shown to function upstream of H2O2 accumulation in attacked host cells, which precedes localized host cell death. We isolated Rar1 by map-based cloning. The sequence of the deduced 25.5 kDa protein reveals two copies of a 60–amino acid domain, CHORD, conserved in tandem organization in protozoa, plants, and metazoa. CHORD defines a novel eukaryotic Zn2+-binding domain. Silencing of the C. elegans CHORD-containing gene, chp, results in semisterility and embryo lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wild-type gene in nematode development. Our findings indicate that plant R genes have recruited a fundamental cellular control element for signaling of disease resistance and cell death."

The immunosuppressant drug rapamycin inhibits p70α activation in a manner that can be overcome by coexpression of p70α with a rapamycin-resistant mutant of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) but only if the mTOR kinase domain is intact. We report here that a mammalian recombinant p70α polypeptide, extracted in an inactive form from rapamycin-treated cells, can be directly phosphorylated by the mTOR kinase in vitro predominantly at the rapamycin-sensitive site Thr-412. mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation in vitro is accompanied by a substantial restoration in p70α kinase activity toward its physiologic substrate, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6. Moreover, sequential phosphorylation of p70α by mTOR and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 in vitro resulted in a synergistic stimulation of p70α activity to levels similar to that attained by serum stimulation in vivo. These results indicate that mTOR is likely to function as a direct activator of p70 in vivo, although the relative contribution of mTOR-catalyzed p70 phosphorylation in each of the many circumstances that engender p70 activation remains to be defined. p70 S6 kinase α (p70α) is activated in vivo through a multisite phosphorylation in response to mitogens if a sufficient supply of amino acids is available or to high concentrations of amino acids per se.

A second set of regulated phosphorylation sites, Thr-412 and Ser-427, exhibit the sequence motif Phe-Ser/Thr-Phe/Tyr. Thr-252, located on the activation loop in catalytic subdomain VIII, is the site at which 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates p70α (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T.

Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Among these, the phosphorylation of Thr-252, Ser-394, and Thr-412 is necessary for the activation of p70α kinase catalytic function; the attainment of physiologic levels of p70α activity results from a strongly synergistic, positive site-site interaction between the phosphorylated Thr-252 and Thr-412 residues (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition to its regulation by insulin and mitogens through PI-3 kinase-dependent pathways, p70α can also be activated by increasing concentrations of extracellular amino acids in the absence of serum or mitogens to the level attained by maximal mitogen stimulation (9-11). Moreover, a threshold level of cellular amino acids is necessary for p70α to be susceptible to activation by mitogens. Withdrawal of amino acids from the nutrient medium results in a rapid, selective deactivation of p70α, which becomes unresponsive to mitogens; readdition of amino acids restores the mitogen responsiveness of p70α (9Hara K.

This is achieved indirectly by the ability of a rapamycin-FKBP12 complex to bind to the mTOR polypeptide and inhibit mTOR kinase activity; mTOR mutants unable to bind the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex can rescue p70α from rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation and inhibition but only if the mTOR catalytic domain is intact (14Brown E.J.

As for the biochemical steps by which the mTOR kinase controls p70α phosphorylation and activity, evidence is available in support of two independent, but nonexclusive mechanisms. The possibility that mTOR inhibits an inactivating p70α-phosphatase is supported by both indirect and direct experiments. Thus, a doubly deleted p70α mutant (p70α-Δ2–46/ΔCT104) can be activated by mitogens and inhibited by low concentrations of wortmannin but is insensitive to inhibition by rapamycin (3Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) or amino acid withdrawal (9Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar); these features are most readily explained if mitogens and PI-3 kinase control p70α-kinases, whereas amino acid sufficiency and mTOR negatively regulate a p70α-phosphatase. A recent report provides direct evidence implicating protein phosphatase 2A in this role (16Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Conversely, Burnett et al. (17Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) reported that mTOR can directly phosphorylate prokaryotic recombinant fragments of p70α in vitro at sites important to activation, including Thr-412. The latter finding was surprising, inasmuch as all sites of mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation on the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E binding protein 1 (eIF-4E BP1) reside in Ser/Thr-Pro motifs (18Brunn G.J.

We therefore inquired whether mTOR can phosphorylate and/or activate a precisely folded full-length p70α polypeptide expressed in mammalian cells and dephosphorylated and inactivated in vivo by the pretreatment with rapamycin. The anti-mTOR antibody was described previously (20Nishiuma T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Kaneko K. Shii K. Yonezawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphopeptide antibodies against Thr-412, Ser-434, and Thr-444/Ser-447 of p70α (the anti-412-P Ab, the anti-434-P Ab, and the anti-444/447-P Ab, respectively), the anti-FLAG antibody, and the anti-HA antibody were described previously (21Weng Q.P.

The antibody against carboxyl-terminal peptides of p70α (the anti-p70αC Ab) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The expression vectors of the wild-type (W-mTOR) and the kinase-negative mutant (NK-mTOR) of mTOR, of the wild-type p70α and the mutant p70α (p70α-ΔCT104), and of GST-PDK1 were described previously (3Weng Q.P.

Site-specific mutants of p70α (p70α-Thr-412 → Ala, p70α-5A, and p70α-ΔCT104/Thr-412 → Ala) were generated using polymerase chain reaction based on the pcDNA1 plasmids. Recombinant p70α was prepared from HEK293 cells that were transfected with various p70α cDNAs and extracted after serum starvation for 16 h and the following treatment with 0.2 μm rapamycin for 30 min prior to harvest. Endogenous mTOR was extracted from HEK293 cells, and recombinant mTOR was extracted from HEK293 cells transfected with mTOR cDNAs. All cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (20 mmTris (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin), and the supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The anti-mTOR immunocomplex and the anti-recombinant p70α immunocomplex were each prepared using separate supernatants incubated 2 h at 4 °C with the specific antibodies. The two supernatants were then mixed together, and protein G-Sepharose beads were added immediately and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. Normal mouse immunogloblin was added to cell supernatant to provide control for the anti-mTOR immunocomplex, whereas the anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies were added to cell supernatant prepared from mock-transfected cells to provide the controls corresponding to recombinant HA-tagged mTOR or FLAG-tagged p70α immunocomplexes. The protein G beads containing immunocomplexes were washed twice with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl (the high salt wash buffer) followed by two washes with either the same high salt wash buffer or the high salt wash buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 or the RIPA buffer. The RIPA buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris (pH = 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 150 mm NaCl. The immunocomplexes were further washed twice with buffer B (10 mm Hepes (pH = 7.4), 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl) and subjected to the kinase assay. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of buffer C (10 mm Hepes (pH = 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of the SDS sample buffer. The ability of mTOR to stimulate the kinase activity of p70α toward S6 in vitro was measured using a two step kinase reaction. In the first step, after p70α was immunoprecipitated with mTOR on protein G-Sepharose beads, the immunoprecipitate was washed twice with the high salt wash buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with buffer B, and the immunoprecipitate was incubated in buffer C with nonradioactive ATP for the indicated times. The first kinase reaction was terminated by washing the beads twice with the ice-cold high salt wash buffer and twice with buffer D (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and subjected to the second kinase assay. The samples were incubated in the S6 kinase assay mixture (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunit, and 60 μm ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP) for 15 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of the SDS sample buffer. To measure the effects of GST-PDK1 on mTOR-catalyzed activation of p70α, a three step kinase assay was employed. The first kinase reaction was performed as described above, and the reaction was terminated by washing the beads with the ice-cold buffer E (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA). The second kinase reaction was initiated by adding buffer F (50 mmTris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP) containing either purified GST-PDK1 (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or control buffer and continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The second kinase reaction was terminated by washing the beads with the ice-cold high salt wash buffer twice and buffer D twice and subjected to the S6 kinase assay as described above. After the kinase reaction was terminated, the reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was analyzed by autoradiography using x-ray film and a BAS-2000 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). Then, the membrane was immunoblotted with the indicated antibody as the first antibody and visualized by using ECL method. To obtain a precisely folded full-length p70α polypeptide that was expressed in mammalian cells and dephosphorylated and inactivatedin vivo, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a full-length HA-tagged p70α, and cells were deprived of serum and treated with rapamycin (0.2 μm) for 30 min prior to harvest. HA-tagged p70α was immunopurified on protein G-Sepharose beads, together with either a control immunoglobulin or an anti-mTOR immunocomplex; each were prepared separately from extracts of HEK293 cells. To define optimal conditions for detection of mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation, the protein G-Sepharose beads were washed in several ways prior to the kinase assay (Fig.1 A). Although mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation was detectable with all washing conditions, the mTOR autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward p70α is substantially enhanced when the immunoprecipitate is washed with the high salt wash buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 or the RIPA buffer, compared with that prepared after washing with the high salt wash buffer without detergent. The result was unexpected, as we have previously shown that washing of mTOR immunoprecipitates with 1% Nonidet P-40 reduces greatly the ability of mTOR to catalyze eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation (20Nishiuma T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Kaneko K. Shii K. Yonezawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These differences in mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation are not because of differences in the recovery of mTOR polypeptide, as demonstrated by the immunoblot with the anti-mTOR antibody (Fig. 1 A). mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into p70α is detectable within 5 min after initiation of the kinase reaction and increases over 30 min (Fig. 1 B); no 32P incorporation into the wild-type p70α substrate (i.e. p70α autophosphorylation) is detectable in the absence of mTOR (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and7). Moreover, mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into the kinase-inactive, ATP binding site mutant of p70α (p70α-Lys-123 → Met) is similar in extent to that seen with wild-type p70α substrate (data not shown). These results show that the 32P incorporation into p70α occurring in the presence of mTOR is catalyzed by a mTOR-associated kinase and is not because of a stimulation of p70α autophosphorylation. To confirm that the phosphorylation of p70α by mTOR is dependent on the intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR, we compared the ability of a recombinant wild-type or kinase-negative mutant of mTOR to phosphorylate p70α in vitro (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to the robust 32P incorporation into p70α catalyzed by recombinant wild-type mTOR, no phosphorylation of p70α is detectable on incubation with the kinase-negative mutant of mTOR. We next examined the effects of mTOR kinase inhibitors on mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 1 D). Incubation of mTOR immunoprecipitates with a rapamycin-FKBP complex severely inhibits mTOR autophosphorylation, as well as the phosphorylation of p70α, whereas neither rapamycin or FKBP singly have any effect. Wortmannin, at a concentration previously shown to inhibit mTOR kinase toward eIF-4E BP in vitro also inhibits mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of p70α in vitro requires the intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR. To examine the effects of stimulation by mitogens and depletion of amino acids on the mTOR kinase activity, serum-deprived cells were treated with or without 10% serum in the presence of amino acids or incubated for up to 2 h in the amino acid-free buffer; mTOR was immunoprecipitated and assayed for kinase activity toward p70α. No significant alterations in the mTOR kinase toward p70α resulted from these treatments (data not shown); thus the effects of these perturbations on mTOR kinase activity toward p70α, if any, do not survive immunoprecipitation and washing. We employed a panel of anti-p70α phosphopeptide antibodies (21Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A.H. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol.

The phospho-specific immunoreactivity at all sites examined appeared to be increased by mTOR; however, this was most unmistakable with Thr-412 (Fig. 1, A and B), which exhibits no phospho-specific immunoreactivity prior to incubation with mTOR. Overall phospho-specific immunoreactivity at Thr-444/Ser-447 is also substantially increased over the initial level, whereas the response at Ser-434 is equivocal in that the modest apparent increase in overall phospho-specific immunoreactivity at Ser-434 may be entirely attributable to the upshift of a fraction of p70α polypeptides resulting from mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation at other sites with a consequent spreading of Ser-434-P immunoreactivity over a greater area. In view of the limitation of immunoblot for quantitative analysis, we compared the extent of mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into wild-type p70α with that observed using equal amounts of several p70α mutants as substrates. The p70α mutants examined were (i) p70α-5A in which five Ser/Thr-Pro sites (Ser-434, Ser-441, Thr-444, Ser-447, and Ser-452) in the carboxyl-terminal autoinhibitory domain are substituted by Ala; (ii) p70α-Thr-412 → Ala; (iii) p70α-ΔCT104 in which the carboxyl-terminal 104 amino acids are deleted and the protein terminates after Ser-421; (iv) p70α-ΔCT104/Thr-412 → Ala. The quantitative importance of Thr-412 as a site of mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation is clearly evident in Fig. 2; mutation of p70α Thr-412 to Ala reduces mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into full-length p70α by about 80% and into p70α-ΔCT104 by a similar extent; the mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into the p70α-ΔCT104/Thr-412 → Ala mutant is less than 10% of that seen with full-length p70α wild-type (Fig. 2 B). Thus, Thr-412 is a dominant site of mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation in vitro. Overall mTOR-catalyzed 32P incorporation into the p70α-5A mutant is diminished by about 25% compared with p70α wild-type, whereas 32P incorporation into the ΔCT104 mutant is diminished by 50–60%. These results indicate that a portion of mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation is directed to the carboxyl-terminal tail, at least half of which is into the Ser/Thr-Pro sites mutated in the 5A variant. This is consistent with the results of the anti-Thr-444/Ser-447-P immunoblots (Fig. 1, A andB, and Fig. 2 A). The lesser total 32P incorporation into p70α-ΔCT104 as compared with p70α-5A suggests that there might be phosphorylation site(s) other than the five Ser/Thr-Pro sites within the carboxyl-terminal 104 amino acids. One such site may be Ser-427, located in a Phe-Ser-Phe motif similar to that surrounding Thr-412. Another possible explanation is that the absence of the carboxyl-terminal 104 amino acids may impair the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate Thr-412. The phosphorylation of p70α Thr-412 is known to be critical for its S6 kinase activity and substitution of this residue with an acidic amino acid results in a substantial increase in “basal” S6 kinase activity (5Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A.H. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We therefore inquired whether the p70α kinase activity is increased by mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3, the p70α kinase activity shows a time-dependent increase on incubation with mTOR (Fig. 3 B), which parallels the extent of mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation at Thr-412 and Thr-444/Ser-447 detected by immunoblot (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, no S6 kinase activity is detectable in the absence of mTOR. To establish whether the activation of p70α in vitro requires the intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR, the recombinant wild-type and kinase-negative mutant of mTOR were employed for the assays (Fig. 3 C). As in Fig.3 A, incubation of p70α with wild-type mTOR significantly increased the S6 kinase activity, whereas no activation is detected on incubation of p70α with kinase-negative mTOR. These results clearly indicate that the kinase activity of p70α, which had been fully inactivated in vivo by the treatment of cells with rapamycin, was restored, at least in part, by the phosphorylationin vitro catalyzed by the kinase activity intrinsic to the mTOR catalytic domain. PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Thr-252 on the p70α activation loop is a critical and probably final step in the physiologic activation of p70α in vivo (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 8Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr-252 is regulated primarily by the accessibility of the p70α activation loop to PDK1, which in turn is controlled by a series of prior p70α phosphorylations. Phosphorylation of the multiple Ser/Thr-Pro motifs clustered in the psuedosubstrate autoinhibitory segment of the p70α carboxyl-terminal tail serves to disocclude the catalytic domain, greatly enhancing access to PDK1. A similar effect can be achieved by deletion of the p70α carboxyl-terminal tail (to give p70α-ΔCT104). At any level of PDK1 activity, the extent of Thr-252 phosphorylation of p70α-ΔCT104 is substantially greater than with a similar amount of full-length p70α polypeptide. In addition, the S6 kinase activity generated by any extent of PDK1-catalyzed Thr-252 phosphorylation is significantly higher for p70α-ΔCT104 as compared with full-length p70α. Displacement of the p70α carboxyl-terminal tail is also necessary for the phosphorylation of Thr-412 in vivo, and modification of Thr-412 itself significantly enhances the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr-252. In addition, the simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr-412 and Thr-252 appears to generate a synergistic activation of p70α. Thus, the substitution of Thr-412 by Glu in p70α-ΔCT104 alone gives a 6-fold increase in S6 kinase activity, and the PDK1 catalyzed phosphorylation of p70α-ΔCT104 Thr-252 alone gives a 15-fold increase, but the two modifications together give at least a 240-fold increase in S6 kinase activity over the unmodified p70α-ΔCT104 polypeptide (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The importance of the strong positively cooperative effect of Thr-252 and Thr-412 phosphorylation for the physiologic activation of p70α is illustrated by the response of p70α to the inhibitors rapamycin and wortmannin; these agents each cause a rapid dephosphorylation of Thr-412 but a slower and lesser dephosphorylation of Thr-252. Despite the preservation of Thr-252 phosphorylation, S6 kinase activity in the presence of rapamycin or wortmannin declines in parallel to Thr-412 dephosphorylation (21Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A.H. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In view of the ability of mTOR to catalyze the in vitrophosphorylation of p70α Thr-412 as well as sites within the autoinhibitory segment in the p70α carboxyl-terminal tail and the potential effects of such phosphorylations on the response of p70α to PDK1, we compared the p70α activation achieved in vitro by mTOR or PDK1 alone to that achieved by sequential phosphorylation by mTOR and PDK1 and to that achieved in vivo by stimulation of the cells with 10% serum. As shown in Fig.4, mTOR alone increased the S6 kinase activity of p70α in vitro by more than 10-fold, whereas PDK1 alone hardly activated p70α, presumably reflecting the relatively poor access of Thr-252 to PDK1 in full-length, inactive p70α as seen previously (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of p70α by PDK1 after a prior phosphorylation by mTOR increased the p70α activity by 10-fold over that engendered by mTOR alone, to a level roughly 70-fold greater than that generated by PDK1 acting alone. Moreover, the S6 kinase activity generated in vitro by the sequential action of mTOR and PDK1 is indistinguishable from that achieved in vivo by stimulation of cells with 10% serum (Fig. 4). The present results demonstrate that mTOR can catalyze directly the phosphorylation and activation of p70α in vitro. In addition, mTOR can activate p70α in a synergistic manner with PDK1in vitro, and it is likely that this occurs in vivo. Nevertheless, the nature of the physiologic inputs that control mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation and the relative contribution of mTOR-catalyzed p70α phosphorylation to overall p70α regulation in vivo are not clear. Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 cells with insulin has been reported to cause a modest (1.3–2-fold) increase in the ability of mTOR to catalyze eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylationin vitro. Moreover, coexpression with active protein kinase B may enhance mTOR kinase, although evidence for direct activation of mTOR by protein kinase B is lacking. On this basis, mTOR has been proposed to be an intermediate in the insulin/PI-3 kinase-dependent activation of p70α (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To the contrary, the ability of the rapamycin-resistant p70α-Δ2–46/ΔCT104 mutant to undergo insulin-stimulated, wortmannin-inhibitable Thr-412 phosphorylation and activation in the presence of concentrations of rapamycin far in excess of those required for complete inhibition of endogenous wild-type p70α and mTOR indicates that insulin-responsive kinases exist that are capable of p70α (Thr-412) phosphorylation and activation, other than mTOR (9Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of mTOR to insulin-stimulated p70α Thr-412 phosphorylation in vivo is unsettled but may be minor. Another possible role for the mTOR kinase is as the mediator of the amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of p70α; as yet however, direct evidence supporting amino acid regulation of the mTOR kinase activity is lacking (9Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). A plausible synthesis for the operation of the mTOR kinase in vivo is that insulin- and amino acid-induced signals each converge independently in the regulation of mTOR, although insulin also controls an alternative, mTOR-independent set of p70α-kinases. In turn, mTOR controls p70α through direct phosphorylation, as well as through the negative regulation of a p70α phosphatase. Gingras et al. (19Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) reported that mTOR phosphorylates eIF-4E BP1 in vitro primarily on Thr-37 and Thr-46; these phosphorylations do not themselves result in the release of eIF-4E but are required for the further phosphorylation on several carboxyl-terminal serum-sensitive sites, and these latter phosphorylations result in the release of eIF-4E. In the case of p70α, mTOR alone gives some activation, but by phosphorylating the Ser/Thr-Pro sites within the carboxyl-terminal 104 amino acids to improve access of PDK1 and by phosphorylating Thr-412, mTOR strongly promotes the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr-252. In both instances, mTOR phosphorylation acts primarily in a “priming” role rather than a sole activator. An intriguing and unresolved aspect of mTOR function is the apparent ability of its single catalytic domain to catalyze phosphorylation of Ser/Thr-Pro sites, such as those on eIF-4E BP1 and p70α Thr-444/Ser-447, as well as Phe-Ser/Thr-Phe/Tyr sites, such as p70α Thr-412. Although these two kinds of mTOR kinase activity appear differentially sensitive to detergent, they are both inhibited by rapamycin/FKBP-12 in vitro and by mutations in the mTOR kinase domain. Assuming both activities are physiologically meaningful, such a breadth in substrate specificity is relatively unprecedented among the protein kinases. Finally, it should be noted that Phe-Ser/Thr-Phe/Tyr motifs homologous to p70α Thr-412 are found in many kinases of the AGC (protein kinase A, G, and C) subclass, and it is of interest to note the recent report that PKCδ activation and phosphorylation at Ser-662 (in the context Phe-Ser-Phe) is inhibitable by rapamycin (23Ziegler W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2015893386,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are well characterized regulators of G protein-coupled receptors, whereas regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins directly control the activity of G protein α subunits. Interestingly, a recent report (Siderovski, D. P., Hessel, A., Chung, S., Mak, T. W., and Tyers, M. (1996) Curr. Biol. 6, 211–212) identified a region within the N terminus of GRKs that contained homology to RGS domains. Given that RGS domains demonstrate AlF4−-dependent binding to G protein α subunits, we tested the ability of G proteins from a crude bovine brain extract to bind to GRK affinity columns in the absence or presence of AlF4−. This revealed the specific ability of bovine brain Gαq/11 to bind to both GRK2 and GRK3 in an AlF4−-dependent manner. In contrast, Gαs, Gαi, and Gα12/13 did not bind to GRK2 or GRK3 despite their presence in the extract. Additional studies revealed that bovine brain Gαq/11 could also bind to an N-terminal construct of GRK2, while no binding of Gαq/11, Gαs, Gαi, or Gα12/13 to comparable constructs of GRK5 or GRK6 was observed. Experiments using purified Gαq revealed significant binding of both GαqGDP/AlF4− and Gαq(GTPγS), but not Gαq(GDP), to GRK2. Activation-dependent binding was also observed in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells as GRK2 significantly co-immunoprecipitated constitutively active Gαq(R183C) but not wild type Gαq. In vitro analysis revealed that GRK2 possesses weak GAP activity toward Gαq that is dependent on the presence of a G protein-coupled receptor. However, GRK2 effectively inhibited Gαq-mediated activation of phospholipase C-β both in vitro and in cells, possibly through sequestration of activated Gαq. These data suggest that a subfamily of the GRKs may be bifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling operating directly on both receptors and G proteins. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are well characterized regulators of G protein-coupled receptors, whereas regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins directly control the activity of G protein α subunits. Interestingly, a recent report (Siderovski, D. P., Hessel, A., Chung, S., Mak, T. W., and Tyers, M. (1996) Curr.

However, GRK2 effectively inhibited Gαq-mediated activation of phospholipase C-β both in vitro and in cells, possibly through sequestration of activated Gαq. These data suggest that a subfamily of the GRKs may be bifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling operating directly on both receptors and G proteins.

This information is translated into intracellular signals when agonist-bound GPCRs activate exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Activated, GTP-bound Gα (Gα(GTP)) then dissociates from Gβγ and each of these G protein components go onto regulate downstream effector molecules. In general the intracellular signal is limited by the presence of the extracellular stimuli and by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα. However, in order to selectively modulate the appropriate magnitude and duration of signals in diverse cellular contexts, several ubiquitous mechanisms are utilized to regulate these signaling cascades both at the level of the GPCR and at the level of the G protein. At the level of the GPCR, agonist-specific loss of receptor responsiveness involves a family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK1–6). GRKs phosphorylate the agonist-activated form of GPCRs which in turn promotes the high-affinity binding of a second family of proteins termed arrestins (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These interactions function to uncouple the GPCR from further G protein activation and to promote clathrin-mediated internalization of the receptor (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Initiation of this process is controlled by GRKs, which are, in turn, regulated by a variety of molecules including the activated GPCRs themselves, Gβγ subunits, PIP2, PKC, calmodulin, and caveolin (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The overall topology of GRKs includes a somewhat conserved catalytic domain of ∼270 residues which is flanked by N- and C-terminal regulatory domains. The C terminus is highly variable (∼100–230 residues) and has the general function of mediating membrane localization. For example, GRK2 and GRK3 possess a C-terminal plecktrin homology domain which binds to both PIP2 and free Gβγ promoting membrane recruitment and subsequent receptor phosphorylation (2Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ability of GRK2 and GRK3 to bind to Gβγ has also been implicated as playing a direct role in the regulation of G protein signaling via the sequestration of free Gβγ (4Koch W.J.

The ∼190 residue N terminus of GRKs is modestly conserved and has been suggested to contain receptor binding determinants (7Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, calmodulin (8Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V. Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

However, the overall structure and function of this domain has remained largely uncharacterized. At the level of the G protein, regulation occurs through intrinsic GTPase activity possessed by the Gα subunits which hydrolyze bound GTP and promote rebinding of Gβγ. This process has recently been found to be modulated by a ubiquitous family of proteins termed regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), which serve as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis and thereby limit the half-life of the activated species (10Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 11Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RGS proteins share a ∼120-residue region of homology termed an RGS domain which folds into an α-helical module that binds preferentially to the transition state of Gα (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This preferential binding to the transition state, which can be mimicked in vitro by the addition of GDP/AlF4−(13Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.L. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), compared with the active state, which can be stably generatedin vitro by addition of GTPγS, is thought to serve as the driving force for acceleration of GTPase activity (14Berman D.M.

In general, these RGS proteins interact with the α subunits of the Gi and Gq families (10Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Recently, one of these atypical RGS proteins, p115 Rho-GEF, was shown to function as a selective GAP for Gα12/13 suggesting that sequence differences in these RGS proteins may correlate with different preferences for G protein-binding partners (20Kozasa T.

To date, no functionality has been attributed to any of the other atypical RGS domains. Given that GRK2 and GRK3 represent well characterized components of GPCR regulation that are already known to bind to Gβγ subunits, we explored the possibility that these GRKs may interact with Gα subunits. These experiments revealed selective and high affinity binding of activated Gαq/11 to GRK2 and GRK3, an interaction that may function to regulate phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) activity in vivo.

M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M1AChR), PLC-β1, and PLC-β2 were purified from Sf9 cells and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles along with purified Gαq and Gβγ1/2 as described previously (27Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using standard methods (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride for peptide sequence analysis or nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed using Gαq/11-, Gαs-, Gαi-, Gα12/13-, α-tubulin-, actin-, GRK2-, Gβcommon-, HA-, or EE-specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution). Immunoblots were visualized by ECL following the manufacturer's guidelines. Two g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was hydrated and successively washed with 5 × 25 ml of 1 mm HCl. One mg of GRK2, GST-GRK2(1–178), GRK3, GST-GRK5(1–200), GST-GRK6(1–192), or GST was dialyzed against 3 × 500 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.6, 500 mm NaCl). Dialyzed proteins (or an equal volume of coupling buffer for mock) were mixed with a 1-ml bed volume of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Resins were then washed with 5 × 20 ml of coupling buffer and residual unreacted sites were blocked by incubation with 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 4 °C. Resins were then washed with 2 × 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100) containing 500 mm NaCl followed by 2 × 20 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and finally adjusted to 50% bed volume. Coupling efficiencies ranged from 85 to 95%. Fresh bovine calf brain was stripped of connective tissue and minced in ∼1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmbenzamidine, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2% Triton X-100) per mg of tissue using a Brinkman Polytron (14,000 rpm, 30 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min and the resulting supernatant at 300,000 × g for 60 min. The final supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. 250-μl aliquots (∼125 μg) of GRK-, GST-GRK-, GST-, or mock-coupled resins (50% bed volume) were incubated with 10 ml of the soluble brain extract (∼10 mg/ml total protein) and 10 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Lubrol, and 5% glycerol) with 100 μm GDP in the absence or presence of AlF4− (5 mmsodium fluoride and 30 μm AlCl3) for ∼12 h at 4 °C. The incubation mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 1 min and the pellet washed four times with buffer B containing 100 μm GDP in the absence or presence of AlF4−. Bound proteins were released from the pelleted resin by addition of 150 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 10 min. The eluted proteins were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A specific ∼42-kDa protein band was identified by Ponceau-S staining, excised, and subjected to peptide sequence analysis. Alternatively, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to immunoblot analysis. 0.5–5.0 μg of purified GRK2, GRK3, GST-GRK2(1–178), GST-GRK2(45–178), GST-GRK5(1–200), GST-GRK6(1–192), or GST immobilized on either CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B or glutathione-agarose beads were combined at 4 °C with 0.1–200 nm purified Gαq, Gαq (R183C), Gαs, Gαi1, or Gα12 in buffer B containing 100 μm GDP in the absence or presence of AlF4−. For binding curve experiments fixed amounts of Gαq and GRK2 affinity column were incubated in various volumes of binding buffer to produce the desired Gαq concentrations. For some experiments, Gα was preincubated in buffer B with either 1 mm GTP, 1 mm GTPγS, 1 mm GDP or 1 mmGDP/AlF4− at 25 °C for 2 h prior to addition to binding reactions. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and chilled on ice for 5 min. The resins were then pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10 s, washed three times with 400 μl of the appropriate binding buffers, and boiled with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using Gα-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation reactions contained, in a total volume of 20 μl, 30 nm GRK2 or GRK3, 200 nm Gαq, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 cpm/fmol), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2 in the absence or presence of one or more of the following: 100 μm GDP, AlF4−, 400 nm rhodopsin, or 60 nm Gβγ. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 0–60 min, stopped with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Gα GTPase activity was determined in solution using a single turnover assay essentially as described previously (20Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G.

Briefly, GTP-loaded Gαq(R183C), Gαs, Gαi1, Gαo, and Gα12 were generated by incubating Gα proteins in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP followed by gel filteration on G-25 Sephadex. Next, Gα([γ-32P]GTP) was incubated in the absence or presence of RGS4 (100 nm), GRK2 (300 nm), GST-GRK2(1–178) (500 nm), GST (500 nm), or control buffer. Reactions were quenched with 9 volumes of 5% (w/v) Norit A charcoal in 50 mmNaH2PO4. The charcoal was pelleted and the32Pi-containing supernatant was counted. Alternatively, the steady state GTPase activity was measured in phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with M1AChR and heterotrimeric Gq as described previously (27Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M.

Briefly, the vesicles were equilibrated for 5 min at 20 °C in the absence or presence of carbachol (1 mm) and RGS4 (50 nm), GRK2 (300 nm), GST-GRK2(1–178) (500 nm), or GST (500 nm) in buffer containing GTP (4 μm). The experiment was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]GTP (106 cpm) followed by incubation at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched and quantitated as above. Determination of Gαq-mediated activation of PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 activity was performed in vitro essentially as described previously (30Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G.

Briefly, lipid substrate was prepared by combining PIP2 and phosphatidylethanolamine (1:10) with [3H]PIP2 (5,000–10,000 cpm per assay) followed by sonication. Lipids were then combined with purified PLC-β1 or PLC-β2 in the absence or presence of purified Gαq(GDP)/AlF4− (150 nm) and 6 μm RGS4, GST-GRK2(1–178), or GST on ice. The incubation contained 50 μm PIP2, 50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.2, 3 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.83 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% ultrapure albumin (bovine), 0.16% sodium cholate, and 1.5 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 60 μl. Reactions were initiated by raising the temperature to 30 °C for 0–15 min and quenched by addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) and placing the reactions on ice. [3H]inositol 1,4,5-phosphate (IP3) (supernatant) was separated from unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. Released [3H]IP3 was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. COS-1 and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. COS-1 and HEK293 cells grown to 75–95% confluence were transfected with either 20 μg (100-mm plate) or 3 μg (12-well plate) of total DNA using FugeneTM according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100-mm plates of COS-1 or HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-GRK2 and pcDNA3-HA-Gαq, pcDNA3-HA-Gαq(R183C), pcDNA3-HA-Gαs, pcDNA3-HA-Gαs(R201C), pcDNA3-EE-Gαi2, or pcDNA3-EE-Gαi2(R179C) and in some experiments pcDNA3-M3AChR. At 24 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by addition of 1 ml of buffer-C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.7% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). For cells co-transfected with pcDNA3-M3AChR, cells were incubated for 0–60 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 μm carbachol prior to harvesting. Cells were scraped and homogenized with two 15-s bursts with a Brinkman Polytron (2500 rpm) and lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant removed. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with 4 μg of either GRK2- or pol II-specific polyclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in buffer C and an additional 60-min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 s in a microcentrifuge and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer C each for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 10 min. Initial supernatants, as well as elutions from immunoprecipitation reactions, were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using GRK2- and HA-specific monoclonal antibodies. Measurement of inositol phosphate production in cells was essentially as described previously (32Parent J.-L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells per well in 12-well plates and transfected with the thromboxane A2-α receptor (TXA2Rα), M3AChR, or vector (pcDNA3) and a variety of GRK or RGS constructs (pcDNA3-GRK2, pcDNA3-GRK2(K220R), pcDNA3-HA-GRK2(45–178), pcDNA3-HA-GRK2(468–689), pcDNA3-GRK3, pcDNA3-GRK3(K220R), pcDNA3-GRK5, pcDNA3-GRK6, pB6-RGS4, and pB6-GAIP). The following day, cells were labeled for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol at 4 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose without inositol). After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated for 10 min with 100 nm U46619 (TXA2Rα) or 100 μm carbachol (M3AChR). The reactions were terminated by removing the stimulation media and adding 0.8 ml of 0.4 m perchloric acid to the cells. Samples were harvested in Eppendorf tubes and 0.4 ml of 0.72 n KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3 was added. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. Total inositol phosphates were separated on Dowex AG1-X8 columns, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA-Gαq or pcDNA3-HA-Gαq(R183C) (instead of the GPCR constructs) and various GRK or RGS constructs as stated above. For these experiments inositol phosphate measurement was as described above with the exception that these cells were not stimulated with agonist. Whereas the central catalytic and C-terminal domains of GRKs have been well characterized, the overall structure and function of the ∼190 residue N-terminal domain has remained relatively uncharacterized (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Siderovski et al.(17Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 211-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) identified sequence homology between RGS domains and an ∼120 residue region in the N terminus of GRKs through a BLAST search of the NCBI protein data base (17Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 211-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Indeed, both GRK2 and GRK3 (residues 51–173) are ∼20% identical and ∼30% similar to various RGS domains (Fig. 1). This compares with an average of 44% identity (∼54% similarity) shared among various RGS proteins. Importantly, the majority of the conserved hydrophobic residues shown to make up the hydrophobic core of the RGS domain (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar,15Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) are shared throughout the GRK family (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This suggests that the N terminus of GRKs may have a three-dimensional topology that is similar to RGS domains. Residues thought to be critical for Gα binding and GAP activity in most RGS proteins are only partially conserved by GRK2 and GRK3 (Fig. 1) (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

However, p115 Rho-GEF, a new member of the RGS family that serves as a GAP for Gα12/13, also exhibits only partial conservation of these residues compared with other RGS proteins (Fig. 1) (20Kozasa T.

Finally, it is noteworthy that residues previously defined as conserved caveolin binding determinants in GRKs (residues 60–73 in GRK2 and GRK3 (3Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2009945174,"We investigated the EGL-30 (Gqα) pathway in C. elegans by using genetic screens to identify genes that confer phenotypes similar to egl-30 mutants. One such gene, egl-8, encodes a phospholipase Cβ that is present throughout the nervous system and near intestinal cell junctions. EGL-30 and EGL-8 appear to positively regulate synaptic transmission because reducing their function results in strong aldicarb resistance and slow locomotion rates. In contrast, GOA-1 (Goα) and DGK-1 (diacylglycerol kinase) appear to negatively regulate synaptic transmission, because reducing their function results in strong aldicarb hypersensitivity and hyperactive locomotion. A genetic analysis suggests that GOA-1 negatively regulates the EGL-30 pathway and that DGK-1 antagonizes the EGL-30 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2058615553,"How simple neuronal circuits control behavior is not well understood at the molecular or genetic level. In Caenorhabditis elegans, foraging behavior consists of long, forward movements interrupted by brief reversals. To determine how this pattern is generated and regulated, we have developed novel perturbation techniques that allow us to depolarize selected neurons in vivo using the dominant glutamate receptor mutation identified in the Lurcher mouse. Transgenic worms that expressed a mutated C. elegans glutamate receptor in interneurons that control locomotion displayed a remarkable and unexpected change in their behavior-they rapidly alternated between forward and backward coordinated movement. Our findings suggest that the gating of movement reversals is controlled in a partially distributed fashion by a small subset of interneurons and that this gating is modified by sensory input."

https://openalex.org/W1965785388,"Inductive signals cause conversion of mesenchyme into epithelia during the formation of many organs. Yet a century of study has not revealed the inducing molecules. Using a standard model of induction, we found that ureteric bud cells secrete factors that convert kidney mesenchyme to epithelia that, remarkably, then form nephrons. Purification and sequencing of one such factor identified it as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF acted on epithelial precursors that we identified by the expression of Pax2 and Wnt4. Other IL-6 type cytokines acted like LIF, and deletion of their shared receptor reduced nephron development. In situ, the ureteric bud expressed LIF, and metanephric mesenchyme expressed its receptors. The data suggest that IL-6 cytokines are candidate regulators of mesenchymal to epithelial conversion during kidney development."
https://openalex.org/W2118509956,"C. elegans detects several odorants with the bilaterally symmetric pair of AWC olfactory neurons. A stochastic, coordinated decision ensures that the candidate odorant receptor gene str-2 is expressed in only one AWC neuron in each animal--either the left or the right neuron, but never both. An interaction between the two AWC neurons generates asymmetric str-2 expression in a process that requires normal axon guidance and probably AWC axon contact. This interaction induces str-2 expression by reducing calcium signaling through a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and the CaM kinase II UNC-43. CaMKII activity acts as a switch in the initial decision to express str-2; thus, calcium signals can define distinct cell types during neuronal development. A cGMP signaling pathway that is used in olfaction maintains str-2 expression after the initial decision has been made."
https://openalex.org/W2061260576,"Synapsins constitute a family of synaptic vesicle proteins essential for regulating neurotransmitter release. Only two domains are conserved in all synapsins: a short N-terminal A domain with a single phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and CaM Kinase I, and a large central C domain that binds ATP and may be enzymatic. We now demonstrate that synapsin phosphorylation in the A domain, at the only phosphorylation site shared by all synapsins, dissociates synapsins from synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, we show that the A domain binds phospholipids and is inhibited by phosphorylation. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which proteins reversibly bind to membranes using a phosphorylation-dependent phospholipid-binding domain. The dynamic association of synapsins with synaptic vesicles correlates with their role in activity-dependent plasticity."

However, the chemical biology of NO- remains largely unknown. Here, we show that NO- -unlike NO*, but reminiscent of NO+ transfer (or S-nitrosylation)- -reacts mainly with Cys-399 in the NR2A subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor to curtail excessive Ca2+ influx and thus provide neuroprotection from excitotoxic insults. This effect of NO- closely resembles that of NOS, which also downregulates NMDA receptor activity under similar conditions in culture."

Retrograde intracellular transport and translocation of ricin was studied under conditions that alter the sensitivity of cells to the toxin.

Pihl A. FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Olsnes S. Heiberg R. Pihl A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1973; 1: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The toxin is a heterodimer consisting of an A-chain and a B-chain that are linked by a disulfide bond (3Olsnes S. Pihl A. FEBS Lett. 1972; 28: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Olsnes S. Pihl A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3121-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The B-chain has lectin properties and binds to surface structures containing terminal galactose (5Olsnes S. Refsnes K. Pihl A. Nature. 1974; 249: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The A-chain is an enzyme that acts on ribosomes by removing an adenine residue from an exposed loop in the 28 S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit without breaking the phosphoribose backbone of the RNA (6Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loop is involved in binding of elongation factors (8Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Holmberg L. Nygård O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and after toxin treatment, the elongation factors bind poorly, and protein synthesis stops. Upon binding to the cell surface, the toxin is taken up by endocytosis (10van Deurs B. Petersen O.W. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 131-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and a minor fraction (∼5%) is transported to the Golgi apparatus (11van Deurs B. Tønnessen T.I. Petersen O.W. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and from there it is further transported retrogradely to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 where the A-chain appears to be translocated to the cytosol (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). On the other hand, evidence for translocation from endosomes has also been reported (13Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In attempts to elucidate if translocation from the ER is the main entry route, we have applied a number of conditions that increase or reduce the toxin sensitivity of cells and studied intracellular trafficking and membrane translocation of the toxin. It is an old observation that cells depleted for calcium or kept at moderately acidic conditions are partly protected against ricin (15Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7495-7503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment with low concentrations of monensin increases the sensitivity of cells to ricin, whereas higher concentrations provide a partial protection (16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In neither case could the changed sensitivity be accounted for by altered rates of endocytosis or altered enzymatic action on ribosomes, and we have therefore here considered the possibility that it could be due to interference with the transport of the toxin from endosomes to the ER or to interference with translocation of the A-chain from ER to cytosol. A mutant ricin A-chain containing a C-terminal KDEL sequence was shown to be more toxic than wild-type ricin (17Wales R. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Tagge E. Chandler J. Tang B.L. Hong W.J. Willingham M.C. Frankel A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that this was due to increased transport to the ER. In the present work we have taken advantage of a recently developed system where we fused tyrosine sulfation and N-glycosylation signals onto the C-terminal end of ricin A-chain (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Tyrosine sulfation takes place in the Golgi apparatus and in the trans-Golgi network (19Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when ricin containing the sulfation signal is added to cells growing in medium containing35SO42−, that minority of toxin molecules that is transported to the Golgi apparatus becomes labeled selectively. Furthermore, the addition of glycosylation sites onto the toxin A-chain allows us to follow the labeled toxin to the ER (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When the toxin reaches this organelle, the A-chain becomes glycosylated, which can easily be monitored by a decreased migration rate in SDS-PAGE. We here provide evidence that monensin interferes with transport of ricin from the cell surface to the Golgi apparatus, whereas depletion of calcium and reduced pH do not but instead, inhibit translocation of the A-chain across the ER membrane. KDEL-tagged ricin is more efficiently transported from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. Finally, we present evidence that ricin utilizes the ER translocon for retrograde translocation to the cytosol. Na235SO4 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hepes medium: bicarbonate-free Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered with 20 mm Hepes to pH 7.4. PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2. Lysis buffer: PBS, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Rabbit anti-ricin was obtained by standard immunization. Rabbit antibodies against the C terminus of Sec61α was a gift from Dr. Thomas Sommer, Max-Delbruck-Centrum, Berlin. Rabbit anti-human immunodeficiency virus-Tat was obtained from ImmunoDiagnostics. Lactacystin was provided by Dr. E. J. Corey, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Cells were maintained and propagated under standard conditions (5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum). Two days before the experiment, the cells were seeded into 12- or 24-well Costar plates at a density of 105 and 5 × 104 cells/well, respectively. Ricin A-chain-sulf1 and ricin A-chain-sulf2 were prepared as described (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To form ricin A-sulf2-KDEL, a C-terminal extension was introduced by polymerase chain reaction using pMal-CN-RA-sulf2 as template and 5′-GCAATCACTCATCTTTTCACTGATGTTC-3′ as forward primer and 5′-GCGTAAGCTTTATCACATAATGACGCACTGGGATGTGTTATTTTTGGTGCCGTT-3′ as reverse primer. The product was cut with BglII andHindIII and cloned into pMAL-cN-RA-sulf2 that had been cut with the same enzymes. All plasmids were transfected intoEscherichia coli DH5α. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, bacteria were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the clear supernatant was applied to a column with amylose resin. The fusion proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Free ricin A-chain (with a modified C terminus) was cleaved off with factor Xa, mixed with ricin B-chain, and dialyzed extensively against PBS to remove reducing agents and allow a disulfide bridge to be formed between the two chains, as described in Rapaket al. (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In an alternative way, to produce mutant ricin A-chain, the ricin-A-sulf2 construct was cloned into the expression vector pUTA (21Day P.J. Ernst S.R. Frankel A.E. Monzingo A.F. Pascal J.M. Molina-Svinth M.C. Robertus J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11098-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using standard procedures. The mutant A-chain was expressed and purified as described (21Day P.J. Ernst S.R. Frankel A.E. Monzingo A.F. Pascal J.M. Molina-Svinth M.C. Robertus J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11098-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Vero cells were incubated with increasing amounts of toxin for 4 h in Hepes medium without leucine. The cells were then transferred to Hepes medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine and no unlabeled leucine and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, followed by a brief wash in 5% trichloroacetic acid and subsequently dissolved in 0.1 mKOH. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Vero cells were incubated with35SO42− and reconstituted ricin for 4 h. Then 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide was added, and the cells were further incubated for 10 min and subsequently washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 mlactose. The cells were then placed on ice, and 2 μg/ml SLO preactivated with 10 mm 2-mercaptomethanesulfonic acid in Hepes medium, pH 7.5, was added as described (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After 10 min the cells were washed briefly to remove unbound toxin and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C for permeabilization to occur. Subsequently, the cells were kept on ice for an additional 30 min to allow components of the cytosol to diffuse into the buffer, which was collected. Finally, the cells were scraped from the dish, centrifuged, and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The lysate and buffer were exposed to immobilized anti-ricin antibodies, and the adsorbed material was subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, as indicated. The gels were fixed in 4% acetic acid, 27% methanol for 30 min, and then, in the case of proteins labeled with Na235SO4, treated with 1m sodium salicylate, pH 5.8, in 2% glycerol for 30 min. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films at −80 °C for fluorography. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, the nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was treated with antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The adsorbed material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. To compare the intensity of bands in polyacrylamide gels, the gels were scanned with a Personal Densitometer SI with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To correct for the background, adjacent areas of the gels with the same size but containing no visible bands were scanned, and the values obtained were subtracted from those obtained with the bands of interest. Ricin A-chain was modified to contain a C-terminal tyrosine sulfation signal without (ricin A-sulf1) and with (ricin A-sulf2) three partly overlappingN-glycosylation sites. In one case (ricin A-sulf2-KDEL) a C-terminal KDEL sequence was added as well (Fig.1 A). The constructs were expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein to allow their purification on an amylose column. Subsequently, the maltose-binding protein was cleaved off with factor Xa, a site that had been inserted between the two proteins. The modified A-chains were reconstituted with ricin B-chain to form holotoxins. In the following the reconstituted toxins will be referred to as wild-type ricin, ricin-sulf1, ricin-sulf2, and ricin-sulf2-KDEL. When increasing concentrations of the reconstituted toxins were added to Vero and U2OS cells and the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured after 4 h, there was in all cases a dose-dependent reduction in incorporated radioactivity that did not differ much from that obtained with wild-type ricin (Fig. 1, A and B). Ricin-sulf2-KDEL was somewhat more toxic than the parent ricin-sulf2, particularly in U20S cells. Incubation of cells for shorter times (1 or 2 h) gave similar results (data not shown). This demonstrates that the alterations introduced into ricin A-chain did not strongly interfere with the toxic effect. When ricin-sulf-2 was added to cells in the presence of Na235SO4, two labeled bands were observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) in accordance with earlier data (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The lower band represents the unglycosylated form of ricin-A-sulf2, and the upper band represents the glycosylated form (gA). When a C-terminal KDEL sequence was added (ricin-sulf2-KDEL), the amount of unglycosylated protein was considerably reduced (lane 2), suggesting that the KDEL sequence increased transport of the protein to the ER. The presence of brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi apparatus, completely prevented sulfation of ricin-A-sulf2-KDEL (Fig.2 B, lane 2) as we have earlier found with ricin-A-sulf-2 (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin prevented the appearance of the heavier band (lane 3), confirming that this band represents the glycosylated form of ricin-A-sulf2-KDEL. When low concentrations of monensin (0.01–0.1 μm) were added to the culture medium, the cells were approximately 3-fold more sensitive to ricin than in the absence of the compound (Fig.3, A and B). In the presence of higher concentrations (1–10 μm monensin), the sensitivity to the toxin was somewhat reduced. This is in accordance with earlier observations (16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monensin affects the structure of the Golgi apparatus, which swells up at higher concentrations (23Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To study if the altered sensitivity was due to altered transport to or altered function of the Golgi apparatus, we measured the ability of ricin-sulf2 to be sulfated and glycosylated in the presence of monensin. The results in Fig. 3,C and D, demonstrate that at the lower concentrations of monensin there was a moderate increase in labeling of the toxin with sulfate, whereas at the higher concentrations, the labeling was considerably reduced. This indicates that low concentrations of monensin increase the transport of toxin to the Golgi apparatus, whereas higher concentrations either inhibit the transport or reduce the labeling due to swelling of the Golgi apparatus. On the other hand, the relative fraction of labeled toxin that became glycosylated was not affected, as the relation between the two labeled bands was approximately the same at the different concentrations of monensin (Fig. 3, E and F). The data therefore indicate that monensin interferes either with the transport of toxin to the Golgi apparatus or with the sulfate labeling but not with the further retrograde transport to the ER. The electrophoresis was carried out under nonreducing conditions, and in Fig. 3 C the gel was run to also visualize the separated chains to check to what extent cell-induced reduction of the toxin A- and B-chains had taken place. Such cell-mediated reduction could be a requirement for translocation to the cytosol. The data demonstrate that monensin did not strongly influence the relative amount of toxin that was reduced by the cells. Altogether, there is good correlation between the toxic effect on cells and labeling of the toxin and subsequent glycosylation. The findings are therefore consistent with the possibility that transport through the Golgi apparatus to the ER is necessary for intoxication. When the cell culture medium is slightly acidified under conditions that do not inhibit endocytosis from coated pits (24Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the cells are partly protected against ricin (16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig.4, A and B, demonstrate that this is also the case with ricin-A-sulf2 and ricin-sulf2-KDEL. Experiments using radioactive sulfate showed that there was no reduction in the labeling and glycosylation of the protein at low pH (Fig. 4 C). In fact, in some cases there was rather an increased labeling of the toxin. In Vero cells the KDEL construct was less labeled than the parent ricin-sulf2, but there was no difference between the two pH values with respect to sulfate labeling and glycosylation. It therefore appears that incubation at slightly acidic pH provides protection against ricin by a mechanism occurring after the toxin has reached the ER. To test if the altered sensitivity to ricin in cells incubated at pH 6.5 was due to interference with the translocation of the A-chain to the cytosol, we treated the cells with SLO to selectively permeabilize the surface membrane (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Bhakdi S. Bayley H. Valeva A. Valev I Walker B. Weller U. Kehoe M. Palmer M. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Bhakdi S. Weller U. Walev I. Martin E. Jonas D. Palmer M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 182: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and release soluble proteins from the cytosol into the buffer. Due to technical problems in carrying out SLO experiments with U2OS cells, the experiments were performed only with Vero cells. After centrifugation, we then analyzed the buffer and the cellular pellet for labeled material. In a previous paper it was shown that mainly the glycosylated form of ricin-A-sulf2 was found in the cytosol after SLO treatment (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, the data in Fig. 4 D demonstrate that mainly glycosylated ricin-A-sulf2 was recovered from the cytosol of cells kept at pH 7.5. In cells incubated at pH 6.5 very little material was found in the cytosol, indicating that the translocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol was inhibited. A brief exposure to medium with neutral pH was, however, sufficient to allow the A-chain to appear in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). When cells were briefly treated with EGTA and then incubated in Ca2+-free medium, they were found to be less sensitive to wild-type ricin than cells kept in normal medium (15Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7495-7503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 5,A and B, this is also the case with ricin-sulf2 and ricin-sulf2-KDEL. When cells were incubated with mutated ricin in the presence of35SO42−, two labeled bands were obtained corresponding to glycosylated and nonglycosylated A-chain both with and without Ca2+ depletion (Fig. 5 C). This indicates that depletion of Ca2+ does not inhibit transport of toxin to the ER. Translocation of misfolded proteins to the cytosol for degradation requires normal Ca2+ concentration in the ER (27Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In cells depleted for Ca2+, the concentration of Ca2+ in the ER is reduced (28Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To investigate if the depletion of Ca2+ inhibits the translocation to the cytosol of ricin, we permeabilized the cells with SLO and analyzed the cytosol. In the Ca2+-depleted cells, the translocation from the ER to the cytosol was strongly inhibited (Fig. 5 D). Also in this case a short exposure of the cells to normal medium containing Ca2+ was sufficient to let the A-chain appear in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). It has been reported that misfolded proteins that are translocated retrograde from the ER to the cytosol become ubiquitinated by a membrane-bound enzyme and thereby targeted for degradation by proteasomes in the cytosol (29Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 30Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 31Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To study if ricin A-chain is partially degraded by proteasomes, we tested if an inhibitor of proteasomes, lactacystin, is able to sensitize cells to ricin. The data in Fig.6, A and B, demonstrate that in the presence of lactacystin, the cells were approximately 3-fold more sensitive to ricin than in the absence of the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the amount of sulfate-labeled and glycosylated A-chain in the whole cells was essentially the same with and without lactacystin. On the other hand, the amount of A-chain present in the cytosolic fraction after SLO treatment of the cells was approximately 3-fold higher when the activity of the proteasomes was inhibited by lactacystin (Fig. 6 D). The data therefore indicate that although a fraction of ricin A-chain translocated to the cytosol is able to escape degradation, a considerable part is degraded by the proteasomes. To study if lactacystin and calcium sensitize the cells by acting at the same or different steps in the intoxication process, we tested the sensitivity of cells in the presence of each component as well as their combination. The data in Fig. 7 demonstrate that compared with Ca2+-depleted cells, calcium and lactacystin sensitized the cells to wild-type ricin to approximately the same extent. The combination of the two conditions sensitized the cells to an extent corresponding to an additive effect of the two conditions. The data therefore indicate that lactacystin and calcium sensitize the cells to ricin by two independent mechanisms. Several recent studies have provided evidence that misfolded ER proteins destined for degradation are first transported to the cytosol in a Sec61p-dependent manner before being degraded by proteasomes (32Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 33Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 35Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To test if ricin also interacts with the Sec61p translocon, we first incubated cells with35SO42− and ricin-sulf1 (Fig. 8, panel A) or ricin-sulf2 (Fig. 8, panel B). After a 4-h incubation, we lysed the cells and subjected the lysate to sequential immunoprecipitation. In a first round we used an irrelevant antibody (anti-HSP90 (Fig. 8 A) or anti-human immunodeficiency virus-Tat (Fig. 8 B)) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Subsequently, we incubated the same lysate with antibodies against Sec61α coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Finally, the lysate was incubated with immobilized anti-ricin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 8, A andB, no ricin was precipitated with the control antibodies, whereas a small amount of sulfated and glycosylated ricin was precipitated with anti-Sec61α. Control experiments demonstrated that the antibodies used did not precipitate 125I-labeled ricin as such (data not shown). Interestingly, in the material immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec61α in Fig. 8, panel B, the relation between the glycosylated and the nonglycosylated form of ricin A-chain was 1.6 and 1.9, whereas in the immunoprecipitate with anti-ricin antibodies, the relation was only 0.9. Clearly, the glycosylated form of the A-chain is preferentially associated with Sec61p. The data indicate that ricin interacts with the Sec61p complex in the ER. When compared with the total amount of labeled ricin in the cells, the amount immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec61α was found to be 0.93% in the case of Fig. 8 Aand 0.58 and 0.63% in the case of Fig. 8 B. When the cells were kept in the absence of Ca2+, where translocation of the A-chain to the cytosol is inhibited, we were not able to immunoprecipitate more ricin A-chain with anti-Sec61α than from cells kept under normal conditions (data not shown). This indicates that in calcium-depleted cells the inhibition of translocation is at a step before the A-chain interacts with Sec61p. Previously we provided direct evidence that ricin is transported retrograde through the Golgi apparatus to the ER and subsequently translocated to the cytosol (12Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but we did not exclude the possibility that there could be other translocation routes that could be more efficient. It has been reported that ricin can be translocated from endosomes (13Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that transport through the Golgi apparatus may not be required (36Takeda Y. Kurazono H. Yamasaki S. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 37: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present paper we have investigated in detail the effect on transport and translocation of different conditions that decrease or enhance the sensitivity of cells to the toxin. Under these conditions the toxic effect correlated with transport to the Golgi apparatus and translocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol. Certain toxins have a C-terminal KDEL or KDEL-like sequence (37Chaudhary V.K. Jinno Y. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17376-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to act as an ER retrieval signal. It has been proposed that the KDEL system could facilitate transport of toxins to the ER (39Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Wild-type ricin does not contain a KDEL sequence, but addition of this sequence to the C terminus of the isolated A-chain of ricin increased its toxicity to a varying extent in different cells (18Tagge E. Chandler J. Tang B.L. Hong W.J. Willingham M.C. Frankel A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Wales R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23986-23990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To check the effect of the KDEL sequence on the transport of ricin to the ER, we added this sequence to the C terminus of ricinA-sulf2. Ricin-sulf2-KDEL was more efficiently transported to the ER in U20S cells than the parent ricin-sulf2, and it was more toxic. Interestingly, ricin-sulf2-KDEL was labeled very weakly in Vero cells. Possibly, in these cells the mutant leaves the Golgi apparatus quickly such that sulfation is incomplete. Ricin-sulf2-KDEL was more extensively glycosylated in U2OS cells at lower pH, indicating more efficient transport to the ER, possibly due to a higher affinity to the KDEL receptor at lower pH (41Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monensin, which is a carboxylic ionophore, prevents at higher concentrations acidification of intracellular compartments (23Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting the degradation of ricin by lysosomes. Also, endosomes and the Golgi apparatus swell in the presence of the drug, and the transport to and through the Golgi stacks is inhibited. The effect of submicromolar concentrations of monensin is less well understood. At lower concentrations of monensin, there was increased labeling of the toxin and increased toxicity. This supports earlier findings that transport of the toxin to and through the Golgi apparatus is required for intoxication (42Yoshida T. Chen C. Zhang M. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Earlier it was demonstrated that the toxicity of ricin is reduced in cells depleted for calcium, incubated at slightly reduced pH or in the presence of high concentrations of monensin, although the binding of ricin to cells and endocytosis of the toxin was not altered under these conditions (15Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7495-7503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the rate of inactivation of ribosomes in a cell-free system was not inhibited. When cells are kept in Ca2+-free medium, the concentration of Ca2+ in the ER rapidly decreases from 500–600 μm to about 150 μm (28Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is known that calcium plays an important role in the translocation of proteins across the ER membrane (44Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The majority of chaperones, like BiP, protein disulfide isomerase, GRP94, calnexin, and calreticulin, which could assist ricin during translocation, are calcium-dependent (45Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 46Helenius A. Tombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). BiP is supposed to close the lumenal end of the Sec61p translocation channel (47Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and would therefore have to be removed before ricin A-chain could enter the pore. Reduced calcium concentration could interfere with this process. Importantly, a decrease in the Ca2+ concentration in the ER of yeast due to a mutated Ca2+ pump resulted in an inability of the cells to degrade misfolded carboxypeptidase Y (27Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), a process occurring by the proteasomes after retrograde transport of the protein to the cytosol (48Hiller M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). A moderate reduction in pH of the medium (from 7.5 to 6.5) was also found to strongly reduce the translocation of ricin A-chain from the ER to the cytosol. The reason for this is not clear. A reduction in extracellular pH will only moderately reduce the pH of the cytosol due to the correcting effect of the Na+/H+exchanger (49Tonnessen T.I. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1117-C1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is operative in the bicarbonate-free Hepes medium used. The pH in the ER is close to that in the cytosol (50Kim J.H. Johannes L. Goud B. Antony C. Lingwood C.A. Daneman R. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it would be expected to be slightly lowered by the transfer of the cells from the regular medium to the pH 6.5 medium. The question of whether the slightly reduced pH in the ER or that in the cytosol is the reason for the reduced translocation efficiency remains to be elucidated. It is known that certain proteins may be transported retrograde from the ER to the cytosol. Wiertz et al. (30Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) provided evidence that this retrograde transport is mediated by the Sec61p channel. The HCMV gene US2 product bound to newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains and the complex formed was rapidly transported from the ER to the cytosol, deglycosylated byN-glycanase, and subsequently degraded by the proteasomes (51Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Also, it was demonstrated in yeast that misfolded secretory proteins in the ER are exported via the Sec61p channel to the cytosol for degradation (48Hiller M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 52Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using two cold-sensitive mutants of Sec61 at a temperature permissive for protein import, membranes were deficient for export of misfolded secretory proteins, which remained associated with Sec61p. In the presence of ATP and cytosol, the misfolded secretory protein was released from wild-type Sec61p and degraded. Mutations in two other translocon components, Sec62 and Sec63, only slightly affected export (34Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In in vivo experiments using a mutated lumenal yeast carboxypeptidase Y, Sec63p and Kar2p (BiP) were found to be involved in export of carboxypeptidase Y to the cytosol for degradation (35Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We have found here that the toxin interacts with Sec61p. Compared with the total amount of labeled ricin in the cells, only a small fraction (0.6–0.9%) is associated with Sec61p. The reason for this could be that only a small fraction of the toxin A-chain is in the process of translocating at any time or that the association is weak and that only a minor part does not dissociate during the immunoprecipitation. In the absence of Ca2+ the translocation is inhibited. However, this inhibition appears to be at some step before the translocation, since we were not able to immunoprecipitate more ricin A-chain with anti-Sec61α under these conditions. A protein bound to the ER membrane, Cue1p, is a component of a ubiquitin system that interacts with the soluble Ubc7p enzyme at the ER surface. In the absence of Cue1p, the degradation substrates remained inside the ER, indicating that ubiqutination is an important process during retrograde transport from the ER to the cytosol (53Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that ricin may use the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway for entry into the cytosol (54Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), we used a specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. Lactacystin increased the toxicity of both wild-type ricin and ricin mutants approximately 3-fold as well the amount of free A-chain in the cytosol. This indicates that a fraction of the A-chain translocated to the cytosol is degraded by the proteasomes. Possibly, therefore, the toxin may use the same translocation mechanism, as defect or misfolded proteins employ during transport through the Sec61p channel for destruction by the proteasomes. However, for toxins to kill the cell, they must at least to some extent avoid proteasome degradation. It was proposed that toxins that are translocated from the ER could be inefficiently ubiquitinylated due to a low lysine content of the A chain (55Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the course of evolution, ricin A-chain may have learned how to behave like a misfolded protein in the ER and as a correctly folded one after it has been translocated to the cytosol. We are indebted to Drs. Kirsten Sandvig and Pål Ø. Falnes for their critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2068551564,"Cytoplasmic transport and localization of mRNA has been reported for a range of oocytes and somatic cells. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 response element (A2RE) is a 21-nucleotide segment of the myelin basic protein mRNA that is necessary and sufficient for cytoplasmic transport of this message in oligodendrocytes. The predominant A2RE-binding protein in rat brain has previously been identified as hnRNP A2. Here we report that an 11-nucleotide subsegment of the A2RE (A2RE11) was as effective as the full-length A2RE in binding hnRNP A2 and mediating transport of heterologous RNA in oligodendrocytes. Point mutations of the A2RE11 that eliminated binding to hnRNP A2 also markedly reduced the ability of these oligoribonucleotides to support RNA transport. Oligodendrocytes treated with antisense oligonucleotides directed against the translation start site of hnRNP A2 had reduced levels of this protein and disrupted transport of microinjected myelin basic protein RNA. Several A2RE-like sequences from localized neuronal RNAs also bound hnRNP A2 and promoted RNA transport in oligodendrocytes. These data demonstrate the specificity of A2RE recognition by hnRNP A2, provide direct evidence for the involvement of hnRNP A2 in cytoplasmic RNA transport, and suggest that this protein may interact with a wide variety of localized messages that possess A2RE-like sequences."

However, little is known about the sequence of events that lead to ischemic neuronal death. Understanding these events at the molecular level is essential for developing treatments to prevent or reduce ischemic injury to the brain. A considerable amount of evidence suggests that excitotoxic overactivation of glutamate receptors, especially those of theN-methyl-d-aspartate-type, contributes to ischemia-induced neuronal cell death (5Olney J.W.

SinceN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are highly permeable to Ca2+, influx of extracellular Ca2+is considered to be the primary event responsible for glutamate toxicity (11MacDermott A.B. Mayer M.L.

Although the mechanism of this increased Ca2+-induced neurotoxicity is not completely understood, we speculated that calcineurin, a Ca2+-regulated protein, may be associated with the neurotoxicity because the areas of the brain that are most vulnerable to ischemia (12Crain B.J.

Moreover, there is both direct and indirect evidence that calcineurin can mediate apoptosis in certain types of cells, including neurons (18Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J.

A 61-kDa catalytic subunit, calcineurin A, contains the catalytic, calcineurin B-binding, calmodulin-binding, and autoinhibitory domains. Deletion mutants lacking the latter two domains have constitutively active phosphatase activity not associated with Ca2+/calmodulin (24Zhao Y. Tozawa Y. Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6346-6354PubMed Google Scholar). Calcineurin A is abundantly expressed in several areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, striatum, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and hippocampus, as well as in cardiac cells and other tissues (25Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar, 26Sussman M.A. Lim H.W.

Calcineurin A expression is especially high in hippocampal CA1 neurons (17Goto S. Matsukado Y. Mihara Y. Inoue N. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1986; 397: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of high level calcineurin expression in the brain, however, remains largely unknown. The known substrates for calcineurin include nitric oxide synthases (28Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)1 (29Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (30Tong G. Shepherd D. Jahr C.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and others (27Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). Among the diverse function of calcineurin, its role in the immune system is relatively well understood. T-cell receptor/CD3-initiated T-cell activation and the subsequent immune response cascade is mediated by NF-AT-promoted production of cytokines. Calcineurin activates NF-AT by dephosphorylating and translocating it into the nucleus, where, together with AP-1, it transactivates the transcription of interleukin-2, interleukin-3, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor α, and other proteins (29Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 31Tocci M.J. Matkovich D.A. Collier K.A. Kwok P. Dumont F. Lin S. Degudicibus S. Siekierka J.J. Chin J. Hutchinson N.I. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 718-726PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of calcineurin in association with apoptosis are also well described in this field. In T-cell hybridomas, anti-CD3/activation-induced apoptosis depends on de novosynthesis of Fas and Fas ligand, which is inhibited by cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor, and on their cell-autonomous interaction (21Shi Y.F. Sahai B.M. Green D.R. Nature. 1989; 339: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar,32Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H.

Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). De novo synthesis of Fas-ligand appears to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-AT, which is dephosphorylated and activated by calcineurin (34Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, calcineurin-activated NF-AT signaling is considered essential for anti-CD3/activation-induced apoptosis in T-cells. On the other hand, evidence has been obtained in certain types of cells, including neurons, that calcineurin-mediated apoptosis does not require de novo protein synthesis (18Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,23Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Despite the direct and indirect evidence that calcineurin mediates apoptosis and the likelihood that overexpression of calcineurin affects neuronal cells, there is no direct evidence that high level calcineurin activity predisposes these cells to apoptosis. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the areas of the brain that are most vulnerable to ischemia largely coincide with regions with high concentrations of calcineurin. This selective vulnerability is not fully understood. Investigating the effects of high level calcineurin activity in neuronal cells is likely to provide clues to the mechanism of this vulnerability. The goal of this study was to determine if high level calcineurin activity in neuronal cells increases their vulnerability to apoptosis. Here we show that high level, virus-mediated constitutive activity of calcineurin increases the vulnerability of neuronal cells to apoptosis even under sublethal conditions, such as serum reduction or brief exposure to calcium ionophore. We also show that high level, virus-mediated forced activity of calcineurin induces cytochrome c/caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in neuronal cells. Primary cultures of cortical neurons and PC12 cells were studied. Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from the cerebral cortex of fetal Wistar rats (18-day gestation) and cultivated in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 (a substitute for serum), 0.5 mm glutamine, 10 μm2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 μm glutamate (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were seeded in polyethyleimine-coated 6-well dishes at 1 × 106cells/well and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Three days after seeding, the cultures were incubated with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside for 24 h to prevent the growth of glial cells. Half the medium in each well was changed every 4 days. After 7 days, glutamate and 2-mercaptoethanol were removed from the medium. On day 14, monoclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (clone G-A-5, Sigma) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) (clone AP-20, Sigma) were used to assess the cell populations in the culture. Two-week-old cultures composed of >95% neurons were used for this study. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated on collagen-coated 6-well dishes and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Neuronal differentiation was induced by adding 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (Takara, Japan) and culturing the cells for 14 days as described (36Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These differentiated cells have many properties of normal sympathetic neurons. Neuronal differentiation was assessed by dendrite elongation and expression of MAP-2 (37Greene L.A. Liem R.K.H. Shelanski M.L. J.

All cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 100% humidity at 37 °C. The cell density of the cultures was routinely maintained below 80% confluence. For MAP-2 immunostaining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated first with primary monoclonal antibody against MAP-2 (AP-20, Sigma; 1:200) and subsequently with Alexa 546 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 1:500). Cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope (BX-50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 520/550 nm emission and <580 nm absorption filters. Mouse calcineurin cDNAs were obtained from Dr. M. Iwata (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). CaNT is a 1.2-kilobase (kb) fragment of a truncated form of calcineurin that lacks the autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains of CaNF, a 1.6-kb fragment containing the whole calcineurin Aα catalytic subunit (24Zhao Y. Tozawa Y. Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6346-6354PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of CaNT is assumed to be constitutively active without association with Ca2+/calmodulin. Blunt-ended CaNT and CaNF were separately ligated to a blunted BamHI site of a retroviral vector plasmid, pRx-bsr (39Shinoura N. Ohashi M. Yoshida Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Saito I. Hamada H. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2683-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transfected into BOSC23 (40Pear N. Nolan G.T. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) ecotropic packaging cells with Lipofectin (Life Technologies) to generate RxCaNT and RxCaNF recombinant retroviruses. The filtered supernatant of the culture was incubated with ΨCRIP(P131) amphotropic packaging cells (41Wakimoto H. Yoshida Y. Aoyagi M. Hirakawa K. Hamada H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Retroviruses expressing Bcl-2 were generated by blunting and ligating a 0.95-kb EcoRI fragment of humanbcl-2 cDNA including the entire coding region (a kind gift from Dr. Y. Tsujimoto, Biomedical Science Center, Osaka, Japan) with pRx-bsr. To generate retroviruses expressing CrmA (an anti-apoptotic gene encoded by cowpox virus), the coding region of theCrmA gene from pcDNA-crm (42Pickup D.J. Ink B.S. Hu W. Ray C.A. Joklik W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7698-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), consisting of 1176 base pairs from the ATG start codon at the NcoI site to the 3′ noncoding EcoRI site, was subcloned into pRx-bsr (39Shinoura N. Ohashi M. Yoshida Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Saito I. Hamada H. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2683-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each construct was transfected into BOSC23 packaging cells by lipofection. The culture supernatant of the BOSC23 cells was then incubated with ΨCRIP(P131) producer cells for retrovirus transduction. Conditioned medium from confluent, virus-producing ΨCRIP(P131) cells was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter and added to cultured PC12 cells at 30–40% confluency in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Before NGF treatment, PC12 cells were incubated with culture supernatants of ΨCRIP containing RxCaNT and RxCaNF recombinant retroviruses. Stable transfectants were obtained by incubating the infected cells in medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) from days 3 through 9 after the infection; after the first passage, the cells were cultured in blasticidin S-free medium, and the selected cells were treated with NGF to induce neuronal differentiation. The blunted 1.2-kb fragment of CaNT and the 1.6-kb fragment of CaNF were ligated into theSwaI site of a cassette cosmid containing loxP sites, pAxCALNLw (43Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. I. Saito, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan), to generate pAxCALNL-mCNT and pAxCALNL-mCNF, respectively. Recombinant human adenovirus expressing calcineurin (AxCALNL-mCNT and AxCALNL-mCNF) was then generated by homologous recombination with EcoT22I/ClaI-digested adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex (Ad DNA-TPC) in 293 host cells (44Nakamura Y. Wakimoto H. Abe J. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Aoyagi M. Hirakawa K. Hamada H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5757-5760PubMed Google Scholar, 45Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Infection with calcineurin-encoding viruses at various multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) was always accompanied by AxCANCre encoding Cre recombinase at one-fifth the multiplicities of infection of calcineurin-encoding viruses to activate calcineurin expression (43Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). For adenovial infection, exponentially growing cells were incubated with titered viral solution as described (39Shinoura N. Ohashi M. Yoshida Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Saito I. Hamada H. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2683-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To achieve high level constitutive expression of calcineurin, we infected PC12 cells with RxCaNT and RxCaNF and cortical neurons with AxCALNL-mCNT and AxCALNL-mCNF together with AxCANCre at m.o.i. 30. At this multiplicity of infection, approximately 100% of cells were infected by calcineurin-encoding viruses (data not shown). Under normal conditions, all transfectants were cultured in appropriate medium as described above. PC12 cells were treated with NGF after the retroviral transduction. All cells were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 100% humidity at 37 °C. For the serum reduction experiment, serum was reduced to 6% (4% horse serum and 2% fetal calf serum) in cultures of PC12 cells and their transfectants. In cortical neuron cultures, B27 was reduced to 1%. For calcium ionophore treatment, cortical neurons and PC12 cells were incubated with 1 μm A23187 in normal medium for 2 min, and then the medium was replaced with A23187-free normal medium. For Iodo-1 loading of cells to measure cytosolic Ca2+, cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated in normal medium containing 5 μm Iodo-1/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with modified Hank's solution consisting of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 4.2 mmNaHCO3, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmHEPES-Na (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm glucose and resuspended in this solution at a density of 5 × 106cells/ml. Iodo-1-loaded cells were kept at room temperature and used within 30 min. For Ca2+ measurements after the addition of A23187, Iodo-1-loaded cells were placed in a constant temperature cuvette (37 °C) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and stirred continuously. A23187 (1 μm) was added to the suspension, and Iodo-1 fluorescence was measured in a dual-channel fluorometer (F-2000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) registered at emission wavelengths of 405 and 485 nm (band path 10 nm). The free Ca2+ concentration in cytosol was calculated by ratiometrically as described (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (10 μg) extracted from each tissue by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method was loaded in each lane. Denatured RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 7% formaldehyde, transferred and UV cross-linked to a nylon filter, and probed with 32P-labeled mouse calcineurin Aα cDNA. After autoradiography, the membrane was deprobed and reprobed with32P-labeled mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as an internal control and processed for autoradiography again. For Western blot analysis, approximately 5 × 105cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Each crude lysate (20 μg) was separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking of nonspecific protein-binding sites with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated with affinity purified rabbit anti-calcineurin Pan A antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at 4 °C overnight and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 1 h at dilutions of 1:2000. Positive signals were detected on x-ray films with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To measure phosphatase activity of CaN, the CaN substrate peptide DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE corresponding to a sequence in the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was phosphorylated on the serine residue with [γ-32P]ATP with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Sigma) as described (47Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad H. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1991: 135-137Google Scholar). Minced brain tissue from several regions or cultured cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% CHAPS, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Reaction mixtures for the phosphatase assay contained 20 μl of the lysate, 5 μm32P-labeled phosphopeptide, 500 nm okadaic acid, and assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm CaCl2). After 15 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5% trichloroacetic acid. Free 32Pi was separated on a Dowex cation-exchange chromatography column (AG 50W-X8 resin 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) and quantitated by scintillation counting as described (48Manalan A.S. Klee C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4291-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 49Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3689-3690Crossref Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The net counts per minute (cpm) for each flow-through (32Pi) was calculated by subtracting counts/min measured in blank assays lacking lysate (designates unbound 32Pi not excluded during32Pi-labeled peptide purification) from the total counts/min. The amount of 32Pi released (pmol) was calculated by dividing the net counts/min of each flow-through by that of substrate used and by its specific activity (cpm/pmol). Phosphatase activity was designated as the amount of released 32Pi divided by the reaction time and the amount of protein in the lysate (pmol/min/mg). Apoptosis was assessed morphologically by Hoechst staining and quantitatively by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol and caspase-3 activation, both of which reflect apoptosis, were also assessed, as was inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-2, Crm-A, and tetrapeptide caspase-3 inhibitor. For Hoechst staining, harvested cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 20 μm Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 15 min, and examined under a fluorescence microscope (BX-50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 330/385 nm emission and <420 nm absorption filters. LDH release was defined as the ratio of LDH activity in the medium to total LDH activity and expressed as a percentage (50Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). For detection of cytochrome c release, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 250 mm sucrose and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting mitochondrial pellets were retained for preparation of the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 250 mm sucrose, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Both the final supernatants (cytosolic fraction and mitochondrial fraction) were used for Western blot analysis. Anti-cytochromec antibody (Sigma, 1:1000) was used as the primary antibody. Caspase-3 activity was measured with the fluorescent tetrapeptide substrate Ac-DEVD-MCA (Peptides Institute, Osaka, Japan). Crude lysates were prepared by sonicating cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT) followed by centrifugation. Each lysate (20 μl) was incubated with 1 μm peptide-MCA substrates in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Before and after the reaction, the fluorescence intensity of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released from the substrates was measured with a spectrofluorometer set at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The fluorescence intensity of purified control 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin in an amount equal to that of peptide-MCA added to the reaction mixture was used as a reference (fluorescence intensity/nmol). The amount (nmol) of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released in the reaction mixture was calculated by dividing the increase in fluorescence intensity by the reference. The enzyme activity (nmol/min/mg of protein) of each cell lysate was determined by dividing the amount (nmol) of released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin by the reaction time (30 min) and the amount of protein (mg) in each lysate. The relative caspase-3 activity was defined as the ratio of enzyme activity of each cell lysate to that of control lysate. In cultured neuronal cells, intrinsic calcineurin was expressed at moderate levels (Fig.1 A). In cortical neurons, adenoviruses encoding CaNT (AxCALNL-mCNT), CaNF (AxCALNL-mCNF), or LacZ (AxCALacZ) were transduced at m.o.i. 30 with adenovirus encoding Cre (AxCANCre) at one-fifth the multiplicity of infections of accompanying adenoviruses. Moderate expression of CaNT and CaNF was obtained in the adenovirus-transduced neurons (Fig. 1 B). From PC12 cells, retrovirus-mediated calcineurin transfectants expressing CaNT, CaNF, or null extrinsic calcineurin were obtained (Fig. 1 C). Each transfectant was polyclonal (400–800 clones). Addition of NGF (100 ng/ml) to PC12-derived transfectants induced neuronal differentiation even after retrovirus-mediated induction of calcineurin expression. The extent of neuronal differentiation estimated by dendrite elongation and MAP-2 expression in these transfectants was almost the same as that in parent PC12 cells (Fig. 1 D). The phosphatase activity of CaNT transfectants was higher than that of CaNF transfectants or control cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The relative phosphatase activity of the normal hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, and cerebral cortex is 9.5, 0.8, 0.4, 2.6, and"

In Dictyostelium, the 7-TM cAMP receptors regulate GSK3 by parallel, antagonistic pathways to establish a developmental body plan. We describe here a novel tyrosine kinase, ZAK1, downstream of 7-TM cAMP receptor signaling that is required for GSK3 activation during development. zak1-nulls have reduced GSK3 activity and are defective in GSK3-regulated developmental pathways. Moreover, recombinant ZAK1 phosphorylates and activates GSK3 in vitro. We propose that ZAK1 is a positive regulator of GSK3 activity required for cell pattern formation in Dictyostelium and speculate that similar mechanisms exist to antagonize Wnt/wg signaling for metazoan cell fate specification."

IP3R1 degradation during apoptosis was inhibited by pretreatment of Jurkat cells with the caspase-3 (-like protease) inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and the caspases inhibitor, z-VAD-CH2DCB but not by the caspase-1 (-like protease) inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, suggesting that IP3R1 was cleaved by a caspase-3 (-like) protease.

To determine whether IP3R1 is cleaved by caspase-3 or is proteolyzed in its absence by other caspases, we examined the cleavage of IP3R1 during apoptosis in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, which has genetically lost caspase-3. Tumor necrosis factor-α- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells failed to demonstrate cleavage of IP3R1. In contrast, MCF-7/Casp-3 cells stably expressing caspase-3 showed IP3R1 degradation upon apoptotic stimuli. Therefore IP3R1 is a newly identified caspase-3 substrate, and caspase-3 is essential for the cleavage of IP3R1 during apoptosis.

This programmed cell death is regulated by a series of biochemical events, namely activation of a family of cysteine proteases, caspases, which in turn cleave specific intracellular proteins resulting in an irreversible commitment to cell death. Among the caspase family, caspase-3 plays a crucial role in execution of apoptosis. Known substrates for caspase-3 (1Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

In their experiments, IP3R-deficient cells showed a reduction in apoptosis in which the degree of resistance depend on the number of IP3Rs depleted, i.e. triple IP3R-deficient cells were more resistant than single IP3R-deficient cells. Although it has been demonstrated that IP3Rs are involved in the process of apoptosis, less attention has been directed to the relationship between IP3Rs and caspases. Among the IP3R family, IP3R1 is the most widely expressed in tissues and is recognized as an ubiquitous type of IP3R. In the primary amino acid sequence of IP3R1, there is the DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage at 1889–1892 amino acids of mouse IP3R1, which is conserved among species (1888DEVD rat IP3R1 and 1835DEVD human IP3R1). In the present studies, we asked whether IP3R1 could serve as a substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis, and we obtained evidence that IP3R1 is a newly identified substrate for caspase-3. Using caspase-3-deficient cells, MCF-7 (17Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), we found that caspase-3 is essential for the cleavage of IP3R1. In addition, effects of the cleavage by caspase-3 on the IP3R1 channel function were also given attention. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) KM1112, KM1083, and KM1082 against the C terminus of IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3, respectively, were prepared as described elsewhere (18Sugiyama T. Furuya A. Monkawa T.

Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against pro-caspase-3 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Fas IgM CH-11 was purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was obtained from Pepro Tech EC, Ltd. (London, UK). Staurosporine and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma and Wako Chemical (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Ac-YVAD-CHO (inhibitor for caspase-1-like protease) and Ac-DEVD-CHO (inhibitor for caspase-3-like protease) were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). z-VAD-CH2DCB (inhibitor for caspases with broad specificity) was obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Mountain View, CA). The human lymphoblastoid T-cell line, Jurkat, was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% of fetal calf serum. The human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, was obtained from Dainippon-Seiyaku, Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. To induce apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with staurosporine (1 or 2 μm) or with anti-Fas IgM CH-11 (500 μg/ml). MCF-7 cells or MCF-7/Casp-3 cells were treated with staurosporine (1 μm) or a combination of TNF-α (30 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Cells (1 × 106cells) treated with apoptotic stimuli were harvested at the indicated time and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then were solubilized in 100 μl of the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm E-64, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) on ice for 15 min. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was subjected to SDS-5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunodetected using mAbs specific for each type of IP3R. The recombinant histidine-tagged human caspase-3 (CPP32) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Miura (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The recombinant caspase-3 was purified using a nickel column according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cerebellar microsome fraction (200 μg/ml), in which IP3R1 is dominantly expressed was incubated with the purified recombinant caspase-3 (10 or 50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. The reaction mixture were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Cleavage sites of IP3R1 by caspase-3 were determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, as described, but with some modification (20Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, IP3R1 was purified, as described previously (21Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then was treated with the recombinant caspase-3. The reaction mixture was applied to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining the membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, three fragments of 215,000, 160,000, and 95,000 were cut and applied to a gas-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystem). The expression vector for FLAG-tagged human caspase-3, pM136, was a kindly provided by Dr. M. Miura (Osaka University). pM136 was used to transfect MCF-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks of selection in growth medium containing 700 μg/ml of G418, about 40 resistant colonies were isolated and examined for caspase-3 expression by Western blot analysis, and then the positive clones were reseeded, isolated, and maintained in culture medium with 100 μg/ml of G418. Effect of digestion by caspase-3 on IP3R1 channel activity was investigated using mouse cerebellar microsome fractions in the presence or absence of the recombinant caspase-3. Mouse microsome fractions (400 μg/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of recombinant caspase-3 (0–100 μg/ml) for 10 min at 30 °C with continuous stirring in Ca2+ release assay buffer (110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm E-64, and 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2) to produce different degrees of digestion. The reaction of digestion was stopped by adding 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO, and then an equal volume of the Ca2+ release assay buffer supplemented with oligomycin, phosphocreatine, creatine kinase, MgCl2, and Fura-2 was added to give final concentrations of 1 μg/ml, 10 mm, 10 units/ml, 2 mm, and 2 μm, respectively. IP3-induced Ca2+ release was measured as described (20Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In all experiments, IP3 was added at the same base-line level to minimize effect of deviation of free Ca2+ concentration on IP3R channel activity. Free [Ca2+] was calculated as described (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), assuming a dissociation constant of 224 nm for Fura-2-Ca2+. Following these measurements, the reaction mixture was subjected to Western blots, and the extent of digestion was determined by densitometric analysis using NIH Image 1.58 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). IP3R1 has the DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage within its modulatory domain at 1888DEVD of mouse IP3R1, which is conserved among species (rat:1888DEVD and human: 1835DEVD) (Fig.1 A). To determine whether IP3R1 is cleaved during apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with either 2 μm staurosporine or 500 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM CH-11 and then were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific mAbs against the C terminus of each type of IP3R. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows the time course of IP3Rs degradation during apoptosis, as induced by either 1 μm staurosporine or 500 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM CH-11. During the staurosporine-induced apoptosis, IP3R1 was partially cleaved, whereas IP3R2 and IP3R3 were resistant to specific degradation. All three types of IP3R, however, disappeared 10 h after stimulation, a time when almost all the Jurkat cells had died, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. In the case of anti-Fas antigen, specific degradation of IP3R1 was also observed during apoptosis. In both cases, one major fragment with an estimated molecular weight of 95,000 and two minor fragments of 215,000 and 160,000 were detected, using a mAb against the C terminus of IP3R1, KM1112. To determine whether degradation of IP3R1 during apoptosis is mediated by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases, we examined effects of caspase inhibitors on IP3R1 degradation. Jurkat cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors 1 h prior to apoptotic stimuli and then were incubated together during the stimuli. Fig. 2 shows that pretreatment of Jurkat cells with either a caspase-3-like protease inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) or a caspase inhibitor of broad specificity (z-VAD-CH2DCB) inhibited the degradation of IP3R1 during the apoptosis induced by staurosporine, whereas caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO) showed no such inhibition (Fig. 2). The same results were obtained in the case of anti-Fas stimulation (data not shown). Other cysteine protease inhibitors tested, E-64d for cathepsin B/H/L and calpain andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal for calpain, did not block IP3R1 degradation during apoptosis (data not shown). To confirm that IP3R1 is cleaved by caspase-3, digestion of IP3R1 was tested by treatment with the purified recombinant caspase-3 in vitro. Fig.3 shows cleavage of IP3R1 by recombinant caspase-3, in a concentration-dependent manner, and the fragmentation pattern was consistent with that seen in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis. In the presence of the caspase-3 (-like protease) inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, this specific cleavage was inhibited (Fig. 3). To determine the cleavage sites, the purified fragments of 215,000, 160,000, and 95,000 were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the major fragment of 95,000 is RDAPXR (X is not determined), consistent with1892RDAPSR of mouse IP3R1, indicating that IP3R1 is cleaved at just after DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3 (Fig. 1 A). N-terminal amino acid sequences of two minor fragments of 215,000 and 160,000, however, could not be determined, because they were too faint to examine the sequence or N termini blocking. To determine whether IP3R1 is cleaved by caspase-3 or is proteolyzed in its absence by other caspases, we examined the degradation of IP3R1 during apoptosis in the caspase-3 deficient cell line, MCF-7 cells (breast carcinoma cell) (17Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). As noted by other investigators (17Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), pro-caspase-3 was not detected in MCF-7 cells, where we used an anti-caspase-3 antibody that recognizes pro-caspase-3 but not the active form of caspase-3 (Fig. 4). Although TNF-α or staurosporine induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells failed to demonstrate cleavage of IP3R1 (Fig. 4). To confirm that caspase-3 is essential for IP3R1 degradation during apoptosis, we established MCF/Casp-3 cells that were stably transfected to express caspase-3. Fig. 4 shows that two independent stable transformants of MCF/Casp-3 cells, 2B1 and 2B5 (two representative clones out of seven tested), express pro-caspase-3. In these cell lines, no spontaneous activation of caspase-3 and no morphological changes were observed (data not shown). Treatment of MCF/Casp-3 cells, 2B1 and 2B5, with TNF-α/cycloheximide or staurosporine resulted in decreases in pro-caspase-3 because of processing into an active form. In contrast to the caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, MCF-7/Casp-3 2B1 and 2B5 cells showed IP3R1 degradation upon apoptotic stimuli, and the fragmentation patterns were the same as seen in Jurkat cells andin vitro cleavage. Effects of the cleavage of IP3R1 by caspase-3 on channel activity were then investigated using mouse cerebellar microsome fractions, in which IP3R1 is dominantly expressed. Fig.5 A shows typical profiles of ATP-induced Ca2+ uptake and IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) in microsome fractions treated with various concentrations of caspase-3. Control microsomes or caspase-3-digested microsomes were loaded with Ca2+ by adding 2 mm of ATP, and then 1 μm of IP3 was added to induce Ca2+ release. Although the ATP-induced Ca2+ uptake was not affected by caspase-3, IICR was inhibited by caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. To quantify the degree of digestion, control microsomes and caspase-3-treated microsomes were subjected to Western blots, and amounts of intact IP3R1 were measured by densitometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of digested IP3R1 and the channel activity are summarized in Fig. 5 B. Increasing caspase-3 concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/ml) resulted in increase in the percentage of the digested IP3R1 (0, 25.8 ± 8.2, 46.4 ± 15, 81.1 ± 6.7, and 89.2 ± 4.7, respectively;n = 3). IICR activities were not significantly inhibited by caspase-3 until less than 50% of IP3R1 was digested, yet when over half of the IP3R1 was digested, the channel activities decreased. In the IP3R1 primary amino acid sequence, there is the DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage at 1888–1891 amino acids of mouse IP3R1 (Fig. 1 A), which is conserved among mice, rats, and humans. In Jurkat cells, IP3R1 was cleaved during apoptosis. One major fragment of 95,000 and two minor fragments of 215,000 and 160,000 of IP3R1 were detected using an mAb against the C terminus of IP3R1, indicating that IP3R1 is cleaved at three sites during apoptosis (Fig. 1,B and C). The different degrees of degradation of IP3R1 seen with use of staurosporine and anti-Fas IgM would be attributed to different caspases activated or to different activities of these proteases. In both cases, the main fragment of 95,000 was observed, and the molecular size was consistent with that of the expected fragment if IP3R1 is cleaved at DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3. Therefore, IP3R1 is probably degraded by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases. IP3R2 and IP3R3 were resistant to specific degradation. In IP3R2 and IP3R3, there is no DEXD sequence and no potential cleavage site, which resembles the tetrapeptide sequences identified in various substrates for caspase-3. Khan et al. (13Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported down-regulation of IP3R1 and up-regulation IP3R3 during apoptosis in WEHI-B cells induced by IgM, thymocytes, and S49 cells, as induced by dexamethasone. In the present study, there was no apparent increase in IP3R3 expression. These differences may relate to different cells used and to the stimuli used to induce apoptosis. We found the time course of cell death induced by staurosporine or anti-Fas IgM to be more rapid (10–20 h) than that seen with dexamethasone (24–96 h). Caspase-3 (-like protease) inhibitor or a caspase inhibitor of broad specificity but not caspase-1 inhibitor inhibited the degradation of IP3R1 during apoptosis, thereby indicating that IP3R1 is cleaved by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like protease (Fig. 2). It was reported that IP3R1 was down-regulated in response to chronic activation of cell surface receptors, an event that was caused by IP3R1 degradation by the cysteine protease, calpain (24Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the case of apoptosis, cysteine protease inhibitors, E-64d for cathepsin B/H/L, and calpain andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal for calpain did not block IP3R1 degradation, thus supporting our observation that IP3R1 is cleaved by caspase-3 (-like protease) but not by calpain. In addition, in the case of the recombinant caspase-3 digested IP3R1 in vitro, the fragmentation pattern is consistent with that seen in Jurkat cells. This means that IP3R1 serves as a substrate for caspase-3 (-like protease). The N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed that the major fragment of 95,000 is produced by cleavage at caspase-3 recognition motif, the DEVD tetrapeptide. We propose that IP3R1 is a newly identified caspase-3 substrate and that one of the cleavage sites contains the DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage. Janicke et al. (17Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells have genetically lost caspase-3 and that caspase-3 is essential for DNA fragmentation and for blebbing. However, MCF-7 cells do respond to certain apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that caspase-3 is not essential for apoptosis and that other caspases may be activated. Actually, caspase-2, -5, -7, -8, -9, and -10 were detected in MCF-7 cells, and caspase-8 is activated in MCF-7 during the apoptosis induced by TNF-α (25Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These same authors reported that most substrates of caspase-3 were cleaved during apoptosis in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, and they stated that caspase-3 is essential for cleavage of α-fodrin but dispensable for the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Rb, p21-activated kinase 2, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, gelsolin, and DNA fragmentation factor 45-kDa subunit, which suggested that caspases other than caspase-3 are activated and cleaved these substrates in MCF-7 cells (25Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is, however, uncertain whether cleavage of these substrates by other caspases in caspase-3-deficient cells is functional for apoptosis, because other groups reported that DNA fragmentation factor 45-kDa subunit and gelsolin require caspase-3 for proper cleavage and its function (3Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 4Liu X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), despite the finding that they were cleaved in the absence of caspase-3, possibly by other caspases. In the case of IP3R1, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells failed to demonstrate cleavage of IP3R1 (Fig. 4), indicating that IP3R1 was not cleaved by remaining caspases, such as caspase-8. In MCF/Casp3 cells, pro-caspase-3 became the active form, as induced by apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 4), thereby indicating that the caspase-3 activation pathway was functional. Upon apoptotic stimuli, IP3R1 was cleaved when MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with caspase-3, indicating that caspase-3 is essential for the cleavage of IP3R1. Thus, our data show that IP3R1 is a specific substrate for caspase-3 and that this cleavage cannot occur with other caspases in MCF-7 cells. Effects of the cleavage of IP3R1 by caspase-3 on channel activity were also investigated using mouse cerebellar microsome fractions, in which IP3R1 is dominantly expressed (Fig. 5). The time course of Ca2+uptake was not affected by caspase-3 treatment, indicating that the Ca2+-ATPase function is resistant to cleavage by caspase-3 (Fig. 5 A). On the contrary, the IICR was inhibited by caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Digestion of up to 50% did not significantly inhibit the channel activity, suggesting that even partially digested IP3R1 can function as a Ca2+ channel (Fig. 5 B), as was observed in trypsinized IP3R1 (20Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore 90% of the digested IP3R1 has 25% IICR activity. Alternatively, IICR is not highly cooperative, because if the Hill coefficient of IICR is 4, the digested IP3R subunit could have a dominant negative effect on IP3R channel activity. Moreover, inhibitory effects on the IICR were observed in over 50% of the digested IP3R1, suggesting that cleavage of at least two subunits of IP3R is needed to inactivate the IP3R channel. These results are in accord with our previous studies on kinetics of the purified IP3R1, in which the Hill coefficient of IICR was 2 (28Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Okura I. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In conclusion, IP3R1 is a newly identified caspase-3 substrate, and caspase-3 is essential for cleavage of IP3R1 during apoptosis. One of the cleavage sites of IP3R1 is the DEVD consensus sequence for caspase-3. Cleavage of IP3R1 by caspase-3 resulted in inhibition of IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity, in a digestion-dependent manner, an event that may possibly interfere with the IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis within cells undergoing apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1999530386,"GRK2 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, which phosphorylates the activated form of a variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and plays an important role in GPCR modulation. It has been recently reported that stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by GPCRs involves tyrosine phosphorylation of docking proteins mediated by members of the Src tyrosine kinase family. In this report, we have investigated the possible role of c-Src in modulating GRK2 function. We demonstrate that c-Src can directly phosphorylate GRK2 on tyrosine residues, as shown by in vitro experiments with purified proteins. The phosphorylation reaction exhibits an apparentK m for GRK2 of 12 nm, thus suggesting a physiological relevance in living cells. Consistently, overexpression of the constitutively active c-Src Y527F mutant in COS-7 cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of co-expressed GRK2. In addition, GRK2 can be detected in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with this Src mutant. Interestingly, phosphotyrosine immunoblots reveal a rapid and transient increase in GRK2 phosphorylation upon agonist stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors co-transfected with GRK2 and wild type c-Src in COS-7 cells. This tyrosine phosphorylation is maximal within 5 min of isoproterenol stimulation and reaches values of ∼5-fold over basal conditions. Furthermore, GRK2 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues promotes an increased kinase activity toward its substrates. Our results suggest that GRK2 phosphorylation by c-Src is inherent to GPCR activation and put forward a new mechanism for the regulation of GPCR signaling.

Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event leads to the recruitment of cytosolic proteins known as β-arrestins to the receptor-signaling complex, with the subsequent uncoupling from heterotrimeric G proteins and loss of receptor responsiveness (1Pitcher J.A.

Consistent with an important physiological role, GRK2 activity and subcellular localization appear to be subject to complex regulatory processes that involve the interaction of diverse domains of the kinase with G protein βγ subunits, several lipids, anchoring proteins, and the agonist-bound form of receptors. The interaction of GRK2 with βγ subunits through its C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain helps to target the kinase to the membrane and enhances its activity toward the receptor (11Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The interaction of GRK2 with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by means of the N-terminal portion of its pleckstrin homology domain seems also to be necessary for full kinase activation (13Pitcher J.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22552-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GRK2 activity toward receptors is also modulated by phosphorylation by PKC on a yet unidentified residue located in the C terminus of GRK2. Phosphorylation by PKC leads to an increased GRK2 activity, probably due to an enhanced kinase association to the plasma membrane (15Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This would provide a cross-talk or feedback mechanism by which activation of PKC by different transduction systems may affect GPCR modulation and signaling. In this regard, emerging evidence indicates that stimulation of Gq- or Gi-coupled GPCR also leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in a Ras-dependent way (see Refs. 7Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar and 18Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

It has been shown that activation of lysophosphatidic acid and β2-adrenergic and other GPCR receptors stimulate phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of Shc and Gab1 adapter proteins and other plasma membrane-associated proteins (Refs. 18Gutkind J.S.

Recruitment and activation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases of the Src family play a critical role in the GPCR-mediated regulation of the MAPK cascade (Refs. 18Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, it has been recently suggested that GRK2 and β-arrestin directly participate in the process of MAPK cascade activation, either by facilitating receptor internalization and/or the interaction with additional proteins (7Lefkowitz R.J.

On the other hand, overexpression of the c-Src kinase enhances β-adrenergic-induced cAMP accumulation in murine fibroblasts (26Bushman W.A. Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Moyers S.J. Parsons S.J. Proc.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5735-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results suggest a role for Src-like tyrosine kinases in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and desensitization. In this context, we have investigated the possibility that GRK2 could be regulated by Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. We find that GRK2 is a new substrate for c-Src and, what is more important, that agonist stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors leads to rapid phosphorylation of GRK2 on tyrosine residues, which results in an enhancement of GRK2 intrinsic activity. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 is inherent to GPCR activation, thus suggesting an important role in the modulation of GRK2 cellular functions. Bovine GRK2 was overexpressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (29Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purity of the GRK2 preparation as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was >95%. Recombinant baculovirus for GRK2 was kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Benovic at the Thomas Jefferson Cancer Institute of Philadelphia. The cDNAs encoding human pp60c-src and the constitutively active Y527F pp60c-src were provided by Dr. S. Gutkind (NIH, Bethesda, MD). COS-7 cells, HEK-293 cells, and human Jurkat T lymphocytes were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Culture media and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein A-Sepharose, isoproterenol, and heparin (M r 6,000) were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-labeling mixture was from NEN Life Science Products. Purified pp60c-src was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed on 70% confluent monolayers in 100-mm dishes for immunoprecipitation assays or 60-mm dishes for 35S-labeling experiments. For transient transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free OPTIMEM (5 ml containing 5 μg of DNA/100-mm dish or 3 μg/60-mm dish) plus 8 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/μg of DNA. Empty vector was added to transfections as needed to keep the total amount of DNA added/dish constant. After 5 h of exposure to the transfection medium, monolayers were refed with culture medium and incubated overnight. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Transient expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates using specific antisera (mAb-1 from Upstate Biotechnology for c-Src and Ab9 (30Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for GRK2). Stimulation of COS-7 cells was performed 48 h after transfection and was carried out at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma). Isoproterenol was used at the concentration depicted in the figure legends. In some experiments, cells were serum-starved for 90 min before the experiment as reported (31Lin F.-T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Treatments with the Src inhibitor PP2 (5 μm, Calbiochem) were initiated 15 min before isoproterenol stimulation. For metabolic labeling, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were kept for 2 h in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM and then incubated for 15 min in DMEM supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-labeling mixture as reported (32Penela P. Ruiz-Gómez A. Castaño J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were used for antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation experiments as described below. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the presence of GRK2 was subsequently analyzed by35S detection or immunoblot. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, solubilized in 700 μl/100-mm dish or 400 μl/60-mm dish of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 mNaCl, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) TX-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors). After gentle rocking for 90 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and an aliquot (30 μl) was used to assess protein overexpression. Before GRK2 immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were precleared by overnight incubation with a preimmune serum plus 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 4 ° with Protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and centrifugation, the beads (preimmune controls) were washed with ice-cold RIPA buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. GRK2 was then immunoprecipitated from the supernatants with the specific AbFP1 polyclonal antibody as described (29Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Penela P. Ruiz-Gómez A. Castaño J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with 50 μl of a 50% suspension of an agarose-conjugated phosphotyrosine antibody from Transduction Laboratories. All immunoprecipitated samples were boiled for 5 min before resolution by 8% SDS-PAGE and transference to nitrocellulose membranes. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (HPRO-PY20 or PY99-HRP from Transduction Laboratories or Santa Cruz Laboratories, respectively). Immunoprecipitated GRK2 protein was detected in the same blots by incubating stripped filters with Ab9 antibody. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of GRK2 activity in the immunoprecipitates, 40-μl aliquots of the latter were washed with phosphorylation buffer to remove the detergent, and casein or rhodopsin were added to a final concentration of 30 μm or 1 μm, respectively. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 8 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 4.5 mm NaF, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, 160 μm ATP, and 5,000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP). After incubation for 30–60 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, revealed by autoradiography, and quantitated as reported (29Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Freeman J.L.R. de la Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20653-20657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the in vitro phosphorylation studies, recombinant GRK2 protein at the concentrations depicted in the figure legends was incubated with purified c-Src kinase (9.2 nm, Upstate Biotechnology) in a final volume of 15–30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 25 mmMnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, 125 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm ATP, and 2,000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP) in the presence or absence of 0.25 ng/μl heparin to inhibit GRK2 autophosphorylation (34Benovic J.L. Stone C.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the indicated time at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Enolase phosphorylation assays were performed as described (35Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Biol. 1990; 62: 481-492Scopus (478) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that GRK2 could be a target for Src-like tyrosine kinases, recombinant GRK2 was incubated with purified c-Src under phosphorylating conditions. The presence of Src promoted a marked increase in GRK2 phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). The phosphorylation of GRK2 is likely due to the activity of Src, since these initial experiments were performed in the presence of heparin, a well known inhibitor of GRK2 activity and autophosphorylation (34Benovic J.L. Stone C.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments indicated that heparin had no effect on Src intrinsic activity toward other substrates such as enolase (Fig. 1 B). To further confirm that GRK2 was directly phosphorylated by Src on tyrosine residues, we performed similar phosphorylation experiments followed by immunoblot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 1 C shows that these antibodies only recognized GRK2 after previous incubation with Src. These results indicate that GRK2 is a substrate for Src tyrosine kinase in vitro. To explore if phosphorylation of GRK2 by Src could have a physiological meaning, we sought to determine the kinetic parameters of the phosphorylation reaction. Since results similar to those shown in Fig.1, A and C, were obtained in the absence of heparin (data not shown), we routinely performed the experiments in the latter conditions using basal GRK2 autophosphorylation controls to assess Src-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation in each experimental determination. Fig. 2 Aindicates that GRK2 is readily phosphorylated by c-Src reaching a plateau at 15–20 min of incubation. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of 10 nm GRK2 induced by equimolar Src in the absence of heparin was 0.86 ± 0.08 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of GRK2 (mean ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments). This value is similar to that reported for PKC phosphorylation of GRK2 (0.5–0.9 mol Pi/mol of GRK2; see Refs. 15Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 16Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and suggests that GRK2 is phosphorylated by c-Src on 1 tyrosine residue. Double-reciprocal plot analysis (Fig. 2 B) reveals that c-Src displays an apparent K m for GRK2 of ∼12 nm, with a V max of 1.3 nmol/min/mg of protein. This K m is lower than that reported (36Akiyama T. Kadowaki T. Nishida E. Kadooka T. Ogawara H. Fukami Y. Sakai H. Takaku F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14797-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sato K-I. Yamamoto H. Otsuki T. Aoto M. Tokmakov A.A. Hayashi F. Fukami Y.

Therefore, our data indicate that GRK2 is a high affinity substrate for c-Src in vitro and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 would also take place in the cellular environment. To determine whether GRK2 could be phosphorylated by Src in vivo, we coexpressed this kinase with wild type Src or the constitutively active Y527F Src mutant (39Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) in COS-7 cells. The pattern of phosphorylated proteins in cell lysates was investigated using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in the left panelof Fig. 3 A, a protein that comigrates with GRK2 is markedly tyrosine-phosphorylated only in cells transfected with constitutively active Src. Similar levels of GRK2 (upper right panel) and Src (lower right panel) overexpression were obtained in the different conditions, as assessed by reprobing the blots with specific antibodies. In addition, antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis of GRK2 immunoprecipitated from cells transiently co-transfected with the kinase and Y527F Src demonstrate that GRK2 is indeed phosphorylated on tyrosine residues under these conditions (Fig. 3 B). The titration experiment shown in Fig. 3 B indicates a correlation between the phosphotyrosine content of immunoprecipitated GRK2 and an increased expression of the Src mutant, suggesting a direct relationship between the levels of Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of the GRK2 cellular pool. We also performed similar experiments in HEK-293 cells. Our data show that GRK2 could be immunoprecipitated with an agarose-conjugated phosphotyrosine antibody only after coexpression with the Src mutant (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). GRK2 protein present in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was detected either by Western blot using a GRK2 antibody or by35S-radiolabeling and autoradiography. It is worth noting that a tyrosine-phosphorylated band with a slightly slower migration than GRK2 was detected by the kinase antibody (Fig. 3 C,upper panel) but not by 35S-labeling (Fig.3 C, lower panel). Such a band is also present in some experiments in GRK2 immunoprecipitates analyzed with phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.4 A and data not shown). It is tempting to suggest that such a band represents a minor cellular pool of another form of tyrosine-phosphorylated GRK2, which deserves to be characterized in future experiments.Figure 4Agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. A, time course of isoproterenol-stimulated GRK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GRK2, c-Src, and β2-adrenergic receptor (1 μg of cDNA of each/plate) were stimulated or not (C lane) for the indicated times with isoproterenol (ISO, 10 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitates (IPP) of GRK2 from RIPA buffer lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and analyzed with antiphosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr) antibodies (upper panel); after stripping, the presence of GRK2 was analyzed in the same gel using a specific GRK2 antibody (lower panel). Thearrows indicate the migration of GRK2 as assessed by the position of recombinant GRK2 resolved in the same gel (GRK2 Std). A gel representative of three independent experiments is shown. B, quantitation of isoproterenol-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 was measured by scanner laser densitometry, and the data were normalized to the amount of GRK2 protein present in the immunoprecipitates, as assessed with the GRK2 antibodies. Nonstimulated controls were taken as the basal condition. Each data point represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. C, isoproterenol-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 is blocked by a specific Src inhibitor. COS-7 cells as in panel A were treated with 5 μm PP2 or vehicle as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” before stimulation for the indicated times with isoproterenol (10 μm) as described above. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 was assessed as in panel A. The arrows indicate the migration of GRK2. A gel representative of two independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Taken together, our results indicate that GRK2 is phosphorylated by activated Src tyrosine kinase in living cells. We next tested the hypothesis that GPCR activation could be the physiological trigger of GRK2 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Several recent reports have established that stimulation of β-adrenergic and other GPCR leads to c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. Phosphorylation of adapter proteins such as Shc and Gab1 is followed by Ras-dependent modulation of the MAPK cascade (reviewed in Refs. 7Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar and 18Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors also leads to Src-mediated phosphorylation of dynamin, which appears to be related to increased receptor internalization and signaling through the MAPK cascade (40Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation would lead to GRK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor, GRK2, and wild type c-Src and treated with the β-agonist isoproterenol for different periods of time. GRK2 was then immunoprecipitated, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 4 shows that isoproterenol stimulation results in a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2, which is maximal (4–5-fold) within 5 min of agonist exposure. These results demonstrate that β2-adrenergic receptor activation triggers the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. Interestingly, when similar experiments were performed in the presence of a specific Src inhibitor, the agonist-stimulated GRK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced (Fig. 4 C), thus suggesting that this process is in fact due to the activity of Src. The use of transient transfection experimental systems raises the question of whether GRK2 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues could also be observed in more physiological conditions. In this regard, preliminary data in our laboratory 2S. Sarnago, A. Elorza, and F. Mayor, Jr., manuscript in preparation. indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous GRK2 can be detected in Jurkat cells and that its tyrosine phosphorylation levels are modulated upon stimulation with agents that activate tyrosine kinases of the Src family or with CXCR4 receptor agonists (data not shown). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 affected its function, we compared the activity of GRK2 in cells expressing this kinase in the absence or presence of the constitutively active Y527F Src mutant. Y527F Src expression promotes an increased level of GRK2 tyrosine phosphorylation that can be detected both in cell lysates (Fig. 5 A) or after immunoprecipitation with specific GRK2 antibodies (Fig. 5 B). When immunoprecipitates containing similar quantities of GRK2 (Fig.5 B, lower panel) were tested for the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate soluble GRK2 substrates, a clear increase in GRK2 activity was detected in the tyrosine-phosphorylated samples (between a 1.4- and 2.5-fold increase in activity toward casein, Fig.5 C). Similar results are obtained when a GPCR such as rhodopsin is used as a substrate (1.7 ± 0.29-fold increase in phosphorylation, Fig. 5 D). The range of this stimulatory effect is similar to that reported for other GRK2 modulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation by PKC or interaction with lipids (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 15Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol.

It is worth noting that the observed effect is likely an underestimation, since only a fraction of the immunoprecipitated GRK2 protein would be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The fact that the activity of GRK2 is increased toward both soluble and membrane- bound substrates suggests a direct effect of Src phosphorylation on its catalytic activity. Taken together, our data indicate that GRK2 is a substrate for c-Srcin vitro and in living cells and that stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 and modulation of GRK2 function.

Higher GRK2 functionality upon phosphorylation by c-Src would favor a diminished response of GPCR to extracellular messengers. Consistently, the level of activity of Src kinase has been reported to correlate with a loss of responsiveness of luteinizing hormone receptors in MA10 Leydig cells (28Taylor C.C. Limback D. Terranova P.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5735-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or of α1- and β-adrenoreceptors in pinealocytes (41Ho A.K. Wiest R. Ogiwara T. Murdoch G. Chik C.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1597-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, different effects have been observed in other systems (26Bushman W.A. Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Moyers S.J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the overall effect of c-Src would depend on the combination of its actions at different levels of the GPCR-mediated signaling pathway by phosphorylating targets such as αs, cAMP phosphodiesterase (41Ho A.K. Wiest R. Ogiwara T. Murdoch G. Chik C.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1597-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), or GRK2. The fact that GRK2 is one of the targets of agonist-activated Src is consistent with the reported presence of GRK2 as part of the multimolecular complexes formed upon GPCR stimulation (30Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Aragay A.M. Mellado M. Frade J.M.R. Martin A.M. Jimenez-Sainz M.C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), indicating that agonist-induced GRK2 phosphorylation is an early event in GPCR signal transduction. On the other hand, its transient nature suggests the existence of active GRK2 dephosphorylation mechanisms, which may contribute to the explanation of why GRK2 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues has not been previously detected. Moreover, our results are of particular interest in the context of recent data published during the preparation of this manuscript, indicating that arrestin proteins can act as adaptor molecules for recruiting Src to activated GPCR (23Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Thus, the following sequence of events can be envisaged. Agonist-occupied receptors are rapidly phosphorylated by GRK2; β-arrestin then binds to the phosphorylated GPCR, allowing Src recruitment and activation (23Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) so the subsequent phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of GRK2 and other adaptor and signaling proteins can take place. Src-dependent phosphorylation of GRK2 as inherent to GPCR signaling may provide a positive feedback loop mechanism (45Weng G. Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 284: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar); increased GRK2 activity would help to block G protein-mediated signaling while reinforcing the arrestin/Src/Ras/MAPK pathway. This suggested function of GRK2 is in line with the recently proposed role for GRKs and arrestins in “signal switching” (7Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and may also have physiological implications. In this regard, GRK2 appears to be important in the function and disfunction of the cardiovascular system (reviewed in Refs. 1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 5Aragay A.M. Ruiz-Gómez A. Penela P. Sarnago S. Elorza A. Jimenez-Sainz M.C. Mayor Jr., F.

Recent data indicate that c-Src activation plays a critical role in hypertrophic growth regulation of cardiac myocites (Refs. 46Fuller S.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol.

Therefore, the interaction between Src and GRK2 in such a pathway may help to understand the physiological consequences of the lack of GRK2 activity during embryonic development (lethal phenotype with marked myocardial hypoplasia (48Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, it is tempting to suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 may also modulate other unknown functions of this kinase in the GPCR multimolecular signaling complex or affect other aspects of GRK2 cellular functions and regulation, which we are currently investigating. On the other hand, our data also put forward GRK2 as a potential target for cross-talk mechanisms, suggesting a possible pathway by which other signaling transduction systems that lead to the activation of Src tyrosine kinase (reviewed in Ref. 52Thomas M. Brugge J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar) could modulate GPCR desensitization and signaling. The increasing role of GRKs and arrestins in GPCR signal transduction would require further research to better understand their mechanisms of regulation and their interaction with other cellular proteins.

Regulation of the ERMs involves intramolecular and/or intermolecular head-to-tail associations between family members. We have determined whether merlin undergoes similar interactions, and our findings indicate that the C terminus of merlin isoform 1 is able to associate with its N-terminal domain in a head-to-tail fashion. However, the C terminus of isoform 2 lacks this property. Similarly, the N terminus of merlin can also associate with C terminus of moesin. We have also explored the effect of merlin self-association on binding to the regulatory cofactor of Na+-H+exchanger (NHE-RF), an interacting protein for merlin and the ERMs. Merlin isoform 2 captures more NHE-RF than merlin isoform 1 in affinity binding assays, suggesting that in full-length merlin isoform 1, the NHE-RF binding site is masked because of the self-interactions of merlin. Treatment with a phospholipid known to decrease self-association of ERMs enhances the binding of merlin isoform 1 to NHE-RF. Thus, although isoform 1 resembles the ERM proteins, which transition between inactive (closed) and active (open) states, isoform 2 is distinct, existing only in the active (open) state and presumably constitutively more available for interaction with other protein partners.

Merlin has a striking similarity in sequence and structure with ezrin, radixin, and moesin, commonly referred to as the ERM proteins. The ERM proteins share ∼78% amino acid identity with each other, and all three are 45–47% identical to merlin (3Trofatter J.A. MacCollin M.M. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Duyao M.P. Parry D.M.

Like the ERM proteins and protein 4.1, merlin possesses a FERM (protein 4.1, ezrin, radixin,moesin) domain (∼270 amino acids defining membership in the protein 4.1 superfamily) in its N-terminal half, followed by a long α-helical segment and a charged C-terminal domain (4Chishti A.H.

TheNF2 gene comprises 17 exons with alternative splicing of the penultimate exon producing two major merlin isoforms. Isoform 1 is a 595-amino acid protein produced from exons 1–15 and exon 17. Isoform 2 results from the presence of the alternatively spliced exon 16, which alters the C terminus of the protein to produce a 590-amino acid protein identical to isoform 1 over the first 579 residues (5Haase V.H.

We and others have recently identified the human homologue of a regulatory cofactor for Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE-RF) as a novel interactor for the conserved N terminus of merlin and ERM proteins (14Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with many binding partners, the ERM proteins are capable of forming homo- and heterotypic associations between family members (16Gary R. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10846-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Indeed, several recent studies performed on the regulation of ERM proteins suggest that the availability of ERM domains to binding partners is controlled by self-association of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S.

Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thus the ERM proteins can exist in the “closed” state, where the N- and C-terminal regions undergo an intramolecular interaction, masking the respective ligand-binding site. This closed state can be converted to the “open” state in which intramolecular interaction is disrupted by a variety of cellular signals, including Rho-mediated signaling and the phospholipid PIP2. In vitro binding studies performed with merlin isoforms suggested that the C terminus of isoform 1 can interact with its N terminus, and the C terminus of isoform 2 lacked this property (20Sherman L. Xu H.M. Geist R.T. Saporito-Irwin S. Howells N. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Gutmann D.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2505-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Homotypic interaction of merlin isoform 1 and heterotypic interaction between merlin and the ERM proteins have also been reported recently by yeast two hybrid and blot overlay assays (21Gronholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang L. Ichimaru E. Pestonjamasp K. Cui X. Nakamura H. Lo G.Y.H. Lin F.I.K. Luna E.J. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of self-association in regulation of the ERM proteins, we have used affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE) assays to explore the capacity of the two major merlin isoforms to self-associate and to interact with a representative ERM protein. The uniqueness of this assay is the ability to determine the dissociation constants of the observed interactions. Although, like the ERMs, the C terminus of merlin isoform 1 interacts in a head-to-tail fashion with its N-terminal domain, the C terminus of isoform 2 lacks this property. The N terminus of merlin is also able to associate heterotypically with the C terminus of moesin. Furthermore, in affinity binding experiments we observe that full-length merlin isoform 2 is able to capture greater quantities of NHE-RF than full-length merlin isoform 1, consistent with the notion that the ligand binding is suppressed by the self-interaction of merlin isoform 1. In addition, the interaction between merlin isoform 1 and NHE-RF is enhanced in the presence of the phosphoinositide PIP2. Thus, merlin isoform 1 behaves like the ERM proteins in its interdomain interaction and its regulation by phospholipids, but merlin isoform 2 does not exhibit this property and is always available for interaction with other ligands. The different regulation of inter- and intramolecular domain interactions of the isoforms of merlin could play an essential role in its tumor suppressor function. Full-length isoform 1 (aa 1–595), full-length isoform 2 (aa 1–590), N-terminal (aa 1–332), and C-terminal (isoform 1 aa 340–595; isoform 2 aa 340–590; common to both isoforms aa 340–579) portions of merlin were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in pGEX2T. Also, full-length moesin (aa 1–577), N-terminal (aa 1–332), and C-terminal (aa 307–577) portions of moesin were expressed as GST fusion proteins in pGEX4T1. Similarly, full-length NHE-RF (aa 1–338) was expressed as a GST fusion protein. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously for merlin (23Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar) and using standard methods for moesin and NHE-RF. In addition, full-length merlin isoform 1 and 2 were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3 engineered to have a FLAG tag at the N terminus. These constructs were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells as described previously (24Xu L. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Beauchamp R. Pinney D. Sterner C. Ramesh V. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 238: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-merlin antibody (N21) and the polyclonal anti-GST antibody have been described previously (23Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar,25Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol.

The anti-FLAG antibody M2 was commercially obtained (Kodak, IBI). For affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE), purified GST fusion protein products of merlin and moesin were thrombin cleaved. ACE gels were prepared using 1% low melting point agarose in 125 mm potassium acetate, 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and carried out as described (25Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P.I. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis.

Gels were run at 60 volts for 4 h, and the proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose by capillary action and analyzed by immunoblotting using an affinity eluted N terminus-specific anti-merlin antibody (N21) at a dilution of 1:100 and protein A conjugated to 125I. Retardation coefficients were calculated as described previously (27Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants were calculated from nonlinear, least squares fitting of plots of corrected retardation coefficient versusconcentration of retarding protein (27Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Data were then fit, using a nonlinear least squares approach (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software), to the equation r = R ∞/[1 + (K d/[P tot])], wherer = retardation coefficient and [P tot] = protein concentration in a given lane of an ACE gel. The variables that were fit simultaneously wereK d, the dissociation constant, andR ∞, the maximum value of R. Data from two independent experiments were used for calculating dissociation constants, and the K d value is shown with S.E. ZR-75-B cells were lysed in Brij lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 30% glycerol, 1% Brij 96) containing a 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the lysate was incubated with 600 pmol of GST-merlin immobilized on glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing Pefabloc, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with IC270 antiserum (1:1000). In some experiments, GST-merlin immobilized on beads was incubated with ZR-75-B lysate along with 50 μl/ml phosphatidyl serine or PIP2 (Sigma). Each phospholipid was dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and sonicated three times each for 10 s. Cos-7 cells expressing merlin isoforms 1 and 2 as FLAG-tagged proteins were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a 1× protease inhibitor mixture as described above. The lysates were incubated with 600 pmol of GST-NHE-RF full-length fusion protein or GST protein alone coupled to GSH-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed as described above, and the separated proteins were immunoblotted with the anti-FLAG antibody M2. To determine whether merlin as an ERM family member is capable of self-association and to ascertain whether the two major isoforms of merlin differ from each other in this property, we used the technique of ACE. Using this technique we were able to demonstrate direct binding between the N- and C termini of merlin isoforms in solution and to measure the strength of the binding. Briefly, the thrombin cleaved N- (aa 1–332) and C-terminal (iso 1, aa 340–595 or iso 2, aa 340–590) polypeptides were subjected to affinity electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel in physiological buffer. The N terminus of merlin (at 125 nm) was loaded into a long transverse slot. The C terminus of either isoform 1 or 2 of merlin was cast (in agarose) into nine rectangular wells at concentrations ranging from 750 to 0 nm. The anode was placed so that the more rapidly migrating N-domain passes through the zones containing the C-domain during most of the electrophoresis run. The mobility of the N-domain was then detected by transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose and probing with an N-terminal-specific antibody. Fig. 1 A demonstrates the interaction of the N terminus of merlin with the C terminus of merlin isoform 1, where migrating N-domain encountered the C-domain. The migration of the former was retarded in a manner that varied directly with the concentration of the latter. In contrast, the migration of the N-domain of merlin was not retarded by the C-domain of merlin isoform 2 over the same range of concentrations (Fig.1 B). Because we were able to demonstrate a difference in self-association between the two isoforms of merlin that differ from each other only at the extreme C terminus, we further sought to determine whether the C-domain of merlin lacking both exons 16 and 17 is capable of self-interaction. To address this question we performed the same type of experiment described above except the C-domain of merlin spanned the common region aa 340–579. The results shown in Fig. 1 Cindicate that the migration of the N terminus was not retarded by this C-domain. These data suggest that the domain responsible for the self-association of the N terminus of merlin to the C terminus of merlin isoform 1 includes, at least in part, the last 16 amino acids (aa 580–595) specific to this isoform. To evaluate whether merlin can interact in a heterotypic fashion with other ERM family members, we performed ACE experiments where the N-domain of merlin was used as the faster migrating protein passing through the zones containing the C-domain of moesin (aa 305–557). Fig.1 D shows the interaction of merlin and moesin by the retardation of migration of the N terminus of merlin. The migration of purified GST used as a control protein was not affected by the merlin C-domain isoform 1 and moesin C-domain over the same range of concentrations (Fig. 1, E and F). From measurements of mobility retardation in Fig. 1 (A–F), we can calculate the dissociation constant for the interaction of the N- and C-terminal polypeptides of merlin isoforms 1 and 2 (homotypic) and for the interaction of merlin to moesin (heterotypic). To avoid problems arising from the saturation of the films, ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) was used to determine the true midpoint of each of the bands (28SanAntonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the analyses of the six representative experiments. For every gel, retardation coefficients (R) were determined for each C-terminal protein concentration tested. Dissociation constants were measurable for N-merlin interaction with the C-merlin isoform 1 and N-merlin interaction with the C-moesin by fitting the data to the equationr = R ∞/[1 =(K d,app/[proteintot])] (see “Experimental Procedures”). Merlin isoform 1 can self-interact with a K d of 49.0 ± 6.45 nm, whereas merlin interacts with moesin with a K d of 28.5 ± 6.5 nm. By contrast, no binding was measurable with merlin isoform 2 and control proteins. We recently identified NHE-RF, a regulatory factor for the Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), as an interacting protein for merlin in a two-hybrid screen and demonstrated that NHE-RF can bind to merlin, moesin, and radixin via their conserved N-terminal regions (14Murthy A.

It is well documented that the binding of ERM proteins to their ligands is suppressed in the native full-length protein (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), a phenomenon explained by the interdomain interactions of the ERM proteins that could compete with the ligand binding (29Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether NHE-RF displays differential binding with isoforms 1 and 2 of merlin by performing affinity precipitation experiments. Briefly, equal quantities of merlin full-length isoforms 1 and 2, N-domain, C-domain of both isoforms 1 and 2, expressed as GST fusion proteins, were bound to Sepharose beads and incubated with equal amount of ZR-75-B cell lysates. After extensive washes, the coupled proteins were removed from the beads by boiling and were detected on Western blots using a specific polyclonal antibody against NHE-RF. The results shown in Fig.3 demonstrate that the N-domain and full-length isoform 2 of merlin exhibit a greater affinity for NHE-RF than merlin isoform 1. As expected NHE-RF did not bind to either the C-domain of both isoforms of merlin or the GST control protein. These results were further confirmed by at least three independent experiments. To confirm the differential binding of merlin isoforms to NHE-RF, affinity binding assays were performed utilizing merlin isoforms expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in Cos-7 cells and GST fusion protein of NHE-RF. The expression of FLAG-tagged merlin isoforms in Cos-7 cells were examined with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2) and found to be equally expressed (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2). Cos-7 cell lysates expressing approximately the same amount of the isoforms were incubated with 600 pmol of GST-NHE-RF beads. The bound proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and probed with M2 antibody (Fig. 4). Merlin isoforms expressed in mammalian cells also revealed a differential binding to NHE-RF, and the analysis of the supernatants that were not bound to the beads clearly showed that NHE-RF beads capture 3–5-fold more merlin isoform 2 than isoform 1 in duplicate set of experiments. These data are consistent with the ACE results supporting that merlin isoform 2 exists constitutively in an open conformation that allows its ligand, NHE-RF, to interact without being hindered by the interdomain interaction that occurs in merlin isoform 1. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and PIP2 enhance the interaction of ERM proteins to its ligands CD44, ICAM-1, and ICAM-2 (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). ERM proteins bind to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and PIP2 (30Niggli V. Andreoli C. Roy C. Manget P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and it is believed that this binding evokes conformational changes in these proteins in a manner similar to the regulation of vinculin activity by PIP2 (31Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether PIP2 influences the binding of NHE-RF to merlin isoforms. For this, PIP2 or phosphatidyl serine was included in the affinity precipitation assays. In the presence of PIP2 the amount of NHE-RF bound to merlin isoform 1 significantly increased (Fig. 5). The intensity of the bands was further analyzed by densitometric scanning of the autorads using transmittance analysis (Fluor-S, Multiimager, Bio-Rad). Results from three independent experiments revealed a 3-fold increase (3.10 ± 1.04) in binding of NHE-RF to merlin isoform 1 in the presence of PIP2. The binding of NHE-RF to either the N-domain of merlin or merlin isoform 2 (1.07 ± 0.45) was not influenced by PIP2 (Fig. 5). The control phospholipid phosphatidyl serine did not enhance the NHE-RF binding to merlin isoform 1 (Fig. 5). Despite an overall structural similarity to the ERM proteins, merlin differs from these relatives in having two isoforms with alternative C termini and in having a demonstrated tumor suppressor function. Both isoforms are expressed at the RNA and protein level in a variety of cell lines examined including NF2 target cells such as Schwann and meningeal cells (Refs. 6Arakawa H. Hayashi N. Nagase H. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 7Pykett M.J. Murphy M. Harnish P.R. George D.L. Hum. Mol.

Work from other laboratories has demonstrated the interdomain interaction of merlin using yeast two hybrid, blot overlay, co-immunoprecipitation, andin vitro binding assays (20Sherman L. Xu H.M.

Commun. 1998; 248: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Employing the technique of ACE, we not only demonstrate the difference between merlin isoforms in their interdomain interaction but also define the affinities of these interactions. The affinities that we have observed for merlin self-interaction and for the interaction of merlin with moesin are quite comparable with that reported for radixin using similar analysis (25Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal construct of merlin containing the common region (aa 340–579) did not exhibit the self-interaction, we believe that the isoform 1-specific C-terminal residues (aa 580–595) are critical for the interdomain binding. This is in agreement with a previous report suggesting that extreme C-terminal protein sequences encoded by exon 17 is critical for the interdomain interaction (20Sherman L. Xu H.M. Geist R.T. Saporito-Irwin S. Howells N. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Gutmann D.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2505-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is well established that the interaction of ERM proteins with their membrane partners, as well as with the actin cytoskeleton, is suppressed in the full-length molecule, a phenomenon explained by intramolecular self-association that masks the binding sites for other ligands (32Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 33Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In the presence of phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate or PIP2, the interdomain interaction is disrupted, thus exposing the ligand binding sites (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Interdomain interaction also blocks the binding of full-length ezrin and radixin to NHE-RF compared with their N termini (29Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).2 In our earlier studies (14Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we failed to note a similar difference in binding to NHE-RF between the full-length merlin isoform 1 and the N-domain of merlin (aa 1–332). This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the previous studies were designed to answer qualitatively whether merlin binds to NHE-RF. However, the present studies were done in a quantitative fashion to address the differences in binding between the two isoforms of merlin. Our results demonstrate that the binding of merlin isoform 1 to its ligand NHE-RF is suppressed in the full-length molecule, and in the presence of PIP2 this suppression is relieved. Merlin isoforms expressed in mammalian cells show the same difference in their binding to NHE-RF as the bacterially expressed proteins. The fact that merlin isoforms expressed in mammalian cells show differential binding to NHE-RF suggests that this may have functional significance in vivo. The studies performed here illustrate the differences in the ability of the two alternatively spliced isoforms of merlin to interact with NHE-RF and further show that a phospholipid such as PIP2can regulate the interaction of merlin isoform 1 to NHE-RF. Thus these results document that merlin isoform 1 behaves in a manner similar to its ERM relatives, whereas merlin isoform 2 behaves distinctly and binds to NHE-RF more efficiently. Similarly, betaII-spectrin, a C-terminal interactor of merlin, has been shown to interact to a greater extent with the C terminus of merlin isoform 2 than with the C terminus of isoform 1 (34Scoles D.R. Huynh D.P. Morcos P.A. Coursell E.R. Robinson N.G.G. Tamanoi F. Pulst S.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a critical Thr residue at the C terminus of the ERM proteins has been implicated in stabilizing the open conformation of these proteins (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This Thr residue is conserved in both isoforms of merlin; however, further studies are required to understand whether the phosphorylation of this residue is involved in regulating the intramolecular interaction of merlin isoform 1 and what role it might play in the function of merlin isoform 2. Both NHE-RF and the related NHE-RF2 possess two PDZ domains known to mediate protein-protein interactions. The interaction of NHE-RF and NHE-RF2 with merlin and the ERMs is not mediated by the PDZ domains (14Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the PDZ domains of both NHE-RF and NHE-RF2 can interact with several other membrane proteins, such as Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3, the β2-adrenergic receptor, the purinergic P2Y1 receptor, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which functions as a Cl− channel (35Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Foster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Thus, NHE-RF and NHE-RF2 appear to act as multifunctional adaptor proteins that may link merlin and the ERM proteins to different ion channels and receptors, providing many new possibilities for effects on intracellular signaling. Because merlin isoform 2 exists always in the open state, its interaction with NHE-RF and potentially with other merlin interactors may in fact occur when the equivalent sites in merlin isoform 1 and in the ERM proteins are masked in the closed state. The strategy of comparing merlin with the related ERM proteins can be expected to produce similarities that are instructive concerning the overall function of these types of proteins and differences that could reveal the special tumor suppressor activity of merlin. In this study, we have observed both. The behavior of merlin isoform 1 with respect to interdomain interactions suggests that its regulation is similar to the regulation of ERM protein interactions. Moreover, the interaction of merlin with the ERM proteins suggests that these proteins could also be involved in mutual regulation of each other's activities. Although the full range of merlin interactions with other proteins remains to be delineated, it is likely that merlin sits within a web of interactions comprising multiple partners and signaling pathways, some of which are shared with the ERM family members. Interestingly, studies of theDrosophila homologue of merlin suggest that its growth suppression properties reside within the conserved N-terminal domain of the protein (37Lajeunesse D.R. McCartney B.M. Fehon R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the distinct tumor suppressor role of merlin could lie either in the distinct regulation of isoform 2, which differs from that of isoform 1 and the ERM proteins, or in the participation of merlin but not the ERM proteins in a signaling pathway that is uniquely important to NF2 target cells such as Schwann and meningeal cells.

https://openalex.org/W2154153871,"We present the solution structure of MAP30, a plant protein with anti-HIV and anti-tumor activities. Structural analysis and subsequent biochemical assays lead to several novel discoveries. First, MAP30 acts like a DNA glycosylase/apurinic (ap) lyase, an additional activity distinct from its known RNA N-glycosidase activity toward the 28S rRNA. Glycosylase/ap lyase activity explains MAP30's apparent inhibition of the HIV-1 integrase, MAP30's ability to irreversibly relax supercoiled DNA, and may be an alternative cytotoxic pathway that contributes to MAP30's anti-HIV/anti-tumor activities. Second, two distinct, but contiguous, subsites are responsible for MAP30's glycosylase/ap lyase activity. Third, Mn2+ and Zn2+ interact with negatively charged surfaces next to the catalytic sites, facilitating DNA substrate binding instead of directly participating in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2017774392,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are activated in response to the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to an intracellular domain. This domain is thought to contain a beta roll and two alpha helices, designated the B and C helices. To probe the conformational changes occurring in the ligand-binding domain during channel activation, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). We found that a residue in the beta roll, C505, is more accessible in unliganded channels than in liganded channels, whereas a residue in the C helix, G597C, is more accessible in closed channels than in open channels. These results support a molecular mechanism for channel activation in which the ligand initially binds to the beta roll, followed by an opening allosteric transition involving the relative movement of the C helix toward the beta roll."
https://openalex.org/W1976617130,"Behavioral and neuroendocrine responses underlying systemic osmoregulation are under the concerted control of centrally located osmoreceptors and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Na+ concentration ([Na+]) detectors. Although the process underlying osmoreception is understood, the mechanism by which [Na+] is detected and integrated with cellular information derived from osmoreceptors is unknown. Here, we show that shifts in extracellular [Na+] ([Na+]0) cause proportional changes in the relative Na+ permeability of mechanosensitive cation channels responsible for signal transduction in the osmosensory neurons of the supraoptic nucleus. This effect causes the generation of Na+ specific receptor potentials under isotonic conditions and modulates osmoreceptor potentials and electrical responsiveness during osmotic perturbation. These results provide a cellular basis for Na+-sensing and for the coordinated detection of CSF [Na+] and osmolality in central osmoregulatory neurons."

The parasite exhibits a complex life cycle in which the extracellular, flagellated promastigote is present in the phlebotomine sandfly vector, and the intracellular amastigote form is found within the phagolysosome of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the mammalian host. The current arsenal of drugs used to treat leishmaniasis was arrived at empirically and is far from ideal. Chemotherapy is complicated both by drug toxicity and resistance (1Grogl M. Thomason T.N. Franke E.D. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1992; 47: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the need for more efficacious and less toxic agents, particularly rational drugs that exploit targets unique to the parasite, is acute. Perhaps the metabolic pathway that is most discrepant betweenLeishmania and the mammalian host is that by which purine nucleotides are synthesized. Whereas mammalian cells synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, all protozoan parasites lack this purine pathway (2Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar). Consequently, each genus of parasite expresses a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes that enable the acquisition of host purines (2Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar). Biochemical measurements in extracts of L. donovani revealed the existence of three biochemically distinct phosphoribosyltransferase (PRT)1 enzymes, hypoxanthine-guanine PRT (HGPRT), adenine PRT (APRT), and xanthine PRT (XPRT), all of which convert preformed purine bases to the nucleotide level (3Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas HGPRT and APRT have mammalian counterparts, XPRT is unique to L. donovani and is, therefore, a potential target for therapeutic exploitation. HGPRT and APRT have both been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the native and recombinant HGPRT and APRT proteins purified to homogeneity and characterized (4Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T.

The construction of viableΔhgprt and Δaprt null mutants that can proliferate in defined growth medium supplemented with any purine base or nucleoside and salvage radiolabeled hypoxanthine, coupled with the ability of xanthine to obliterate hypoxanthine incorporation inΔhgprt but not wild type parasites, implicate a prominent role for XPRT in purine scavenge by L. donovani (4Hwang H.-Y.

In order to characterize XPRT and investigate its role in intact parasites, we have cloned XPRT by functional rescue of anE. coli purine auxotroph lacking prokaryotic PRT activities. Sequence analysis and molecular characterization of the XPRTlocus revealed that XPRT was a single copy gene located 2.2-kb downstream from HGPRT . To test XPRT function in intact parasites, a Δxprt knockout was created by double-targeted gene replacement and characterized for its ability to salvage a variety of purines. For biochemical characterization,XPRT was overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity. Kinetic analysis revealed a novel enzyme of unique substrate specificity that phosphoribosylated xanthine most efficiently but also recognized, albeit inefficiently, hypoxanthine and guanine.

A directionally cloned Uni-ZapXR L. donovani cDNA library was subjected to in vivoexcision and electroporated into SΦ609 E. coli(Δpro-gpt-lac, thi, hpt, pup, purHJ), a strain that is auxotrophic for purines and lacks the bacterial PRT enzymes, hypoxanthine PRT, and xanthine-guanine PRT (6Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The bacteria were plated on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and the lawn of transformants was resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed twice with 20 ml of a low phosphate induction (LPI) medium. The cell suspension was diluted to 0.5 A 550 with LPI, and 100-μl aliquots were plated on LPI agarose plates supplemented with 150 μM xanthine, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the resultant colonies, and the ends of the inserts were sequenced on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer using standard dye-terminator cycle sequencing methodology. 20,000 colonies from an L. donovani cosmid library were screened at high stringency using the XPRT cDNA as a hybridization probe using previously reported laboratory protocols (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar). A 4.3-kbEcoRI fragment encompassing both HGPRT andXPRT was subcloned from one purified cosmid into the pBluescript vector KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using the CLUSTAL X multiple sequence alignment program (8Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). The construction and molecular characterization of the Δhgprt andΔhgprt/Δaprt knockout parasites by targeted gene replacement has been described in detail (4Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19488-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DI700 is the wild type clone of L. donovani from which the Δhgprt andΔhgprt/Δaprt clones were eventually derived. AllL. donovani lines were propagated in a completely defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle-Leishmania (DME-L) medium that was routinely supplemented with 100 μm purine. Selections of L. donovani transfectants were performed on DME-L-FBS plates (DME-L plus 5% fetal bovine serum) and 1.0% Noble agar. The purine source employed for routine propagation of all L. donovani strains was xanthine, except for the selection and maintenance of the Δxprt line in which the xanthine in the culture medium was replaced with hypoxanthine. The purine in DME-L was varied when assessing purine salvage capacities of wild type and mutantL. donovani strains. Total RNA was isolated from wild type (DI700), Δhgprt, and Δhgprt/Δaprtpromastigotes in late exponential phase using the Qiagen RNeasy midi-kit. Thirty μg of total RNA were loaded onto each lane of a 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gel and electrophoresed under standard conditions (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) by capillary action using 40 mm NaOH and cross-linked with ultraviolet light. Membranes were prehybridized in 6× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS solution containing Denhardt's solution and 200 μg/ml herring sperm DNA for 2 h at 42 °C. Northern blots were hybridized at 42 °C for 20 h with a random prime labeled 598-bp fragment from theXPRT gene. Membranes were washed twice for 30 min in 1× SSC at 65 °C followed by autoradiography at −70 °C for 72 h. To normalize for RNA loading, the blot was stripped and reprobed with theL. enriettii 1.4-kb rRNA gene (9Comeau A.M. Miller S.I. Wirth D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated from 1 × 108 log phase L. donovani DI700 promastigotes using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). cDNA was generated using random hexamer oligonucleotides and the Superscript reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). A nondegenerate sense primer, 5′-CCAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG-3′, was designed to the L. donovani mini-exon (10Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that istrans-spliced onto the 5′ terminus of all leishmanial mRNAs (11Miller S.I. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2597-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and an antisense primer 5′-GCGGGTTGTCGTAGCTGAT-3′ to the XPRT coding sequence was used to amplify the 5′ end of the XPRT mRNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on an MJ Research thermocycler using 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s with Tflas the polymerase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The PCR product was ligated into pBluescript KS+ and sequenced. A sense oligonucleotide, 5′-TCCCAAGCTTGTAGAGGCATGCCTCATC-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-ACGCGTCGACGTAATTTATCTATCGCTCCGTTGC-3′, containing restriction sites for HindIII andSalI (underlined), respectively, were used to amplify a 970-bp 5′ flank of XPRT by PCR. Similarly, a 620-bp sequence 3′ to the XPRT coding region was amplified using the sense primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGAAATGTGGAGGCGGCTGAG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGAAGATCTTGAAGAGGGAGAGTGGCGAGGT-3′ that encompassed SmaI and BglII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. To generate the knockout constructs the 970-bp 5′ and 620-bp 3′ flanks were cloned into theHindIII/SalI and SmaI/BglII sites of the pX63HYG and pX63NEO vectors, which contain the hygromycin phosphotransferase and neomycin phosphotransferase resistance markers, respectively (12Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The presence of the XPRT flanking regions and their orientation were confirmed by restriction mapping. The drug resistance cassettes were designated pX63-NEO-Δxprt and pX63-HYG-Δxprt. Parasites were transfected by electroporation using conditions identical to those reported previously (4Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ulman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pX63-NEO-Δxprt and pX63-HYG-Δxprt were linearized by digestion with HindIII and BglII, and the 4.6- (pX63-NEO-Δxprt) and 4.8-kb (pX63-HYG-Δxprt) fragments were gel-purified prior to electroporation. The first wild type XPRT allele was replaced with pX63-HYG-Δxprt to create theXPRT/xprt heterozygote, whereas the other wild type allele was supplanted with pX63-NEO-Δxprt to generate the homozygous Δxprt knockout strain. Electroporated parasites were maintained for 24 h in liquid medium prior to plating in semi-solid DME-L-FBS. The XPRT/xprt lines were selected in DME-L-FBS supplemented with xanthine containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, whereas the Δxprt null mutant was selected in 20 μg/ml geneticin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin with hypoxanthine as the purine source. Hygromycin was added to the selective medium for theΔxprt knockouts to ensure selection of transfectants in which pX63-NEO-Δxprt had integrated into the remaining wild type allele in the XPRT/xprt line. Colonies isolated after transfection with either pX63-NEO-Δxprt or pX63-HYG-Δxprt were initially expanded in 1.0 ml of DME-L-FBS and then continually maintained in DME-L (no fetal bovine serum) containing the appropriate purine and selective agents. The allelic replacements in the genetically manipulated strains were established by Southern blotting, and the enzyme deficiencies determined by immunoblotting. Once the genetic lesions were confirmed, the purine salvage capacities of the wild type, XPRT/xprt,and Δxprt promastigotes were assessed by growth in DME-L supplemented with a single purine base or nucleoside. According to the recently adopted genetic nomenclature for genetically manipulated Leishmania strains (13Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Bringaud F. Cross G. C ruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J. El-Sayed N. Fu G. Ersfeld K. Gibson W. Gull K. Ivens A. Kelly J. Lawson D. Lebowitz J. Majiwa P. Matthews K. Melville S. Merlin G. Michels P. Myler P. Norrish A. Opperdoes F. Papadopoulou B. Parsons M. Seebeck T. Smith D. Stuart S. Turner M. Ullu E. Vanhamme L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the heterozygote and homozygote null mutant are designatedXPRT/Δxprt::NEO andΔxprt::NEO/Δxprt::HYG, respectively. For the purposes of simplicity and communication, these strains will be called XPRT/xprt and Δxprt throughout this paper. Mid-log phase cultures (160 ml) of DI700,Δhgprt, and Δhgprt/Δaprt promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 5.0 ml of PBS. Cell pellets were suspended in 5.0 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0% Triton X-100 (Calbiochem) and subjected to three rounds of rapid freezing and thawing to lyse parasites. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and brought to 40% saturation with solid (NH4)2SO4 and incubated on ice for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were removed, and the supernatant was brought to 80% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 and maintained at 4 °C for 16 h. The protein precipitates containing the bulk of theL. donovani PRT activities (3Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were dissolved in 1.0 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, and aliquots were used for determining protein concentration (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 248-254Crossref Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). XPRT activity was measured by mixing 10 μl of the 80% (NH4)2SO4 protein fraction with 150 μl of an assay mixture containing 40 μm[14C]xanthine and 1 mmpyrophosphorylpyrophosphate (PRPP) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 and incubating at 37 °C. At various intervals, 15-μl aliquots were removed, spotted onto DEAE filters that were then washed extensively with H2O, and the levels of XMP quantitated by liquid spectrophotometry. TheL. donovani XPRT coding sequence was amplified from the genomic DNA template by PCR using the 5′ sense primer 5′-TCTCATATGCTACCAACCCACAGTTGT-3′ and the 3′ antisense primer 5′-TCTCTCTGCAGTCAGAGCTTGGCAGGGTAAC-3′. AnNdeI restriction site was created at the initiation methionine codon in the sense primer, and a PstI restriction site was introduced into the antisense primer downstream of the termination codon for subcloning into the pBAce (15Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Olafson R.W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) expression vector (restriction sites in primers described in previous sentence are underlined). The fidelity of the XPRT sequence generated by PCR was verified by DNA sequencing. The pBAce-XPRT construct was transformed into SΦ609 E. coli (6Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), andXPRT expression was induced in LPI medium as described (15Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Olafson R.W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One-liter volumes of overnight bacterial cultures were harvested, and the cell pellets was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2 (TM) buffer and lysed with two passes through a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 31,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were applied to DEAE-cellulose columns (2.7 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2. Void volume fractions containing XPRT activity, as determined spectrophotometrically (see below), were pooled, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to 40% saturation. Following a 30-min incubation at 0 °C, the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation and discarded, and the supernatant was brought to 60% saturation with solid (NH4)2SO4 to precipitate XPRT. The protein pellet was dissolved in 5.0 ml of 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2 and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column (1.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 1.0m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2. XPRT enzyme was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient from 1.0m to zero (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2. XPRT fractions containing only a single 27-kDa polypeptide, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), were pooled, dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml protein using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). All XPRT preparations were rapidly frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath and stored at −70 °C. No significant loss in enzyme activity was observed after 10 months of storage. Polyclonal antisera against L. donovani XPRT were generated in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) using recombinant XPRT protein as immunogen and standard injection protocols. Antisera titers were evaluated by immunoblotting after fractionation of crude promastigote lysates on a reducing 15% SDS slab gel and transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane (17Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of PBS containing 3% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with XPRT antisera diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit second antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and developed with the NEN Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Signals were quantitated by densitometric measurements on a Bio-Rad scanning densitometer (Bio-Rad). The pBAce-XPRTconstruct was transformed into SΦ609 E. coli and plated on LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. A single bacterial colony was then picked and resuspended in 200 μl of LPI medium supplemented with ampicillin and streptomycin, and 20-μl aliquots were then dispensed into 3.0 ml of liquid LPI medium containing both antibiotics and either adenine, adenine/hypoxanthine, adenine/guanine, adenine/xanthine, or adenine/guanosine. Each nucleobase or nucleoside was present at a concentration of 150 μm. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm), and cell growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. Initial rate measurements for the forward reaction were determined using a 1.0-cm path length on a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer equipped with a kinetic software package in a 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 buffer at 27 °C. Nucleobase substrate K m values were determined in 1.0 mm PRPP and either 1–100 μm xanthine, 1–100 μm guanine, or 1–8000 μm hypoxanthine, whereas the K m value for PRPP was ascertained at 1.0 mm hypoxanthine using PRPP concentrations ranging between 7.5 and 1000 μm PRPP. XMP and GMP formation was monitored at 250 and 257 nm using extinction coefficients of 3900 and 4200m−1 cm−1, respectively. IMP formation was monitored at 243 and 275 nm for hypoxanthine concentrations of 1–700 and 750–8000 μm, respectively. IMP concentrations were calculated using extinction coefficients of 2200 m−1 cm−1 at 243 nm and 1570m−1 cm−1 at 275 nm. In the absence of any sequence information about the XPRT protein, a functional complementation strategy was implemented to isolate the L. donovani XPRT cDNA. A directionally cloned L. donovani cDNA library was transformed into SΦ609 E. coli and plated in minimal M9 induction medium supplemented with adenine and xanthine. Five colonies were obtained, and nucleotide sequence of the plasmids revealed that the inserts exhibited the codon bias of a leishmanial protein coding gene (18Langford C.K. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and encoded a unique member of the purine PRT family, i.e. the insert predicted a polypeptide different from the L. donovani HGPRT (15Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Olafson R.W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and APRT (19Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with considerably more homology to the former. A 600-bp NcoI/SacI fragment from the protein coding region of the longest cDNA was then used as a probe to isolate an XPRT genomic clone contained within a 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment from a purified cosmid. The nucleotide sequences of the protein coding regions of the longest cDNA and genomic clone were identical and predicted a 241-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 27.1 kDa (Fig.1). An in-frame termination codon was located 16–18 nucleotides upstream from assigned initiation codon (see GenBankTM accession number AF170105). A multiple sequence alignment of the L. donovani XPRT protein with members of the “HGPRT” family from phylogenetically diverse organisms revealed that the XPRT contained the following: (i), a Val-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ser pentapeptide implicated in binding the 5′-phosphate group of IMP and GMP to HGPRTs (20Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), (ii) a Ser-Tyr dyad that is absolutely conserved among HGPRT family members and is essential for catalytic activity (21Jardim A. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8967-8973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), (iii) a conserved Lys at position 186 that is implicated in stabilizing purine binding, and (iv) a fingerprint Lys-His-Val-Leu-Ile-Val-Glu-Asp-Val-Cys-Asp-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr PRPP binding motif that is found among almost all members of the PRT family, as well as PRPP synthetase (22Hendrickson N. Allen T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A pairwise alignment between the L. donovani HGPRT (15Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Olafson R.W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and XPRT primary structures revealed a 33% amino acid identity and a similarity of 50% when conservative amino acid substitutions are considered, and similar pairwise alignments of XPRT with other HGPRTs displayed identities between 25 and 29% (Fig. 1). A similar comparison of the L. donovani XPRT with APRT (19Allen T.E. Hwang H.Y. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) sequences showed essentially no homology except within the signature PRPP binding domain (data not shown). One other XPRT structural feature worth noting is the COOH-terminal tripeptide, Ala-Lys-Leu, a motif compatible with the topogenic signal for targeting to the glycosome (23Fung K. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a peroxisomal-like organelle unique to trypanosomatid protozoa (24Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of the XPRT locus using both cosmid (Fig.2 A) and genomic (data not shown) DNA gave identical restriction patterns and indicated that the gene was present as a single copy within the L. donovanigenome, as BglII and SalI, both of which cut once within the XPRT coding region, each excised two hybridizing bands of unequal size. Strikingly, the restriction pattern of theXPRT locus was remarkably akin to that of HGPRT(Fig. 2 A). Digestion of cosmid and L. donovanigenomic (data not shown) DNA and probing with the XPRTcoding region (1st panel) revealed a hybridization pattern consisting of a 7.5-kb BamHI, a 6.0-kbBglII, a 4.3-kb EcoRI, a 3.9-kb PstI, a 3.3-kb SacI, and a 2.9-kb SalI fragments common to those obtained after hybridization to HGPRT(2nd panel). Control experiments showed thatXPRT and HGPRT do not cross-hybridize under the high stringency hybridization and wash conditions employed in these Southern blot analyses. These data implied that HGPRT andXPRT were proximally located on the same L. donovani chromosome. The co-localization of HGPRT andXPRT was supported further by Southern blot analysis ofL. donovani chromosomes fractionated by contour clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis (25Ablig W. Entian K.-D. Gene (A"
https://openalex.org/W2036279452,"Abstract Two cytokine-inducible kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are components of a 700-kDa kinase complex that specifically phosphorylates IκB. Phosphorylation of IκB by IKK leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The oncogenic protein Tax, encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), stimulates IKK activity to result in constitutive nuclear levels of NF-κB. In an attempt to gain insights into the mechanism by which Tax mediates constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway, we analyzed the chromatographic distribution of IKK proteins using cellular extracts prepared from three T lymphocytes either lacking or containing Tax. IKK kinase activity and the distribution of proteins in the IKK complex were characterized. In extracts prepared from cells containing Tax, the activity of both IKKα and IKKβ present in the 700-kDa IKK complex were increased. Surprisingly, cell lines expressing Tax also contained an additional peak of IKKβ, but not IKKα activity, that migrated at 300 kDa rather than at 700 kDa. We noted that extracts containing Tax had extremely low levels of IκBβ, but not IκBα, and contained predominantly a truncated form of the MAP3K MEKK1. These results suggest that Tax may target several components of the NF-κB pathway leading to constitutive activation of this important regulator of cellular gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1970346586,"Although three germ cell-specific transcripts of type 1 hexokinase exist in murine male germ cells, only one form, HK1-sc, is found at the protein level. This single isoform localizes to three distinct structures in mouse spermatozoa: the membranes of the head, the mitochondria in the midpiece, and the fibrous sheath in the flagellum (Travis, A. J., Foster, J. A., Rosenbaum, N. A., Visconti, P. E., Gerton, G. L., Kopf, G. S., and Moss, S. B. (1998) Mol. Biol. Cell 9, 263–276). The mechanism by which one protein is targeted to multiple sites within this highly polarized cell poses important questions of protein targeting. Because the study of protein targeting in germ cells is hampered by the lack of established cell lines in culture, constructs containing different domains of the germ cell-specific hexokinase transcripts were linked to a green fluorescent protein and transfected into hexokinase-deficient M+R42 cells. Constructs containing a nonhydrophobic, germ cell-specific domain, present at the amino terminus of the HK1-SC protein, were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. Mutational analysis of this domain demonstrated that a complex motif,PKIRPPLTE(with essential residues italicized), represented a novel endoplasmic reticulum-targeting motif. Constructs based on another germ cell-specific hexokinase transcript, HK1-sa, demonstrated the specific proteolytic removal of an amino-terminal domain, resulting in a protein product identical to HK1-SC. Such processing might constitute a regulatory mechanism governing the spatial and/or temporal expression of the protein.

The biological significance of appropriate protein targeting is best demonstrated in cells that are highly polar in organization. For example, epithelial cells of the renal tubules and intestinal lumen could not provide directional transport without their sodium-potassium ATPases organized strictly on their basolateral surfaces. Among the various cell types that have been studied, mature spermatozoa represent one of the most highly differentiated and polarized cells. The spermatozoon can be divided into three main compartments: the head, the midpiece, and the principal piece of the flagellum. Within these different compartments are many unique organelles such as the membrane-delimited acrosome in the head, as well as the fibrous sheath and outer dense fibers, cytoskeletal elements that surround the axoneme in the flagellum. Furthermore, organelles common to both germ cells and somatic cells possess unusual adaptations in the male gamete. In this regard, sperm mitochondria differ from their somatic counterparts in that they are restricted to a specific region of the cell (the midpiece of the flagellum) and possess additional germ cell-specific isozymes (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase-X) (1Goldberg E.

By regionalizing the distribution of specific organelles and proteins, spermatozoa have achieved a functional compartmentalization of the machinery necessary for such diverse functions as cellular motility, binding and penetrating the extracellular matrix of the egg, and binding and fusing with the plasma membrane of the egg. How these components are targeted and assembled during spermatogenesis to form the polarized spermatozoon is largely unknown. One enzyme critical to the compartmentalized metabolic pathways of both spermatozoa and somatic tissues is type 1 hexokinase (HK1)1 This enzyme is best known for catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose in the first step of glycolysis. Targeting of the somatic isoforms of HK1 is based largely upon the presence of different amino-terminal domains. The classical somatic cell HK1 can associate with the outer mitochondrial membrane through a 15-amino acid amino-terminal hydrophobic domain (3Polakis P. G. Wilson J. E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,4Gelb B. Adams V. Jones S.N. Griffin L.D. MacGregor G.R. McCabe E.R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This “mitochondrial membrane-binding domain” has been shown to be sufficient to target a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to the mitochondria in M+R42 cells, a HK-deficient cell line (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is believed that the hydrophobic nature of this domain allows insertion of this region of the protein into the outer mitochondrial membrane (6Xie G.C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two cell types, reticulocytes and male germ cells, contain mRNAs encoding variants of HK1 that do not possess this mitochondrial membrane-binding domain. In human reticulocytes, one of these HK variants contains an alternative amino terminus that replaces the first 21 residues with 20 alternative amino acids (7Murakami K. Piomelli S. Blood. 1997; 89: 762-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this reticulocyte-specific HK isozyme does not target to mitochondria but rather is found exclusively in the cytosol. It has been known for some time that male germ cells possess a variant of HK1 protein (8Katzen H.M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1967; 5: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Katzen H.M. Soderman D.D. Cirillo V.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 151: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In both mice and humans, three cDNAs have been identified that are predicted to encode for male germ cell-specific isoforms of HK1 that do not contain either the mitochondrial membrane-binding domain or the reticulocyte-specific sequence (10Mori C. Welch J.E. Fulcher K.D. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Mori C. Nakamura N. Welch J.E. Shiota K. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rather, the murine germ cell-specific HK mRNAs all encode an alternative 24-amino acid domain (10Mori C. Welch J.E. Fulcher K.D. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), called GCS for itsgerm cell-specific expression. This GCS domain is not hydrophobic in nature, in contrast to the somatic mitochondrial membrane-binding domain. Although three germ cell-specific HK1 transcripts, HK1-sa, HK1-sb, and HK1-sc, have been identified in the mouse (10Mori C. Welch J.E. Fulcher K.D. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), only one, HK1-SC, 2Lowercase letters will be used to denote nucleic acids/transcripts (e.g. HK1-sc), and uppercase letters will be used to denote proteins (e.g. HK1-SC). 2Lowercase letters will be used to denote nucleic acids/transcripts (e.g. HK1-sc), and uppercase letters will be used to denote proteins (e.g. HK1-SC). has been demonstrated to be expressed at the protein level (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our interest in the targeting of proteins within male germ cells began with our demonstration that this isoform is found associated with the membranes of the head of the sperm, as well as with the mitochondria and the fibrous sheath of the flagellum (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). How one isoform of HK could target to such dissimilar biochemical structures within a single cell type poses interesting questions regarding the basic cell biology of protein targeting and metabolic compartmentalization, as well as of sperm cell assembly during spermatogenesis. In addition to its unusual localization pattern, HK1-SC has some biochemical characteristics that are not seen with other isoforms of HK1. For example, the murine germ cell-specific protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and at least a population of this protein has properties consistent with an integral membrane protein (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J.

Dev. 1996; 43: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both the localization of the germ cell-specific HK to cell membranes and its biochemical behavior as an integral membrane protein are unexpected, given the fact that HK1-SC lacks the mitochondrial membrane-binding domain and contains neither predicted signal sequences nor regions of significant hydrophobicity (10Mori C. Welch J.E. Fulcher K.D. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies of protein targeting in germ cells have been hampered by the lack of established germ cell lines in culture. Therefore, to initiate a study of the mechanism by which HK may be targeted to multiple subcellular locations in sperm, we have chosen a heterologous cell expression system previously found to be useful in studies of the targeting of somatic forms of mammalian HK (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A series of HK-GFP fusion constructs including different segments of the murine germ cell-specific isoforms, or mutants thereof, were expressed in the HK-deficient M+R42 cell line (15Faik P. Morgan M. Naftalin R.J. Rist R.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Subcellular distribution was monitored using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The nonhydrophobic GCS domain was found to be necessary and sufficient to target fusion proteins to the ER and plasma membrane in this expression system. Mutational analysis defined a specific and complex targeting motif located within the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of the GCS domain. Individual point mutations and several combinations of mutations within this region did not abolish ER targeting but did disrupt normal protein processing through the ER to the plasma membrane. Only when six specific residues were mutated in combination was targeting to the ER abolished. Constructs based on another germ cell-specific HK1 transcript, HK1-sa, revealed the specific proteolytic removal of the unique amino-terminal domain of this isoform. The cleavage of this domain resulted in a protein identical to HK1-SC, the isoform of HK1 previously demonstrated to be expressed in sperm (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This processing might offer an explanation as to why HK1-sa transcript was not found at the protein level in a previous study (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and may represent a regulatory mechanism governing spatial and temporal expression of this protein during spermatogenesis. The pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was utilized for the production of HK fusion proteins with a carboxyl-terminal GFP tag. This vector permitted the expression of the fusion proteins under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmids were transfected into M+R42 cells, a HK-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line (15Faik P. Morgan M. Naftalin R.J. Rist R.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The M+R42 cell line was generously provided by Drs. Michael Morgan and Pelin Faik (Guy's Hospital Medical School, London, UK). Rhodamine 123 and DioC6(3) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The cDNA clones encoding the different germ cell-specific HK1 isoforms were generously provided by E. M. Eddy (National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC) (10Mori C. Welch J.E. Fulcher K.D. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol.

O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and are listed in Table I. All constructs not containing mutations were generated by the same general method that is described below. A schematic representation of the constructs generated for use in this study is shown in Fig.1.

Open table in a new tab Briefly, constructs including the SA domain, or the truncated SA domain (tSA), were first amplified from mixed germ cell total RNA by reverse transcription PCR, using SuperScript II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For other constructs, the appropriate DNA regions were amplified with oligonucleotide primers using either the original cDNA clones or plasmids constructed previously as the template (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). EitherTaq or Taq+ DNA polymerase was used depending upon the length of the expected product, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels with ethidium bromide and then isolated using the Wizard PCR Preps Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR products and the pEGFP-N1 vector were digested with HindIII andEcoRI (Promega, Madison, WI, and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively). The plasmid was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and the PCR products were ligated into the plasmid with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids then were transformed into HB101 competent cells (Promega), purified, and analyzed to check for the presence of the desired insert. DNA from plasmids containing inserts were sequenced on each end and over any internal domains of interest to ensure that the insert was correct and in-frame with the carboxyl-terminal GFP. An Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 373A automated sequencer, with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS, was utilized for sequencing. Transformed cells containing appropriate inserts were grown up, and plasmids were purified using the Perfect Prep Plasmid DNA kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), prior to transfection into the M+R42 cells. Point mutations in the GCS domain were created using the Quik-Change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Amino acids were altered with the goals of changing relative charge or hydrophobicity, while keeping size relatively constant. Oligonucleotide primers (TableII) were constructed to conform to the guidelines of the kit and included single or multiple base changes that resulted in the desired expression of alternative amino acid residues. Mutant constructs were generated according to the instructions of the kit, with the exceptions that the annealing temperature was varied from 55 to 59 °C and the number of cycles was varied from 10–18, depending upon the construct. Briefly, sense and antisense primers covering the same region were generated and used for PCR off the circular plasmid. After PCR, the DNA was treated with DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C to digest the dam methylated parental plasmid. The mutated plasmid was then transformed into competent cells, isolated, and sequenced as above.Table IIOligonucleotide primers and specific nucleotide substitutions used in the generation of mutant HK-GFP fusion proteinsMutant construct2-aAmino acid residues are numbered from the first M in the GCS domain, from Mori et al.

Open table in a new tab Mutant constructs containing amino-terminal deletions were generated with oligonucleotide primers containing an in-frame ATG 5′ to the region where translation was to begin. The protocol for generating the construct was the same as described above for nonmutant constructs. For observation by confocal microscopy, M+R42 cells were cultured in chambered coverglasses (Lab-Tek catalog number 178655, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and transfected using previously described procedures (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the transfection reagent. For preparation of cell extracts used in the immunoblotting experiments, M+R42 cells were grown in 100-mm plates. Transfection was done using LipofectAMINE PLUS to obtain higher transfection efficiencies, following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Extracts were prepared approximately 30 h after transfection. The cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of 0.6 ml of hot (boiling water bath) sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were transferred to microfuge tubes, sonicated for 6 s, and centrifuged for 5 min. The resultant supernatants were used for immunoblotting. As in the previous study (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), fluorescence was observed using an Insight® confocal microscope (Meridian Instruments, Okemos, MI), generously made available by Dr. Melvin Schindler (Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University). Excitation was obtained with the 488-nm line of an argon ion laser. Fluorescence of GFP was observed using a cutoff filter passing light of wavelength above 505 nm. Rhodamine 123 fluorescence was observed using a 570 ± 30 nm bandpass filter, and DioC6(3) fluorescence was observed with a 530 ± 30 nm bandpass filter. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6–20% gradient gels and electroblotting was performed as described previously (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 1% gelatin-5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and developed by standard methods, with detection using the SuperSignal West Pico Reagent (Pierce). Alternatively, proteins from cell lysates were separated and visualized using 10% gels (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts from the transfected M+R42 cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels under reducing conditions (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from gels to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were then blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS), and 5% cold water teleostean gelatin (Sigma). A variety of polyclonal antisera were used to detect the fusion protein products on immunoblots. Anti-GFP was purchased fromCLONTECH and used at a dilution of 1:10,000. An antiserum that detects both somatic and germ cell HK1 (anti-HK1) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000 (13Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera against either the unique amino-terminal region of HK1-SA (anti-SA) or the germ cell-specific region shared by HK1-SA, HK1-SB, and HK1-SC (anti-GCS) were used at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively (12Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in TTBS for 1 h, washed in TTBS, and then probed with an anti-rabbit, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 35 min. Blots were washed in TTBS for at least 2 h prior to visualization of target proteins by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. To examine the protein targeting of the germ cell-specific HK1 isoforms, we utilized an HK1-deficient somatic cell line, M+R42 cells, because no germ cell lines currently exist in culture that are permissive for spermatogenic differentiation. Confirming previous results (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), sham-transfected cells (transfected with vector containing no insert) showed no fluorescence when viewed under conditions used to image GFP fluorescence in cells expressing GFP-constructs (results not shown). When stained with the mitochondrial marker, rhodamine 123, mitochondria were clearly visible in a tubular-punctate pattern in these cells (Fig. 2 A). Staining of cells with DioC6(3), which primarily stains the ER, revealed a reticular pattern in the perinuclear region (Fig.2 B). DioC6(3) also labeled some peri-nuclear mitochondria. However, the differences in the pattern of staining between the organelles and the comparison of this labeling to the rhodamine 123 pattern allowed the two organelles to be easily distinguished. When cells were transfected with a construct containing GFP alone, a diffuse fluorescence was observed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus that did not correlate with either ER or mitochondrial localization (Fig.2 C). In addition to these controls, it was necessary to ensure that domains within the HK sequence shared between the germ cell-specific and somatic isoforms did not play a role in protein targeting. It has been suggested that other regions within the amino-terminal half of HK1 might interact with the mitochondrial membrane-binding domain and confer additional targeting information (5Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,17Smith A.D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a control for the possibility that these domains might confer specific targeting information, a construct containing the amino-terminal half of the germ cell-specific protein, minus the GCS region (tH) was generated. A diffuse pattern of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm demonstrated that this construct did not contain sufficient intrinsic information to target fusion proteins in the absence of an amino-terminal targeting domain (Fig. 2 D). The amino-terminal GCS region is found in all three germ cell-specific HK1 mRNAs, where it replaces the mitochondrial membrane-binding domain of the somatic HK1 isoform. It is the only region of HK1-SC that differs from the somatic isoform and was therefore a likely candidate to be involved in protein targeting. A full-length construct based on HK1-SC, GCS/H, was generated and observed to localize to the ER, and to a lesser extent, the plasma membrane (Fig.3, A and B). A construct based on the amino-terminal half of HK1-SC including the GCS domain, GCS/tH, also was seen to target to the ER. However, in these cells, a larger proportion of signal was seen in the membranes of vesicles coming off the ER and incorporating into the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, C and D). To investigate more precisely the role of the GCS domain in ER targeting, the construct GCS, comprised solely of the GCS domain fused to GFP, was generated. This construct was targeted to the ER and vesicles coming off the ER, but the majority of the signal was found at the plasma membranes (Fig. 3,E and F). Comparison of localization patterns at different times following transfection with these constructs revealed a distinct trend that the smaller the construct, the faster and more efficient the processing to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A,C, and E, demonstrates such differences in the relative amounts of plasma membrane localization). Thus at comparable times after transfection, a major portion of the GCS was found in the plasma membrane, with a lesser amount of the GCS/tH, and only minor amounts of the GCS/H showing a plasma membrane localization. These data, taken together with those from the tH control, demonstrated that the GCS region was both necessary and sufficient for targeting GFP to the ER and plasma membranes in M+R42 cells. When imaging fields of cells transfected with the above constructs, there were several cells that showed a diffuse pattern of fluorescence typical for GFP alone. This phenomenon occurred at a higher frequency in cells"

When there is a high density of starved cells, as indicated by a high concentration of CMF, the cells begin expressing some genes and aggregate using pulses of cAMP as a chemoattractant. CMF regulates gene expression via a G protein-independent pathway, whereas CMF regulates cAMP signal transduction via a G protein-dependent pathway. To elucidate receptors mediating cell density sensing, we used CMF-Sepharose to isolate membrane proteins that bind CMF. We identified a 50-kDa protein, CMFR1, that is sensitive to trypsin treatment of whole cells. We obtained partial amino acid sequence of CMFR1 and isolated the cDNA encoding it. The derived amino acid sequence has no significant similarity to known proteins and has two or three predicted transmembrane domains. Expression of CMFR1 in insect cells caused an increase in CMF binding. Repression of CMFR1 inDictyostelium by gene disruption resulted in a ∼50% decrease of the CMF binding and a loss of CMF-induced G protein-independent gene expression. The G protein-dependent CMF signal transduction pathways appear to be functional in cmfr1 cells, suggesting that cells sense the density-sensing factor CMF using two or more different receptors.

The simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum uses a cell density-sensing mechanism to coordinate its development.Dictyostelium normally exists as vegetative amoebae that eat soil bacteria. When a cell starves, it signals that it is starving by slowly secreting a cell density sensing factor, the glycoprotein conditioned medium factor (CMF)1 (4Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When there is a sufficiently high density of starving cells, as indicated by a high level of CMF, the cells aggregate using relayed pulses of cyclic AMP as the chemoattractant. The aggregated cells then develop into a fruiting body consisting of a mass of spores supported on a column of stalk cells. CMF has no obvious similarity to any known protein and has no obvious motif content aside from a signal sequence (7Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A starved cell secretes roughly 12 molecules of CMF/min and has a CMF sensitivity threshold of 0.3 ng/ml (5Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). Diffusion calculations showed that CMF can be used for density sensing on a soil surface (8Yuen I.S. Gomer R.H. J. Theo. Bio. 1994; 167: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for aggregates of fewer than ∼200 cells, the CMF concentration can never rise to 0.3 ng/ml. These results showed that as a general principle, cells can sense their local density by simultaneously secreting and recognizing a signal molecule. In addition, such a mechanism could be used to determine the total number of cells in a tissue (1Clarke M. Gomer R.H. Experientia. 1995; 51: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Gomer R.H. ASM News. 1999; 65: 23-29Google Scholar, 11Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CMF antisense and knockout cells do not aggregate unless exogenous CMF is added, suggesting that the function of CMF is to coordinate the development of large fruiting bodies by triggering aggregation only when most of the cells in a given area have starved, as signaled by a high level of extracellular CMF (7Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Without such a mechanism to sense the density of starved cells, cohorts of cells that starved at the same time might each form a small, ineffective fruiting body. CMF regulates at least three separate processes inDictyostelium. First, CMF regulates cAMP signal transduction (9Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When a pulse of cAMP arrives at a starved Dictyosteliumcell that is in the presence of high levels of CMF, a burst of cAMP is released by the cell to relay the signal, the cell moves toward the source of cAMP, and the expression of specific classes of genes is altered. The incoming cAMP pulse is sensed by cAR1 cell surface cAMP receptors. cAR1s then activate G proteins whose α subunits are Gα2. Gα2 normally binds GDP; when activated, Gα2 releases GDP and binds GTP, resulting in activation of adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase (see Refs. 12Theibert A. Devreotes P. J Biol Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Van Haastert P.J.M. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Janssens P.M.W. Eur. J.

The GTP is hydrolyzed back to GDP, inactivating the G protein. A cAMP-stimulated Ca2+ influx is mediated partly by a G protein-dependent pathway and partly by a G protein-independent pathway (17Milne J.L. Wu L. Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5926-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Sonnemann J. Aichem A. Schlatterer C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to CMF is required for cAMP activation of both cyclases and Ca2+influx (9Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A simple pathway allows CMF to regulate cAMP signal transduction. GTPγS causes a ∼40% reduction in the high affinity binding of CMF to membranes, suggesting that some of the putative CMF receptors are coupled to a G protein (19Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Bio. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). During the developmental stage when CMF regulates cAMP signal transduction, there is a second G protein present, Gα1 (20Kumagai A. Pupillo M. Gundersen R. Miake-Lye R. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Gα1 do not exhibit GTPγS inhibition of CMF binding and do not exhibit CMF regulation of cAMP signal transduction, suggesting that a putative CMF receptor interacts with Gα1 (19Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Bio. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that when CMF binds to this receptor, Gβγ is released from Gα1. This activates phospholipase C, which through an unknown mechanism causes the Gα2 GTPase to be inhibited, prolonging the lifetime of the cAMP-activated Gα2-GTP configuration. This, in turn, allows cAR1-mediated cAMP signal transduction to take place (19Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Bio. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Brazill D.T. Gundersen R. Gomer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Second, CMF regulates properties of cAR1. CMF binds to developing cells with a K D of approximately 170 ng/ml (2.1 nm) (6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vegetative cells have little CMF binding and few cAMP receptors, whereas starved cells possess about 40,000 receptors for CMF and cAMP. Transformants overexpressing cAR1 show a 10-fold increase of cAMP binding and a similar increase of CMF binding; disruption of the cAR1 gene abolishes both cAMP and CMF binding (22Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, high levels of cAMP down-regulate both cAMP and CMF binding, and CMF similarly down-regulates both cAMP and CMF binding. This suggested that cAMP and CMF binding are closely linked. We found that CMF does not bind to cAMP or cAR1, indicating that the effect of CMF on cAMP binding to cAR1 is through an intermediate (22Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2J. D. Bishop and R. H. Gomer, unpublished data. Binding of ∼200 molecules of CMF to starved cells affects the affinity of ∼35,000 cAR1s within 2 min, indicating that an amplifying signal transduction mechanism allows one activated CMF receptor to regulate many cAR1s (22Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In cells lacking Gβ, cAMP induced a loss of cAMP binding but not CMF binding, whereas CMF induced a reduction of CMF binding without affecting cAMP binding. These data thus suggested that CMF regulates properties of cAR1 through a G protein. Two other cAMP-induced events, the formation of a slow dissociating cAMP receptor form and the loss of cAMP binding, also require CMF (22Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The third process regulated by CMF is the expression of prespore- and prestalk-specific genes (4Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes requires cells to be exposed to both CMF and cAMP. However, we observed normal CMF/cAMP induction of these genes in cells lacking Gα1, Gα2, Gβ, phospholipase C, or cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase (19Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Bio. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggested that, unlike the regulation of cAMP signal transduction and cAR1 properties by CMF, the induction of prestalk and prespore gene expression by the combination of CMF and cAMP is G protein-independent. Our previous data on CMF binding kinetics did not indicate that there were two classes of CMF receptor with strongly differentK D values (6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there could either be one CMF receptor that mediates both activation of Gα1 as well as the G-independent activation of gene expression, or different CMF receptors with similar K D values, with one activating Gα1 and another activating gene expression. There is a precedent for multiple receptors sensing the same ligand inDictyostelium; pharmacological studies indicate that there are multiple folate receptors (23De Wit R.J.W. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 814: 199-213Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24De Wit R.J.W. Bulgakov R. Pinas J.E. Konijn T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 814: 214-226Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and four different cAMP receptors have been cloned, sequenced, and knocked out (25Kim J.Y. Borleis J.A. Devreotes P.N. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 35-47PubMed Google Scholar, 27Firtel R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1996; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To characterize the receptor(s) mediating cell density sensing, we used an affinity resin to purify a CMF receptor. We found CMFR1, a membrane protein that does not resemble G protein-coupled receptors. CMFR1 appears to mediate the G-independent CMF signal transduction but not the G-dependent CMF signal transduction, suggesting thatDictyostelium cells have two different receptors for CMF. Vegetative Dictyostelium Ax2 and Ax4 cells and mutants were grown in suspension shaking culture with HL5 and antibiotics as described previously (6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain starved cells, mid-log phase cells (2–5 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 6 min, resuspended in either PB (0.454 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.945 g/liter KH2PO4, pH 6.5) or PBM (20 mmKH2PO4, 0.01 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.1 with KOH), pelleted, and resuspended to 1–5 × 106 cells/ml at room temperature. Cells were then shaken as for growth conditions for 4–6 h. Developmental stages were followed on filter pads (7Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and low cell density assays for CMF- and cAMP-induced prestalk and prespore gene expression were carried out using immunofluorescence as described previously (28Clay J.L. Ammann R.A. Gomer R.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was made following Yuen et al. (29Yuen I.S. Taphouse C. Halfant K.A. Gomer R.H. Development. 1991; 113: 1375-1385PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-CMF was made and purified following the procedures of Jain and Gomer (6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 4 liters of bacteria yielded approximately 1–2 mg of fusion protein/0.5 g of resin. GST-CMF-Sepharose was prepared by incubating 0.3 g of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with freshly thawed bacterial lysate (13 ml) containing approximately 300 μg of recombinant GST-CMF. Control resin was prepared in parallel by coupling 500 μg of glutathione-S-transferase (Sigma) to 0.3 g of glutathione-Sepharose. The coupled resins were then washed with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) three times and 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline three times and used immediately for binding preparations. 6 × 109 vegetative or starved cells were pelleted, washed with ice-cold PB, and resuspended in 75 ml of 20 mm Na/PB (0.454 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.945 g/liter NaH2PO4, pH 6.5) containing 10% sucrose and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which was present in all purification buffers. Cells were then disrupted at 2 °C using a BioNeb cell nebulizer (VWR, Plainfield, NJ) at 150 p.s.i., and the particulate fraction was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets containing plasma membranes were resuspended in 6 ml of Na/PB/1 mm MgCl2 and passed 5 times through a 22-gauge needle before bringing the total volume to 15 ml. This fraction was then layered on a step gradient of 7 ml 35% over 2.5 ml 55% sucrose/PB and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 134,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C following Goodloe-Holland and Luna (30Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Spudich J.A. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 103-128Google Scholar). Membranes were removed from the 35–55% interface, pelleted at 39,000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 7.5 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40/PB, and passed three times through a 22-gauge needle. To solubilize proteins, the sample was then incubated with constant stirring for 1.5 h at 4 °C, clarified at 43,000 ×g for 15 min, and diluted to 45 ml with PBM. Nonspecific or GST-binding proteins were removed by first adding 0.3 ml of GST-Sepharose and incubating with constant mixing for 4 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation to remove the resin. The cleared extract was then transferred to a fresh tube containing 0.3 ml of GST-CMF-Sepharose and incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, 1 mm GTPγS, 1 mm GDPβS, or 70 μm cAMP were added during this step. Pelleted resin was then washed in a microcentrifuge tube two times with 1 ml of PBM and three times with 0.08% Nonidet P-40/PBM, and bound proteins were then eluted with 0.5% Nonidet P-40/PB containing 1 m NaCl for 1 h at 2 °C (under these conditions the GST-CMF remained tightly bound to the resin). The sample was then separated from pelleted resin by centrifugation and prepared for 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by desalting and concentrating in 62 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8) using a Centricon 10 filter unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and denatured overnight at 25 °C in Laemmlli sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). This was loaded on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel that was run with the top chamber containing 40 μl of thioglycolic acid (Sigma) in 200 ml of running buffer. Following electrophoresis, gels were either directly stained with Coomassie R-250, or protein was transferred onto ProBlot PVDF (Applied Biosystems) according to Towbin et al. (32Towbin H. Staihelin R. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Selected protein bands were removed for HPLC tryptic peptide or N terminus analyses essentially as described by Jain et al. (7Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by the Baylor College of Medicine Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory (Houston, TX). For whole cell trypsinization studies, 1.4 × 109 Ax2 cells were starved for 5 h. The cells were divided into two, collected by centrifugation, then resuspended in either 10 ml of PBM or 10 ml PBM/10 mg/ml TPCK trypsin (Sigma), and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBM/protease inhibitors, resuspended in 25 ml of 10% sucrose/PB, disrupted in the nebulizer, and processed for GST-CMF binding as described above in a proportionately scaled down manner. GST-CMF-associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The degenerate oligonucleotides 5′-TA(T/C)AA(T/C)TA(T/C)GA(T/C)GC(T/C/A)AT (T/C/A)CC-3′ and 5′-GCCATCCA(G/A)AA(G/A)TCTTG(G/A)TA-3′ were generated to encode N-terminal and internal tryptic peptide sequences, respectively, of a 50-kDa protein isolated using the above procedure. A λ YES vegetative Dictyostelium cDNA library was obtained from Dr. Eugeno DeHostos, and PCR was performed usingPfu enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the above primers. A 1050-bp DNA fragment was gel purified using GeneClean III (Bio 101, Vista, CA), ligated into pCR 2.1, and cloned using the One Shot Escherichia coli transformation system (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). Sequencing was then done at the Microbiology Department Core Sequencing Facility (University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX). Additional sequence was obtained by PCR of the λ YES library using internal oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCAGCACCAAATTGTTGCAAC-3′ and 5′-TCTCACCAATCTCTCAAGAG-3′, respectively, and λ YES 288lac to gal and 288gal to lac oligonucleotide primers; PCR products were then cloned and sequenced as above. Proteometics tools on the ExPASy molecular biology World Wide Web server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics were used to predict the pI and hydrophobicity using the algorithms of Eisenberg et al. (33Eisenberg D. Sweet R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and hydropathy by the algorithms of Kyte and Doolittle (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame along with 25 bases of untranslated region upstream of the start codon was obtained for baculovirus expression of CMFR1 by PCR of the λ YES cDNA library described above using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCCGGCCGCATCGAGATTTGCCAAACAC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGATTAATCTAATTTTTTAATTTGTTTTTTACCTTGG-3′, which generated 5′EagI and 3′ XbaI ends, respectively, for cloning into the polyhedron locus-based transfer vector pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Following restriction digestions of the PCR product and vector, ligation, and cloning in One Shot E. coli cells, the construct, isolated using a midi Plasmid Kit (Qiagen, Santa Claria, CA), was identified by the 9600/1500-bp vector/insert fragments of aBamHI/PstI digest. Recombinant baculovirus was generated in Sf9 cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) grown in serum-free/antibiotic-free Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Co-transformation using either 100 ng of Triple Cut Bac-Vector 2000 or 3000 virus DNA (Novagen) and 300 ng of pVL1392 containing the 1540-bp cDNA (above) or control plasmid pVL1392-XyLE (PharMingen) was performed following the Novagen BacVector System Manual. Five days after transformation, aliquots of the medium were used to infect cells for production of high titers of recombinant virus. Optimal infection and expression from the very late polh promoter were determined (after 2–3 days) by following cell cytotoxicity and staining parallel control cells for XyL E enzyme activity. The recombinant virus construct was partially identified by PCR of PreTaq-treated medium samples using the polh promoter primer (Novagen) and cDNA internal primers, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. Two synthetic peptides consisting of amino acids 185-202 and 354-369 (see Fig.2 A) were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and each was then used to immunize a rabbit at Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). IgG was purified from serum using ammonium sulfate (35Garvey J.S. Creamer N.E. Sussdorf D.H. Methods in Immunology. Third Ed. W. A. Benjamin, Inc., Reading, MA1977Google Scholar). Western blots were done following Lindsey et al. (36Lindsey D.F. Amerik A. Deery W.J. Bishop J.D. Hochstrasser M. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29178-29187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For fractionation, Sf9 cells were washed with 0.1% sucrose/2 mm NaCl/PB, resuspended to 106 cells/ml, and frozen and thawed three times. This was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant and pellet were collected and denatured at room temperature for several hours in Laemmli sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar).Figure 2A, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of cDNA encoding CMFR1. The sequence shown was obtained from cloning PCR products of a vegetative Dictyostelium λ YES cDNA library. Amino acids 1–56 do not appear to be part of the purified 50-kDa plasma membrane protein. N-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 57–76) from the purified protein is shown with a heavy solid line, and amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments from the purified protein are shown with heavy dashed lines. A putative signal sequence is shown with a light solid line.SalI indicates the site used to insert a blasticidin resistance cassette for a gene disruption construct. B, hydropathy plot of the deduced amino acid sequence. The complete protein sequence (510 amino acids) was analyzed with ProtScale programs based on the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) with a 9-residue window. The start (amino acid 57) of the 50.5-kDa protein sequence is indicated with an arrow. C, output from an algorithm to predict transmembrane domains. The derived amino acid sequence of CMFR1 was analyzed following Hofmann and Stoffel (40Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). Scores above 500 are considered a significant indicator of a transmembrane domain. The solid line represents the probability that a segment goes from the cytosolic side to the extracellular side; the dashed line indicates the converse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To generate a gene disruption mutant by homologous recombination, the 1060-bp cDNA-containing plasmid was cut at a single internalSalI site. pBsR 519 (37Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was digested with SalI, the 1400-bp BsR cassette was isolated by gel purification, and this was then ligated into the cDNA. The plasmid construct was cut withEcoRI, and transformation of Ax2 cells was done following de Hostos et al. (38de Hostos E.L. Rehfuess C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Gene disruption was assessed by PCR of genomic DNA prepared using PreTaq (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by Spann et al. (39Spann T.P. Brock D.A. Lindsey D.F. Wood S.A. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5003-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from 5 × 107 cells either at the vegetative stage or at various stages during starvation and development on filter pads. Vegetative cells were directly pelleted, and cells on filter pads were washed from the filters with PBM, pelleted, and then processed using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the protocol for animal cells.

The 1060-bp EcoRI cDNA fragment described above (100 ng) was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random hexamer-primed DNA synthesis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as probe in a 60 °C hybridization reaction (10 ng/ml) containing 0.25 mNa2HPO4, 0.25 m NaCl, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% polyethylene glycol (M r 8000), pH 7.2. Blots were washed with 25 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.2, twice at 25 °C for 30 min and then at 60 °C for 45 min. Autoradiography on preflashed Kodak X-OMAT AR5 film was done for various times at −70 °C. Recombinant GST-CMF from bacterial extracts was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, concentrated, dialyzed, and iodinated as described by Jain and Gomer (6Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol.

Either 4–5 h starved Dictyostelium or recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were washed with PB or 0.1% sucrose/2 mm NaCl/PB, respectively, and prepared for 125I-labeled CMF binding by resuspending cells in the respective buffers to a density of 106 cells/ml at 25 °C. Various concentrations of 125I-labeled CMF (0.4–4 nm) with or without a 20-fold excess of unlabeled CMF were prepared in PB with 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and clarified for 8 min at 16,000 × g before use. Reactions were initiated by adding 70 μl of the cells to 70-μl aliquots of CMF solution. After 25 min the mixtures were layered on 0.5 ml of sucrose/PB cushions (20% for Dictyostelium cells, 10% for Sf9 cells), centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 ×g, and frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath.

https://openalex.org/W1993807626,"The heat shock protein (Hsp) 70/Hsp40 chaperone system plays an essential role in cell physiology, but few of its in vivo functions are known. We report that biogenesis of Axl1p, an insulinase-like endoprotease from yeast, is dependent upon the cytosolic Hsp40 protein Ydj1p. Axl1 is responsible for cleavage of the P2 processing intermediate of pro-a-factor, a mating pheromone, to its mature form. Mutant ydj1 strains exhibited a severe mating defect, which correlated with a 90% reduction in a-factor secretion. Reduced levels of a-factor export were caused by defects in the endoproteolytic processing of P2, which led to its intracellular accumulation. Defective P2 processing correlated with the reduction in the steady state level of active Axl1p. Two mechanisms were uncovered to explain why Axl1p activity was diminished in ydj1strains. First, AXL1 mRNA levels were reducedydj1 strains. Second, the half-life of newly synthesized Axl1p was greatly diminished in ydj1 strains. Collectively, these data indicate Ydj1p functions to promote AXL1mRNA accumulation and in addition appears to facilitate the proper folding of nascent Axl1p. This study is the first to suggest a role for Ydj1p in RNA metabolism and identifies Axl1p as an in vivosubstrate of the Hsp70/Ydj1p chaperone system.

Ydj1p is an Hsp40 protein that is localized in the yeast cytosol and acts to regulate Hsp70 Ssa protein function (10Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

To facilitate these reactions, Ydj1p functions as molecular chaperone to bind and deliver non-native polypeptides to Hsp70 (19Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, Ydj1p is responsible for regulation of the Hsp70 ATP hydrolytic cycle (10Cyr D.M. Lu X.

On the other hand, independent regions within the zinc finger-like domain and carboxyl terminus of Ydj1p carry out its chaperone functions (19Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The combined activities of both the J-domain and polypeptide-binding domain are required in order for Ydj1p to assist Hsp70 in protein folding (19Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To further define the cellular functions of the Hsp70 Ssa1/Ydj1p chaperone system, we examined how mutations in Ydj1p influence the mating efficiency of MAT a yeast strains. The yeast mating reaction was chosen as a model test system because Ydj1p and Hsp70 Ssa1 were previously shown to function in biogenesis of α-factor (13Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 23Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R.

Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), the pheromone secreted by MATα cells. However, whether Ydj1pp could also function to promotea-factor biogenesis was not known. To mate efficiently, MAT a andMATα yeast must secrete their respective mating pheromones, which triggers signaling events that promote the fusion of haploid cells (25Jackson C.L. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In MAT a and MATα cells, these pheromones are synthesized in a proform and are processed to mature forms by peptidases that are homologous to the convertases that process prohormones and growth factors in higher eukaryotes (26Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,27Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prepro-α-factor is processed by endoproteases that are localized within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and then is secreted via the classical secretory pathway (28Julius D. Schekman R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 36: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,29Fuller R.S. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Ydj1p functions to promote the post-translocational translocation of prepro-a-factor across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (13Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). MAT a cells produce the propheromone pro-a-factor. a-Factor is a member of a growing family of secreted proteins, which include interleukin (IL) 1α and IL1β and the fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2, that are endoproteolytically processed in the cytosol and then secreted via a mechanism that does not involve the classical secretory pathway (30Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 31Kuchler K. Thorner J. Curr. Opin.

Sci. 1990; 15: 86-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Whether cytosolic chaperone proteins function to facilitate the processing, folding and/or secretion of any of these of these propeptides is an open question. Pro-a-factor is encoded by two genes: MFA-1 andMFA-2. Biogenesis of the MFA-1 gene product is most frequently studied and has been shown to occur in multiple steps.MFA-1-derived pro-a-factor is synthesized as a 36-amino acid residue propeptide, which contains a single copy of mature a-factor (33Michaelis S. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Pro-a-factor contains an amino-terminal extension and a CAAX box (C is cysteine,A is typically aliphatic, and X can be one of many amino acids) on its carboxyl terminus. The CAAX box serves as a site for the covalent modification of pro-a-factor with the isoprenoid farnesyl. Like other farnesylated proteins, pro-a-factor undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage of its carboxyl-terminal three amino residues (34Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 35Chen P. Sapperstein S.K. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biology. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The terminal cysteine residue that is exposed by endoproteolysis is then carboxymethylated, and this form of pro-a-factor represents a processing intermediate termed P1 (34Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 35Chen P. Sapperstein S.K. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biology. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal extension of P1 is cleaved in two steps. First, Ste24p converts P1 to P2 by cleaving pro-a-factor between residues 7 and 8 (35Chen P. Sapperstein S.K. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biology. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Then mature a-factor is generated by cleavage of a 14-amino acid residue peptide from the amino terminus of P2 in a reaction that is catalyzed by Axl1p (26Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, the ATP binding cassette protein Ste6p (30Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 36McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 340: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) secretes the 12-residuea-factor lipo-peptide across the plasma membrane. We report that MAT a ydj1 strains exhibit severe mating defects that can be accounted for by a dramatic reduction in their ability to secrete a-factor. Defects ina-factor secretion result from diminished processing of P2 to mature a-factor. Inhibition of P2 processing was accompanied by reductions in the level of Axl1. Reduced Axl1 levels were resultant from a drop in the quantity of Axl1 mRNA and instability of newly synthesized forms of this endoprotease. In the absence of functional Ydj1p, loss of Axl1 activity appears to hinder flux through the a-factor biogenic pathway and reduce mating efficiency of MAT a cells. These data identify Axl1p biogenesis as a process that is dependent upon Hsp70 Ssa1p/Ydj1p chaperone system. Standard techniques were utilized to monitor the mating of the haploid MAT a strains GMY210, GMY200, and GMY214 with the MATα partner GPY60 (37Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).MAT a strains were each grown in appropriate selective minimal media to mid-log phase. The GPY60 culture was grown to mid-log phase, and then 1 OD600 (units/ml) of these cells was plated on YPD plates. The various MAT astrains were harvested and resuspended to an OD600 of 1.0. Then, 4 μl of each strain was spotted onto the lawn of GPY60 and incubated for 5 h at 30 °C to allow for mating to occur. Mating mixtures were then replica plated onto selective semi-synthetic dextrose plates to select for diploids. The plates were incubated at 30 °C to allow for outgrowth of the diploid colonies, and mating was visualized after 48 h. A halo assay (37Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was utilized to monitora-factor secretion in the strains GMY210, GMY200, and GMY214. Briefly, yeast strains were grown overnight in selective minimal medium at 30 °C. The cells were then washed once in medium, and 5 ODs of each strain were spotted onto a YPD plate containing a lawn of 0.2 ODs of the a-factor tester strain XBH8–2C. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C, and halos were visualized after 48 h. Processing and maturation of pro-a-factor were monitored by pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation analysis as described previously (38Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring the 2μ MFA-1 expression plasmid, pYK17 (a gift from Dr. Jeffery Becker of the University of Tennessee), were cultured in selective semi synthetic minimal medium at 30 °C overnight. Cultures were then diluted into 250 ml of the same selective medium and incubated until an OD600 between 0.2 and 1.0 was reached. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in a total volume of 3 ml at an OD600 of 7.0. Cells were metabolically labeled for 5 min with [35S]cysteine (0.240 mCi/ml; 1200 Ci/mmol; ICN Radiochemicals). Chase reactions were then initiated by making the medium 0.1 mg/ml in methionine and cysteine, 1.5% yeast extract, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. At the indicated times of chase incubation, 0.5 ml of reaction mixture, which contained 3.5 ODs of cells, was removed and placed in a tube that contained an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mm NaN3 and placed on ice for subsequent analysis of intracellular forms of pro-a-factor. Maturea-factor secreted from yeast into culture medium binds quantitatively to the walls of the polypropylene tubes in which cells are incubated (38Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the tubes containing the cell suspension were saved on ice for later analysis of extracellulara-factor. To analyze intracellular levels of pro-a-factor, cells were washed once in ice-cold 20 mm NaN3 and resuspended in 65 μl of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Glass beads were then added, and the cells were lysed by vortexing the tubes three times for 1 min with samples being placed on ice during the 3-min intervals between vortexing. The extracts were then transferred to new 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. They were then spun in a centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A 60-μl aliquot of the supernatant was then added to 0.8 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (IP; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20) that contained 35 μl ofa-factor antiserum. The a-factor antibody was made against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to maturea-factor (38Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by the addition of 100 μl of a 30% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a 1-h incubation. For the analysis of extracellular a-factor, 0.6 ml of isopropanol was added to the polypropylene tubes to extract the bound mature form of a-factor. The extracted material was then transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and dried under vacuum. The dried pellet was resuspended in 65 μl of a buffer composed of 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. This sample was then subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A 60-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed and added to 0.5 ml of IP buffer that contained 20 μl of a-factor antiserum. Immunoprecipitation reactions were then treated as described above. The material that adhered to protein A-Sepharose beads, from both intra- and extracellular sources of a-factor, was isolated by centrifugation, and pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer. It was resuspended in 2× SDS-sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were loaded and run out on 16.5% acrylamide gels that utilize a Tricine buffer system (39Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5% methanol, soaked in 0.5 msodium salicylate and 0.5% glycerol, and then dried. Radiolabeled products isolated via this procedure were then visualized by autoradiography. Yeast strains were cultured in selective semi-synthetic minimal medium at 30 °C overnight. Cultures were then diluted into 250 ml of the same selective medium and incubated until an OD600 between 0.2 and 1.0 was reached. Cells were then harvested and resuspended at 7.0 OD600/ml. Cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min at 30 °C with Tran35S-label (0.500 mCi/ml; 1032 Ci/mmol; ICN Radiochemicals). Incorporation of Tran35S-label was then quenched by addition of methionine (0.1 mg/ml), cysteine (0.1 mg/ml), yeast extract (1.5%), and cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). At the indicated times of chase incubation, 0.5 ml of reaction mixture, which contained 3.5 ODs of cells, was removed and placed in a tube that contained an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mmNaN3. Cell extracts were then prepared (13Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were carried out (40Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Antibody utilized to immunoprecipitate Ste6p was raised against a cytosolic domain located in the amino-terminal half of the protein (38Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sera that recognized the HA-tag on HA-AXL1p were purchased from Babco. SDS-PAGE and fluorography were then utilized to analyze the products of immunoprecipitation reactions. Bud site selection in the strains GMY210, GMY200, or GMY214 was determined by calcifluor staining of bud scars (41Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The strains GMY210, GMY200, GMY214, and MS3963 were cultured in YPD at 30 °C overnight. Cultures were then diluted 1/5 and incubated for another 2 h at 30 °C. Cells from volume of 1 ml of each culture were then harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water that was made 0.5 mg/ml calcifluor. Following a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with H2O and resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. Stained cells were then examined live with a 100× objective with light that was filtered through a Hoechst dye set. Orientation of buds with respect to the bud scars was scored as axial, bipolar, or random in distribution. For Western blot analysis of the steady state levels of indicated proteins, strains were cultured overnight in the appropriate selective semi-synthetic minimal media. Cultures were then diluted and allowed to grow into log phase. A total of 7.5 OD units were harvested from cultures of each respective strain, fixed in 5% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed with acetone, and dried. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer that contained 5% SDS, 0.5 m Tris, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 2-fold concentration of a protease inhibitor mixture termed Complete Tab that was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Glass beads were then added and the cells were lysed by vortexing the tubes three times for 1 min at room temperature. The extracts were then transferred to new 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min prior to loading on SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with an affinity-purified antibody against Ste6p (38Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with anti-HA antibody. RNA extraction and Northern analysis were carried out as described previously (42Bonetti B. Fu L. Moon J. Bedwell D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in 2× YNB, 2× AA's, 2% glucose medium buffered with 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7) to ∼1 OD600/ml at 30°C. A 500-kilobase probe for the AXL1 mRNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers GGAAGTACTAGCACACAGGC and GTCGTTACTTCCCTCGTT. The ACT1 probe was generated using the primers DB-154 and DB-155 (43Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the random hexamer method. The specific band for the AXL1 messenger RNA was determined by using GMY 283 as negative control. Gels were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After quantitating the radioactivity associated with AXL1mRNA, the membranes were hybridized with the ACT1 probe. After background correction, the intensity of the AXL1 signal in each sample was corrected using the ACT1 mRNA control. The corrected values were then normalized to the values obtained with the WT strain transformed with the AXL1 multicopy plasmid. To initiate our studies on the functions of Ydj1p ina-factor biogenesis, we examined the ability ofydj1 mutant strains to mate with theMAT α tester strain GPY60 (Fig.1; TableI). Mating assays were carried out under conditions where MAT a strains were incubated with an excess of GPY60. Under these conditions, the efficiency of diploid formation is dependent upon the mating competence of theMAT a strain under study. We observedydj1Δ strains to exhibit a severe mating defect. Sinceydj1Δ strains exhibit a slow growth phenotype (44Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we needed to exclude the possibility that decreased mating was due to some general defect in protein metabolism. Therefore, the mating efficiency of a MAT a strain that harbors theydj1-g315d allele of YDJ1 was examined. Thisydj1-g315d allele was chosen for study because haploid yeast strains that harbor it exhibit temperature-sensitive growth, but under permissive conditions these strains grow at near normal rates and do not exhibit signs that are characteristic of the stress response (18Kimura Y. Yahara I. Lindquist S. Science. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The mating efficiency of the ydj1-g315d strain was higher than that of the ydj1Δ strain, but remained about 50% lower than that of the wild type strain.Table IYeast strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceMYY405U−MATa his3leu2 ydjl∷ura3(5-FOA-resistant)Ref. 44Atencio D.P.

A lawn of the MAT α tester strain XBH8–2C (which undergoes growth arrest when exposed toa-factor) was spread on a YPD plate. Then, aliquots ofMAT a strains that harbored YDJ1 or mutant copies of it were spotted onto the lawns. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days, and the size of the zones of growth inhibition formed around the different MAT a strains, which are proportional to the quantity of a-factor secreted (37Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), was determined. The colonies formed by ydj1Δ andydj1-g315d strains were of similar size, but the halos, which surrounded the mutants, were markedly smaller than the one around the YDJ1 strain. Comparison of the size of halos formed around the different ydj1 mutants indicates thata-factor secretion was reduced to a greater extent inydj1Δ than in ydj1-g315d. In mating assays, theydj1Δ strain was markedly less efficient at forming diploids than the ydj1-g315d strain (Fig. 1 B). Thus, there appears to be a correlation between the differences in the mating efficiency of ydj1Δ and ydj1-g315d and the ability of these mutants to secrete a-factor. These data demonstrate that Ydj1p action is required for yeast to secretea-factor with maximum efficiency. Next, we investigated whether the defects in a-factor secretion observed in ydj1 strains were due to a reduction in the steady state level of Ste6p. To address this question, we examined the levels of Ste6p in YDJ1, ydj1Δ, andydj1-g315d strains by Western blot and found them to be similar (Fig. 2 A). In addition, we found that the half-life of Ste6p was not changed when Ydj1p function was compromised (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the overexpression of Ste6p could not ameliorate the a-factor export defect in observed in ydj1 strains (data not shown). These results suggest that a loss of Ste6p function is not likely to be the major cause of the a-factor secretion defect observedydj1 strains. Next, we examined whether loss of Ydj1p function causes a defect in pro-a-factor synthesis and/or processing. To monitor a-factor biogenesis, Ydj1 andydj1Δ stra"

Previously, our laboratory identified a homeodomain protein (GSP1) whose expression was restricted to the cell bodies of mt+ gametes and whose transcript level was up-regulated during flagellar adhesion. In this report, we describe a new form of GSP1 that appears early during gamete interactions. Immunoblot analysis showed that in addition to the 120-kDa form of GSP1 normally present in mt+ gametes, a 122-kDa form was detected when the cells were mixed with mt− gametes. The more slowly migrating form of GSP1 was detectable within minutes after gametes were mixed together, and its appearance did not require new protein synthesis. Thus, the 122-kDa form represents a post-translational modification of the pre-existing 120-kDa form of GSP1. Moreover, conversion to the 122-kDa form did not require cell fusion. Although the 120-kDa form was expressed 10 h after vegetative cells were transferred to gametic induction medium, the 122-kDa form was detected only after mt+ gametes were induced to undergo the sexual signaling that accompanies fertilization. Incubation of mt+ gametes with dibutyryl cAMP led to the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1, and the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-8 inhibited the adhesion-induced conversion. Incubation of GSP1 immunoprecipitated from signaling mt+ gametes with alkaline phosphatase showed that the conversion was due to phosphorylation. The results indicate that flagellar adhesion induces a rapid, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the homeodomain protein GSP1 early during fertilization in Chlamydomonas.

In the unicellular, biflagellated green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, fertilization is initiated when mt+(mating type plus) and mt− (mating typeminus) gametes adhere to each other along the lengths of their flagella via adhesion molecules, the mt+ and mt− agglutinins (5Förster H.

Gamete fusion itself generates signals for cellular responses that prepare the new quadriflagellated cell for the zygotic phase of the life cycle. Pre-existing flagellar agglutinins are inactivated; synthesis of new agglutinins no longer can be detected; flagella are resorbed; and a new, highly impervious zygote cell wall is assembled (17Goodenough U.W.

Recently, a screen in our laboratory carried out to identify molecules regulated by flagellar adhesion in Chlamydomonas (21Kurvari V. Qian F. Snell W.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) yielded a cDNA that encodes a homeodomain protein, GSP1, which is the first homeodomain protein to be identified inChlamydomonas (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis by Southern blotting and immunoblotting indicated that although the gene for GSP1 is present in cells of both mating types (i.e. it is not linked to the mating type locus), the protein is expressed only in mt+gametes; it is not expressed in either mt+ or mt− vegetative cells or in mt− gametes. Here we show that GSP1 undergoes a post-translational modification, detected as a shift in SDS-PAGE1mobility, within minutes after adhesion between mt+ and mt− gametes. Our results indicate that the GSP1 mobility shift does not require cell fusion and is a consequence of adhesion-induced phosphorylation. Unstained and Kaleidoscope prestained molecular mass markers were from Bio-Rad.

Granick S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1954; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) or in Tris acetate/phosphate medium (24Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 575-581Crossref Google Scholar) on a 13-h light/11-h dark cycle. Gametogenesis was induced by transferring vegetatively growing cells to nitrogen-free medium as described previously (25Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 48-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Prior to their use in experiments, cells were allowed to accumulate in the bottom of the culture flask by negative phototaxis for 15 min under illumination by a bank of fluorescent lights. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the cells were resuspended in fresh nitrogen-free medium. This procedure was repeated twice to ensure that only highly motile cells were used for experiments. Sexual signaling in mt+ gametes was induced by mixing them with mt− gametes or by incubating them with dibutyryl cAMP. Typically, mt+ gametes (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with an equal number of mt− gametes for 20–60 min. Alternatively, mt+gametes (2 × 108 cells/ml) were activated by incubation in 15 mm dibutyryl cAMP and 0.15 mmpapaverine in nitrogen-free medium for 45 min with vigorous aeration (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Wilson N.F. Foglesong M.J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1537-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Gametic activation was assessed by determining the extent of loss of cell walls (25Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 48-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Wilson N.F. Foglesong M.J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1537-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For experiments with the protein kinase inhibitor H-8 (Seikagaku America, Inc., Rockville, MD), mt+and mt− gametes (1 × 107 cells/ml) were pretreated separately with 1 mm H-8 for 30 min at 22 °C with aeration prior to mixing the gametes together in the continued presence of the inhibitor (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody generated as described previously (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was affinity-purified over a mixed-peptide column that contained both an N-terminal 16-amino acid peptide (PEATPSGQPPTHPHQQ) and a C-terminal 15-amino acid peptide (AEASTDHKRARTNNP) used in the generation of the antibody (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the once-purified antibodies were further purified on a second column containing only the N-terminal peptide (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with both once- and twice-purified antibodies. Antibodies were stored at 4 °C with 0.02% NaN3. Cells harvested by centrifugation were rapidly resuspended in buffer containing 100 μm leupeptin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 100 μm E-64, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μm TLCK, 20 μm TPCK, 25 μg/ml ALLN, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl in 1 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0; added to boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentrations: 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.0625 m Tris, pH 6.8) (26Wilson N.F. Foglesong M.J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1537-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); boiled for 4 min; and subjected to electrophoresis on Laemmli 10% polyacrylamide slab gels (26Wilson N.F. Foglesong M.J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1537-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) at 10 mA for 22–30 h. Typically, each well was loaded with 40–100 μl of sample containing 1–10 × 106 mt+ cells. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in buffer containing 192 mmglycine, 20% methyl alcohol, and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, at 100 V for 70 min at 4 °C (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature on an orbital shaker (Bellco Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ). Membranes were blocked in 50 ml of TBST (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% Carnation dry milk for 1 h. Blocked membranes were washed for 10 min with TBST and then incubated with the anti-GSP1 polyclonal antibody (at a 1:5000 dilution for the once-purified antibody or a 1:250 dilution for the twice-purified antibody) in TBST containing 3% Carnation dry milk for either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were rinsed twice in TBST, followed by two changes of TBST every 5 min; incubated with a 1:15,000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) in TBST containing 3% Carnation dry milk for 1 h; and rinsed twice in TBST, followed by four changes of TBST every 7 min. Membranes were developed for enhanced chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the film was developed in an AFP MM-90 x-ray developer. GSP1 was immunopurified from mating and non-mating mt+ gametes and incubated with alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphate groups (29King S.J. Dutcher S.K. J.

To carry out immunoprecipitation, mt+ and mt−gametes (1 × 107 cells/ml) were pretreated separately with 25 μg/ml ALLN in nitrogen-free medium for 20 min with aeration. GSP1 was then immunoprecipitated from 5 × 108mt+ gametes alone or from 5 × 108mt+ gametes that had been mixed with an equal number of mt− gametes for 20 min. The cells for immunoprecipitation were harvested by centrifugation at 2600 × g for 3 min (Model H6000A rotor and RC-3B centrifuge, Kendro Laboratory Products, Newtown, CT); the supernatant was discarded; and the sedimented cells were flash-frozen in liquid N2. After at least 1 h in liquid N2, the samples were removed, and 250 μl of buffer containing 1% SDS, 25 μg/ml ALLN, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm E-64, 50 mm NaF, 100 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 37 °C was immediately added to the sample. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, 2.25 ml of buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm KCl was added to yield a final SDS concentration of 0.1%. This mixture was centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (Model TLA100.3 rotor and Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments). The supernatant, which contained GSP1, was used for immunoprecipitation as described below. Anti-GSP1 antibody-coated beads were prepared by incubation of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 10 μl of the once-purified anti-GSP1 polyclonal antibody. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were harvested by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and subsequently mixed with the cell extract for 1 h at 4 °C. The GSP1-bead complex was harvested by centrifugation and washed three to five times with an excess of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.4 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (25 μg/ml ALLN, 100 μmleupeptin, 100 μm E-64, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid). For use in dephosphorylation experiments, the anti-GSP1 antibody-coated beads were washed three times with dephosphorylation buffer (40 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm KCl, 25 μg/ml ALLN, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm E-64, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 6.8), and 20 μl of the washed GSP1-bead complex was mixed with 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and incubated at 30 °C. After 30 min, the beads were washed once with 20 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, and the samples were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For electrophoretic analysis of samples, immunopurified GSP1 from ∼5 × 106 mt+ gametes was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentrations: 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.125m Tris, pH 6.8), boiled for 4 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on Laemmli 7% polyacrylamide minislab gels (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) at 30 mA for 3.5 h. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes as described above. Membranes were blocked and washed as described above and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of the once-purified anti-GSP-1 polyclonal antibody. All subsequent immunoblotting steps were carried out as described above. To study GSP1 during fertilization, mt+ and mt− gametes were mixed together for 60 min, and GSP1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 1 shows that GSP1 migrated as a single band at ∼120 kDa in control, unmixed mt+ gametes; but, after mixing for 60 min, a new, more slowly migrating form of GSP1 of ∼122 kDa was detected. Surprisingly, the new 122-kDa form of GSP1 appeared rapidly after mixing. Fig.2 A shows that 5 min after mixing gametes of opposite mating types together, when 64% of the cells had fused to form zygotes, the majority of GSP1 was in the 122-kDa form. By 15 min, when >85% of the cells had formed zygotes, roughly equivalent amounts of the two forms were present and remained detectable through the 60-min time point. A control, unmixed sample of mt+ gametes incubated under the same conditions for 60 min contained only the 120-kDa form of GSP1.Figure 2The shift in GSP1 mobility occurs early during zygote formation and does not require new protein synthesis. A, to examine the timing of appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1, an equal number of mt+ and mt− gametes (each at 2 × 107 cells/ml) in nitrogen-free medium were mixed together. After 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, samples containing 5 × 106 mt+cells were removed and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-GSP1 antibody. Time of mixing is shown above the sample lanes, and thearrowhead indicates the 122-kDa form of GSP1. Lane 60C contains 5 × 106 control mt+gametes incubated for 60 min without mixing with mt−gametes. The percent of cells forming zygotes is indicated below the corresponding sample. ND, not determined. B, to examine the role of protein synthesis in the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1, mt+ and mt− gametes (each at 2 × 107 cells/ml) were separately pretreated for 10 min with (+) and without (−) 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CH). Equal numbers of mt+ and mt− gametes were mixed together in the continued absence or presence of the inhibitor for 15 min and then analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-GSP1 antibody. The higher molecular mass form of GSP1 is indicated by thearrowhead, and the percent of cells forming zygotes is shown below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the appearance of the new form of GSP1 required new protein synthesis or represented a modified form of pre-existing GSP1, mt+ and mt− gametes were separately preincubated with cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) for 10 min, mixed together, and analyzed for GSP1 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 2 B shows that cycloheximide had no effect on the extent of zygote formation or the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1. Thus, the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1 was due to modification of pre-existing GSP1. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A, the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1 was concomitant with formation of zygotes. To ascertain if modification of GSP1 involved components from the mt− cytoplasm, we determined if the appearance of the more slowly migrating form of GSP1 required cell fusion. To do this, the above experiment was carried out with the mt+fusion-defective mutant imp-1. Gametes of imp-1undergo normal flagellar adhesion and sexual signaling with mt− gametes, but are unable to fuse (16Goodenough U.W. Detmers P.A. Hwang C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 122-kDa form of GSP1 was present after 30 min of mixing wild-type mt−gametes and imp-1 mt+ gametes, although, as expected, no zygotes were observed in these samples (Fig.3). Moreover, the 122-kDa form in signaling imp-1 gametes was first detectable within 5 min of mixing with mt− gametes. These results indicated that adhesion-induced signals and molecules within the mt+gametes were sufficient to lead to conversion of the 120-kDa form of GSP1 to the 122-kDa form. Previous examination of the timing of GSP1 expression during sexual differentiation indicated that GSP1 was first detectable at the time that cells expressed other gametic markers such as the flagellar adhesion molecule, agglutinin (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using SDS-PAGE and sample loading conditions optimized to detect the two forms of GSP1, we reexamined GSP1 during sexual differentiation to determine whether the 122-kDa form of the molecule appeared at any time during gametogenesis. As shown in Fig. 4, within 10 h of transferring vegetatively growing mt+ cells to nitrogen-free medium to induce gametic differentiation, expression of the 120-kDa form of GSP1 was detectable. Consistent with previous observations (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), GSP1 expression was coincident with the appearance of other gamete-specific proteins such as agglutinin, as assessed by the ability of the cells to undergo agglutination when mixed with mt− gametes (Fig. 4). Furthermore, only the 120-kDa form of GSP1 was present during gametogenesis. The 122-kDa form of GSP1 was not detectable in these differentiating cells either prior to or after the appearance of agglutinins. A control experiment showed that the 122-kDa form appeared upon mixing mt+ gametes with mt− gametes (Fig. 4, lane +/−). To learn more about the pathway responsible for the mobility shift of GSP1, we examined whether cAMP-mediated signal transduction was involved. Incubation of gametes in dibutyryl cAMP and papaverine has been shown to induce the cellular responses normally observed during flagellar adhesion (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To induce sexual signaling, mt+ gametes were incubated with dibutyryl cAMP and papaverine or mixed with mt− gametes, and GSP1 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The results in Fig.5 show that the cAMP treatment was sufficient to induce the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1 (lane 3). Only the 120-kDa form was present in untreated cells (lane 1); as expected, control cells mixed with mt− gametes contained the 122-kDa form of GSP1 (lane 2). Since several studies have shown that sexual signaling through cAMP is inhibited by H-8 (an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases) (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we examined whether the change in GSP1 mobility showed a similar sensitivity to H-8. When mt+ and mt− gametes were preincubated in H-8 and mixed together in the continued presence of the inhibitor, only the 120-kDa form of GSP1 was detected (Fig. 6, lane +H-8/mt −). In contrast, control cells contained the 122-kDa form of GSP1 (lane−H8/mt −). Consistent with earlier studies (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), H-8 had no effect on flagellar adhesion, but prevented zygote formation (Fig. 6). These results indicated that adhesion-induced signaling through a cAMP-dependent pathway, perhaps through the activity of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was necessary and sufficient to induce the appearance of the 122-kDa form of GSP1. To determine whether the change in mobility of GSP1 in response to adhesion was due to phosphorylation, immunopurified GSP1 from mating and non-mating mt+ gametes was incubated with alkaline phosphatase and examined by immunoblotting. Fig.7 shows that, as expected for a phosphorylated protein, GSP1 immunopurified from mating mt+gametes and incubated with phosphatase (lane 2) underwent a change (an increase) in mobility on SDS-PAGE compared with the non-phosphatase-treated sample from mating mt+ gametes (lane 3). Phosphatase-treated GSP1 from mating mt+ gametes migrated as a single band at 119 kDa. This apparent molecular mass of 119 kDa was identical to that of immunopurified, phosphatase-treated GSP1 from non-mating mt+ gametes (lane 1). The results indicated that the shift in GSP1 migration during gamete activation was due to phosphorylation. Moreover, the small but consistent difference in migration between non-phosphatase-treated GSP1 (lane 4) and phosphatase-treated GSP1 (lane 1) from non-adhering gametes suggested that GSP1 in non-adhering cells also was phosphorylated. This report describes the adhesion-induced post-translational modification of the mt+-specific homeodomain protein GSP1 during fertilization in Chlamydomonas. Using immunoblotting to identify GSP1 in cells, we discovered that mixing mt+ gametes with mt− gametes led to the appearance of a 122-kDa form of GSP1 (Fig. 1), which had not been detected in previous experiments that used only unmixed cells (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The appearance of the more slowly migrating form of GSP1 was surprisingly rapid, being detectable between 1 and 5 min after gametes were mixed together (Fig. 2 A). These initial experiments did not indicate whether the 122-kDa form of GSP1 represented a newly synthesized molecule or a modified form of pre-existing GSP1. Because flagellar adhesion has been shown to lead to the synthesis of new flagellar agglutinins (11Snell W.J. Moore W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it was possible that fertilization also was associated with induction of synthesis of a new form of GSP1 in mt+ gametes or even in mt−gametes. The result that the appearance of the more slowly migrating form of GSP1 was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, however, demonstrated that the new form was derived from pre-existing GSP1. In addition, the results indicated that the molecules responsible for the conversion also pre-existed within the cells and were activated early during fertilization. We were able to determine if cell fusion was required for the shift in mobility of GSP1 by use of the sterile mt+ mutant ofChlamydomonas, imp-1. Gametes of imp-1express normal levels of flagellar agglutinin, adhere to mt− gametes, and undergo activation of adenylyl cyclase and all of the cellular responses normally associated with increases in cAMP. Because of a lesion in the fus1 gene (16Goodenough U.W. Detmers P.A. Hwang C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Ferris P.J. Woessner J.P. Goodenough U.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1235-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), however, they are unable to undergo cell-cell fusion. The result (Fig.3) that the shift in GSP1 mobility also occurred during adhesion and signaling of imp-1 gametes indicated that adhesion-associated signals alone were sufficient to induce the change in GSP1; signals generated during cell fusion were not required for the modification. Moreover, all of the molecules required for the modification of GSP1 also were present within mt+gametes. Having shown that flagellar adhesion alone brought about conversion of GSP1, we next examined whether the more slowly migrating form of GSP1 was present at other stages in the life of a gamete. We showed previously (22Kurvari V. Grishin N.V. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that GSP1 appears at the same time during gametogenesis that mt+ cells acquire flagellar agglutinins. In those experiments, however, we were not aware that GSP1 could be present in different electrophoretic forms, and the SDS-PAGE methods may not have been sufficient to distinguish between a 120- and a 122-kDa band. When we re-examined GSP1 during gametogenesis, we found that only the 120-kDa form of GSP1 was detectable at any time in unmixed mt+ gametes. Thus, the 122-kDa form of GSP1 appears in mt+ gametes only under the unique conditions that obtain as a consequence of interactions with mt− gametes. A key consequence of flagellar adhesion is a rapid and dramatic increase in the intracellular level of cAMP (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,10Pijst H.L.A. van Driel R. Janssens P.M.W. Musgrave A. van den Ende H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 132-136Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pasquale and Goodenough (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and others (12Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Hunnicutt G.R. Kosfiszer M.G. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have shown that incubation of gametes of a single mating type in this cyclic nucleotide along with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induces all of the cellular responses in gametes that are associated with flagellar adhesion, including loss of cell walls, erection of mating structures, and movement of agglutinins from the cell body onto the flagella. Not surprisingly, we found that incubation of mt+ gametes with dibutyryl cAMP and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor also induced the post-translational modification of GSP1 (Fig. 5). Moreover, H-8, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, blocked conversion of GSP1 even though the H-8-treated gametes underwent normal flagellar adhesion. Previous studies have shown that in mt+ and mt− gametes mixed together in the presence of H-8, adenylyl cyclase is activated, and cAMP levels undergo increases indistinguishable from those of untreated cells (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In H-8-treated cells, however, the cellular events that normally accompany flagellar adhesion are blocked, including release of cell walls, activation of mating structures, and cell-cell fusion (7Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The result that GSP1 conversion also is blocked by this inhibitor adds another event to this group of cellular responses activated by cAMP and blocked by H-8. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that the adhesion-induced change in migration of GSP1 was due to phosphorylation. GSP1 immunopurified from signaling mt+ gametes and incubated with alkaline phosphatase was converted from the 122-kDa form to a 119-kDa form (Fig.7). Consistent with this result, alkaline phosphatase treatment of GSP1 immunopurified from non-mating mt+ gametes also reduced its apparent molecular mass to 119 kDa. These results indicate that GSP1 undergoes a basal level of phosphorylation in mt+ gametes after its synthesis during gametogenesis and that flagellar adhesion leads to further phosphorylation of the molecule. In earlier studies, we have shown that protein kinases are required for regulation of the gamete-specific adenylyl cyclase that is activated during flagellar adhesion (8Zhang Y. Ross E.M. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22954-22959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In related studies, we identified a protein (SksC) that serves as a substrate for a protein kinase whose activity is regulated by flagellar adhesion (31Zhang Y. Luo Y. Emmett K. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Kurvari V. Zhang Y. Luo Y. Snell W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and is probably upstream of adenylyl cyclase. The evidence presented here indicates that protein phosphorylation also occurs as a downstream event in this signaling pathway. To our knowledge, GSP1 is the first molecule to be identified whose phosphorylation state is regulated by the increased levels of cAMP present during fertilization inChlamydomonas. With the available information, it is not possible to determine if the increased level of phosphorylation is due to activation of a protein kinase(s) or inhibition of a protein phosphatase(s). GSP1 contains several consensus sites for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (data not shown), and a simple interpretation of our results is that GSP1 is phosphorylated on one of these sites by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. On the other hand, it is possible that regulation of GSP1 phosphorylation is controlled farther downstream in the pathway initiated by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. The role of the adhesion-induced phosphorylation of GSP1 in Chlamydomonas gametes and zygotes remains unknown. The presence of a homeodomain in the molecule and the mt+ gamete-specific expression of GSP1 suggest that it could be a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in gametes or zygotes or both. For example and by analogy to the role of the homeodomain protein Matα2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(33Johnson A.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), after cell fusion, GSP1 might form a complex with molecules from the mt− gamete (34Goodenough U.W. Ferris P.J. Loomis W. Genetic Regulation of Development. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 171-189Google Scholar, 35Ferris P.J. Goodenough U.W. Genetics. 1997; 146: 859-869PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, if GSP1 functioned solely after cell fusion to regulate gene expression, then phosphorylation of GSP1 prior to cell fusion would seem to be unnecessary. In other words, since expression of GSP1 is sex-limited (i.e. expressed only in mt+ gametes), its presence in the mt+/mt− cytoplasm formed by cell fusion should be sufficient for induction of zygotic genes without prior phosphorylation. The observation that phosphorylation of GSP1 occurs in the absence of cell fusion suggests that phosphorylation of GSP1 could play a role during signaling in mt+ gametes (Fig. 3), possibly to up-regulate synthesis of a gamete-specific molecule such as agglutinin that undergoes rapid turnover during flagellar adhesion (11Snell W.J. Moore W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Hunnicutt G.R. Kosfiszer M.G. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Now that a protein has been identified whose phosphorylation is regulated (either directly or indirectly) by cAMP, it becomes possible to study the molecules responsible for this post-translational modification. Such studies should offer new molecular insights into the entire adhesion-induced signaling pathway during fertilization. We thank Drs. Melanie Cobb and Fred Grinnell (both from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) for helpful discussions on protein phosphorylation and for critically reading the manuscript, respectively."

Here, we report a class of motion-induced illusory contours that demonstrate the existence of novel mechanisms of illusory contour synthesis. In a series of experiments, we show that the velocity of contour terminations and the direction of motion of a partially occluded figure regulate the perceived shape and apparent movement of illusory contours formed from moving image sequences. These results demonstrate the existence of neural mechanisms that reconstruct occlusion relationships from both real and inferred image velocities, in contrast to the static geometric mechanisms that have been the focus of studies to date."
https://openalex.org/W1973385557,"Activation of T cells through the antigen-specific T-cell receptor in combination with a costimulatory signal results in efficient cytokine gene transcription. The CD28-induced signal represents a major costimulatory signal for T cells. A CD28 response element, named CD28RE, was first identified in the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter region. Here we demonstrate that the NF-κB sequence in the IL-6 promoter functions as a CD28 response element. Mutations in this sequence rendered the IL-6 promoter unresponsive to CD28 costimulation. Moreover, this element could replace the IL-2 CD28RE in conferring CD28 responsiveness to the IL-2 promoter. In analogy to the known CD28 response elements IL-2 CD28RE, IL-8 CD28RE, and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) NF-κB motif, the IL-6 NF-κB motif efficiently bound c-Rel, c-Rel/NFKB1, and the recently identified inducible T-cell factor NF-MATp35. However, the IL-6 NF-κB sequence together with the IL-8 CD28RE and HIV-1 NF-κB sequence differed from the IL-2 CD28RE in the binding of NF-κB/Rel family proteins. Although the IL-2 CD28RE exerted selective binding with c-Rel and c-Rel/NFKB1, the other CD28REs allowed efficient binding of a wide range of NF-κB/Rel family proteins. The difference in binding specificity correlated with the capacity of the distinct CD28 response elements to function in the context of the IL-6 promoter in response to T-cell activation. Domain swapping experiments revealed that the IL-8 CD28RE and HIV-1 NF-κB motif conferred similar responsiveness as the genuine IL-6 NF-κB motif in the transcriptional activation of the IL-6 promoter upon CD28 costimulation. In contrast, replacement of the IL-6 NF-κB sequence by the IL-2 CD28RE motif strongly reduced the responsiveness of the IL-6 promoter. These data indicate that despite the sequence similarity, two different classes of CD28 responsive elements exist that differ in their NF-κB binding capacity and the ability to confer CD28 costimulatory responsiveness toward a heterologous promoter."

The crystal structures of the yeast and archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilumproteasomes revealed that the subunits are arranged in a particle comprising four heptameric rings, α7-β7-β7-α7, around a central catalytic cavity (4Groll M.

Recent mutational studies on the yeast 20 S proteasome revealed three proteolytically active β-type subunits, Pup1, Pre2, and Pre3, homologues of human subunits Z, X, and Y, respectively, that each have a catalytic N-terminal threonine residue and express trypsin-type, chymotrypsin-type, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities, respectively (4Groll M.

However, the enzymatic activities of the 20 S proteasome other than proteolytic activities and the functions of the other β- and α-type subunits remain to be clarified.Recently, we found the intrinsic NDP kinase-like activity, but not ATPase activity, of the molecular chaperone, Hsp70 (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the transfer of γ-phosphoryl groups from NTPs to NDPs. The interaction of Hsp70 with protein or peptide substrates is regulated by the activities of ATP hydrolysis and ADP-ATP exchange. The latter reaction may be catalyzed by the intrinsic NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70 or through cooperation between the NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70 and a cytosolic GrpE-like cofactor, resulting in acceleration of the ATP-dependent reaction cycle in protein/peptide folding (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this paper, we first report that the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome exhibits a novel function, i.e. intrinsic NDP/NTP exchange activity other than proteolytic activity, the enzymatic properties being similar to those of the NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70. The C5 subunit among the β-type and the C8 subunit among the α-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome give ATP-binding and autophosphorylated intermediates during the γ-phosphate transfer reaction. We discuss the possible role of this NDP kinase-like activity in the proteolytic function of the proteasome.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found a novel function, intrinsic ADP/ATP exchange activity, of the proteasome; this activity is similar to that of NDP kinase. The exchange reaction exhibited a preference for ATP and dATP as phosphate donors and a broad specificity for NDPs other than GDP as phosphate acceptors, and yielded autophosphorylated intermediates during the transfer of γ-phosphate from NTPs to NDPs. Judging from the kinetic results for ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis of the proteasome, the rate constants for the two reactions were almost the same at neutral pH. Consequently, the ATP hydrolysis activity of the 20 S proteasome determined as the release of Pi from ATP at neutral pH was hard to detect, and no ATPase activity of the proteasome has been reported so far. However, the activities of ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis of the proteasome can be analyzed as the conversion of [14C]ATP to [14C]ADP and of [14C]ADP to [14C]ATP, respectively, in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm ADP in the reaction mixture. The nucleotide specificity and other enzymatic properties of the NDP kinase-like activity of the proteasome are similar but not identical to those of conventional NDP kinase (27Leung S.-M. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2607-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Roisin M. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and show a striking resemblance to those of an intrinsic NDP kinase-like activity (not ATPase activity) of the molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70 (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), DnaK, 2Kido, H., Yano, M., and Kanesaki, Y., manuscript in preparation. and the mitochondrial import stimulation factor 14-3-3 protein (18Yano M. Mori S. Niwa Y. Inoue M. Kido H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,43Hachiya N. Mihara K. Suda K. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgrow T. Nature. 1995; 376: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the mechanism for the Hsp70-protein/peptide interaction, ADP-ATP exchange is rate-limiting in the cycle of substrate binding and release, and the intrinsic ADP-ATP exchange activity of Hsp70 may responsible for the ATP-dependent reaction cycle in protein folding (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although this remains to be proven. We found that the C5 among the β-type and the C8 among the α-type subunits of the proteasome exhibit intrinsic chaperone-type NDP kinase activity, which catalyzes ATP hydrolysis as well as ATP synthesis.NDP kinase autophosphorylates the active site histidine residue in the catalytic phosphate transfer reaction, and hence, NDP-dependent dephosphorylation of the autophosphorylated intermediate occurs (36Biondi R.M. Walz K. Issinger O.-G. Engel M. Passeron S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14643-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar). In addition, NDP kinase also exhibits histidine-dependent protein phosphotransfer activity,i.e. downstream phosphorylation of serine residues from the acid-labile phosphohistidine residue (22Freije J.M.P. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The C8 and C5 subunits of the proteasome gave autophosphorylated intermediates during the transfer of γ-phosphate from NTPs to NDPs. Most of the autophosphorylated intermediates of the proteasome were acid-labile, and phosphoamino acid analysis of the proteasome revealed an alkaline-stable histidine autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). In addition, chemical modification of the histidyl residues of the proteasomal subunits by DEPC inhibited the NDP kinase-like activity (Fig. 5 A) and their autophosphorylation (data not shown). These results suggest the high possibility of a high energy phosphate on histidine residues of these subunits. The minor acid-stable phosphorylation, which was indicated by the remaining radioactivity after acid treatment, was determined to be due to phosphoserine residue(s) on phosphoamino acid analysis. These results are consistent with those of autophosphorylation and histidine-dependent protein phosphorylation of conventional NDP kinase and histidine protein kinase reported (22Freije J.M.P.

A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP binding of the C8 and C5 subunits of the proteasome was evident on specific photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP. Previously, the specific phosphorylation of serine residues of the C8 subunit by casein kinase II and those of C9 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase and/or casein kinase II in vitro was reported (44Ludemann R. Lerea K.M. Etlinger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17413-17417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mason G.G.F. Hendil K.B. Rivett A.J. Eur. J.

In our purified proteasome preparation, however, no protein kinase activity toward casein was present (data not shown). The phosphorylation of serine residue(s) of the C8 subunit reported may be caused in part by protein phosphotransfer activity of the C8 subunit with NDP kinase-like activity.The photoaffinity labeling studies involving 8-azido-ATP revealed that ATP binds to the NDP kinase-like C5 and C8 subunits. Many Mg·ATP-binding proteins contain the consensus sequences of the two conserved domains designated as the Walker segment A and B motifs (47Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.L. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Segment A (ATP-binding motif) consists of GXXXXGK (whereX is any amino acid) (48Moeller W. Amons R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 49Reinstein J. Brune M. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 50Black M.E. Hruby D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6801-6806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the original Walker sequence for segment B (Mg2+ binding motif) is rather long ((R/K)XXXGXXXLXhXhXhXhD, whereXh represents any hydrophobic residue), others have reported several shorter, modified versions, the key residue in all these sequences being the aspartic acid that lies at the end of the predicted β-sheet domain (51Chin D.T. Goff S.A. Webster T. Smith T. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11718-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the ATP-binding site of the C5 subunit has not yet been clarified experimentally, we found the sequences 140GLDEEGK146 and132GLDEDGK138 in the C5 subunits of the human and yeast proteasome, respectively, which closely resemble the Walker segments A and are also similar to the ATP-binding pocket sequence of the ATP-dependent protease, La (51Chin D.T. Goff S.A. Webster T. Smith T. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11718-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence184KNMQNVE-HVPLSLD195 in the C5 subunit of the human proteasome may resemble the Walker segment B motif. The C8 subunit of the human and yeast proteasome, however, does not contain any known ATP-binding motifs, and thus it may contain some other, more distant Walker motif homologues. NDP kinase has a three-dimensional ATP-binding domain structure (53Williams R.L. Oren D.A. Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye S. Inouye M. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1230-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and exhibits no sequence similarity to Walker motifs. Further studies on the three-dimensional structure similarity between the proteasome C5 and C8 subunits and NDP kinase or ATP-dependent chaperones Hsp70 and Hsc70 are required to elucidate the nucleotide-binding structures of these subunits.Although ATP and ADP had no effect on the proteolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome (data not shown), the enzyme catalyzes the activities of both ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis, resembling Hsp70 (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that the β-type subunits act in pairs,i.e. an “active” subunit must interact with an “inactive” subunit to generate peptidase activity (2Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NDP kinase-like activity of the proteasome may be such a case, because the proteasome lost its NDP kinase-like activity after separation of the subunits. Recent structure analysis revealed that protease subunits Z (PUP1) and X (PRE2 or MB1) are neighbors of subunit C5 and that protease subunit Y (PRE3) and NDP kinase-like subunit C5 are neighbors of subunit C8 (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Lšwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 54Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kristensen P. Hendil K.B. Arch. Biol. Biophy. 1999; 363: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the C5 and C8 subunits do not directly participate in the mechanism of protein and peptide hydrolysis, these subunits may play some role in assisting the interactions between specific pairs of subunits to generate the peptidase activity or in supporting the assembly of the proteasomal subunits. It was recently reported that the human C8 subunit, but not other α-type subunits, forms hetero-oligomeric ring complexes with co-expression of neighboring α-type subunits (55Gerards W.L.H. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Boelens W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of a heat-shock and ATP-dependent protease complex, HsIVU, from Escherichia coli, ATP binding is required for oligomerization of HsIU, which is required for the association with HsIV peptidase (56Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.-S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Goldberg A.L. Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Lee D.H. Rohrwild M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). Judging from these results, although the function of the chaperone-type NDP kinase-like activity of the C8 and C5 subunits has not been elucidated, the activity may participate in the subunit interactions. The intrinsic chaperone-like NDP kinase activity constitutes an important clue for a better understanding of the unknown mechanism of proteolysis by the proteasome. Further studies on the role of the NDP kinase-like activity in the proteolytic activity of the proteasome and in subunit interactions are currently in progress. The 20 S proteasome, representing a new family of the Ntn1 hydrolases (1Seemüller E. Lupas A. Zühl F. Zwickl P. Baumeister W.

Tanaka K. Goldberg A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the transfer of γ-phosphoryl groups from NTPs to NDPs. The interaction of Hsp70 with protein or peptide substrates is regulated by the activities of ATP hydrolysis and ADP-ATP exchange. The latter reaction may be catalyzed by the intrinsic NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70 or through cooperation between the NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70 and a cytosolic GrpE-like cofactor, resulting in acceleration of the ATP-dependent reaction cycle in protein/peptide folding (16Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this paper, we first report that the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome exhibits a novel function, i.e. intrinsic NDP/NTP exchange activity other than proteolytic activity, the enzymatic properties being similar to those of the NDP kinase-like activity of Hsp70. The C5 subunit among the β-type and the C8 subunit among the α-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome give ATP-binding and autophosphorylated intermediates during the γ-phosphate transfer reaction. We discuss the possible role of this NDP kinase-like activity in the proteolytic function of the proteasome. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found a novel function, intrinsic ADP/ATP exchange activity, of the proteasome; this activity is similar to that of NDP kinase. The exchange reaction exhibited a preference for ATP and dATP as phosphate donors and a broad specificity for NDPs other than GDP as phosphate acceptors, and yielded autophosphorylated intermediates during the transfer of γ-phosphate from NTPs to NDPs.

An unusual feature of the book is that it is written by an eminent research scientist, who nonetheless respects the work of professional philosophers and has clearly read their works with close attention. This results in a final chapter on the philosophy of mind that will be a considerable intellectual challenge to non-philosophers, who will have to distinguish type/type and token/token identity theories, and contemplate Davidson's idea that though each instance of a mental state is identical with some physical brain state, there are in general no laws describing the connections between the mental and physical characteristics."
