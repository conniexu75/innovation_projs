https://openalex.org/W2076464393,"Dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system results in marked disorders of movement such as occur in Parkinson's disease. Functions of this dopamine-containing projection system were examined in monkeys trained in a classical conditioning task, and the effects of striatal dopamine depletion were tested. Unilateral dopamine loss substantially reduced the acquired sensory responsiveness of striatal neurons monitored electrophysiologically. This effect was ipsilateral and selective, and could be reversed by apomorphine. These results suggest that the primate nigrostriatal system modulates expression of neuronal response plasticity in the striatum during sensorimotor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2159146649,"Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (CN-I) is caused by an inherited absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward bilirubin (B-UGT), resulting in severe non-hemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Based on the expression of cDNAs in COS cells, two UGT isoforms in human liver, B-UGT1 and B-UGT2, have been reported to catalyze bilirubin glucuronidation. These isoforms, which are derived from a single gene, ugt1, have identical carboxyl-terminal domains that are encoded by four consecutive exons shared by both isoforms. A critical lesion in any of these common exons should inactivate both B-UGT isoforms, giving rise to CN-I. The amino-terminal domains of the B-UGT isoforms are unique, each being encoded by a different 5‘ exon. If both B-UGT isoforms contribute significantly to bilirubin glucuronidation, a mutation in one of these unique 5‘ exons should affect a single isoform, while the other isoforms should provide residual B-UGT activity. However, in two patients with CN-I, we found a mutation only in the unique exon of B-UGT1, the other exons being normal. To clarify this apparent paradox, we expressed the cDNA for each B-UGT isoform in COS cells and determined the specific B-UGT activity. These studies show that only B-UGT1 has quantitatively significant catalytic activity. Furthermore, we show that the mutation in B-UGT1 observed in each of the two CN-I patients inactivates B-UGT1. Together, the results indicate that B-UGT1 is the only physiologically relevant isoform in bilirubin glucuronidation."
https://openalex.org/W1591346049,"Since the characterization of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) as a major melanogenic intermediate, the fate of this compound and the mechanisms of its incorporation into the melanin polymer have become major issues in the study of melanogenesis. DHICA is a stable dihydroxyindole with a low rate of spontaneous oxidation, suggesting that enzymatic mechanism(s) might contribute to its evolution. The most obvious candidates are the melanosomal tyrosinases. We have recently shown that mouse melanosomes contain two electrophoretically distinct tyrosinase isoenzymes, termed low electrophoretic mobility tyrosinase (LEMT) and high electrophoretic mobility tyrosinase (HEMT), that can be resolved and purified. In this study, we report immunological evidence indicating that LEMT corresponds to the protein encoded by the brown locus (termed tyrosinase-related protein-1, TRP1), while HEMT corresponds to the tyrosinase encoded by the albino locus. We have compared the ability of both isoenzymes to catalyze DHICA evolution as determined by high performance liquid chromatography; although LEMT is a relatively poor tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA oxidase as compared to HEMT, it was readily able to accelerate DHICA consumption concomitant with the production of a brownish product. However, the DHICA conversion activity of HEMT was barely detectable. The ability of purified LEMT to catalyze DHICA conversion could be almost completely abolished by treatment with heat or trypsin, and was inhibited in a concentration dependent way by the tyrosinase inhibitor 2-phenylthiourea and by L-tyrosine. Moreover, in the presence of low concentration of ascorbate, the DHICA conversion activity of LEMT displayed a lag period which was progressively longer at higher ascorbate concentrations. Based on the relationship between ascorbate added, enzyme activity, and lag period, it is very likely that the DHICA converting activity is indeed a DHICA oxidase activity. This was further proven by the demonstration that the product reacts rapidly and efficiently with the quinone trapping reagent 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone, yielding a colored adduct similar to the one obtained with DOPAquinone. The DHICA oxidase activity of LEMT displayed a Km for DHICA of about 0.8 mM, as compared to 1.9 mM for L-DOPA and 0.23 nM for L-tyrosine. These results suggest that TRP1, the product of the brown locus, is indeed a tyrosinase with DHICA oxidase activity. However, as opposed to the tyrosinase encoded by the albino locus, TRP1's role in melanogenesis could be more directly related to DHICA metabolism than to the first steps of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1550866124,"Cell type-specific expression of specific carbohydrate structures on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids is increasingly recognized for providing information relevant to cell-cell interactions in developing and adult organisms. Sialyltransferases contribute to the diversity in carbohydrate structure through their attachment of sialic acid in various terminal positions on glycolipid and on glycoprotein (N-linked and O-linked) carbohydrate groups. In this report, differential expression of five sialyltransferase genes in human tissues is evaluated as a potential mechanism to account for cell type-specific variation in terminal sialoside structures produced by a cell. For this analysis, the complete cDNA of the human Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase and a partial cDNA of the developmentally regulated STX gene were cloned. Northern analysis was performed using these cDNAs and those of three previously cloned human sialyltransferase genes as probes. Each of the five sialyltransferase genes exhibits dramatic differential expression in the 16 adult and 5 fetal human tissues examined, and expression of each gene appears to be independently regulated. Comparison with fragmentary earlier studies of the expression of several of the same enzymes in rat tissues suggests that the overall pattern of expression is largely conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1649674936,"Expression screening in Xenopus oocytes was used to isolate a cDNA from rat jejunal epithelium encoding a Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport protein (named cNT1). The cDNA sequence of cNT1 predicts a protein of 648 amino acids (relative molecular mass 71,000) with 14 potential transmembrane domains. Data base searches indicate significant sequence similarity to the NUPC proton/nucleoside symporter of Escherichia coli. There is no sequence similarity between cNT1 and proteins of mammalian origin. Functionally, cNT1 exhibited the transport characteristics of the nucleoside transport system cit (selective for pyrimidine nucleosides and adenosine) and accepted both 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) as permeants (Km = 0.49 and 0.51 mM, respectively). The demonstration of transport of AZT by cNT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes provides the first direct evidence that AZT enters cells by transporter-mediated processes, as well as by passive diffusion. Consistent with the tissue distribution of system cit transport activity, transcripts for cNT1 were detected in kidney as well as jejunum. cNT1 therefore belongs to a potential new gene family and may be involved in the intestinal absorption and renal handling of pyrimidine nucleoside analogs used to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W1986579608,"Spontaneous mutations are thought to occur primarily in growing cells. However, spontaneous mutations also arise in nutritionally deprived cells, and in some cases this process appears to be adaptive. Here it is reported that when a Lac- strain of Escherichia coli is under selection for lactose use, the spectrum of Lac+ mutations that arises is different, and simpler, than that arising without selection. Mutations appearing during selection were mainly one-base deletions in runs of iterated bases. Similar mutations occurring in repetitive DNA elements are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases and are increased in cells that cannot correct heteroduplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1531847963,"Suspension-cultured tomato cells have a sensitive perception system for chitin fragments with a degree of polymerization (DP) > or = 4 and react to these compounds with a transient alkalinization of their culture medium (Felix, G., Regenass, M., and Boller, T. (1993) Plant. J. 4, 307-316). A chitin fragment with DP 5 was aminated at the reducing end and coupled to t-butoxycarbonyl-L-[35S]methionine via an amidoglycine spacer. The radiolabeled chitin fragment (approximately 1000 Ci/mmol) exhibited specific, saturable, reversible binding to whole tomato cells as well as to tomato microsomal membranes with dissociation constants of 1.4 and 23 nM, respectively. Binding of the radioligand was competed by chitin fragments of different DP with IC50 values (50% inhibition of binding) that closely paralleled the concentrations inducing the alkalinization response half-maximally. Deacetylated chitooligosaccharides and N-propanoyl chitooligosaccharides were weak elicitors of the alkalinization response as well as weak competitors of radioligand binding. A lipochitooligosaccharide (Nod factor) from Rhizobium leguminosarum stimulated the alkalinization response in tomato cells half-maximally at 3 nM and competed radioligand binding to the cells with an IC50 of 8 nM. These results demonstrate the presence of a high affinity binding site for chitin fragments on the tomato cell membrane that may function as a receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1815276265,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunits (GABAA) can be divided into five classes, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho, based on sequence homology. We have used purified fusion proteins of the major intracellular domain of GABAA receptor subunits produced in Escherichia coli to examine the phosphorylation of these subunits by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAM KII). Both PKG and CAM KII phosphorylated a purified beta 1 subunit fusion. Both of these kinases phosphorylated serine 409 within the beta 1 subunit; in addition, CAM KII also phosphorylated serine 384 as determined by site-specific mutagenesis. Fusion proteins of the major intracellular domains of the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits were produced. These proteins differ by 8 amino acids (LLRMFSFK). Both the gamma 2L and gamma 2S fusion proteins were excellent substrates of CAM KII. However, the gamma 2L fusion protein was phosphorylated to higher stoichiometry due to the phosphorylation of serine 343 within this 8-amino acid insertion. Both the gamma 2L and gamma 2S subunits were phosphorylated on common residues by CAM KII identified as serine 348 and threonine 350. These results identify specific sites of phosphorylation for CAM KII and PKG within GABAA receptor subunits, suggesting a role for these two kinases in modulating GABAA receptor function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1489316903,"GATA-binding proteins are transcription factors that regulate the stage- and tissue-specific expression of globin genes in cells of the erythroid lineage. Recently, a cardiac GATA-binding protein was found to be the earliest gene expressed during cardiogenesis; however, the target genes of this transcription factor in the heart are unknown. Since brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is activated early in cardiac growth and development, we evaluated whether it could serve as a target gene for GATA-binding protein-mediated induction. Upon isolating and sequencing 2.5 kilobases of the rat BNP 5'-flanking sequence (FS), a variety of putative transcriptional enhancer sites were identified, including several GATA consensus sequences (WGATAR), one of which apparently serves as the major promoter site. Primary myocardial cells were transfected with BNP/luciferase fusion genes; reporter expression was strongly induced by typical growth factors such as phorbol esters, serum, or alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, as well as by GATA-4 overexpression. Truncation analyses showed that inducibility mapped primarily to the proximal -116 base pair of the rat BNP 5'-FS, where there are two consensus GATA sites in addition to the GATA sequence at the TATA box. Point mutation analyses showed that at least one of the GATA sites was required to confer full GATA-4-inducible transcription. These results demonstrate that a proximal region of the rat BNP 5'-FS is required for growth factor- and GATA-inducible transcription, supporting the view that the BNP gene could serve as a target for GATA-binding proteins during early cardiac development."
https://openalex.org/W1597009892,"Purified mammalian DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) fills short gaps of up to 6 nucleotides by a processive mechanism, and this gap-filling activity requires a PO4 group on the 5'-side of the gap (Singhal, R. K., and Wilson, S. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15906-15911). To assess details of bimolecular binding between beta-pol and a 5-nucleotide (nt) gapped radiolabeled heteropolymeric DNA substrate, beta-pol.DNA complexes were formed, photochemically cross-linked using UV light, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A 39-nt template was annealed with two 17-mer oligonucleotides, generating a 5-nt gap. The results indicate that beta-pol binds to both the template and primer strands, and binding is strongly enhanced by a 5'-PO4 on the downstream oligonucleotide, even though little cross-linking is observed to this oligonucleotide. The results suggest that beta-pol recognizes the 5'-side of a long single-stranded gap in DNA, provided it contains a 5'-PO4. Additional beta-pol.DNA binding measurements were performed using a competition assay to assess the ability of heteropolymeric DNA to inhibit synthesis on a homopolymeric template-primer system. The results indicate that in addition to the 5'-PO4, the length of the single-stranded template nucleic acid adjacent to the 5'-PO4 is also important for tight binding. Proteolysis of the cross-linked beta-pol.DNA complex with trypsin resulted in a single radiolabeled tryptic product corresponding to nucleic acid cross-linked to the 8-kDa domain. The results demonstrate that the role of the 8-kDa domain is to direct beta-pol binding to the phosphorylated 5'-position in gapped DNA substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1931571693,"We studied the phosphorylation of the alpha and beta subunits of the Type I interferon (IFN) receptor induced by Type I IFNs in the human U-266 and MOLT-4 cell lines. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the receptor. The Type I IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunit was rapid and transient, being detectable within 1 min of Type I IFN treatment and gradually diminishing to almost base-line levels by 60 min. All Type I IFNs studied were found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the Type I IFN receptor, the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases, and the ISGF3 alpha components. Interestingly, IFN-beta, but not IFN-alpha or IFN-omega, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of an alpha subunit-associated protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa (p100). These data suggest the existence of a common signaling pathway(s) for Type I IFNs involving the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor, the tyrosine kinases p135tyk2 and JAK-1, and the ISGF3 alpha components. However, differences between the signaling pathways of different Type I IFNs exist, as suggested by tyrosine phosphorylation of an alpha subunit-associated protein only in response to IFN-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1571434023,"Glucose metabolism in the photoreceptor rod outer segment produces both ATP (GTP) and NADPH to support phototransduction and NADPH-requiring processes in this organelle. Glycolysis in isolated bovine rod outer segments produces 44.0 +/- 6.4 nmol of ATP/min/mg of protein or 5.7 mM ATP/min. This rate of ATP production is more than sufficient to maintain the basal rate of cGMP synthesis (0.86 mM cGMP/min) in the dark requiring 1.7 mM ATP/min. Following photoexcitation, the 4.5-fold increase in the turnover of cGMP requires an ATP synthesis rate of up to 7.7 mM ATP/min (Ames, A., Walseth, T. F., Heyman, R. A., Barad, M., Graeff, R. M., and Goldberg, N. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13034-13042). Under these conditions the rate of ATP production by glycolysis as measured in isolated rod outer segments is not sufficient for the regeneration of cGMP. Additional energy is most likely provided by the phosphocreatine shuttle which transports high energy phosphate groups in the form of creatine phosphate from the rod inner segment to the rod outer segment for conversion to ATP. The hexose monophosphate pathway in bovine rod outer segments can produce up to 39.8 +/- 2.2 nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein. This rate of NADPH production is sufficient to support both the reduction of retinal to retinol (1.2 +/- 0.2 nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein) following the photobleaching of rhodopsin and glutathione reduction (1.1 +/- 0.1 nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein) for the protection of rod outer segments from oxidative damage. These studies provide insight into the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate pathway in providing energy and nucleotides for phototransduction and other outer segment processes."
https://openalex.org/W2127764420,"Coatomer is a distinct type of coat protein complex involved in the formation of specific Golgi intercisternal transport vesicles. Direct binding studies using purified coatomer isolated from bovine liver cytosol show that coatomer specifically binds both inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate ((1,3,4,5)IP4) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) with subnanomolar affinities (0.1 and 0.2 nM, respectively). Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5) is an efficient competitor for both (1,3,4,5)IP4 and IP6 binding to coatomer. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate ((1,3,4,5,6)IP5) is a poor inhibitor of IP6 binding, whereas little or no competition is detected with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)I-P3). Coatomer displays ion channel activity when reconstituted into planar bilayers which is preferentially permeable to K+. Permeability ratios of the channel are PK+/PCl- approximately 8.0 and PK+/PNa+ approximately 7.1, indicating a cation-selective channel with selectivity of K+ over Na+. In symmetrical 500 mM KCl, the smallest observable unitary channel conductance is 8.3 picosiemens. The coatomer channel activity is normally active with long open times (0.1 to several seconds) and is selectively blocked by 10 microM (1,3,4,5)IP4, 1 microM IP6, and 0.27 microM PP-IP5; even lower concentrations are sufficient to induce channel flicker. The channel activity is not affected by (1,4,5)IP3, or (1,3,4,5,6)IP5. Thus, the channel activity of coatomer is modulated by the inositol polyphosphates which exhibit tight binding to the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1545557903,"Glut2, the facilitative glucose transporter isoform expressed in pancreatic beta cells, is believed to play a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Two polymorphisms that result in amino acid substitutions have been reported in the human Glut2 gene (Tanizawa, Y., Riggs, A. C., Chiu, K. C., Janssen, R. C., Bell, D. S. H., Go, R. P. C., Roseman, J. M., Acton, R. T., and Permutt, M. A. (1994) Diabetologia 37, 420-427). A threonine 110–>isoleucine substitution was present at equal frequency in diabetic and control populations, and a valine 197–>isoleucine substitution was discovered in a single allele of a patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The effect of these amino acid changes on glucose transport activity was tested by expression of the mutant proteins in Xenopus oocytes. The polymorphism at threonine 110 had no effect on the expression of Glut2 protein or the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Remarkably, however, the highly conservative valine 197–>isoleucine amino acid change abolished transport activity of the Glut2 transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This represents the first known dysfunctional mutation in a human facilitative glucose transporter protein. The presence of this mutation in a diabetic patient suggests that defects in Glut2 expression may be causally involved in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1497917975,"After binding to its receptor (uPAR), active cell-surface urokinase (uPA) is not internalized while the complex formed by uPA with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is internalized and degraded. Internalization and degradation require binding to uPAR and subsequently an interaction with the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (alpha 2-MR). To analyze the generality of this mechanism, we studied the internalization of uPA by recombinant protease nexin-1 (rPN-1), an inhibitor of thrombin, uPA, and plasmin. 125I-uPA.rPN-1 complexes bound specifically to uPAR; internalization occurred efficiently, and its time course was essentially the same as for uPA.PAI-1. Internalization required binding to uPAR since it could be blocked by the anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies, by the uPAR antagonist amino-terminal fragment of uPA, and by the removal of uPAR by the treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. As for uPA.PAI-1, the internalization of uPA.rPN-1 also required alpha 2-MR, since it could be inhibited by the 39-kDa alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein, a ligand for the alpha 2-MR. Finally, we show by ligand blot analysis that the uPA.rPN-1 complex, like uPA.PAI-1 but unlike free uPA, bound specifically to both uPAR and alpha 2-MR."
https://openalex.org/W1520224518,"Proteoglycans play pivotal roles in the regulation of thrombin. Thrombomodulin (TM) binds thrombin through protein-protein contacts and a chondroitin sulfate moiety. The complex activates the anticoagulant zymogen, protein C. Thrombin and a thrombin mutant with Arg93, Arg97, and Arg101 changed to Ala bind soluble TM lacking the chondroitin sulfate with comparable affinities, but the mutant binds TM containing chondroitin sulfate 45-fold weaker than thrombin. A simple hyperbolic relationship describes the Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation with the thrombin mutant-TM complex whether or not the TM contains chondroitin sulfate. A similar Ca2+ dependence is observed with wild type thrombin only when the TM contains chondroitin sulfate. Thus, charge neutralization of Arg93, Arg97, and Arg101 mimics the functional effects of the chondroitin sulfate. The mutant and wild type thrombin are inhibited at comparable rates by antithrombin +/- the pentasaccharide capable of inducing the active antithrombin conformation, but heparin acceleration of antithrombin inhibition of the mutant is reduced by more than 95%. Binding studies revealed that the mutant has a > or = 20-fold decrease in heparin affinity. We conclude that heparin and chondroitin sulfate interact with one or more of these Arg residues. These basic residues appear to play a critical role in the regulation of thrombin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1535106643,"P450 4A6 is highly induced by peroxisome proliferators in vivo. Gene transfer experiments indicate that this induction can be mediated by the mouse peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and that it is dependent on upstream enhancer elements in the CYP4A6 gene. However, as has been seen for other peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs), PPAR alpha does not bind directly to a previously characterized PPRE of the CYP4A6 gene in the absence of additional proteins such as the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha). When PPAR alpha and RXR alpha are coexpressed, the overall transcription of the CYP4A6 reporter is increased, and a synergistic response to both retinoids and peroxisome proliferators is evident that is dependent on the presence of both receptors. In addition, a cryptic response element is unmasked in constructs lacking the upstream enhancers. DNase I protection assays indicate that when present together, but not singly, PPAR alpha and RXR alpha bind to a site located within 29 base pairs upstream of the CYP4A6 transcription start site. This region contains a sequence similar to that found in the apolipoprotein CIII gene that has been shown to bind RXR alpha and the orphan nuclear receptor, ARP-1. The corresponding sequence in the CYP4A6 gene also binds ARP-1. A similar sequence found in the promoter region of the rat CYP4A1 gene does not, however, bind either PPAR alpha/RXR alpha or ARP-1. Transfection of increasing amounts of the ARP-1 expression vector blocks the PPAR alpha/RXR alpha-mediated induction of transcription from the CYP4A6 promoter. Mutations that prevent the binding of either PPAR alpha/RXR alpha or ARP-1 to a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the proximal enhancer eliminate the peroxisome proliferator-induced transcriptional response observed for the promoter construct in the presence of PPAR alpha/RXR alpha, but these mutations do not eliminate the response seen when the upstream enhancers are present. These results indicate that the PPREs of the CYP4A6 gene are recognized by multiple members of the nuclear receptor family that are likely to contribute to the regulation of CYP4A6 expression in both an agonistic (RXR alpha) and an antagonistic (ARP-1) manner."
https://openalex.org/W1524914308,"To obtain cDNAs for analysis of mucin gene transcription in rat models of human disease, we screened a rat intestinal cDNA library in lambda ZAPII using an upstream non-tandem repeat cDNA fragment of the human MUC 2 gene (Gum, J., Hicks, J., Toribara, N., Rothe, E., Lagace, R., and Y., K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21375-21383). Three cDNAs, 1-1, 8-1, and 21-1, were isolated. A translation start site was found in cDNA 21-1. Combined nucleotide sequence for the three cDNAs contained an open reading frame spanning 4546 base pairs. This amino-terminal sequence contains a non-tandem repeat domain enriched in cysteine (1391 residues) followed by an irregular tandem repeat domain (122 residues). Identity with the human gene is about 80% in the non-tandem repeat domain and about 38% in the irregular tandem repeat domain. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis indicate a transcription start site at 28 base pairs upstream of translation initiation. Northern analysis showed expression of cognate RNA in the intestine and airway but not heart and spleen. The cDNAs have been used to isolate the gene promoter, the structure of which should yield clues to the regulation of mucin expression in rat models of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1488655099,"Availability of voids for diffusion of quinone in the membrane was shown to be the rate-limiting step in electron transport in mitochondria and chloroplasts (Mathai, J. C., Sauna, Z. E., John, O., and Sitaramam, V (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15442-15454). The primary role of voids in these diffusion-controlled reactions required a more rigorous documentation of the role of diffusion in membranes by independent measurements. The transbilayer diffusion of hydrogen peroxide as monitored by occluded catalase activity was developed as a kinetically valid probe to specifically address this question. This in turn led to unique results on the mechanistic basis of stretch (= hypo-osmotic) activation of hydrogen peroxide permeation via such voids. The rate of peroxide permeation is shown to be markedly stretch sensitive in some cells/organelles (e.g. peroxisomes) and insensitive in others (e.g. erythrocytes); this was equally true of liposomes prepared from lipids extracted from the corresponding cells/organelles. The molecular basis of stretch sensitivity was uncovered using specific binary mixtures of lipids: while pure phosphatidyl choline liposomes were stretch insensitive, these became sensitive when doped only with specific lipids, viz. cardiolipin and cerebrosides. Cholesterol abolished this stretch sensitivity in ternary mixtures. Induction of stretch sensitivity by cardiolipin was marked by lowering of activation energy for peroxide diffusion, a negative temperature coefficient for glucose permeation while further addition of cholesterol reversed these phenomena. The steady state fluorescence polarization studies revealed intimate correlations between anisotropy, hydrogen peroxide diffusion, and stretch sensitivity consistent with presence of voids in these binary mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W1582592433,"Sphingosine is a positive regulator of cell growth in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Zhang, H., Buckley, N. E., Gibson, K., and Spiegel, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 76-81). The present study investigated the stereospecificity of sphingosine-induced cell proliferation and its mitogenic signal transduction mechanisms. D-(+)-erythro Stereoisomers (cis and trans) stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas neither L-(-)-threo-sphingosine (cis or trans) nor DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine had any effect. Previously, we have shown that sphingosine-1-phosphate may mediate the mitogenic effect of sphingosine (Zhang, H., Desai, N. N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167). However, no major differences were found in the formation of D-(+)-erythro- and L-(-)-threo- sphingosine-1-phosphate derived from the respective sphingosine isomers in intact cells. Thus, the stereospecificity of the response to sphingosine may reside at the level of specific intracellular targets for sphingosine-1-phosphate. Sphingosine-1-phosphate triggers dual signal transduction pathways of activation of phospholipase D leading to increases in the levels of phosphatidic acid and mobilization of calcium from internal stores. Both D-(+)-erythro- and L-(-)-threo-sphingosine isomers induced similar increases in phosphatidic acid concomitant with identical decreases in phosphatidylcholine levels. In contrast, only the D-(+)-erythro-stereoisomers (cis and trans) were effective in releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Our results suggest that the formation of phosphatidic acid is not sufficient to mediate sphingosine-stimulated DNA synthesis. However, the stereospecificity of the sphingosine-induced mobilization of calcium from internal stores seems to correlate with the induction of DNA synthesis by sphingosine stereoisomers."
https://openalex.org/W1591556642,"Repetitive cyclic stretch (60 cycles/min) of rat aortic smooth muscle cells dramatically enhances the effect of angiotensin II (AII) on mRNA expression of the vasorelaxant, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Thus, combined stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells by cyclic stretch and low concentrations of AII, but not either alone, induces a synergistic, marked increase in the PTHrP mRNA level, in a manner dependent on the strength of stretch. This response is accompanied by a synergistic increase in secretion of PTHrP from smooth muscle cells. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of Ca2+ channel blockers, including Gd3+ and nitrendipine, does not considerably reduce the combined effects of stretch and AII, indicating that this response is not dependent on stretch-induced Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. The combined effect of stretch and AII on PTHrP mRNA expression is strongly attenuated by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine or by down-regulation of PKC, suggesting that PKC plays an important role in the synergistic response. However, stretch neither elicits activation of phospholipase C or PKC by itself, nor does it enhance AII-induced activation of these enzymes. These results indicate that in vascular smooth muscle cells mechanical stretch acts together with the vasoconstrictor AII to regulate the expression of the vasodilator PTHrP and suggest the role of PTHrP as a local modulator of myogenic tone."
https://openalex.org/W1656415435,"The nuclear protein interacting with the distal CCAAT box of human thymidine kinase (TK) gene promoter has been suggested to be a specific TK-CCAAT-binding protein, which is responsible for the serum-dependence of TK transactivation in normal human IMR-90 fibroblasts. By biochemical characterization, TK-CCAAT-binding protein was found to be distinct from other known CCAAT-binding proteins (Pang, J. H., and Chen, K. Y. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2909-2916). In this study, we identify NF-Y, which is composed of Ya and Yb subunits, to be responsible for the TK-CCAAT binding activity in the crude nuclear extract from HL-60 cells. The interaction of NF-Y with the distal CCAAT box of the TK promoter in the crude extract appeared to be more heat-sensitive than that in the DNA affinity chromatography purified fraction. We have further established that the serum dependence of TK-CCAAT binding activity in normal IMR-90 fibroblasts is due to the decrement of NF-Ya, but not NF-Yb expression following serum-deprivation, and that such serum dependence is absent in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588840456,"The chloroplast photosystem II reaction center protein D1 contains five membrane-spanning helices and binds chlorophyll, carotenoid, quinone, iron, and probably manganese. Turnover of pulse-labeled D1 in isolated plastids was found to involve cleavage between helix IV and helix V, which releases a 23-kDa N-terminal peptide and two C-terminal peptides of 10 and 8 kDa. Ribosomes pause at specific sites during translation of D1, which results in the accumulation of D1 translation intermediates. Pulse-labeling assays followed by polysome isolation and immunoprecipitation identified paused D1 translation intermediates of 9, 12.5, 15-18, 20, 21, 24, and 28-32 kDa. Ribosome pausing was not altered when dark-grown seedlings were illuminated for up to 1 h, even though this treatment stimulated accumulation of chlorophyll and D1. However, illumination of plants for 16-72 h resulted in increased ribosome pausing and the build-up of D1 translation intermediates. We hypothesize that ribosome pausing during synthesis of D1 improves the efficiency of chlorophyll binding of D1 nascent chains and enhances accumulation of D1 in mature chloroplasts, which have reduced rates of chlorophyll biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1537356627,"The expression of the ATPase gene (PMA1) is regulated by glucose (Rao, R., Drummond-Barbosa, D., and Slayman, C. W. (1993) Yeast 9, 1075-1084) and by the TUF/RAP1/GRF1 transcription factor (Capieaux, E., Vignais, M.-L., Sentenac, A., and Goffeau, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7437-7446). In this work, we describe the isolation of mutations on seven genes that affect the levels of ATPase. One of these genes (APA1) was cloned by complementation and shown to encode a protein with six putative transmembrane stretches. Expression of APA1 gene is regulated by the carbon source and requires the protein GCR1. Deletion of APA1 causes a defective regulation of the PMA1 expression by glucose but has not noticeable effect on the expression of other TUF-regulated genes. Nevertheless the expression of glucose-repressible HXT3 and SNF3 genes is significantly reduced. These results suggest a model in which APA1 acts on a glucose-signaling pathway that controls the expression of several genes that are transcriptionally regulated by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1556342932,"A small upstream open reading frame (uORF), located 14 nucleotides from the cap in the 5' transcript leader (5' TL) of the mRNA encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), suppresses translation of the downstream cistron in normal T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined the structural features of the 5' TL that overcome this suppressive influence in cells of nonlymphoid origin. Initiation at the downstream cistron in nonlymphoid cells is by a cap-dependent mechanism that requires ribosome scanning along the 5' TL and does not involve an internal ribosome entry site. Extending the uORF so that it overlapped the major cistron by 101 nucleotides had no effect on translation of the downstream cistron in either HeLa or Jurkat cells. When the distance between the uORF and the cap was extended to 47 nucleotides, using sequence previously found to be neutral, translation of the major cistron was inhibited 5-fold in HeLa cells and the mRNA was moved from polysomes to monosomes, a location identical to that of the wild type mRNA in Jurkat cells. Therefore, in contrast to T cells, initiation at the uORF seems to be relatively infrequent in non-lymphoid cells due to its proximity to the cap, allowing efficient translation of the downstream cistron."
https://openalex.org/W1607019337,"The previously cloned human interferon alpha/beta (Hu-IFN-alpha/beta; Type I interferon) receptor cDNA appears to be only one component of a receptor complex since expression of the cDNA in mouse cells confers sensitivity only to Hu-IFN-alpha B2, but a monoclonal antibody against this cloned receptor subunit inhibits biological activities of Hu-IFN-alpha A, Hu-IFN-alpha B2, Hu-IFN-omega, and Hu-IFN-beta. Here we report that a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing a segment of human chromosome 21 introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells confers upon these cells a greatly enhanced response to Hu-IFN-alpha A and Hu-IFN-alpha B2 as well as an increased response to Hu-IFN-omega, Hu-IFN-alpha A/D(Bgl), andd Hu-IFN-beta. These responses were measured by induction of class I MHC antigens and by protection against encephalomyocarditis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. Furthermore, these cells exhibit specific high affinity binding of Hu-IFN-alpha A and Hu-IFN-alpha B2, Hu-IFN-beta, and Hu-IFN-omega. The results indicate that all the genes necessary to reconstitute a biologically active Type I human IFN receptor complex are located within the human DNA insert of this YAC clone."
https://openalex.org/W1495969925,"Expression of the lysozyme gene in chicken macrophages is regulated by an enhancer located 2.7 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site. The organization of this enhancer was analyzed by in vitro assays (DNase I footprinting, dimethyl sulfate methylation protection, and band shift assays) and in vivo footprinting experiments. The results show that the enhancer contains four regions (I-IV) of protein-DNA interactions. First, transient gene transfer experiments demonstrate that region II contributes most to the enhancer function. This region contains a recognition site for the macrophage- and B cell-specific transcription factor PU.1, a member of the Ets transcription factor family. This site plays a major role in the enhancer since a mutation of this site abolishes enhancer activity. Second, in competition band shift experiments, we show that the only myeloid-specific complexes in regions I and II with nuclear factors are formed on the PU.1 recognition site by a member of the Ets transcription factor family. Third in in vivo footprinting experiments, the only sign of a protein-DNA interaction is a dimethyl sulfate-hyperreactive guanine 3'-adjacent to the PU.1 recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1934878529,"Abstract NMT1 is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene which encodes myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p). Nmt1p transfers myristate (C14:0), from myristoyl-CoA to the amino-terminal Gly residue of several essential cellular proteins. Little information is available about how myristoyl-CoA metabolism is regulated in eukaryotic cells. We have isolated and characterized three unlinked Fatty Acid Activation genes from S. cerevisiae, FAA1, FAA2, and FAA3. In vitro biochemical assays reveal that the myristoyl-CoA synthetase activity of purified Faa2p is approximately equal to that of Faa1p, and two orders of magnitude greater than that of Faa3p. Analysis of NMT1 strains containing faa1, faa2, and/or faa3 null alleles indicates that Faa1p, Faa2p, and Faa3p are not essential for vegetative growth when de novo acyl-CoA synthesis by fatty acid synthetase (Fas) is active. S. cerevisiae strains containing nmt1-181 exhibit temperature-sensitive growth arrest and myristic acid auxotrophy due to the reduced affinity of its mutant protein product (nmtGly451-->Asp) for myristoyl-CoA. Comparison of the growth characteristics of isogenic NMT1 and nmt1-181 strains with all possible combinations of faa1, faa2, and faa3 null alleles, in the presence or absence of an active Fas complex, indicates that (i) Faa1p is responsible for activation of imported fatty acids to their CoA derivatives; (ii) Faa2p and Faa3p are able to access endogenous but not imported fatty acid substrates; (iii) nmt181p requires myristoyl-CoA production from both Fas and Faas for cells to remain viable at nonpermissive temperatures; (iv) Faa2p is unique among the three Faas in its ability, when overproduced, to partially rescue growth of a nmt1-181 strain at nonpermissive temperatures on yeast/peptone/dextrose (YPD) media without C14:0 supplementation; (v) acyl-CoAs produced by Faa1p, Faa2p, or Faa3p are not specifically targeted for beta-oxidation; and (vi) the ability of NMT1, faa1 delta, faa2 delta, faa3 delta strains to remain viable in the absence of an active Fas complex on YPD plus C14:0, or on media that contains fatty acids as the sole carbon source, suggests that S. cerevisiae contains other acyl-CoA synthetases which can activate imported fatty acids."

RNA polymerase III transcription complexes have been assembled on this DNA and analyzed by photocrosslinking for proteins making close contact with DNA. Comparison DNA probes with a long-tether photoactive nucleotide 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]-dUMP (N3RdUMP) incorporated at the same positions have also been analyzed, in order to compare the properties of these two crosslinking reagents. At least 10 of the 16 different S. cerevisiae polymerase III subunits make direct contact with DNA. The 120-kDa subunit of transcription factor (TF)IIIC, which is thought to play the key role in positioning TFIIIB upstream of the transcriptional start site, also contacts DNA near the transcriptional start site in TFIII(C+B) complexes with a SUP4 tRNA(Tyr) gene. The photocrosslinking patterns generated by 4-S-dTMP and N3RdUMP are distinctive, implying that these two reagents can yield complementary information about the structures of complex protein assemblies on DNA. Surprisingly, some subunits of the S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase III are crosslinked by 4-S-dTMP but not by N3RdUMP."
https://openalex.org/W1502985975,"We have recently cloned the entire human elastin gene, including approximately 5.2 kilobases of the 5'-flanking sequences. To examine tissue-specific expression of the elastin gene, we have developed a transgenic mouse line that expresses the human elastin promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Assay of CAT activity in different tissues revealed the highest expression in the lungs and aorta, while lower levels were detected in the kidneys, heart, brain, and skin; this distribution parallels the accumulation of elastin in developing animals. Comparison of CAT activity in the lungs of fetal (15-day gestation) and newborn (5-day postnatal) animals revealed significantly (approximately 4-fold) higher activity in the fetal tissue. The relatively high activity in the lungs progressively declined during the postnatal period up to 6 months. The promoter activity in the aorta remained constant from 5 days to 3 months and then gradually declined, while in the skin, the activity peaked at 3 months, returning thereafter to the control (5-day) level. Thus, there is evidence for developmentally regulated, tissue-specific expression of the elastin promoter in vivo as tested in these transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1595619978,"Clusterin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein, expressed by various cell types and shown to have activity in cell-cell adhesion. Cultured porcine smooth muscle cells (SMC) undergo morphological and phenotypic modulation associated with a change from a substrate-attached monolayer culture to a nodular culture in which most of the cells are present in multicellular aggregations (nodules). During that transition from monolayer to nodular cell culture (> 8 days) the expression of an mRNA and protein with significant homology to rat and human clusterin is increased. Clusterin expression continues in the nodular cell cultures and it is secreted at 0.3 micrograms/ml/24 h as a protein with an apparent molecular mass = 80 kDa. In the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol the molecular mass is approximately 40 kDa. SMC clusterin expression is regulated by culture conditions that also affect culture morphology. SMC cultures seeded on a preformed extracellular matrix composed of Matrigel form nodules within 24 h and cultures seeded on a collagen gel form nodules in 48-72 h. We establish here that Matrigel contains clusterin and propose that endogenous clusterin supports the rapid formation of nodules. The collagen gel does not contain clusterin but facilitates clusterin expression by smooth muscle cells. Nodule formation in SMC cultures growing on collagen gel is inhibited by the addition of anticlusterin antibody to SMC growing on collagen gels and the antibody effect is eliminated by preincubation with purified plasma clusterin. These results demonstrate differential expression of SMC clusterin and suggest that clusterin has a functional role in SMC modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1949220541,"We examined the regulation of an amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance expressed in human B lymphoid cells. This conductance was activated by two independent pathways, one involving cyclic adenylyl monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase and the other involving a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Cholera toxin, presumably by increasing cellular cAMP, and pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates certain GTP-binding proteins, both independently increased the amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance. Simultaneous treatment with both toxins, however, failed to increase the sodium conductance, implying that a single set of sodium channels was being affected by both toxins. In cells preactivated with pertussis toxin, 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP inhibited the activated sodium conductance back to the basal level. Thus, cyclic AMP-dependent pathways can either activate or inhibit amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, depending upon the activation state of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. These findings support a hypothesis for the regulation of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels which incorporates the independent effects of cholera and pertussis toxins, and in which cyclic AMP can play a dual role in the regulation of channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1661394574,"Rat liver adenosine kinase can catalyze an exchange reaction between adenosine and AMP in the absence of ATP (Bontemps, F., Mimouni, M., and Van den Berghe, G. (1993) Biochem. J. 290, 679-684), suggesting a classical ping-pong mechanism. Contrary to expectations, formation of a phosphorylenzyme intermediate could not be demonstrated by incubating the enzyme with [gamma-32P] ATP. Although initial velocity measurements in function of the concentration of adenosine or Mg.ATP, at various fixed concentrations of Mg.ATP or adenosine, generated parallel line patterns, inhibition studies revealed that competitive inhibition was only observed between ADP and ATP. This indicates an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which ATP binds first to the enzyme, and ADP is released last. The adenosine-AMP exchange reaction was found to be potently stimulated by ADP, and the basal exchange reaction, i.e. measured in the absence of added ADP, could be accounted for by a slight (0.001%) contamination by ADP of analytical grade AMP. The ADP requirement of the adenosine-AMP exchange reaction explains its occurrence in an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. Stimulation of the exchange reaction between AMP and adenosine by increasing concentrations of ADP/ATP, and stimulation followed by inhibition of the exchange reaction between ADP and ATP by increasing concentrations of AMP/adenosine, corroborated the proposed mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1586241513,"We investigated the signal transduction pathways leading to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1)-induced IL-1 alpha mRNA in mouse keratinocytes. Induction of IL-1 alpha mRNA by TPA or IL-1 alpha was followed by increases in cell-associated IL-1 alpha protein measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although protein kinase C (PKC) was involved in TPA-induced IL-1 alpha mRNA, down-regulation of PKC did not block the induction of this gene by TPA. The autocrine induction of IL-1 alpha was not mediated through PKC or cAMP. IL-1 alpha did activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked both IL-1 alpha-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation as well as IL-1 alpha mRNA expression. Genistein, at an unsaturating dose, plus a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7, completely blocked the autocrine induction of IL-1 alpha suggesting that expression of this gene is regulated by tyrosine kinase(s) in combination or independently with serine/threonine kinase(s). In addition, both TPA and IL-1 alpha caused increases not only in the phosphorylation of c-Jun and c-Fos protein but also in the transactivating activity of AP-1 nuclear transcription factor. Neither TPA nor IL-1 alpha induced NF-kappa B binding activity, as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. This study suggests that the activation of AP-1 may be a common event through which TPA and IL-1 alpha induce IL-1 alpha mRNA."

Using a T7 RNA polymerase-based pET system, HMG-CoA lyase was overexpressed but largely recovered in an insoluble, catalytically inactive form. In contrast, an expression plasmid (pTrcHL-1), derived from pTrc99a, supported production of soluble, active enzyme. A synthetic oligonucleotide cassette was employed to produce an enzyme variant in which cysteine was replaced by serine at position 323. Both wild-type and C323S HMG-CoA lyases were isolated in homogeneous form and characterized. The function of Cys-323 in influencing catalytic activity in vitro has been investigated by comparing the response of wild-type and C323S lyases to oxidation and reduction. Additionally, the consequences of treatment of these enzymes with the sulfhydryl-directed bifunctional reagent, o-phenylenedimaleimide have been determined. The results support the hypothesis that a thiol/disulfide exchange mechanism affects enzyme activity in vitro and indicate that Cys-323 residues on adjacent subunits of the homodimeric native enzyme are suitably positioned to form an intersubunit cross-link upon oxidative inactivation and disulfide formation."
https://openalex.org/W1921797592,"The functional role of the oligosaccharide chains linked to the insulin receptor (IR) beta subunit was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of each of the 4 acceptor asparagines (N1 to N4 from the amino to the carboxyl terminus) and stable expression of the receptors in CHO cells. All mutant receptors are expressed normally at the cell surface, bind insulin with similar affinity, but have a beta subunit of smaller molecular mass, and a defect in ligand-induced internalization as compared to wild type receptor. In terms of receptor activation and signal transduction, the N1 and N2 mutants function normally, whereas the N4 mutant exhibits major alterations in in vitro tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation and is unable to transduce the signal for either glycogen or DNA synthesis. By contrast, in vivo autophosphorylation and IRS-1 phosphorylation appear quantitatively normal, and only partial alterations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation are observed. Mutation of the N3 site results in partial defect of IR activation. These data provide evidence for (i) glycosylation of each N-linked glycosylation site of the IR beta subunit, (ii) absence of correlation between internalization and transmembrane signaling, and (iii) a major role for oligosaccharide side chain(s) located close to the cell membrane in IR activation and transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1500869750,"Previous studies have described specific photoincorporation of radiolabeled sulfonylureas into a peptide with high molecular mass (140-175 kDa), which thus has been suggested to represent the sulfonylurea receptor. In the present study, a 125I-labeled 4-azidosalicyloyl analog of glibenclamide, 125I-N3-GA (N-[4-(2-(4-azido-2-hydroxy-5-125I- iodobenzamido)ethyl)benzenesulfonyl]-N'-cyclohexylurea), was used for photoaffinity labeling. This novel probe was specifically photoincorporated into a peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 160-175 kDa when samples from insulin-secreting HIT cells or cerebral cortex were boiled in a SDS-buffer prior to separation with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, omitting the heating step revealed specific labeling of an additional peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa. The amount of radioactivity specifically photoincorporated into this peptide was 3-4-fold higher than that incorporated into the 160-175-kDa peptide. Both peptides displayed similar dissociation constants for binding of the sulfonylureas IN3-GA (N-[4-(2-(4-azido-2-hydroxy- 5-iodobenzamido)ethyl)benzenesulfonyl]-N'-cyclohexylurea), glibenclamide, glipizide, and tolbutamide. Analysis of photoaffinity labeling of solubilized fractions indicated an almost exclusive specific linkage to the 38-kDa peptide. The data support the view that the sulfonylurea receptor in insulin-secreting cells and cerebral cortex consists of a peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa, which seems to be tightly coupled to a 160-175-kDa peptide."

G., and Sierra, J. M. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 2181-2190) and another of 200 kDa. Both subunits cosedimented through a sucrose density gradient containing 0.5 M KCl. In contrast to rabbit reticulocyte eIF-4F, we did not find any RNA-dependent ATPase associated with the Drosophila factor. As shown previously for eIF-4E, the p200 subunit was also required for the translation of endogenous mRNAs in cell-free systems from Drosophila embryos. Only the eIF-4E subunit was able to cross-link to the m7G cap structure. However, an efficient cross-linking of the p200 subunit to an uncapped mRNA was observed. Both subunits were phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C from rat brain. As an extension of our previous results (Zapata, J. M., Maroto, F. G., and Sierra, J. M. (1991) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1515025950,"The overexpression of the membrane-bound C domain of the mannitol transport protein EIIMtl of Escherichia coli has been achieved. This protein, IICMtl, consisting of the first 346 amino acids, was purified from membrane vesicles and still bound mannitol with a high affinity. Gel filtration experiments showed that purified IICMtl was a dimer, confirming that the interaction within the EIIMtl dimer occurs between the membrane-bound portions of the protein. IICMtl in combination with a chimeric protein consisting of the membrane-bound EIIGlc C domain and the cytoplasmic EIIMtl BA domain could restore both phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation and mannitol/mannitol-P exchange activity. The interaction in this complex was comparable to that of IICMtl with soluble IIBAMtl in as much as there appeared to be no specific interaction between IICMtl and the membrane-bound EIIGlc C domain; the Km of IICMtl for the chimer was so low that saturation could not be achieved. In contrast, a very high affinity with a Km of 2 nM was measured between purified IICMtl and purified EIIMtl. This interaction was manifested in a IICMtl-dependent stimulation of the EIIMtl catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannitol phosphorylation reaction and the mannitol/mannitol-P exchange reaction. The high affinity of IICMtl for the wild type enzyme can be explained by the formation of heterodimers consisting of a IICMtl monomer and an EIIMtl monomer which interact at the level of the membrane-bound domains. The 2-fold increase in mannitol phosphorylation activity of the hetero- versus homodimer is an indication that the individual subunits in the homodimer are functionally coupled and work at only half their maximum rate. It is known that the EIIMtl dimer, but not the monomer, catalyzes the mannitol/mannitol-P exchange reaction. Since the heterodimer also catalyzes this reaction, it appears that only one functional B domain is required per dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1572857841,"Based on work of Post et al. (Post, R. L. Toda, G., and Rogers, F.N. (1975) J. Biol, Chem. 250, 691-701), we studied the E2 form reactivity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) during Na(+)-ATPase turnover by following ATP hydrolysis with and without P(i) and enzyme phosphorylation from P(i) at 20 degrees C. For theoretical calculations we employed the Albers-Post scheme assuming that, even with no K+, E2 exhibits the ATP regulatory site. Using available rate constants the model predicts: (i) without P(i), Na(+)-ATPase displays a single high affinity ATP site but becomes double Michaelian (with high and low ATP affinity) when P(i) is present. (ii) Phosphorylation from P(i) can be detected during Na(+)-ATPase (t 1/2 about 400 ms); the KmP(i) is substantially higher that the KdP(i). (iii) P(i) incorporation is reduced by ATP acting with low affinity; this does not require an increase in the E2-E1 transition rate. (iv) The KmATP of the regulatory site is augmented when [P(i)] increases. The experimental observations, using partially purified pig kidney enzyme, agreed with the predictions. In addition they showed that: (i) extracellular Na+ can prevent P(i) incorporation; this effect is additive with that of ATP but with independent Ki values. (ii) Mg2+ stimulates P(i) incorporation with low affinity (Km of 1.5 mM). (iii) beta, gamma-Methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate and palmitoyl-CoA antagonize P(i) inhibition of Na(+)-ATPase. These results agree with a model where the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)-ATPase cycles share most of their intermediate steps and enzyme conformations."

Pro-1 mRNAs are expressed almost exclusively in the promastigote or insect stage of the parasite life cycle. The Pro-1 tandem repeat encodes two isoforms of the putative transporter, iso-1 and iso-2, which have identical predicted amino acid sequences except for their NH2-terminal hydrophilic domains. We have now expressed both iso-1 and iso-2 by microinjecting their RNAs into Xenopus oocytes and assaying these oocytes for transport of various radiolabeled ligands. Both iso-1 and iso-2 transport [3H]2-deoxy-D-glucose, confirming that each protein is a bona fide glucose transporter. Each isoform also transports fructose and, to a much lesser degree, mannose. Compounds which inhibit 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in L. enriettii promastigotes also inhibit transport in the microinjected oocytes expressing each isoform, indicating that the substrate specificities and pharmacological properties of each isoform are similar to those measured for 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in intact parasites. The Km for transport of 2-deoxyglucose in oocytes expressing iso-1 is similar to that for oocytes expressing iso-2. These results reveal that both transporter isoforms have closely related functional properties and that the difference in their structures may serve some other purpose such as differential subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W1520693192,"Cations like Mg2+ play an important role in the catalytic mechanism of F1-ATPases. In this study we applied ESR spectroscopy and used the ATP analog 2-azido-2',3'-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid ester)ATP (2-N3-SL-ATP) to investigate the effects of Mg2+ ions on the structure of the nucleotide binding sites of F1-ATPases from beef heart mitochondria (MF1) and from the thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF1). The results demonstrated that Mg2+ ions not only influenced the binding of the nucleotide analogs to F1 but also altered the structure and geometry of the nucleotide binding sites. We observed that the dipolar interactions that are indicative of the close proximity of enzyme-bound 2-N3-SL-ANP (Vogel, P.D., Nett, J.H., Sauer, H.E., Schmadel, K., Cross, R.L., and Trommer, W.E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11982-11986) were only detectable in MF1-ATPase when the enzyme was preincubated with Mg2+ ions. In the absence of Mg2+, the enzyme exhibited ESR spectra indicative of spin label bound in at least two different environments (binding sites) with no dipolar interactions visible. TF1-ATPase did not exhibit clear dipolar interactions in the presence or absence of Mg2+. The ESR spectra of TF1 in the absence of Mg2+ indicated two different environments of the spin labels. Subsequent addition of Mg2+, however, led to exactly the same spectra as if the enzyme was incubated with the ions, indicating a rearrangement of the nucleotide binding sites. In summary, clear differences in the structures of the nucleotide binding sites of MF1 and TF1 in the presence or absence of Mg2+ were observed. Conformational differences between F1-bound spin-labeled nucleotides were also observed between TF1- and MF1-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1563684343,"Apamin, a peptide neurotoxin from bee venom, blocks small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in central synapses and peripheral tissues. Using 125I-apamin, single classes of high affinity binding sites (Kd 1-3 pM) were identified on plasma membranes from rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and bovine brain and from rabbit, guinea pig, and bovine liver. Binding was sensitive to scyllatoxin, dequalinium, gallamine, and d-tubocurarine but not to charybdotoxin, toxin I, or mast cell degranulating peptide. In contrast, saturable binding of 125I-apamin to rat liver plasma membranes was virtually undetectable, thereby providing a correlation with the ability to measure apamin-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated potassium currents in rabbit and guinea pig hepatocytes but not in rat hepatocytes. In agreement with membrane binding studies, homobifunctional cross-linkers identified apparently identical 33-kDa 125I-apamin binding polypeptides on brain plasma membranes from all species and analogous but distinct polypeptides on plasma membranes from rabbit, guinea pig, and bovine liver. None of these affinity-labeled polypeptides were detectable on plasma membranes from rat liver. Affinity labeling was abolished on both liver and brain membranes by apamin, scyllatoxin, dequalinium, gallamine, and d-tubocurarine. These results indicate that comparable approximately 30-kDa polypeptides may fulfill equivalent functional roles within putative subtypes of apamin-sensitive small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1483373078,"ATP may play an important role in the regulation of Cl- secretion in epithelial cells. Previous studies have suggested that ATP may regulate Cl- secretion in at least two ways. First, cytoplasmic ATP is required for the opening of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels. Thus, an increase in metabolic activity associated with cAMP-stimulated Cl-secretion might decrease cellular levels of ATP, thereby decreasing the activity of CFTR Cl- channels. Second, cAMP-dependent opening of CFTR channels might allow the efflux of ATP through the channels into the mucosal solution. An increase in extracellular ATP could in turn activate apical membrane receptors that stimulate other Cl- channels. We tested the hypothesis that acute stimulation of Cl- secretion would produce changes in cell ATP concentration and/or in ATP concentration in the mucosal fluid. We found that in an intestinal epithelial cell line (T84) and in primary cultures of airway epithelia, cAMP-dependent stimulation of Cl- secretion did not alter cell ATP content. Moreover, cAMP agonists did not increase the ATP or nucleotide content of the mucosal fluid. In contrast, when 3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing CFTR were stimulated with cAMP agonists, cell ATP levels decreased. In addition, 3T3 cells appear to have a pathway that allows leakage of ATP into the extracellular fluid; this pathway is not affected by the presence or activation of CFTR. We interpret the data to suggest that changes in intracellular ATP probably do not regulate CFTR in Cl- -secreting epithelia under physiologic conditions and that secretion of ATP probably plays a minor role in control of transepithelial Cl-transport."
https://openalex.org/W1576067831,"The bovine A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) and rat A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) display distinct agonist and antagonist binding properties. To identify regions involved in ligand recognition, A1AR/A3AR chimeric receptors were created, expressed in COS-7 cells, and analyzed by radioligand binding. A chimeric receptor in which the third intracellular loop of the A1AR was replaced with that of the A3AR bound agonists and the antagonist, [3H]xanthine amine congener, with affinities identical to wild-type A1AR. A chimeric receptor with the fifth transmembrane domain (TM5) and third intracellular loop of the A1AR replaced with that of the A3AR displayed antagonist affinity similar to wild-type A1AR. However, relative to the A1AR, this chimeric demonstrated much greater affinity for 5'-substituted adenosine analogs, whereas affinity for N6-substituted compounds was unaffected. Substitution of a 6-amino acid cassette of the exofacial half of TM5 of the A3AR into the A1AR produced enhanced binding of exclusively a 5'-substituted analog, indicating involvement of this specific region in ligand recognition. These findings suggest that the 5'- and N6-substituents of adenosine agonists bind to distinct regions of ARs and that TM5 of the A3AR interacts more favorably with 5'-substituted compounds than does that of the A1AR."
https://openalex.org/W1483752684,"The beta subunits of mammalian glycoprotein hormones contain 20 invariant amino acid residues, including 12 Cys residues that form six disulfide bonds, as well as other highly conserved residues. Such stringent conservation suggests an important role for those residues in chain folding, holoprotein formation, or receptor binding/activation, but not receptor specificity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have prepared and characterized replacements of 14 conserved non-Cys residues in human choriogonadotropin beta for which there is little, if any, information available: Pro7, Thr32, Tyr37, Thr40, Val56, Tyr59, Phe64, Pro70, Gly71, Ser81, Tyr82, Val84, Ala85, and Ser87. The cDNAs were subcloned into a pRSV mammalian expression vector and transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a stably integrated gene for bovine alpha. Holoprotein formation was assessed by radioimmunoassays, and in vitro competitive binding and steroidogenic assays were used to determine potencies. Our results demonstrated that Tyr37, Thr40, Tyr59, and Ala85 participate directly or indirectly in holoprotein formation, as may Ser81. Replacements of the other conserved amino acid residues resulted in no significant change in subunit assembly or receptor binding/activation as measured, although an Arg at position 81 or 82 reduced secretion. This study has identified several amino acid residues of the beta subunit that are important in alpha binding and has raised interesting questions on the constraints that maintain conservation of amino acid residues during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1586953142,"Here we report the large scale isolation and characterization of a species, designated MoFe cluster, that exhibits an S = 3/2 EPR signal, and the comparison of this entity to isolated FeMo cofactor in N-methylformamide and to the active site of the enzyme nitrogenase. MoFe cluster is isolated from purified nitrogenase by extraction into acidic methyl ethyl ketone and it is stable in that solvent in the absence of thiols. As initially isolated, MoFe cluster solutions exhibit an S = 1/2 EPR signal that arises from an oxidized species that can be reduced by dithionite or thiols to an EPR silent state and then to a state that exhibits an S = 3/2 EPR signal. The S = 3/2 signal is as sharp as the signal exhibited by the protein and much sharper than the signal exhibited by isolated FeMo cofactor. Circular dichroism experiments indicate that unlike the last two species, MoFe cluster does not contain the endogenous ligand R-homocitrate and thus, the sharpness of the S = 3/2 signal is an intrinsic property of the metal center and does not depend upon specific interactions with this organic ligand or with the protein. Metal analyses indicate that the metal core responsible for the S = 3/2 signal contains 6 Fe atoms per molybdenum. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments show that although the molybdenum atom in MoFe cluster retains its pseudo-octahedral geometry, its first coordination shell has one less iron atom than that of FeMo cofactor and there has been a significant change in the long range order of the cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1568336365,"Follipsin, an enzyme that accumulates in the follicular fluid of porcine ovaries during follicular maturation, was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme consists of two different polypeptide chains having M(r) = 45,000 and 32,000 each, associated covalently. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, benzamidine, leupeptin, and antipain, indicating that follipsin is a serine proteinase. Using synthetic peptide substrates containing 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, follipsin was shown to preferentially hydrolyze Arg-X bonds but not Lys-X bonds. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the 45- and 32-kDa polypeptides were highly homologous with those of the heavy and light chains, respectively, of human plasma kallikrein and human factor XIa. Immunological analyses and substrate specificity studies, together with other existing evidence, indicated that follipsin is distinct from kallikrein and factor XIa, thus being a novel type of serine proteinase. Follipsin is immunohistochemically localized in follicular fluid as well as in stroma cells of porcine ovaries. The results strongly suggest that follipsin originates from interstitial cells of the ovarian stroma."
https://openalex.org/W1581603143,"The protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) are potent inhibitors of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In this study, the interaction between Phe10 of PKI and the C subunit residues Tyr235 and Phe239 was investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. Previous peptide studies as well as the crystal structure suggested that these residues may play a key role in C-PKI binding. The C subunit codons for Tyr235 and Phe239 were changed singly and in combination to serine codons. The mutated C alpha proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified C alpha Y235S, C alpha F239S, and C alpha Y235S/F239S proteins did not exhibit any differences in their Km(app) for the peptide substrate Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) or Vmax(app), with respect to wild-type C alpha. All of the C subunit mutants displayed less than 2-fold changes in their Km(app) for ATP. The PKI alpha isoform displayed increased IC50 values for C alpha Y235S (71-fold), C alpha F239S (150-fold), and C alpha Y235S/F239S (1800-fold). Similarly, the PKI beta 1 protein showed increased IC50 values against the C alpha Y235S, C alpha F239S, and C alpha Y235S/F239S proteins, 9.4-, 11-, and 44-fold, respectively. In addition, the PKI alpha F10 codon was altered to an alanine codon, and this mutation decreased its ability to inhibit C alpha kinase activity, but did not affect its ability to inhibit C alpha Y235S/F239S. The mutation of Tyr235 and Phe239 to serines, however, did not alter the ability of the type II R subunit to inhibit phosphotransferase activity. These results suggest that C alpha Y235 and C alpha F239 are important for specific inhibition by both PKI alpha and PKI beta but not the type II R subunit and that mutations at these residues would be useful for in vivo analysis of C-PKI interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1550125332,"Abstract The effect of sequential stimulation of different inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3)-linked receptors on the functioning of intracellular Ca2+ stores was evaluated in single LAN-1 human neuroblastoma cells by means of fura-2 microfluorimetry. Homologous restimulation both in the absence and in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ with endothelin-1 (ET-1), Lys-bradykinin (BK), and ATP did not elicit an intracellular Ca2+ increase, whereas a [Ca2+]i elevation after carbachol (CCh) re-exposure was obtained only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Since thapsigargin and ionomycin, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, were still able to release Ca2+ after ET-1, BK, and ATP but not after CCh, it can be argued that in the first case the stores were not completely depleted. This evidence was also confirmed by the fact that LAN-1 cells, sequentially exposed in different order to ET-1, BK, ATP, and upon extracellular Ca2+ removal, showed an increase of [Ca2+]i although progressively reduced in magnitude. By contrast, when CCh was perfused as the first agonist, it completely precluded any further Ca2+ mobilization by the other three agonists. In addition, the lack of potentiation of the Ca2+ response when BK and ET-1 were superfused together and the potentiation of Ca2+ response elicited by ET-1 after BK, when the plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pathways were blocked by lanthanum during the first agonist exposure, indicated that LAN-1 cells can recycle cytoplasmic Ca2+ when exposed to ET-1, BK, ATP but not when exposed to CCh. This inhibitory effect of CCh (perfused for 90 s) on Ca2+ refilling was strictly dependent on the time of receptor occupancy since the exposure to CCh for a shorter period (15 s) produced the same effect on Ca2+ refilling when ET-1, BK, and ATP were perfused, as first agonist, for 90 s. Furthermore, the entity of Ca2+ refilling after 15 s of BK receptor occupancy was similar to that observed after 90 s. This seems to suggest that the receptors for ET-1, BK, and ATP maintain the transductional mechanisms in an activated state for a time shorter than the time of receptor occupancy. This was confirmed by the fact that IP3 levels during a 90-s BK exposure fell to prestimulated value within 30 s, whereas after CCh they reached a sustained plateau phase, after the peak."
