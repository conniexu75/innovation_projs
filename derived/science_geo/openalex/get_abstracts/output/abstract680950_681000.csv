We show that a high-fat diet (HFD) reduces the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) genes in intestinal epithelial cells, including ISCs. This decline in epithelial MHC class II expression in a HFD correlates with reduced intestinal microbiome diversity. Microbial community transfer experiments suggest that epithelial MHC class II expression is regulated by intestinal flora. Mechanistically, pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling regulates epithelial MHC class II expression. MHC class II-negative (MHC-II−) ISCs exhibit greater tumor-initiating capacity than their MHC class II-positive (MHC-II+) counterparts upon loss of the tumor suppressor Apc coupled with a HFD, suggesting a role for epithelial MHC class II-mediated immune surveillance in suppressing tumorigenesis. ISC-specific genetic ablation of MHC class II increases tumor burden cell autonomously. Thus, HFD perturbs a microbiome-stem cell-immune cell interaction that contributes to tumor initiation in the intestine.

Diet is a major lifestyle factor that influences health and disease states, including cancer (Beyaz and Yilmaz, 2016Beyaz S. Yilmaz O.H.

Significant epidemiologic and preclinical studies link long-term dietary patterns such as western diets and obesity to several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. However, how the adaptation of the intestinal epithelium to pro-obesity diets alters cancer risk remains elusive (Basen-Engquist and Chang, 2011Basen-Engquist K. Chang M.

The intestinal epithelium is maintained by Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside at the crypt base and give rise to the diverse, specialized cell types of the intestinal lining (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

These rapidly renewing ISCs coordinate intestinal adaptation in response to environmental inputs such as diet by balancing stem cell self-renewal with differentiation divisions (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S.

ISCs are also the cells of origin for many early intestinal tumors and lie at the interface of dietary nutrients, commensal microbes, and immune cells. Thus, understanding how diet induces changes in ISCs and their surrounding components may shed light on the early steps involved in initiation of colorectal cancers (Barker et al., 2009Barker N.

Diet contributes to colorectal cancer risk through diverse cancer-cell-intrinsic and cancer-cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates that pro-obesity or western diets enhance intestinal tumorigenesis in many ways, such as through activation of lipid-sensing PPAR transcription factors (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S.

Pommerenke C. et al.High-fat-diet-mediated dysbiosis promotes intestinal carcinogenesis independently of obesity.Nature. 2014; 514: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the role that immune cells play in this process is unclear. Because interactions between the cancer cells and the immune system influence tumor initiation and progression, it is important to understand the crosstalk between tumor-initiating ISCs and immune cells. Recognition of antigens by T cells through antigen presentation pathways is a major mechanism for triggering anti-tumor immunity (Sade-Feldman et al., 2017Sade-Feldman M. Jiao Y.J. Chen J.H.

Although major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) antigen presentation pathway-mediated activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells plays a major role in anti-tumor immune responses, MHC class II-mediated activation of CD4+ T cells is also pivotal for tumor immunity. CD4+ T cells can help in the maintenance of CD8+ T cell responses and produce cytokines that shape the overall response against the tumor (Haabeth et al., 2016Haabeth O.A. Tveita A. Fauskanger M.

To explore how a high-fat diet (HFD) perturbs immunomodulatory gene expression in ISCs, we examined our previous mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) dataset of Lgr5+ ISCs isolated from control and HFD-fed mice (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S. Mana M.D. Roper J. Kedrin D. Saadatpour A. Hong S.J. Bauer-Rowe K.E. Xifaras M.E. Akkad A. Arias E. et al.High-fat diet enhances stemness and tumorigenicity of intestinal progenitors.Nature. 2016; 531: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We found that Lgr5+ ISCs derived from HFD-fed mice significantly downregulate immunomodulatory genes that are involved in the MHC class II pathway (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, and Ciita), anti-microbial response/inflammation (Reg3g and Nfkb2), and costimulation (Icosl, Sectm1a, and Sectm1b) (Choi et al., 2011Choi N.M.

Mana M. Mendez-Lago M. Hernando-Momblona X. Sevillano M. Guillaumet-Adkins A. Rodriguez-Esteban G. Buczacki S.J.A.

Consistent with the bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles, H2-Ab1, a key component of the MHC class II complex, was among the top 5 differentially expressed genes, with >3-fold higher expression in control compared with HFD ISCs (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C; see STAR Methods) (Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics [MAST] test, p < 1e−10). To determine the extent of MHC class II downregulation in response to HFD in our scRNA-seq data, we ranked individual ISCs based on their expression pattern of MHC class II pathway genes (MHC class II score) (Table S1) and found that HFD Lgr5+ ISCs had a consistently lower MHC class II score compared with control Lgr5+ ISCs (Figure 1C). We then selected the upper and lower quartiles in scRNA-seq data and performed differential expression analysis between MHC class II-low and MHC class II-high HFD Lgr5+ ISCs. As expected, MHC class II pathway genes (H2-Ab1, Cd74, H2-Aa, and H2-DMa) were among the top upregulated genes in MHC class II-high cells (Figure 1D). Although MHC class II expression and function are generally considered restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells, several studies have demonstrated that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) express high levels of MHC class II and are able to capture, process, and present antigens to CD4+ T cells; this includes work from our group on ISCs (Biton et al., 2018Biton M.

We validated the reduction of MHC II expression on IECs and Lgr5+ ISCs under a HFD in several ways. In situ hybridization for H2-Ab1 showed that MHC class II is expressed in the epithelium of control mice but has diminished expression throughout the epithelium of HFD mice, including in the intestinal crypt where ISCs reside (Figure 1E). Moreover, by flow cytometry, both Epcam+ IECs (Figures 1F and 1G) and Lgr5+ ISCs (Figures 1I and 1J) expressed high levels of MHC class II protein on their cell surface at steady state, and this expression was significantly downregulated in response to a HFD. Finally, we confirmed that sorted Epcam+ IECs (Figure 1H) and Lgr5+ ISCs (Figure 1K) from HFD-fed mice significantly downregulated MHC class II expression by qPCR. We then partitioned Lgr5+ ISCs into two subpopulations based on their MHC class II expression pattern, MHC class II-positive (MHC-II+) and MHC class II-negative (MHC-II−), and assessed their frequencies in control or HFD-fed mice. Although in control mice most Lgr5+ ISCs were MHC-II+, a HFD led to a significant reduction in the frequency of MHC-II+ Lgr5+ ISCs and to a concomitant increase in the frequency of MHC-II− Lgr5+ ISCs (Figures 1L and 1M). We sorted these ISC subpopulations to confirm MHC class II expression levels. Consistent with our scRNA-seq analysis, the expression levels of H2-Ab1 mRNA were significantly reduced in response to HFD (Figure S1D). Altogether, these results indicate that HFD leads to suppression of MHC class II expression in Epcam+ IECs, including Lgr5+ ISCs. A HFD perturbs multiple epithelial-intrinsic and epithelial-extrinsic pathways that may influence the regulation of MHC class II expression in ISCs (Fu et al., 2019aFu T. Coulter S. Yoshihara E. Oh T.G. Fang S. Cayabyab F. Zhu Q. Zhang T. Leblanc M.

Pommerenke C. et al.High-fat-diet-mediated dysbiosis promotes intestinal carcinogenesis independently of obesity.Nature. 2014; 514: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because our prior findings demonstrated that a PPAR-δ program mediates many effects of a HFD in Lgr5+ ISCs (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S. Mana M.D. Roper J. Kedrin D. Saadatpour A. Hong S.J. Bauer-Rowe K.E. Xifaras M.E. Akkad A.

Mana M.D. Yilmaz O.H. High-fat diet activates a PPAR-δ program to enhance intestinal stem cell function.Cell Stem Cell. 2021; 28: 598-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next assessed the activation status of a PPAR-δ program in Lgr5+ ISCs based on their MHC class II expression pattern in response to a HFD. We found no difference in the expression levels of PPAR-δ-induced signature genes Hmgcs2 and Jag1 or the stem cell marker Lgr5 in MHC-II+ and MHC-II− ISCs in either cohort (Figure S1E). Interestingly, agonist-induced PPAR-δ activation with GW501516 also did not reduce MHC class II expression in Lgr5+ ISCs, indicating that HFD-induced MHC class II downregulation is independent of PPAR-δ activity in ISCs (Figures S1I and S1J). To determine whether MHC class II expression in Lgr5+ ISCs is reduced in an independent model of obesity, we examined leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice, an obesity model that develops on a control diet (Coleman, 1978Coleman D.L. Obese and diabetes: two mutant genes causing diabetes-obesity syndromes in mice.Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 141-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (Figure S1H). Lgr5+ ISCs isolated from both lean control (db/+) and obese (db/db) mice expressed high levels of MHC class II, indicating that diet-induced alterations, rather than obesity per se, inhibit MHC class II expression in ISCs (Figures S1K and S1L). We next assessed whether HFD-mediated downregulation of MHC class II affects stemness. First, we assayed the functional potential of MHC-II+ and MHC-II− ISCs, using an in vitro approach based on the ability of isolated Lgr5+ ISCs to form organoid bodies in 3D culture (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S. Mana M.D. Roper J. Kedrin D. Saadatpour A. Hong S.J. Bauer-Rowe K.E. Xifaras M.E. Akkad A.

Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3431) Google Scholar). We found that MHC class II expression levels in control and HFD Lgr5+ ISCs did not affect in vitro organoid formation (Figure S1F). To further ascertain whether MHC class II expression regulates ISC function, we generated mice with intestinal epithelium-specific MHC class II deletion (vil-iKO; see STAR Methods). Intestine-specific loss of MHC class II did not affect the weight and length of the small intestine or affect crypt depth and villi height (Figures S2A–S2G). Furthermore, the proliferation or organoid-forming capacity of ISCs was unaltered upon loss of MHC class II in the intestinal epithelium (Figures 2A–2F). To assess how MHC class II regulates ISC function specifically, we ablated MHC class II in Lgr5+ ISCs (Lgr5-iKO; Figure S2H; see STAR Methods) and found that loss of MHC class II in Lgr5+ ISCs and their progenies did not affect the capacity of ISCs to initiate organoids (Figures 2G and 2H). To determine how MHC class II influences Lgr5+ ISC function in vivo, we performed LacZ lineage-tracing analysis and did not detect differences in the generation of LacZ+ cells between wild-type (WT) and Lgr5-iKO mice (Figure S2I). Although these data illustrate that the in vitro organoid-forming capacity of Lgr5+ ISCs is independent of MHC class II expression and that MHC class II loss does not alter intestinal homeostasis and ISC output (i.e., LacZ+ progeny) at steady state, MHC class II likely influences ISC differentiation by engaging T helper cell cytokines in the context of inflammation, as we have previously reported (Biton et al., 2018Biton M.

Because dietary perturbations are among the major external factors shaping the intestinal microbiome, we asked whether HFD-induced alterations in the microbiome influence MHC class II expression in IECs and ISCs. To determine whether the microbiome is involved in regulation of epithelial MHC class II levels, we treated mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which ablated bacterial diversity and massively altered community composition (Figure S2J). Similar to a HFD, antibiotic treatment was accompanied by decreased MHC class II expression in Lgr5+ ISCs and the intestinal epithelium (Figures 3A and 3B ) comparable with that observed in HFD. To corroborate the role of the intestinal microbiome on MHC class II expression on ISCs, we generated germ-free Lgr5-GFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice. Lgr5+ ISCs from germ-free mice exhibited reduced MHC class II expression at both RNA and protein levels compared with specific pathogen-free control mice (Figures 3C–3F, S2J, and S2K). To gain insight into the spectrum of members of the bacterial microbiome capable of inducing epithelial MHC class II expression, we performed comparative 16S rDNA sequencing in fecal DNA isolated from HFD-treated mice and controls. Consistent with previous reports, HFD-induced obesity led to microbial dysbiosis with reduced bacterial diversity in the feces (Figures 3G and S2J) (Ley et al., 2005Ley R.E. Bäckhed F. Turnbaugh P.

Among the bacterial genera strongly diminished under HFD conditions was Helicobacter (Figure 3H). To determine whether Helicobacter colonization in mice correlates with epithelial MHC class II expression in the intestine, we surveyed our mouse facility for presence or absence of Helicobacter species in mice housed in different rooms. We created two separate rooms with mice either naturally colonized with Helicobacter species (H+, dirty room) or without detectable Helicobacter species (H−, clean room) (Figure 4A). Helicobacter species that naturally colonize mice in the H+ room and are absent from the H− room include Helicobacter mastomyrinus and Helicobacter typhlonius (Table S2). Interestingly, MHC class II expression was significantly higher in the intestinal epithelium of mice that are housed in the H+ room compared with the mice housed in the H− room (Figure 4B).

https://openalex.org/W3121336634,"This work introduces a novel epidemiological model that simultaneously considers multiple viral strains, reinfections due to waning immunity response over time and an optimal control formulation. This enables us to derive optimal mitigation strategies over a prescribed time horizon under a more realistic framework that does not imply perennial immunity and a single strain, although these can also be derived as particular cases of our formulation. The model also allows estimation of the number of infections over time in the absence of mitigation strategies under any number of viral strains. We validate our approach in the light of the COVID-19 epidemic and present a number of experiments to shed light on the overall behaviour under one or two strains in the absence of sufficient mitigation measures. We also derive optimal control strategies for distinct mitigation costs and evaluate the effect of these costs on the optimal mitigation measures over a two-year horizon. The results show that relaxations in the mitigation measures cause a rapid increase in the number of cases, which then demand more restrictive measures in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3200155323,"Background The prominence of telemental health, including providing care by video call and telephone, has greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are clear variations in uptake and acceptability, and concerns that digital exclusion may exacerbate previous inequalities in access to good quality care. Greater understanding is needed of how service users experience telemental health, and what determines whether they engage and find it acceptable. Methods We conducted a collaborative framework analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with a sample of people already experiencing mental health problems prior to the pandemic. Data relevant to participants’ experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic were identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where researchers with relevant lived experience, contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings alongside clinical and academic researchers. Findings The experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care of the forty-four participants were dynamic and varied across time and settings, as well as between individuals. Participants’ preferences were shaped by reasons for contacting services, their relationship with care providers, and both parties’ access to technology and their individual preferences. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important challenges related to safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies they had experienced, including services scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools. Discussion Participants in our study have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations that risk hindering mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences. Further research is needed on ways of minimising digital exclusion and of supporting staff in making effective and collaborative use of relevant technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3199239897,"Background The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and quickly spread to the rest of the world. This study aimed to analyse the associations between the COVID-19 mortality rate in hospitals, the availability of health services, and socio-spatial and health risk factors at department level. Methods and findings This spatial cross-sectional study used cumulative mortality data due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospitals until 30 November 2020 as a main outcome, across 96 departments of mainland France. Data concerning health services, health risk factors, and socio-spatial factors were used as independent variables. Independently, we performed negative binomial, spatial and geographically weighted regression models. Our results revealed substantial geographic disparities. The spatial exploratory analysis showed a global positive spatial autocorrelation in each wave indicating a spatial dependence of the COVID-19 deaths across departments. In first wave about 75% of COVID-19 deaths were concentrated in departments of five regions compared to a total of 13 regions. The COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with the physicians density, and not the number of resuscitation beds. Socio-spatial factors were only associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate in first wave compared to wave 2. For example, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 35.69% for departments densely populated. Health risk factors were associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate depending on each wave. This study had inherent limitations to the ecological analysis as ecological bias risks and lack of individual data. Conclusions Our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has spread more rapidly and takes more severe forms in environments where there is already a high level of vulnerability due to social and health factors. This study showed a different dissemination pattern of COVID-19 mortality between the two waves: a spatial non-stationarity followed by a spatial stationarity in the relationships between the COVID-19 mortality rate and its potential drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3201547235,"To solve the problem of one-sided pursuit of the shortest distance but ignoring the tourist experience in the process of tourism route planning, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed for tourism route planning. Contextual information of scenic spots significantly effect people's choice of tourism destination, so the pheromone update strategy is combined with the contextual information such as weather and comfort degree of the scenic spot in the process of searching the global optimal route, so that the pheromone update tends to the path suitable for tourists. At the same time, in order to avoid falling into local optimization, the sub-path support degree is introduced. The experimental results show that the optimized tourism route has greatly improved the tourist experience, the route distance is shortened by 20.5% and the convergence speed is increased by 21.2% compared with the basic algorithm, which proves that the improved algorithm is notably effective."
https://openalex.org/W3201287276,"Bacterial signaling histidine kinases (HKs) have long been postulated to function exclusively through linear signal transduction chains. However, several HKs have recently been shown to form complex multikinase networks (MKNs). The most prominent MKN, involving the enzymes RetS and GacS, controls the switch between the motile and biofilm lifestyles in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While GacS promotes biofilm formation, RetS counteracts GacS using three distinct mechanisms. Two are dephosphorylating mechanisms. The third, a direct binding between the RetS and GacS HK regions, blocks GacS autophosphorylation. Focusing on the third mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of a cocomplex between the HK region of RetS and the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain of GacS. This is the first reported structure of a complex between two distinct bacterial signaling HKs. In the complex, the canonical HK homodimerization interface is replaced by a strikingly similar heterodimeric interface between RetS and GacS. We further demonstrate that GacS autophosphorylates in trans, thus explaining why the formation of a RetS-GacS complex inhibits GacS autophosphorylation. Using mutational analysis in conjunction with bacterial two-hybrid and biofilm assays, we not only corroborate the biological role of the observed RetS-GacS interactions, but also identify a residue critical for the equilibrium between the RetS-GacS complex and the respective RetS and GacS homodimers. Collectively, our findings suggest that RetS and GacS form a domain-swapped hetero-oligomer during the planktonic growth phase of P. aeruginosa before unknown signals cause its dissociation and a relief of GacS inhibition to promote biofilm formation.

Sensor histidine kinase (HK)-linked signal transduction systems are the primary means whereby bacteria sense extracellular signals to shape an adaptive response (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L.

Molecular mechanisms of two-component signal transduction.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 3752-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The classic two-component signaling system consists of autophosphorylation of the HK followed by phosphate transfer to a cognate response regulator (RR). In the closely related phosphorelay systems, there are two additional transfer steps. Here, the phosphate moves from the HK region to a receiver domain with no coupled output domain, then to a histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) protein, and from there finally to an RR (4Rodrigue A. Quentin Y. Lazdunski A. Méjean V. Foglino M.

Histidine kinases and response regulator proteins in two-component signaling systems.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Hybrid signaling HKs contain a sensory domain, HK region, a receiver domain, and an HPt domain within a single polypeptide chain (5Buschiazzo A. Trajtenberg F. Two-component sensing and regulation: How do histidine kinases talk with response regulators at the molecular level?.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73: 507-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the tethering of the HK region to the receiver domain confers specificity to the associated phosphotransfer step, the otherwise stringent evolutionary requirement for HK-RR complementarity is more relaxed in hybrid HKs (7Capra E.J. Perchuk B.S. Ashenberg O. Seid C.A. Snow H.R. Skerker J.M. Laub M.T. Spatial tethering of kinases to their substrates relaxes evolutionary constraints on specificity.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross talk between distinct phosphorelay chains was long thought to be undesirable and therefore forbidden (8Capra E.J.

Determinants of specificity in two-component signal transduction.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence suggests the presence of intricately webbed multikinase networks (MKNs) (11Francis V.I. Waters E.M. Finton-James S.E. Gori A. Kadioglu A. Brown A.R. Porter S.L. Multiple communication mechanisms between sensor kinases are crucial for virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Nat. Commun. 2018; 92219Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At this point, we have gained a reasonably clear understanding of how the linear phosphotransfer events are facilitated within a single relay, and we have only a cursory understanding of how such cross talk occurs and is regulated. To date, the best studied example of interactions within an MKN is perhaps the multilayered interplay between the HK family enzymes RetS and GacS in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hybrid HK GacS and its cognate RR GacA sit at the heart of the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway (12Goodman A.L. Merighi M. Hyodo M. Ventre I. Filloux A. Lory S. Direct interaction between sensor kinase proteins mediates acute and chronic disease phenotypes in a bacterial pathogen.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This pathway allows P. aeruginosa to switch between a motile, invasive lifestyle—which causes an acute infection in a human host—and a sessile, biofilm-associated lifestyle—which often results in a chronic infection in a human host (13Goodman A.L.

Once phosphorylated, GacA acts as a transcriptional activator, indirectly upregulating genes associated with the sessile biofilm lifestyle (15Bordi C. Lamy M.C. Ventre I. Termine E. Hachani A.

Conversely, GacA indirectly downregulates genes associated with a motile, invasive lifestyle, such as the expression of flagella-mediated motility-related genes and Type Three Secretion System–related genes necessary for producing the observed cytotoxic effects in an acute infection (15Bordi C.

Kadioglu A. Brown A.R. Porter S.L. Multiple communication mechanisms between sensor kinases are crucial for virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Nat.

Mutational analysis of RetS, an unusual sensor kinase-response regulator hybrid required for Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4462-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RetS has an unusual architecture consisting of a periplasmic sensor domain, an HK region, and two receiver domains. RetS uses its HK region and C-terminal receiver domain to siphon phosphate groups from the receiver and DHp domains of GacS, respectively (11Francis V.I. Waters E.M. Finton-James S.E. Gori A.

Mediated by direct interactions between the HK regions of the two enzymes, RetS also interferes with the initial autophosphorylation of GacS (11Francis V.I. Waters E.M. Finton-James S.E. Gori A.

This mode of inhibition is not well understood and is the focus of the present study. Initial models suggested that RetS might form a heterodimeric complex with GacS (12Goodman A.L. Merighi M. Hyodo M. Ventre I. Filloux A. Lory S. Direct interaction between sensor kinase proteins mediates acute and chronic disease phenotypes in a bacterial pathogen.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, our recent work demonstrated that the GacS dimer remains intact upon RetS binding (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting the formation of a larger heteromeric assembly, perhaps a tetramer (21Mancl J.M.

Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the same study we also demonstrated that a structurally dynamic region of the RetS DHp domain is important for GacS binding and might be involved in regulating the interaction. In the present study, we report the crystal structure of a complex between the RetS HK region and the GacS DHp domain. The RetS-GacS interface closely resembles the canonical interface in homodimeric enzymes. Consistent with the proposed role of helix cracking in the regulation of the interaction, the structurally dynamic helix of RetS DHp is fully formed and involved in GacS binding. We experimentally determined that GacS autophosphorylates in trans. Thus, the RetSHK-GacSDHp structure also answers the question how RetS prevents GacS autophosphorylation, because RetS binding disrupts the spatial arrangements needed for trans-autophosphorylation. Cocrystallization of the HK region of RetS (RetSHK, amino acid residues 413–649) and the DHp domain of GacS (GacSDHp, amino acid residues 270–349) yielded crystals that gave X-ray diffraction data up to 2.3 Å resolution using a CC1/2 threshold of 0.3 as cutoff (data collection and structure refinement statistics are provided in Table 1) (22Assmann G. Brehm W. Diederichs K. Identification of rogue datasets in serial crystallography.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2016; 49: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structure was solved via molecular replacement using a single molecule of the previously solved RetSHK dimer as search model (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The complex consists of a 1:1 heterodimer wherein the DHp domain of RetS and GacS forms an extensive interface (Fig. 1). The final model contains residues 414–573, 604–639 of RetS and GacS residues 285–344. RetS residues 413, 574–603, and 640–649 appear to be structurally dynamic in the complex because no electron density was observed for these sections of the molecule. Similarly, there was no interpretable electron density for GacS residues 270–284 and 345–349. RetSHK consists of a CA and a DHp domain. The overall folds of the individual domains mirror those observed in the crystal structure of the RetSHK homodimer (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D.

The RetS-DHp domain assumes the canonical helix-loop-helix fold wherein the conserved histidine residue H424 is located on the α1 helix and solvent-exposed. The RetS-CA domain assumes the expected α/β sandwich fold comprising the α3–α4 helices, the α7 helix, and strands β1–β7. The residues that formed helices α5 and α6 helices in the RetSHK homodimer show no electron density in the RetS-GacS complex (residues 574–603) (Fig. S2). The DHp domain of GacS forms the anticipated helix-loop-helix structure. The conserved catalytic histidine residue H293 is also solvent-exposed.Table 1X-ray diffraction data collection and refinement statisticsX-ray diffraction data statistics Space GroupP 3(1) 2 1 Unit Cell: a, b, c (Å)103.4, 103.4, 62.0 Unit Cell: α, β, γ (º)90, 90, 120 Resolution range (Å)44.76–2.29 (2.37–2.29) Total reflections369,869 (36,066) Unique reflections17,507 (1708) Multiplicity21.1 (21.1) Completeness (%)100 (100) I/σ(I)16.9 (0.4) Rmerge0.147 (13.7) CC1/2 threshold0.3Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)44.76–2.30 Rwork/Rfree0.2475/0.2662 Root mean square bonds (Å)0.004 Root mean square angles (º)0.815 Average B factor (Å2)89.6Outer shell statistics are provided in parentheses.

Four-helix bundle: A ubiquitous sensory module in prokaryotic signal transduction.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 Suppl 3: iii45-iii48PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The same section of RetSHK also partakes in RetS homodimerization or, in the case of GacS, would also be predicted to form the binding surface in a GacS homodimer. Altogether 25 GacS residues corresponding to a surface area of 1351 Å2 and 23 RetS residues that cover 1348 Å2 of surface area form the extensive interface. The 89 nonbonded contacts are largely hydrophobic, containing only four hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2B). In HKs the α1 helix is kinked N-terminal at highly conserved threonine and proline residues. The kinking provides the plasticity needed for autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer, and phosphatase activity (24Bhate M.A.P. Molnar K.A.S. Goulian M. Degrado W.F. Signal transduction in histidine kinases: Insights from new structures.Structure. 2015; 23: 981-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This kink is also observable N-terminal to Thr428 and Pro429 of RetS and N-terminal to Thr297 and Pro298 in GacS (Fig. 3A). The kink angle for GacS is 28.7° and the angle for RetS is 22.8° (Fig. 3A). In the RetSHK homodimer, the corresponding section is unfolded in one molecule and displays a kink angle of 33.3° in the other molecule (Fig. 3). While RetS is not a functional kinase, the kink does play a role in regulating the equilibrium between a domain-swapped RetS-GacS oligomer and the individual homodimers (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K.

Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that this section is critical for GacS binding but not RetS homodimerization and predicted that it would be helical in the heteromeric complex (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consistent with these predictions, the dynamic N-terminal section of RetS α1 helix is now helical and forms part of the interface in the complex with GacS (Fig. 3B). In the RetS-GacS complex, RetSHK assumes a distinct conformation compared to those observed in the RetSHK homodimer. Overall, it closely resembles Chain A (PDB code 6dk7) with an RMSD of 0.359 Å between the DHp domains. Here, the positions of the CA domains are very similar as demonstrated by the 5.3° angle of rotation between the two CA domains (Fig. 4). A larger angle of rotation between the two CA domains of 35.4° accounts for the larger overall RMSD of 1.53 Å between the RetSHK molecule in the RetS-GacS complex and Chain B of the RetSHK homodimer (Fig. 4). Beyond the relative movements of the CA and DHp domains, GacS binding significantly impacts regions that were previously implicated in the regulation of the RetS-GacS interaction. In the RetSHK-GacSDHp complex, residues 574–603 encompassing a section of the molecule containing the so-called ATP lid loop are not structured. In the asymmetric RetSHK homodimer, the ATP lid loop regions assume two distinct but well-defined conformations consisting of a short N-terminal helix and the lid loop (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). The ATP lid loop of other HKs also displays conformational plasticity, such as in the HK from Bacillus subtilis DesK (25Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. De Mendoza D. Buschiazzo A. Structural plasticity and catalysis regulation of a thermosensor histidine kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 16185-16190Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, RetS has lost the ability to bind ATP (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Instead, the lid region from one RetSHK molecule forms a short helix that displaces an unfolded section of α1 helix from the other molecule at the DHp-DHp interface (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The biological significance of these interactions was corroborated in vitro and in vivo (21Mancl J.M. Ray W.K. Helm R.F. Schubot F.D. Helix cracking regulates the critical interaction between RetS and GacS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Structure. 2019; 27: 785-793.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the RetS-GacS complex, the α1 helix of GacS DHp is fully folded, while the lid region is now dislodged from the interface and apparently unstructured. Because RetS binding disrupts the DHp–DHp interface of the GacS dimer, we reasoned, this interaction should interfere with GacS autophosphorylation if GacS actually autophosphorylates in trans. Many HKs autophosphorylate in trans, although some have been demonstrated to autophosphorylate in cis (26Ashenberg O. Keating A.E. Laub M.T. Helix bundle loops determine whether histidine kinases autophosphorylate in cis or in trans.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Casino P. Miguel-Romero L. Marina A. Visualizing autophosphorylation in histidine kinases.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53258Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). BarA, the GacS homolog in Escherichia coli autophosphorylates in trans (28Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Kinoshita E. Eguchi Y. Koike T. Validation of cis and trans modes in multistep phosphotransfer signaling of bacterial tripartite sensor kinases by using phos-tag SDS-pagE.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0148294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The handedness of the loop between the α1 and α2 helices of the DHp domain may also be used to predict whether an HK will autophosphorylate in trans or in cis (26Ashenberg O. Keating A.E. Laub M.T. Helix bundle loops determine whether histidine kinases autophosphorylate in cis or in trans.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given that the GacS homolog autophosphorylates in trans and, in the structure, GacS has a right-handed loop between the α1 and α2 helices of the DHp domain, GacS was predicted to autophosphorylate in trans as well. To test this prediction, an autophosphorylation assay followed by Zn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE was performed (Fig. 5). GacScyt (GacS 219–925) and the GacScyt variants H293A and G472A G474A were examined in the assay. Variation of the conserved HK region histidine residue (H293) to an alanine inhibits GacS autophosphorylation (28Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Kinoshita E. Eguchi Y. Koike T. Validation of cis and trans modes in multistep phosphotransfer signaling of bacterial tripartite sensor kinases by using phos-tag SDS-pagE.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0148294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The variation of conserved G2 box residues G472 and G474 to alanines inhibits the ability of GacScyt to bind ATP. The G2 box is a conserved region in HKs located within the CA domain, which binds ATP (28Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Kinoshita E. Eguchi Y. Koike T. Validation of cis and trans modes in multistep phosphotransfer signaling of bacterial tripartite sensor kinases by using phos-tag SDS-pagE.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0148294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Individual variant constructs (GacScyt H293A and GacScyt G472A G474A) are unable to autophosphorylate in cis, but when both variant constructs are introduced into the autophosphorylation assay, they can autophosphorylate in trans. The observed mobility shift when both GacScyt H293A and GacScyt G272A G474A were present in the autophosphorylation assay demonstrated that GacS autophosphorylates in trans, thus providing evidence supporting the proposed mechanism by which RetS inhibits GacS autophosphorylation (Fig. 5). In order to experimentally corroborate the RetS-GacS interface found in the crystal structure, a number of interface residues were mutated and the variants examined via the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid (BACTH) assay. The DHp domains of RetS and GacS share a 56.9% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1), whereas the entire HK regions of RetS and GacS share 40.4% sequence identity. The high degree of conservation in the DHp domain might explain the overall complementarity of their molecular surfaces. Yet, we also sought to identify distinctive residues that promote the formation of a RetS-GacS complex at the DHp-DHp interface over the formation of the typical homodimers. The interactions of the cytoplasmic region of GacS (GacScyt) with itself and with the cytoplasmic region of RetS (RetScyt) were used as positive controls and reference points (Fig. 6). The GacS homodimer is expected to contain multiple dimerization interfaces including HAMP-HAMP and DHp-DHp domains (29Workentine M.L. Chang L. Ceri H. Turner R.J. The GacS-GacA two-component regulatory system of Pseudomonas fluorescens: A bacterial two-hybrid analysis.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 292: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, the RetS-GacS interactions are expected to be more sensitive to mutations disrupting the interactions between the DHp domains than the more extensively paired GacS homodimer. A complicating factor in this analysis was the observation we made in prior experiments that monomeric RetS and GacS are not stable proteins. A variant that has completely lost the ability to dimerize could either be misfolded or simply be unstable because it can no longer dimerize. Therefore, we were particular"

As the design of electrochemical devices evolve applications for systems with multiple working electrodes have become more common. These applications drive a need for low-cost multi-channel potentiostat systems. We have developed a portable low-cost scalable system with a modular design that can support 8 to 64 channels at a cost as low as \$8 per channel. This design can replace the functionality of commercial potentiostats which cost upwards of \$10k for certain applications. Each channel in the multi-channel potentiostat has an independent adjustable voltage source with a built-in ammeter and switch, making the device flexible for various configurations. The multi-channel potentiostat is designed for low current applications (nA range), but its purpose can change by varying its shunt resistor value. The system can either function as a standalone device or remotely controlled. We demonstrate the functionality of this system for the control of a 24-channel bioelectronic ion pump for open- and closed- loop control of pH."
https://openalex.org/W3199467466,"The preimplantation period of embryonic development can be a key window for programming of postnatal development because extensive epigenetic remodeling occurs during this time. It was hypothesized that modification of one-carbon metabolism of the bovine embryo by addition of the methyl-donor choline to culture medium would change postnatal phenotype through epigenetic modification. Embryos produced in vitro were cultured with 1.8 mM choline chloride or control medium. Blastocysts were transferred into females and pregnancy outcomes and postnatal phenotype of the resultant calves determined. Exposure of embryos to choline increased gestation length and calf birth weight. Calves derived from choline-treated embryos were also heavier at weaning and had increased ratio of body weight to hip height than control calves. Choline altered muscle DNA methylation of calves 4 months after birth. A total of 670 of the 8149 CpG examined were differentially methylated, with the predominant effect of choline being hypomethylation. Among the genes associated with differentially methylated CpG were ribosomal RNAs and genes in AMPK, mTOR, integrin, and BEX2 canonical pathways and cellular functions involved in growth and proliferation. Results demonstrate that provision of the methyl-donor choline to the preimplantation embryo can alter its developmental program to increase gestation length, birth weight, and weaning weight and cause postnatal changes in muscle DNA methylation including those associated with genes related to anabolic processes and cellular growth. The importance of the nutritional status of the embryo with respect to one-carbon metabolism for ensuring health and well-being after birth is emphasized by these observations."

Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate whether or not parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and the type of OSA treatment are associated with COVID-19 severity. Patient data from OSA patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reviewed from outpatients from the Isala Hospital and patients admitted to the Isala Hospital, starting from March until December 2020. Baseline patient data, sleep study parameters, OSA treatment information and hospital admission data were collected. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), low oxyhemoglobin desaturation (LSAT), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), and the type of OSA treatment were regarded as the independent variables. COVID-19 severity-based on hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation days-were regarded as the outcome variables. Multinomial regression analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis were used to assess the association between the parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and COVID-19 severity. A total of 137 patients were included. Only LSAT was found to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 severity (p<0.05) when COVID-19 severity was dichotomized as non-hospitalized or hospitalized and ICU admission or death. Therefore, our findings showed that LSAT seems to be a significant risk factor for COVID-19 severity. However, the degree of OSA-based on AHI, ODI, and RDI-and OSA treatment were not found to be risk factors for COVID-19 severity when looking at hospital or ICU admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation days."
https://openalex.org/W3201138156,"Australia was one of the first countries to introduce government-funded unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, with 88,790 treated since March 2016. However, treatment uptake is declining which could potentially undermine Australia's progress towards the WHO HCV elimination targets. Using mathematical modelling, we updated estimates for those living with chronic HCV in Australia, new cases of decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related mortality among the HCV-cured and viraemic populations from 2015 to 2030. We considered various DAA treatment scenarios incorporating annual treatment numbers to 2020, and subsequent uptake per year of 6,790 (pessimistic), 8,100 (intermediate), and 11,310 (optimistic). We incorporated the effects of excess alcohol consumption and reduction in progression to DC and HCC among cirrhosis-cured versus viraemic individuals. At the end of 2020, we estimated 117,810 Australians were living with chronic HCV. New cases per year of DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality among the HCV viraemic population decreased rapidly from 2015 (almost eliminated by 2030). In contrast, the growing population size of those cured with advanced liver disease meant DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality declined slowly. The estimated reduction in liver-related mortality from 2015 to 2030 in the combined HCV viraemic and cured population is 25% in the intermediate scenario. With declining HCV treatment uptake and ongoing individual-level risk of advanced liver disease complications, including among cirrhosis-cured individuals, Australia is unlikely to achieve all WHO HCV elimination targets by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W3201102469,"Signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (SIRL-1) is a negative regulator of myeloid cell function and dampens antimicrobial responses. We here show that different species of the genus Staphylococcus secrete SIRL-1-engaging factors. By screening a library of single-gene transposon mutants in Staphylococcus aureus, we identified these factors as phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs). PSMs are amphipathic α-helical peptides involved in multiple aspects of staphylococcal virulence and physiology. They are cytotoxic and activate the chemotactic formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on immune cells. Human cathelicidin LL-37 is also an amphipathic α-helical peptide with antimicrobial and chemotactic activities, structurally and functionally similar to α-type PSMs. We demonstrate that α-type PSMs from multiple staphylococcal species as well as human cathelicidin LL-37 activate SIRL-1, suggesting that SIRL-1 recognizes α-helical peptides with an amphipathic arrangement of hydrophobicity, although we were not able to show direct binding to SIRL-1. Upon rational peptide design, we identified artificial peptides in which the capacity to ligate SIRL-1 is segregated from cytotoxic and FPR2-activating properties, allowing specific engagement of SIRL-1. In conclusion, we propose staphylococcal PSMs and human LL-37 as a potential new class of natural ligands for SIRL-1."

Familial hypercholesterolemia can also cause tendinous abnormalities, such as thickening and xanthoma (tendon lipid accumulation) in the Achilles, which may impede tendon biomechanics. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cholesterol accumulation on the biomechanical performance of Achilles tendons, in vivo . 16 participants (10 men, 6 women; 37±6 years) with familial hypercholesterolemia, diagnosed with tendon xanthoma, and 16 controls (10 men, 6 women; 36±7 years) underwent Achilles biomechanical assessment. Achilles biomechanical data was obtained during preferred pace, shod, walking by analysis of lower limb kinematics and kinetics utilizing 3D motion capture and an instrumented treadmill. Gastrocnemius medialis muscle-tendon junction displacement was imaged using ultrasonography. Achilles stiffness, hysteresis, strain and force were calculated from displacement-force data acquired during loading cycles, and tested for statistical differences using one-way ANOVA. Statistical parametric mapping was used to examine group differences in temporal data. Participants with familial hypercholesterolemia displayed lower Achilles stiffness compared to the control group (familial hypercholesterolemia group: 87±20 N/mm; controls: 111±18 N/mm; p = 0.001), which appeared to be linked to Achilles loading rate rather than an increased strain (FH: 5.27±1.2%; controls: 4.95±0.9%; p = 0.413). We found different Achilles loading patterns in the familial hypercholesterolemia group, which were traced to differences in the centre of pressure progression that affected ankle moment. This finding may indicate that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia use different Achilles loading strategies. Participants with familial hypercholesterolemia also demonstrated significantly greater Achilles hysteresis than the control group (familial hypercholesterolemia: 57.5±7.3%; controls: 43.8±10%; p &lt;0.001), suggesting that walking may require a greater metabolic cost.

Since the circadian clock underlies the daily arousal, a timed coordination is expected between the orexin system and its target subcortical visual system, including the superior colliculus (SC). Here, we use a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and molecular approaches across 24 h, together with the neuronal tract-tracing methods to investigate the daily coordination between the orexin system and the rodent SC. Higher orexinergic input was found to occur nocturnally in the superficial layers of the SC, in time for nocturnal silencing of spontaneous firing in this visual brain area. We identify autonomous daily and circadian expression of clock genes in the SC, which may underlie these day-night changes. Additionally, we establish the lateral hypothalamic origin of the orexin innervation to the SC and that the SC neurons robustly respond to orexin A via OX2 receptor in both excitatory and GABAA receptor-dependent inhibitory manners. Together, our evidence elucidates the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic clock mechanisms that shape the daily function of the visual layers of the SC."
https://openalex.org/W3199141582,"The resolution of inflammation facilitates proper wound healing and limits tissue repair short of exaggerated fibrotic scarring. The atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR)2/D6 scavenges inflammatory chemokines, while IFN-β is a recently unveiled pro-resolving cytokine. Both effector molecules limit acute inflammatory episodes and promote their resolution in various organs. Here, we found fibrotic skin lesions from ACKR2-/- mice presented increased epidermal and dermal thickening, atrophy of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, augmented disorientation of collagen deposition, and enhanced deformation and loss of hair follicles compared to WT counterparts. In addition, affected skin sections from ACKR2-/- mice contained reduced levels of the pro-resolving mediators IFN-β and IL-10, but increased levels of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2 and 3, the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β, and the immune-stimulating cytokine IL-12. Notably, treatment with exogenous IFN-β rescued, at least in part, all the pro-fibrotic outcomes and lesion size in ACKR2-/- mice and promoted expression of the pro-resolving enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO) in both ACKR2-/- and WT mice. Moreover, Ifnb-/- mice displayed enhanced pro-fibrotic indices upon exposure to bleomycin. These findings suggest ACKR2 is an important mediator in limiting inflammatory skin fibrosis and acts via IFN-β production to promote the resolution of inflammation and minimize tissue scaring."

https://openalex.org/W3199524463,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, whereby immune cell-mediated killing leads to loss of the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 genetic variants associated with risk for T1D. The majority of the GWAS risk variants reside in the non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that gene regulatory changes substantially contribute to T1D. However, identification of causal regulatory variants associated with T1D risk and their affected genes is challenging due to incomplete knowledge of non-coding regulatory elements and the cellular states and processes in which they function. Here, we performed a comprehensive integrated post-GWAS analysis of T1D to identify functional regulatory variants in enhancers and their cognate target genes. Starting with 1,817 candidate T1D SNPs defined from the GWAS catalog and LDlink databases, we conducted functional annotation analysis using genomic data from various public databases. These include 1) Roadmap Epigenomics, ENCODE, and RegulomeDB for epigenome data; 2) GTEx for tissue-specific gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci data; and 3) lncRNASNP2 for long non-coding RNA data. Our results indicated a prevalent enhancer-based immune dysregulation in T1D pathogenesis. We identified 26 high-probability causal enhancer SNPs associated with T1D, and 64 predicted target genes. The majority of the target genes play major roles in antigen presentation and immune response and are regulated through complex transcriptional regulatory circuits, including those in HLA (6p21) and non-HLA (16p11.2) loci. These candidate causal enhancer SNPs are supported by strong evidence and warrant functional follow-up studies."
https://openalex.org/W3199563044,"Mitochondria undergo continuous cycles of fission and fusion to promote inheritance, regulate quality control, and mitigate organelle stress. More recently, this process of mitochondrial dynamics has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to nutrient supply, ultimately conferring bioenergetic plasticity to the organelle. However, whether regulators of mitochondrial dynamics play a causative role in nutrient regulation remains unclear. In this study, we generated a cellular loss-of-function model for dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), the primary regulator of outer membrane mitochondrial fission. Loss of DRP1 (shDRP1) resulted in extensive ultrastructural and functional remodeling of mitochondria, characterized by pleomorphic enlargement, increased electron density of the matrix, and defective NADH and succinate oxidation. Despite increased mitochondrial size and volume, shDRP1 cells exhibited reduced cellular glucose uptake and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Untargeted transcriptomic profiling revealed severe downregulation of genes required for cellular and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, which was coupled to loss of ATP-stimulated calcium flux and impaired substrate oxidation stimulated by exogenous calcium. The insights obtained herein suggest that DRP1 regulates substrate oxidation by altering whole-cell and mitochondrial calcium dynamics. These findings are relevant to the targetability of mitochondrial fission and have clinical relevance in the identification of treatments for fission-related pathologies such as hereditary neuropathies, inborn errors in metabolism, cancer, and chronic diseases."

Using solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we report that WT PBP2 exchanges dynamically between a low-affinity state with an extended β3-β4 loop conformation and a high-affinity state with an inward β3-β4 loop conformation. Histidine-514, which is located at the boundary of the β4 strand, plays an important role during the exchange between these two conformational states. We also find that mutations present in PBP2 from H041, a ceftriaxone-resistant strain of N. gonorrhoeae, increase resistance to ceftriaxone by destabilizing the inward β3-β4 loop conformation or stabilizing the extended β3-β4 loop conformation to favor the low-affinity drug-binding state. These observations reveal a unique mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance, whereby mutations in PBP2 lower the proportion of target molecules in the high-affinity drug-binding state and thus reduce inhibition at lower drug concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3199405258,"Despite the formation of biofilms on catheters for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), some patients do not show bacteremia. To elucidate the specific linkage between biofilms and bacteremia in patients with ECMO, an improved understanding of the microbial community within catheter biofilms is necessary. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the biofilm microbiome of ECMO catheters from adults with (n = 6) and without (n = 15) bacteremia. The microbiomes of the catheter biofilms were evaluated by profiling the V3 and V4 regions of bacterial 16s rRNA genes using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. In total, 2,548,172 reads, with an average of 121,341 reads per sample, were generated. Although alpha diversity was slightly higher in the non-bacteremic group, the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no difference in beta diversity between the two groups. We found 367 different genera, of which 8 were present in all samples regardless of group; Limnohabitans , Flavobacterium , Delftia , Massilia , Bacillus , Candidatus , Xiphinematobacter , and CL0-1 showed an abundance of more than 1% in the sample. In particular, Arthrobacter , SMB53 , Neisseria , Ortrobactrum , Candidatus Rhabdochlamydia , Deefgae , Dyella , Paracoccus , and Pedobacter were highly abundant in the bacteremic group. Network analysis indicated that the microbiome of the bacteremic group was more complex than that of the non-bacteremic group. Flavobacterium and CL0 . 1 , which were abundant in the bacteremic group, were considered important genera because they connected different subnetworks. Biofilm characteristics in ECMO catheters varied according to the presence or absence of bacteremia. There were no significant differences in diversity between the two groups, but there were significant differences in the community composition of the biofilms. The biofilm-associated community was dynamic, with the bacteremic group showing very complex network connections within the microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3199614149,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of proteins is an essential post-translational modification in all eukaryotes that occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and serves to deliver GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) to the cell surface where they play a wide variety of vital physiological roles. This paper describes a specialized method for purification and structural analysis of the GPI glycan of individual GPI-APs in yeast. The protocol involves the expression of a specific GPI-AP tagged with GFP, enzymatic release from the cellular membrane fraction, immunopurification, separation by electrophoresis and analysis of the peptides bearing GPI glycans by mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion. We used specifically this protocol to address the structural remodeling that undergoes the GPI glycan of a specific GPI-AP during its transport to the cell surface. This method can be also applied to investigate the GPI-AP biosynthetic pathway and to directly confirm predicted GPI-anchoring of individual proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3199737063,"The development of more effective, better tolerated drug treatments for progressive pulmonary fibrosis (of which idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common and severe form) is a research priority. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) is a key regulator of inflammation and fibrosis and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. However, the use of synthetic PPAR-γ agonists may be limited by their potentially severe adverse effects. In a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, we have demonstrated that the non-racemic selective PPAR-γ modulator GED-0507 is able to reduce body weight loss, ameliorate clinical and histological features of pulmonary fibrosis, and increase survival rate without any safety concerns. Here, we focused on the biomolecular effects of GED-0507 on various inflammatory/fibrotic pathways. We demonstrated that preventive and therapeutic administration of GED-0507 reduced the BLM-induced mRNA expression of several markers of fibrosis, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen and fibronectin as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of mucin 5B. The beneficial effect of GED-0507 on pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed in vitro by its ability to control TGFβ-induced myofibroblast activation in the A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line, the MRC-5 lung fibroblast line, and primary human lung fibroblasts. Compared with the US Food and Drug Administration-approved antifibrotic drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib, GED-0507 displayed greater antifibrotic activity by controlling alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction, EMT, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In conclusion, GED-0507 demonstrated potent antifibrotic properties and might be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3199922528,"Adapting laboratory psycholinguistic methods to fieldwork contexts can be fraught with difficulties. However, successful implementation of such methods in the field enhances our ability to learn the true extent and limitations of human behavior. This paper reports two attempts to run word learning experiments with the small community of Nungon speakers in Towet village in the Saruwaged Mountains, Papua New Guinea. A first attempt involved running a cross-situational task in which word-object pairings were presented ambiguously in each trial, and an explicit word learning task in which pairings were presented explicitly, or unambiguously, in each trial. While this quickly garnered a respectable 34 participants over the course of a week, it yielded null results, with many participants appearing to show simple patterned responses at test. We interpreted the null result as possibly reflecting the unfamiliarity of both the task and the laptop-based presentation mode. In Experiment 2, we made several adjustments to the explicit word learning task in an attempt to provide clearer instructions, reduce cognitive load, and frame the study within a real-world context. During a second 11-day stay in the village, 34 participants completed this modified task and demonstrated clear evidence of word learning. With this success serving as a future guide for researchers, our experiences show that it may require multiple attempts, even by experienced fieldworkers familiar with the target community, to successfully adapt experiments to a field setting."
https://openalex.org/W3200702831,"Labelling of therapeutic antibodies with radionuclides or fluorophores is routinely used to study their pharmacokinetic properties. A critical assumption in utilizing labelled therapeutic antibodies is that the label has no unfavourable effects on antibody charge, hydrophobicity, or receptor affinity. Ideally, the labelled protein should not have any significant deviations from the physiological properties of the original molecule. This article describes an established quality in vitro assessment workflow for labelled antibodies that ensures better prediction of changes in antibody pharmacokinetic (PK) properties after modifications. This analysis package considers degradation and aggregation analysis by size-exclusion chromatography, changes in neonatal-Fc-receptor (FcRn) affinity, and heparin interaction. FcRn binding is important for antibody recycling and half-life extension, whereas heparin affinity provides estimates on the rate of endocytosis through unspecific cell surface binding. Additionally, mass spectrometric analysis to determine the degree of labelling (DoL) completes the package and the combined analysis data allow to predict the label contribution to the PK properties of the modified antibody. This analytical strategy for labelling 11 IgGs has been investigated using 2 different IgG1 constructs and applying 7 different types of labels. Each labelling resulted in a change in the physicochemical properties of the protein. Not only can the DoL of modified IgGs lead to a change in protein properties, but the type of label also can. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the labelling process can also influence the behaviour of labelled mAbs. An identical label on different constructs of IgG1 can cause different affinities for FcRn and heparin. Considering the assessment data, only 6 of the 11 modified antibodies from this study can be recommended for subsequent experiments. In conclusion, a suitability assessment of labelled antibodies prior to any pharmacokinetic studies is essential to reduce cost, allocate resources and reduce the number of animal experiments during pre-clinical drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3199564767,"Patients with cancer and their relatives often suffer from psychosocial burdens following a cancer diagnosis. Psychosocial cancer support services offer support for cancer patients and their relatives. Only a few studies have focused on associations of psychological factors within patient-relative dyads. This study aims to assess associations between the patients' or relatives' self-efficacy and their levels of distress and anxiety who seek help together at psychosocial cancer support centres.Participants were recruited at two psychosocial cancer support centres in a major city in Germany. Patients with cancer and their relatives seeking support together received the questionnaire before their first support session. Self-efficacy was assessed with the Pearlin sense of mastery scale, distress with the distress thermometer and anxiety with the General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). For the analysis, the actor-partner interdependence model was applied.The data analysis was based on 41 patient-relative dyads (patients: 39% women, mean age 53.5; relatives: 66% women, mean age 52.16). A significant actor effect from self-efficacy to distress was found for patients (r = -0.47) but not for relatives (r = -0.15). Partner effects from self-efficacy to distress were not significant (r = -0.03, r = -0.001). The actor effect from self-efficacy to anxiety for patients (r = -0.61) as well as relatives was significant (r = -0.62), whereas the partner effect was significant for patients (r = 0.16) but not for relatives (r = -0.46).The results suggest that patients' and relatives' self-efficacy is associated with their distress and anxiety. Partner effects were visible for patients' self-efficacy and relatives' anxiety. These findings suggest that self-efficacy is an important factor for the psychological well-being of patients and relatives and that it may additionally be associated with the partners' well-being. Longitudinal research with larger samples is needed to support the findings."

GC group (median daily prednisone-equivalent dose: 53.36 mg (IQR 30.00, 80.04)) had greatest CBG differences compared to controls at dinner (254±69 vs. 184±63 mg/dL, P<0.001) and bedtime (260±72 vs. 182±55 mg/dL, P<0.001). In GC group, dinner CBG was 30% higher than lunch (254±69 vs. 199±77 mg/dL, P<0.001) when similar lispro to controls given at lunch. Bedtime CBG not different from dinner when 20% more lispro given at dinner (0.12 units/kg (IQR 0.08, 0.17) vs. 0.10 units/kg (0.06, 0.14), P<0.01). Despite receiving more lispro, bedtime hypoglycemic events were lower in GC group (0.0% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.03).Since equal bolus doses inadequately treat large dinner and bedtime GC-exacerbated glycemic excursions, initiating higher bolus insulin at lunch and dinner with additional enhanced GC-specific insulin supplemental scale may be needed as initial insulin doses in setting of high-dose GC."
https://openalex.org/W3201600582,"Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, resulting in over 600,000 new diagnoses annually. Traditionally, HNCC has been related to tobacco and alcohol exposure; however, over the past decade, a growing number of head and neck cancers are attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaD) was demonstrated as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for acute myelogenous leukaemia. Preclinical data revealed that 5-aza inhibits growth and increases cell death of HPV(+) cancer cells. These effects are associated with reduced expression of HPV genes, stabilization of TP53, and activation of TP53-dependent apoptosis. The aim of the present study is to test the effect of 5-AzaD on growth of human squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu), a HPV(-) and p53 mutated cells, in vitro and in vivo. The effect of 5-AzaD on cell viability, cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis was tested in vitro. The effect of 5-AzaD on tumour growth in vivo was tested using xenograft mice inoculated with FaDu cells. The results indicated that 5-AzaD reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in FaDu cells in vitro. In vivo studies revealed that 5-AzaD suppresses the growth of tumours in xenograft mice inoculated with FaDu cells through inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. These findings may emphasis that 5-AzaD is effective in treatment of HPV(-) HNSCC tumours through TP53 independent pathway. Future studies are needed in order to clarify the molecular mechanism of action of 5-AzaD in HPV(-) cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3155699756,"There remains a great challenge to minimize the spread of epidemics, especially in high-density communities such as colleges and universities. This is particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students were obtained from SUNY College at Geneseo, a rural, residential, undergraduate institution in western NY, USA. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. The effectiveness of contact tracing, and the effect of quarantining neighbors of infectious individuals, was tested. The structure of the college course enrollment and residence networks greatly influenced the dynamics of the epidemics, as compared to the random networks. In particular, average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths than students in smaller majors. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R 0 = 2.4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks when compared to the dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus."
https://openalex.org/W3199239089,"Transcriptome-based exon capture approaches, along with next-generation sequencing, are allowing for the rapid and cost-effective production of extensive and informative phylogenomic datasets from non-model organisms for phylogenetics and population genetics research. These approaches generally employ a reference genome to infer the intron-exon structure of targeted loci and preferentially select longer exons. However, in the absence of an existing and well-annotated genome, we applied this exon capture method directly, without initially identifying intron-exon boundaries for bait design, to a group of highly diverse Haloniscus (Philosciidae), paraplatyarthrid and armadillid isopods, and examined the performance of our methods and bait design for phylogenetic inference. Here, we identified an isopod-specific set of single-copy protein-coding loci, and a custom bait design to capture targeted regions from 469 genes, and analysed the resulting sequence data with a mapping approach and newly-created post-processing scripts. We effectively recovered a large and informative dataset comprising both short (<100 bp) and longer (>300 bp) exons, with high uniformity in sequencing depth. We were also able to successfully capture exon data from up to 16-year-old museum specimens along with more distantly related outgroup taxa, and efficiently pool multiple samples prior to capture. Our well-resolved phylogenies highlight the overall utility of this methodological approach and custom bait design, which offer enormous potential for application to future isopod, as well as broader crustacean, molecular studies."

Based on the Baidu index of ’novel coronavirus’, this paper analyses the spatial and temporal characteristics of and factors that influenced the attention network for COVID-19 from January 9, 2020, to April 15, 2020. The study found that (1) Temporally, the attention in the new coronavirus network showed an upward trend from January 9 to January 29, with the largest increase from January 23 to January 29 and a peak on January 29, and then a slow downward trend. The level of attention in the new coronavirus network was basically flat when comparing January 22 and March 4. (2) Spatially, first, from the perspective of regional differences, the network attention in the eastern and central regions decreased in turn. The network users in the eastern region exhibited the highest attention to the new coronavirus, especially in Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu and other provinces and cities. The network attention in Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Ningxia in the western region was the lowest in terms of the national network attention. Second, from the perspective of interprovincial differences, the attention in the new coronavirus network was highly consistent with the Hu Huanyong line of China’s population boundary. The east of the Hu Huanyong line is densely populated, and the network showed high concern, mostly ranking at the third to fifth levels. (3) The number of Internet users in the information technology field, the population, and the culture and age characteristics of individuals are important factors that influence the novel coronavirus attention network."

The aim of this study was to describe and validate caregivers' reported use of antibacterials by their children prior to seeking care at the healthcare facility.A cross sectional study was conducted among children under five years seeking care at healthcare facilities in Gulu district, northern Uganda. Using a researcher administered questionnaire, data were obtained from caregivers regarding reported prior antibacterial intake in their children. These reports were validated by comparing them to common antibacterial agents detected in blood and urine samples from the children using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods.A total of 355 study participants had a complete set of data on prior antibacterial use collected using both self-report and LC-MS/MS. Of the caregivers, 14.4% (51/355, CI: 10.9-18.5%) reported giving children antibacterials prior to visiting the healthcare facility. However, LC-MS/MS detected antibacterials in blood and urine samples in 63.7% (226/355, CI: 58.4-68.7%) of the children. The most common antibacterials detected from the laboratory analysis were cotrimoxazole (29%, 103/355), ciprofloxacin (13%, 46/355), and metronidazole (9.9%, 35/355). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value and agreement of self-reported antibacterial intake prior to healthcare facility visit were 17.3% (12.6-22.8), 90.7% (84.3-95.1), 76.5% (62.5-87.2), 38.5% (33.0-44.2) and 43.9% (k 0.06) respectively.There is low validity of caregivers' reports on prior intake of antibacterials by these children.

https://openalex.org/W3200289152,"Vaccination is a cost-effective public health intervention, yet evidence abounds that vaccination uptake is still poor in many low- and middle-income countries. Traditional and Religious Leaders play a substantial role in improving the uptake of health services such as immunization. However, there is paucity of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of using such strategies. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of using a multi-faceted intervention that included traditional and religious leaders for community engagement to improve uptake of routine immunisation services in communities in Cross River State, Southern Nigeria. The target population for the intervention was traditional and religious leaders in randomly selected communities in Cross River State. The impact of the intervention on the uptake of routine vaccination among children 0 to 23 months was assessed using a cluster randomized trials. Outcome assessments were performed at the end of the project (36 months).The cost of the intervention was obtained from the accounting records for expenditures incurred in the course of implementing the intervention. Costs were assessed from the health provider perspective. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incremental cost of the initial implementation of the intervention was US$19,357and that the incremental effect was 323 measles cases averted, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$60/measles case averted. However, for subsequent scale-up of the interventions to new areas not requiring a repeat expenditure of some of the initial capital expenditure the ICER was estimated to be US$34 per measles case averted. Involving the traditional and religious leaders in vaccination is a cost-effective strategy for improving the uptake of childhood routine vaccinations."

https://openalex.org/W3200424301,"""Visual Restitution Therapies"" (VRT) claim to ameliorate visual field defects of neurological patients by repeated visual light stimulation, leading to training-related neuroplasticity and resulting in reconnection of lesioned neurons in early cortical areas. Because existing systems are stationary, uncomfortable, and unreliable, we developed a training instrument based on virtual reality goggles. The goal of the ""Salzburg Visual Field Trainer"" (SVFT) is twofold: (1) The device facilitates the clinical evaluation of established neuropsychological rehabilitation approaches, such as VRT. (2) The device enables patients to independently perform VRT based (or other) neuropsychological training methodologies flexibly and comfortably.The SVFT was developed on the principles of VRT. Individual configuration of the SVFT is based on perimetric data of the respective patient's visual field. To validate the utmost important aspect of neuropsychological rehabilitation methodologies-that is displaying stimuli precisely in desired locations in the user's visual field-two steps were conducted in this proof-of-concept study: First, we assessed the individual ""blind spots"" location and extent of 40 healthy, normal sighted participants. This was done with the help of our recently developed perimetric methodology ""Eye Tracking Based Visual Field Analysis"" (EFA). Second, depending on the individual characteristics of every participant's blind spots, we displayed-by means of the SVFT-15 stimuli in the respective locations of every participants' blind spots and 85 stimuli in the surrounding, intact visual area. The ratio between visible and non-visible stimuli, which is reflected in the behavioral responses (clicks on a remote control) of the 40 participants, provides insight into the accuracy of the SVFT to display training stimuli in areas desired by the investigator. As the blind spot is a naturally occurring, absolute scotoma, we utilized this blind area as an objective criterion and a ""simulated"" visual field defect to evaluate the theoretical applicability of the SVFT.Outcomes indicate that the SVFT is highly accurate in displaying training stimuli in the desired areas of the user's visual field with an accuracy of 99.0%. Data analysis further showed a sensitivity of .98, specificity of .99, a positive predictive value of .96, a negative predictive value of .996, a hit rate of .99, a random hit rate of .74 and a RATZ-Index of .98. This translates to 14.7% correct non-reactions, 0.7% false non-reactions, 0.3% false reactions and 84.3% correct reactions to displayed test stimuli during the evaluation study. Reports from participants further indicate that the SVFT is comfortable to wear and intuitive to use.The SVFT can help to investigate the true effects of VRT based methodologies (or other neuropsychological approaches) and the underlying mechanisms of training-related neuroplasticity in the visual cortex in neurological patients suffering from visual field defects."
https://openalex.org/W3200448025,"Despite the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological control of the virus is still challenging due to slow vaccine rollouts, incomplete vaccine protection to current and emerging variants, and unwillingness to get vaccinated. Therefore, frequent testing of individuals to identify early SARS-CoV-2 infections, contact-tracing and isolation strategies remain crucial to mitigate viral spread. Here, we describe WHotLAMP, a rapid molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. WHotLAMP is simple to use, highly sensitive (~4 viral particles per microliter of saliva) and specific, as well as inexpensive, making it ideal for frequent screening. Moreover, WHotLAMP does not require toxic chemicals or specialized equipment and thus can be performed in point-of-care settings, and may also be adapted for resource-limited environments or home use. While applied here to SARS-CoV-2, WHotLAMP can be modified to detect other pathogens, making it adaptable for other diagnostic assays, including for use in future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3200819307,"High salt diet (HSD) is a hallmark of blood pressure elevations, weight gain and diabetes onset in the metabolic syndrome. In kidney, compensatory mechanisms are activated to balance salt turnover and maintain homeostasis. Data on the long-term effects of HSD with respect to tubular cell functions and kidney architecture that exclude confounding indirect blood pressure effects are scarce. Additionally we focus on cold shock Y-box binding protein-1 as a tubular cell protective factor. A HSD model (4% NaCl in chow; 1% NaCl in water) was compared to normal salt diet (NSD, standard chow) over 16 months using wild type mice and an inducible conditional whole body knockout for cold shock Y-box binding protein-1 (BL6J/N, Ybx1). HSD induced no difference in blood pressure over 16 months, comparing NSD/HSD and Ybx1 wild type/knockout. Nevertheless, marked phenotypic changes were detected. Glucosuria and subnephrotic albuminuria ensued in wild type animals under HSD, which subsided in Ybx1-deficient animals. At the same time megalin receptors were upregulated. The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) was completely downregulated in wild type HSD animals that developed glucosuria. In Ybx1 knockouts, expression of AQP1 and SGLT2 was maintained under HSD; proximal tubular widening and glomerular tubularization developed. Concurrently, amino aciduria of neutral and hydrophobic amino acids was seen. In vitro translation confirmed that YB-1 translationally represses Sglt2 transcripts. Our data reveal profound effects of HSD primarily within glomeruli and proximal tubular segments. YB-1 is regulated by HSD and orchestrates HSD-dependent changes; notably, sets reabsorption thresholds for amino acids, proteins and glucose."

Transcriptome-wide gene expression data were generated using RNA-seq from placenta samples collected in a multi-ethnic urban birth cohort in New York City (n = 129). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to characterize placental co-expression modules, which were then evaluated for their associations with MPSP and infant temperament. WGCNA revealed 16 gene coexpression modules. One module, enriched for regulation of chromosome organization/gene expression, was positively associated with MPSP and negatively associated with Regulatory Capacity (REG), a component of infant temperament. Two other modules, enriched for cotranslational protein targeting and cell cycle regulation, respectively, displayed negative associations with MPSP and positive associations with REG. A module enriched with oxidative phosphorylation/mitochondrial translation was positively associated with REG. These findings support the notion that the placenta provides a functional in utero link between MPSP and infant temperament, possibly through transcriptional regulation of placental gene expression."

However, prevalence has remained high or less than anticipated in other areas referred to here as persistent hotspot villages (PHS). Using a cross-sectional quantitative approach, this study investigated the factors associated with sustained high Schistosoma mansoni prevalence in some villages despite repeated high annual treatment coverage in western Kenya.Water contact sites selected based on observation of points where people consistently go to collect water, wash clothes, bathe, swim or play (young children), wash cars and harvest sand were mapped using hand-held smart phones on the Commcare platform. Quantitative cross-sectional surveys on behavioral characteristics were conducted using interviewer-based semi-structured questionnaires administered to assess water usage/contact patterns and open defecation. Questionnaires were administered to 15 households per village, 50 pupils per school and 1 head teacher per school. One stool and urine sample was collected from 50 school children aged 9-12 year old and 50 adults from both responding (R) and persistent hotspot (PHS) villages. Stool was analyzed by the Kato-Katz method for eggs of S. mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths. Urine samples were tested using the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) test for detection of S. mansoni antigen.There was higher latrine coverage in R (n = 6) relative to PHS villages (n = 6) with only 33% of schools in the PHS villages meeting the WHO threshold for boy: latrine coverage ratio versus 83.3% in R, while no villages met the girl: latrine ratio requirement. A higher proportion of individuals accessed unprotected water sources for both bathing and drinking (68.5% for children and 89% for adults) in PHS relative to R villages. In addition, frequency of accessing water sources was higher in PHS villages, with swimming being the most frequent activity. As expected based upon selection criteria, both prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni were higher in the PHS relative to R villages (prevalence: 43.7% vs 20.2%; P < 0.001; intensity: 73.8 ± 200.6 vs 22.2 ± 96.0, P < 0.0001), respectively.Unprotected water sources and low latrine coverage are contributing factors to PHS for schistosomiasis in western Kenya. Efforts to increase provision of potable water and improvement in latrine infrastructure is recommended to augment control efforts in the PHS areas."

Multivariate data and chemometric analysis were completed using the Unscrambler software. Results The Raman spectra detected in ACC samples were mostly assigned to nucleic acids, lipids, and amides. In a principal component-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) 18 of 20 tumor samples were classified correctly. Conclusion In this proof of concept study, we show that a reliable SGT diagnosis based on LDA algorithm appears possible, despite variations in the entity-specific mean spectra. However, a standardized workflow for tissue sample preparation, measurement setup, and chemometric algorithms is essential to get reliable results."
https://openalex.org/W3198981183,"Background Lack of physical activity (PA) and a high level of physical inactivity (PI) are associated with a higher risk for mortality and responsible for several non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular disease. Higher age is associated with a decrease of PA and an increasing level of PI. Studies have shown that interventions in the elderly have the potential to increase the amount of PA and to decrease the level of PI. However, most interventions are complex, elaborated, time- and resource-consuming. Here, we examined the effect of individual feedback-letters reporting the measured PA and PI in a sample of elderly people in Germany. Primary outcomes of the study were overall PA and PI after 6 months in the intervention group compared to a control group. Methods We examined data from the MOVING intervention study (RCT) for people aged ≥ 65 years living in the northeast of Germany. At baseline, 3 and 6-months follow-up, all study participants wore a 3-axis accelerometer over a period of seven consecutive days. After the baseline measurement, the participants were randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in the intervention group received automatically generated, individualized feedback letters reporting their PA and PI by mail after the baseline measurement and after the 3-months follow-up. A Two-Way Mixed ANOVA with repeated measures was calculated with light, moderate and overall PA as well as PI as dependent variables, and group (between subject) and time (inner subject) as factors. The analysis based on retrospective data from the MOVING study (2016–2018). Results N = 258 patients were recruited. N = 166 participants could be included in the analysis, thereof N = 97 women (58.4%). The mean age was 70.8 years (SD 4.8). At baseline, the participants had a mean wearing time of 5,934.5 minutes (SD = 789.5) per week, which corresponds to about 14 hours daily on average. The overall PA in the intervention group at the 6-months follow up was 2488.8 (95% CI 2358.9–2618.2) minutes and 2408.2 (95% CI 2263.0–2553.4) minutes in the control group. There was no statistically significant interaction effect (time*group) between the intervention and control group for the depending variables. Sensitivity analyses showed significant small positive effects of the interaction time*partnership, F(2, 300) = 3.020, p = 0.05, partial η 2 = 0.020. Discussion On average, study participants had high levels of PA at baseline and showed a good adherence in wearing the accelerometer. Both is likely due to selection in the convenience study sample. Thus, some ceiling effect reduced the overall intervention effect somewhat. At baseline, the weekly average of PI was 3436.7 minutes, which correspondents to about 8.2 hours per day and about 57% of participants’ daily waking time. The average level of PI could be slightly decreased in both study groups. Trial registration number DRKS00010410 , 17 May 2017."

Although the lineages of these clinical strains can be traced back to common ancestor/s, there exists a plethora of difference between them, compared to those that have evolved in the laboratory. We identify a mutation present in ~80% of clinical strains, which maps in the HATPase domain of the sensor kinase MtrB and alters kinase and phosphatase activities, and affects its physiological role. The changes conferred by the mutation were probed by in-vitro biochemical assays which revealed changes in signaling properties of the sensor kinase. These changes also affect bacterial cell division rates, size and membrane properties. The study highlights the impact of DNA polymorphisms on the pathophysiology of clinical strains and provides insights into underlying mechanisms that drive signal transduction in pathogenic bacteria."

Previous studies have shown that psychological factors affect the willingness to communicate in English for Japanese people. However, the network structure of psychological factors and their effects have not been revealed yet. The present study conducted a network analysis with 644 Japanese people. Consequently, the edge between perceived communication competence and the willingness to communicate in the first or second language was very strong. Node centrality strength showed that these factors were central in the network structure. The results of the network analysis show the effect of psychological networks on the willingness to communicate in a second language, which will be beneficial for language education."
https://openalex.org/W3199304647,"Academic disciplines are often organized according to the behaviors they examine. While most research on a behavior tends to exist within one discipline, some behaviors are examined by multiple disciplines. Better understanding of behaviors and their relationships should enable knowledge transfer across disciplines and theories, thereby dramatically improving the behavioral knowledge base. We propose a taxonomy built on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), but design the taxonomy as a stand-alone extension rather than an improvement to ICF. Behaviors considered important enough to serve as the dependent variable in articles accepted for publication in top journals were extracted from nine different behavioral and social disciplines. A six-step development and validation process was employed, leading to the final taxonomy. A hierarchy of behaviors under the top banner of Engaging in activities/participating, reflective of ICF's D. hierarchy was constructed with eight immediate domains addressing behaviors ranging from learning, exercising, self-care, and substance use. The resulting International Classification of Behaviors (IC-Behavior), provides a behavior taxonomy targeted towards the interdisciplinary integration of nomological networks relevant to behavioral theories. While IC-Behavior has been labeled v.1.0 to communicate that it is by no means an endpoint, it has empirically shown to provide flexibility for the addition of new behaviors and is tested in the health domain."

Method We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a final study population of 1203 individuals from two medical centers in Taiwan during January 1–June 30, 2019. The “High concern” group was defined as the set of patients who rated themselves as having low risk but who had been rated by physicians as having medium or high risk of developing glaucoma over the next year. Results Approximately 12% of the respondents belonged to the “High concern” group. For those with education at the college level or higher, the interaction term was estimated to be 0.294 (95% CI = 0.136–0.634). Marginal effect calculations revealed significant sex-based differences in the effect of knowledge at specific age intervals. Conclusions A considerable proportion of patients attending the ophthalmology department underestimate their glaucoma risks. Misjudgment of glaucoma risks can lead to delays in seeking of medical attention. Glaucoma education should be designed according to each patient’s education level and sex, as its effect is not consistent across different education and sex clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3199503076,"Purpose We quantified the eye/head (gaze) reaction time in infants to establish a normative database for the Pediatric Perimeter device. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that gaze reaction time will reduce with age. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Healthy infants between 3 to 10 months of age were recruited. Peripheral visual field stimuli (hemifield and quadrant stimuli) were presented in the Pediatric Perimeter device. Infant’s gaze to these stimuli was observed, documented in real time, and video recorded for offline analysis. Results A total of 121 infants were tested in three age group bins [3–5 months, n = 44; &gt;5–7 months, n = 30 and &gt;7–10 months, n = 47]. Overall, 3–5 months old had longer reaction time when compared to the older infants particularly for stimuli presented in the quadrants (Kruskal-Wallis, p&lt;0.038). A significantly asymmetric difference (p = 0.025) in reaction time was observed between the upper (median = 820ms, IQR = 659-1093ms) and lower quadrants (median = 601ms, IQR = 540-1052ms) only for the 3–5 months old infants. Conclusion This study provides the normative gaze reaction time of healthy infants. With increase in age, there is reduction in reaction time and disappearance of reaction time asymmetry in quadrant stimuli. The longer reaction time for upward gaze could be due to delayed maturation of neural mechanisms and/or decreased visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W3201480170,"An infective prey has the potential to infect, kill and consume its predator. Such a prey-predator relationship fundamentally differs from the predator-prey interaction because the prey can directly profit from the predator as a growth resource. Here we present a population dynamics model of partial role reversal in the predator-prey interaction of two species, the bottom dwelling marine deposit feeder sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus and an important food source for the sea cucumber but potentially infective bacterium Vibrio splendidus. We analyse the effects of different parameters, e.g. infectivity and grazing rate, on the population sizes. We show that relative population sizes of the sea cucumber and V. Splendidus may switch with increasing infectivity. We also show that in the partial role reversal interaction the infective prey may benefit from the presence of the predator such that the population size may exceed the value of the carrying capacity of the prey in the absence of the predator. We also analysed the conditions for species extinction. The extinction of the prey, V. splendidus, may occur when its growth rate is low, or in the absence of infectivity. The extinction of the predator, A. japonicus, may follow if either the infectivity of the prey is high or a moderately infective prey is abundant. We conclude that partial role reversal is an undervalued subject in predator-prey studies."
https://openalex.org/W3201533742,"The major human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site endonuclease, APEX1, is a central player in the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway and has a role in the regulation of DNA binding by transcription factors. In vertebrates, APEX1 knockouts are embryonic lethal, and only a handful of knockout cell lines are known. To facilitate studies of multiple functions of this protein in human cells, we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out the APEX1 gene in a widely used non-cancer hypotriploid HEK 293FT cell line. Two stable knockout lines were obtained, one carrying two single-base deletion alleles and one single-base insertion allele in exon 3, another homozygous in the single-base insertion allele. Both mutations cause a frameshift that leads to premature translation termination before the start of the protein’s catalytic domain. Both cell lines totally lacked the APEX1 protein and AP site-cleaving activity, and showed significantly lower levels of the APEX1 transcript. The APEX1-null cells were unable to support BER on uracil- or AP site-containing substrates. Phenotypically, they showed a moderately increased sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; ~2-fold lower EC 50 compared with wild-type cells), and their background level of natural AP sites detected by the aldehyde-reactive probe was elevated ~1.5–2-fold. However, the knockout lines retained a nearly wild-type sensitivity to oxidizing agents hydrogen peroxide and potassium bromate. Interestingly, despite the increased MMS cytotoxicity, we observed no additional increase in AP sites in knockout cells upon MMS treatment, which could indicate their conversion into more toxic products in the absence of repair. Overall, the relatively mild cell phenotype in the absence of APEX1-dependent BER suggests that mammalian cells possess mechanisms of tolerance or alternative repair of AP sites. The knockout derivatives of the extensively characterized HEK 293FT cell line may provide a valuable tool for studies of APEX1 in DNA repair and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3201195421,"We investigated, if migration status, and additional sociodemographic and clinical factors, are associated with somatization and depressiveness at admission and with remission after inpatient psychotherapy.Multiple linear and binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors for severity of somatoform and depressive symptoms at admission of inpatient psychotherapy (T0), and for remission after inpatient psychotherapy (T1). We tested the association between symptoms concerning somatization (PHQ-15: Patient-Health-Questionnaire Somatization Module) and depression (PHQ-9: Patient-Health-Questionnaire Depression Module) and several sociodemographic and clinical factors in 263 patients at admission. For remission after treatment, we additionally included severity of symptoms at admission, number of diagnoses and duration of treatment in the regression models. Remission after treatment was defined as response plus a post value of less than 10 points in the respective questionnaire. Clinical relevance was interpreted using effect sizes (regression coefficients, Odds Ratio (OR)) and Confidence Intervals (CI).Significant and clinically relevant predictors for high symptom severity at T0 were lower education (β = -0.13, p = 0.04), pretreatment(s) (β = 0.205, p = 0.002) and migration status (β = 0.139, p = 0.023) for somatization, and potential clinically relevant predictors (|β|>0.1) for depression were living alone (β = -0.116, p = 0.083), pretreatment(s) (β = 0.118, p = 0.071) and migration status (β = 0.113, p = 0.069). At T1 patients with pretreatment(s) (OR = 0.284 [95% CI: 0.144, 0.560], p<0.001) and multiple diagnoses (OR = 0.678 [95% CI: 0.472, 0.973], p = 0.035) were significantly and clinically relevant less likely to show a remission of depressive symptoms. In addition, a potentially clinically meaningful effect of migration status on remission of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.562 [95% CI: 0.264, 1.198], p = 0.136) cannot be ruled out. For somatoform symptoms pretreatment(s) (OR = 0.403, [95% CI: 0.156, 1.041], p = 0.061) and education (OR = 1.603, [95% CI: 0.670, 3.839], p = 0.289) may be regarded as clinically relevant predictors for remission.The results of our study suggest that migration status has a clinically relevant influence on severity of somatoform and depressive symptoms at admission. Clinical relevance of migration status can also be assumed regarding the remission of depression. Migration status and further factors affecting the effectiveness of the treatment should be analyzed in future research among larger samples with sufficient power to replicate these findings."
