https://openalex.org/W2079885335,HIGH-MOLECULAR polypeptides containing only one kind of amino-acid are prepared by polymerization of N-carboxylic-α-amino-acid anhydrides1 (α-amino-acid-NCA). The determination of the heat of combustion of these compounds and of the corresponding amino-acids offers for the first time the possibility of estimating quantitatively the energetics of formation of high-molecular peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2025479079,"EXTRACTS free from blood and protein are readily prepared for biological estimation by grinding suprarenal glands with 5 or 10 per cent aqueous trichloracetic acid and centrifuging. However, on submitting such an extract from a cat to paper-partition chromatography using as solvent butanol : acetic acid : water (4 : 1 : 5), we observed that development with aqueous potassium iodate1 gave three spots. Two of these corresponded to adrenaline and noradrenaline (RF = 0.32 and 0.25, respectively) and the third to an unknown adrenaline-like substance (RF = 0.63). Three spots were also detected when development was carried out with the Pauly diazo-reagent or potassium ferricyanide (pH 7.8)."

https://openalex.org/W1965661021,"WE have made a check on the assignment of the α-helix with eighteen residues in five turns to poly-γ-methyl-L-glutamate1 by preparing and interpreting X-ray photographs of a sample of the material. The results obtained not only support the assignment, but also indicate that the β-carbon atoms are in position 2 rather than in position 1 2. This is the same assignment of the β-carbon atoms as that made by Riley and Arndt3 for serum albumin, on the basis of their determination of the radial distribution function."

My interpretation was confirmed by the researches of Kock, a pupil of Buchner."

https://openalex.org/W2029586577,"A CRYOSCOPIC method of measuring the osmotic pressures of very small quantities of fluid (10−6 c.c.) has recently been described by Ramsay1. The principle of the method is to place the liquid in a quartz capillary and freeze it by immersion in solid carbon dioxide. The system is then warmed and the temperature at which the smallest observable ice crystal remains in equilibrium with the liquid is noted. This constitutes the freezing-point depression. This method can be used for measuring the osmotic pressure of single cells and strips of muscle 50–200 µ in diameter, material of these dimensions being sufficiently transparent for the ice crystals to be clearly seen."
https://openalex.org/W2080967232,IT has been shown recently1 that the thrombocytes of rat blood contain a cholinesterase having properties similar to the acetylcholinesterase found in erythrocytes. The present communication gives evidence for the presence of an acetylcholinesterase in the thrombocytes of other animals.

https://openalex.org/W1969721285,"IN a recent report elsewhere1 we have shown that the œstrone and œstradiol in the phenolic fraction of urinary extracts can be separated satisfactorily, in microgram quantities, by means of a silica column, using aqueous sodium hydroxide as the stationary phase and benzene as the moving phase. We were at that time unable to deal with the œstriol fraction chromatographically, and separated it chemically by the method of Bachman and Petit2; this, however, was a tedious process and left unsolved the problem of purification so essential for satisfactory determination by fluorimetry using phosphoric acid. We have now succeeded in overcoming both these difficulties in one operation, and can separate the three fractions from the crude phenolic extract, achieving a satisfactory degree of purification in the process, on a single silica column."

https://openalex.org/W2019383489,"CYCLICAL transmission of P. berghei has been successfully carried out under experimental conditions. A batch of laboratory-bred A. quadrimaculatus and A. stephensi fed on February 15 on a hamster infected eight days previously with the Kasapa strain of P. berghei. The hamster showed numerous gametocytes in the peripheral blood at the time of the blood meal. Dissections of mosquitoes' stomachs showed a 50 per cent infection-rate. On February 25, twenty A. stephensi and twenty-two A. quadrimaculatus of this batch bit and fully engorged themselves on a month-old white rat. The salivary glands of these mosquitoes were dissected out in Ringer-glucose and injected into the same animal on February 26."

In Australia, Wilson2 has shown that a response in growth was obtained in the field by applying a solution of sodium molybdate to the foliage of chlorotic lettuces."
https://openalex.org/W2066718735,"IN a previous communication in this journal1, we reported the evidence from autoradiography for a selective occurrence of organic iodine in the pituitary of guinea pigs injected with a dose of 250 μC. carrier-free iodine-131. During the past year, we have repeated and extended2 our experiments to check a few points which were not clear, namely, the bad reproducibility of the autoradiographs and the lack of agreement with the subsequent findings of other workers3."

As an off-shoot of this experiment, we were able to isolate a top yeast, BY 2, which was diploid but had a pair of unequal chromosomes2. This inequality rendered it possible to offer critical evidence3 for mitosis in yeasts."

https://openalex.org/W2082455885,"THE cancerous response of bacteria-free crown-gall tissue has been established by continued proliferation free from the causal organism or external source of auxin, and by experimental implanting. However, the action of an implant on a healthy host has remained in question, since the implant might effect a cancerous response1, no response2, or a temporary stimulatory response1,3."
https://openalex.org/W2089161271,"THE influence of high concentrations of carbon dioxide on the extension growth of the Avena seedling was reported in an earlier communication1. Further observations, briefly noted here, have been made; but the work has been interrupted pending the completion of a thorough examination of the factors contributing to variability in the growth of the control plants and means devised for eliminating the sources of error."
https://openalex.org/W2030779171,"IN an earlier publication1, results obtained by inserting certain steroids directly into tied-off segments of the uterine horns of spayed rabbits were reported. It was found that several steroids which on systemic administration have a progestational effect in the rabbit do not have such activity when inserted into the uterus. It was suggested that steroids of this type exert a progestational effect by an indirect mechanism, becoming converted in the body either into progesterone or one of the related steroids which have direct progestational activity."
https://openalex.org/W2021395051,"IN a previous communication it has been shown by Basu and Nandi1 that the extent of inactivation consequent on the unfolding of the protein chain of an enzyme molecule could be detected by iodimetric titration of the SH-groups uncovered by the unfolding of the coiled-up molecules. In this connexion it has been noted that increase in iodine absorption occurs in cases where the enzyme has been partially deactivated, although no denatured, insoluble protein was formed. It may be concluded, therefore, that denaturation leading to insolubilization takes place only when the unfolding of the protein coil has proceeded to an appreciable extent, whereas deactivation makes its appearance much earlier and with a lesser degree of uncoiling. These observations suggest that the variation in the extent of enzyme activity at different pH's may, to some extent, depend on the extent of coiling or uncoiling of the enzyme molecule. In order to test this point, pepsin solution was adjusted to different pH's by the addition of the necessary amount of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as the case may be, and titrated with N/2,000 iodine solution below 15° C., using starch as indicator. The results are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2054930181,"ACID hydrolysis of casein usually results in the complete destruction of tryptophane and the formation of large amounts of humin. White and Sayers1 reported that casein could be hydrolysed with very dilute sulphuric acid without complete loss of tryptophane. Other workers have reported that reducing agents such as stannous chloride and titanous chloride prevent humin formation2,3. Rigby4 claims that nascent hydrogen helps to prevent destruction of tryptophane during the hydrolysis of casein with sulphuric acid."
