https://openalex.org/W3189646261,"Path to another drug against COVID-19 The rapid development of vaccines has been crucial in battling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, access challenges remain, breakthrough infections occur, and emerging variants present increased risk. Developing antiviral therapeutics is therefore a high priority for the treatment of COVID-19. Some drug candidates in clinical trials act against the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but there are other viral enzymes that have been considered good targets for inhibition by drugs. Owen et al . report the discovery and characterization of a drug against the main protease involved in the cleavage of polyproteins involved in viral replication. The drug, PF-07321332, can be administered orally, has good selectivity and safety profiles, and protects against infection in a mouse model. In a phase 1 clinical trial, the drug reached concentrations expected to inhibit the virus based on in vitro studies. It also inhibited other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and could be in the armory against future viral threats. —VV"
https://openalex.org/W3210936292,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were rising during early summer 2021 in many countries as a result of the Delta variant. We assessed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction swab positivity in the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission–1 (REACT-1) study in England. During June and July 2021, we observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time of 25 days, driven by complete replacement of the Alpha variant by Delta and by high prevalence at younger, less-vaccinated ages. Prevalence among unvaccinated people [1.21% (95% credible interval 1.03%, 1.41%)] was three times that among double-vaccinated people [0.40% (95% credible interval 0.34%, 0.48%)]. However, after adjusting for age and other variables, vaccine effectiveness for double-vaccinated people was estimated at between ~50% and ~60% during this period in England. Increased social mixing in the presence of Delta had the potential to generate sustained growth in infections, even at high levels of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3210650932,"Only a fraction of patients with cancer respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment, but current decision-making procedures have limited accuracy. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict ICB response by integrating genomic, molecular, demographic and clinical data from a comprehensively curated cohort (MSK-IMPACT) with 1,479 patients treated with ICB across 16 different cancer types. In a retrospective analysis, the model achieved high sensitivity and specificity in predicting clinical response to immunotherapy and predicted both overall survival and progression-free survival in the test data across different cancer types. Our model significantly outperformed predictions based on tumor mutational burden, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this purpose1. Additionally, the model provides quantitative assessments of the model features that are most salient for the predictions. We anticipate that this approach will substantially improve clinical decision-making in immunotherapy and inform future interventions. A combination of genomic and clinical features improves predictions of response to immune checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3208590696,"Aegilops tauschii, the diploid wild progenitor of the D subgenome of bread wheat, is a reservoir of genetic diversity for improving bread wheat performance and environmental resilience. Here we sequenced 242 Ae. tauschii accessions and compared them to the wheat D subgenome to characterize genomic diversity. We found that a rare lineage of Ae. tauschii geographically restricted to present-day Georgia contributed to the wheat D subgenome in the independent hybridizations that gave rise to modern bread wheat. Through k-mer-based association mapping, we identified discrete genomic regions with candidate genes for disease and pest resistance and demonstrated their functional transfer into wheat by transgenesis and wide crossing, including the generation of a library of hexaploids incorporating diverse Ae. tauschii genomes. Exploiting the genomic diversity of the Ae. tauschii ancestral diploid genome permits rapid trait discovery and functional genetic validation in a hexaploid background amenable to breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3209265180,"Background The global utilization of the physician assistant/associate (PA) is growing. Their increasing presence is in response to the rising demands of demographic changes, new developments in healthcare, and physician shortages. While PAs are present on four continents, the evidence of whether their employment contributes to more efficient healthcare has not been assessed in the aggregate. We undertook a systematic review of the literature on PA cost-effectiveness as compared to physicians. Cost-effectiveness was operationalized as quality, accessibility, and the cost of care. Methods and findings Literature to June 2021 was searched across five biomedical databases and filtered for eligibility. Publications that met the inclusion criteria were categorized by date, country, design, and results by three researchers independently. All studies were screened with the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies—of Interventions (ROBIN-I) tool. The literature search produced 4,855 titles, and after applying criteria, 39 studies met inclusion (34 North America, 4 Europe, 1 Africa). Ten studies had a prospective design, and 29 were retrospective. Four studies were assessed as biased in results reporting. While most studies included a small number of PAs, five studies were national in origin and assessed the employment of a few hundred PAs and their care of thousands of patients. In 34 studies, the PA was employed as a substitute for traditional physician services, and in five studies, the PA was employed in a complementary role. The quality of care delivered by a PA was comparable to a physician’s care in 15 studies, and in 18 studies, the quality of care exceeded that of a physician. In total, 29 studies showed that both labor and resource costs were lower when the PA delivered the care than when the physician delivered the care. Conclusions Most of the studies were of good methodological quality, and the results point in the same direction; PAs delivered the same or better care outcomes as physicians with the same or less cost of care. Sometimes this efficiency was due to their reduced labor cost and sometimes because they were more effective as producers of care and activity."
https://openalex.org/W3209680340,"Triacsins are an intriguing class of specialized metabolites possessing a conserved N-hydroxytriazene moiety not found in any other known natural products. Triacsins are notable as potent acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitors in lipid metabolism, yet their biosynthesis has remained elusive. Through extensive mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we here report all enzymes required to construct and install the N-hydroxytriazene pharmacophore of triacsins. Two distinct ATP-dependent enzymes were revealed to catalyze the two consecutive N-N bond formation reactions, including a glycine-utilizing, hydrazine-forming enzyme (Tri28) and a nitrite-utilizing, N-nitrosating enzyme (Tri17). This study paves the way for future mechanistic interrogation and biocatalytic application of enzymes for N-N bond formation."

https://openalex.org/W3208738780,"Boron is absent in proteins, yet is a micronutrient. It possesses unique bonding that could expand biological function including modes of Lewis acidity not available to typical elements of life. Here we show that post-translational Cβ-Bγ bond formation provides mild, direct, site-selective access to the minimally sized residue boronoalanine (Bal) in proteins. Precise anchoring of boron within complex biomolecular systems allows dative bond-mediated, site-dependent protein Lewis acid-base-pairing (LABP) by Bal. Dynamic protein-LABP creates tunable inter- and intramolecular ligand-host interactions, while reactive protein-LABP reveals reactively accessible sites through migratory boron-to-oxygen Cβ-Oγ covalent bond formation. These modes of dative bonding can also generate de novo function, such as control of thermo- and proteolytic stability in a target protein, or observation of transient structural features via chemical exchange. These results indicate that controlled insertion of boron facilitates stability modulation, structure determination, de novo binding activities and redox-responsive 'mutation'."
https://openalex.org/W3210999064,"Healthcare workers have had the longest and most direct exposure to COVID-19 and consequently may suffer from poor mental health. We conducted one of the first repeated multi-country analysis of the mental wellbeing of medical doctors (n = 5,275) at two timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020 and November/December 2020) to understand the prevalence of anxiety and depression, as well as associated risk factors. Rates of anxiety and depression were highest in Italy (24.6% and 20.1%, June 2020), second highest in Catalonia (15.9% and 17.4%, June 2020), and lowest in the UK (11.7% and 13.7%, June 2020). Across all countries, higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms were found among women, individuals below 60 years old, those feeling vulnerable/exposed at work, and those reporting normal/below-normal health. We did not find systematic differences in mental health measures between the two rounds of data collection, hence we cannot discard that the mental health repercussions of the pandemic are persistent."
https://openalex.org/W3129608985,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) demonstrates significant regional differences and a high incidence in Southeast Asia and Southern China. Bactericidal/permeability-increasing-fold- containing family B member 1 (BPIFB1) is a relatively specific and highly expressed protein in the nasopharyngeal epithelium. BPIFB1 expression is substantially downregulated in NPC and is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with NPC. However, the specific molecular mechanism by which BPIFB1 regulates NPC is not well understood. In this study, we found that BPIFB1 inhibits vasculogenic mimicry by regulating the metabolic reprogramming of NPC. BPIFB1 decreases GLUT1 transcription by downregulating the JNK/AP1 signaling pathway. Altered glycolysis reduces the acetylation level of histone and decreases the expression of vasculogenic mimicry-related genes, VEGFA, VE-cadherin, and MMP2, ultimately leading to the inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the role and specific mechanism of BPIFB1 as a tumor suppressor gene involved in regulating glycolysis and vasculogenic mimicry in NPC. Overall, these results provide a new therapeutic target for NPC diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3207986377,"With the onset of COVID-19 and the resulting shelter in place guidelines combined with remote working practices, human mobility in 2020 has been dramatically impacted. Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places (Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3211213979,"The transformation of China's economy from extensive growth to high-quality development is essentially an increase in green total factor productivity (GTFP). China currently has a range of environmental regulation tools, and the question of whether environmental regulation can promote improvement in China's GTFP requires theoretical and empirical analysis. This article first divides environmental regulation into three types: administrative, market-based and information-based. It then builds an empirical model of the effect of environmental regulation on GTFP. Slacks based measure-data envelope analysis (SBM-DEA) and the Malmquist index are used to measure the GTFP of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2018, and a measurement model of the impact of environmental regulation on GTFP is established. The results show that: (1) there are significant differences in GTFP in eastern, central and western China; (2) there is a non-linear relationship between environmental regulations and GTFP."
https://openalex.org/W3209470988,"To estimate the prevalence of disability among Syrian refugees living in Sultanbeyli district, Istanbul and compare people with and without disabilities in terms of demographic and socio-economic characteristics.Using the municipality refugee database as the sampling frame, 80 clusters of 50 people (aged 2+ years) were selected using probability proportionate to size sampling of clusters and random selection of households within clusters. Disability assessment included: i) self-reported difficulties in functioning (using the Washington Group Short Set-Enhanced tool and Child Functioning Modules), ii) Rapid Assessment of Musculoskeletal Impairment and iii) screening for symptoms of common mental disorders for children aged 8-17.The overall prevalence of disability was 24.7% (95% CI 22.1-27.4), when including people self-reporting a lot of difficulty/cannot do in at least functional domain (15%, 95% CI 13.1-17.2), moderate/severe MSI (8.7%, 95% CI 7.6-9.9), and/or symptomatic anxiety, depression and PTSD among children 8-17 (21.0%, 95% CI 18.2-23.9). Men with disabilities were significantly less likely to be in paid work compared to their peers without disabilities (aOR 0.3 95% CI 0.2-0.5). Overall 60% of households included at least one person with a disability. Households with at least one person with a disability had a significantly higher dependency ratio, lower proportion of working-age adults in paid work, and were more likely to be female headed and in receipt of social protection schemes (p<0.05).Disability is common among Syrian refugees in Sultanbeyli. People with disabilities in this setting experience greater vulnerability to poverty and exclusion from work, highlighting an urgent need for inclusive services, programmes and policies that are developed and implemented in partnership with people with disabilities."

https://openalex.org/W3209186839,"Farm workers are exposed to high risk of heat-related illness, especially when their jobs require working outside at a fast pace during hot days. Climate change has increased the number of days with high temperatures, and thereby the amount of time that farm workers are likely exposed to extreme heat. To better understand how high heat exposure affects farm workers, this study investigates how crop workers respond to heat exposure and estimates the effects of different pay and work arrangements on workers' responses to heat exposure. We explore, specifically, whether piece-rate arrangements increase workers' effort during periods with high heat exposure compared to workers paid by hourly wages. We use observational data from detailed measurements of localized heat exposure and individual workers' effort in the field. First, these results show workers adjust their effort in response to heat exposure when the heat exposure level changes. Second, piece-rate arrangements increase workers' effort during work shifts. Third, piece-rate arrangements allow workers to modify their effort more easily during different heat exposure levels. When facing low levels of heat exposure, workers who were paid by piece-rate arrangements exert a higher effort than workers paid by hourly wages, up until WBGT is 26.6˚C. When facing high levels of heat exposure (with WBGT exceeding 29.6˚C), workers paid by piece-rate arrangements lower their effort compared to workers paid by hourly wage arrangements."

Methods Between June 9-August 10, 2020, we conducted a self-administered survey among homeless shelter workers in Washington, Massachusetts, Utah, Maryland, and Georgia. We calculated frequencies for work environment, personal protective equipment use, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history. We used generalized linear models to produce unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Of the 106 respondents, 43.4% reported frequent close contact with clients; 75% were worried about work-related SARS-CoV-2 infections; 15% reported testing positive. Close contact with clients was associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PR 3.97, 95%CI 1.06, 14.93). Conclusions Homeless shelter workers may be at risk of being exposed to individuals with COVID-19 during the course of their work. Frequent close contact with clients was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Protecting these critical essential workers by implementing mitigation measures and prioritizing for COVID-19 vaccination is imperative during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3211194972,"Caffeic acid (CA) is known as an antioxidant to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the underlying mechanism of mediation of plant salt tolerance against various abiotic stresses by caffeic acid is only partially understood. A field experiment (120 days duration) was conducted to investigate the protective role of caffeic acid under a high saline medium (EC 8.7 dS m-1 and textural class: sandy loam) in two wheat genotypes (FSD -08 and Zincol-16). Two levels of caffeic acid (50 μM and 100 μM) were applied exogenously in combination with the salinity stress and results revealed that salt alleviation is more prominent when caffeic acid was applied at the rate of 100 μM. Under saline conditions, wheat genotypes show poor fresh and dry matter accumulation, chlorophyll contents, relative water contents (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI) and activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased uptake of Na+ ions. However, wheat genotype FSD-08 eminently responded to caffeic acid application as compared to wheat genotype Zincol-16 as demonstrated by higher growth indicators, RWC, MSI, activities of antioxidant enzymes, accumulation of mineral ions in grain along with yield attributes. In addition, caffeic acid also mitigated salt-induced oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents as well as significantly reduced Na+ uptake. It can be concluded that caffeic acid-induced salinity tolerance in wheat is attributed to improved plant water relations, K+ uptake, yield contents and activities of antioxidant stress enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3208418034,"Cyclone Amphan swept into Bangladesh's southwestern coast at the end of May 2020, wreaking havoc on food security and economic stability, as well as possibly worsening mental health. We studied the prevalence of post-cyclone stressors in adults following the cyclone and its association with symptoms of psychological distress.We conducted a cross-sectional study in a coastal district of Bangladesh. A five-item brief symptom rating scale was used to measure the symptoms of psychological distress. Household food insecurity was measured using the USAID Household Food Insecurity Access Scale questionnaire. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) using robust log-linear models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 478 adults (mean [SD] age, 37.0[12.6] years; 169[35.4%] women) participated in the study. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe psychological symptoms and suicidal ideation was 55.7% and 10.9%, respectively. Following the cyclone, 40.8% of the adults reported severe food insecurity, and 66% of them reported moderate-to-severe mental health symptoms. Also, 54.4% of women and 33.7% of men reported severe food insecurity in the households. Moreover, 25.5% of respondents reported no income or a significant income loss after the cyclone, and 65.5% of them had moderate-to-severe psychological symptoms. Also, 13.8% of respondents reported housing displacement because of severely damaged houses, and 68.2% of them reported moderate-to-severe psychological symptoms. The high prevalence of mental health symptoms was found in women (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.06-1.82), people with severe food insecurity (aPR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.01-2.64), and people who lost jobs or lost a major income source (aPR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02-1.54).Following cyclone Amphan, many low-income individuals saw their income drop drastically while others were unemployed and living with severe food insecurity. The result suggests gender inequalities in food-security after the cyclone. Immediate action is needed to ensure household food-security for reducing the burden of mental illness. Rising opportunities of paid-jobs and decreasing income-loss, especially for the poor people, can have a protective impact on psychological distress. However, due to the high prevalence of severe psychological symptoms, long-term mental health services are required among the population of coastal Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3210058212,"Characteristics of the sleep-site are thought to influence the quality and duration of primate sleep, yet only a handful of studies have investigated these links experimentally. Using actigraphy and infrared videography, we quantified sleep in four lemur species (Eulemur coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia rubra) under two different experimental conditions at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, NC, USA. Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of the sleep-site influences sleep. We obtained baseline data on normal sleep, and then, in a pair-wise study design, we compared the daily sleep times, inter-daily activity stability, and intra-daily activity variability of individuals in simultaneous experiments of sleep-site enrichment and sleep-site impoverishment. Over 164 24-hour periods from 8 individuals (2 of each species), we found evidence that enriched sleep-sites increased daily sleep times of lemurs, with an average increase of thirty-two minutes. The effect of sleep-site impoverishment was small and not statistically significant. Though our experimental manipulations altered inter-daily stability and intra-daily variability in activity patterns relative to baseline, the changes did not differ significantly between enriched and impoverished conditions. We conclude that properties of a sleep-site enhancing softness or insulation, more than the factors of surface area or stability, influence lemur sleep, with implications regarding the importance of nest building in primate evolution and the welfare and management of captive lemurs."
https://openalex.org/W3210850321,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease that affects 12 million people living mainly in developing countries. Herein, 24 new N-oxide-containing compounds were synthesized followed by in vitro and in vivo evaluation of their antileishmanial activity. Compound 4f, a furoxan derivative, was particularly remarkable in this regard, with EC50 value of 3.6 μM against L. infantum amastigote forms and CC50 value superior to 500 μM against murine peritoneal macrophages. In vitro studies suggested that 4f may act by a dual effect, by releasing nitric oxide after biotransformation and by inhibiting cysteine protease CPB (IC50: 4.5 μM). In vivo studies using an acute model of infection showed that compound 4f at 7.7 mg/Kg reduced ~90% of parasite burden in the liver and spleen of L. infantum-infected BALB/c mice. Altogether, these outcomes highlight furoxan 4f as a promising compound for further evaluation as an antileishmanial agent."
https://openalex.org/W3211239237,"Knowledge and beliefs of people on congenital malformations and their causes differ from society to society. As a result, there is a paucity of understanding community perceived knowledge and beliefs towards congenital malformations and their risk factors among children's parents. Therefore, I sought to identify perceived knowledge and beliefs of parents on congenital malformations and their causes.An in-depth discussion and interview were carried out on purposively selected forty participants (women and men) in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The data were collected from June to July, 2015. Semi-structured guiding topics/questions were used during the discussions and in-depth interviews. Note and audio records were taken while the participants discussed the topics. After the discussions and in-depth interviews were completed, the transcripts were read repeatedly to understand the participant's words, phrases, ideas, and concepts. Then notes were taken to combine pieces of similar transcripts. I have employed thematic framework analysis. The relevant transcripts were scrutinized, labeled and coded manually based on their relevance to the objective of the study. Then the coded transcripts were determined and categorized according to the type of thematic variables.The participants responded on three aspects of lived experience, perceived knowledge and beliefs on congenital malformations and their causes. Nearly half of the participants' beliefs on the causes of congenital malformations were related to sin, contraceptive pills, un-prescribed drugs/medication use, and fertilizers (that is eating crops grown by using fertilizers). Almost all said that raising a child with a major congenital malformation was very difficult. About half of the participants' belief on congenital malformations were traditional and resulted from poor awareness.The findings of the present study highlight the challenges and impacts of congenital malformations on parents who had children with and without congenital malformation. Lived experience, perceived knowledge and beliefs of children parents on congenital malformation and their causes can be helpful information for designing preventive actions. Hence, planning a preventive strategy and providing health education on congenital malformations and their causes for children parents are very necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4226343440,"The hypoxia-inducible nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 4-like 2 (NDUFA4L2) has been demonstrated to decrease oxidative phosphorylation and production of reactive oxygen species in neonatal cardiomyocytes, brain tissue and hypoxic domains of cancer cells. Prolonged local hypoxia can negatively affect skeletal muscle size and tissue oxidative capacity. Although skeletal muscle is a mitochondrial rich, oxygen sensitive tissue, the role of NDUFA4L2 in skeletal muscle has not previously been investigated. Here we ectopically expressed NDUFA4L2 in mouse skeletal muscles using adenovirus-mediated expression and in vivo electroporation. Moreover, femoral artery ligation (FAL) was used as a model of peripheral vascular disease to induce hind limb ischemia and muscle damage. Ectopic NDUFA4L2 expression resulted in reduced mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species followed by lowered AMP, ADP, ATP, and NAD+ levels without affecting the overall protein content of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Furthermore, ectopically expressed NDUFA4L2 caused a ~20% reduction in muscle mass that resulted in weaker muscles. The loss of muscle mass was associated with increased gene expression of atrogenes MurF1 and Mul1, and apoptotic genes caspase 3 and Bax. Finally, we showed that NDUFA4L2 was induced by FAL and that the Ndufa4l2 mRNA expression correlated with the reduced capacity of the muscle to generate force after the ischemic insult. These results show, for the first time, that mitochondrial NDUFA4L2 is a novel regulator of skeletal muscle mass and force. Specifically, induced NDUFA4L2 reduces mitochondrial activity leading to lower levels of important intramuscular metabolites, including adenine nucleotides and NAD+ , which are hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction and hence shows that dysfunctional mitochondrial activity may drive muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W3209569712,"Concussion is associated with disrupted cerebral blood flow (CBF), although there appears to be substantial inter-individual variability in CBF response. At present, the mechanisms of variable CBF response remain incompletely understood, but one potential contributor is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. In more severe forms of acquired brain injury, MMP up-regulation contributes to CBF impairments via increased blood-brain barrier permeability. A similar relationship is hypothesized for concussion, where recently concussed individuals with higher MMP levels have lower CBF. To test this hypothesis, 35 concussed athletes were assessed longitudinally at early symptomatic injury (median: 5 days post-injury) and at medical clearance (median: 24 days post-injury), along with 71 athletic controls. For all athletes, plasma MMPs were measured and arterial spin labelling was used to measure CBF. Consistent with our hypothesis, higher concentrations of MMP-2 and MMP-3 were correlated with lower global CBF. The correlations between MMPs and global CBF were also significantly diminished for concussed athletes at medical clearance and for athletic controls. These results indicate an inverse relationship between plasma MMP levels and CBF that is specific to the symptomatic phase of concussion. Analyses of regional CBF further showed that correlations with MMP levels exhibited some spatial specificity, with greatest effects in occipital, parietal and temporal lobes. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of post-concussion cerebrovascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3209683965,"Identifying necessary stream and watershed restoration actions requires quantifying natural potential habitat conditions to diagnose habitat change and evaluate restoration potential. We used three general methods of quantifying natural potential: historical maps and survey notes, contemporary reference sites, and models. Historical information was available only for the floodplain habitat analysis. We used contemporary reference sites to estimate natural potential habitat conditions for wood abundance, riparian shade, main channel length, and side channel length. For fine sediment, temperature, and beaver ponds we relied on models. We estimated a 90% loss of potential beaver pond area, 91% loss of side-channel length, and 92% loss or degradation of floodplain marshes and ponds. Spawning habitat area change due to wood loss ranged from -23% to -68% across subbasins. Other changes in habitat quantity or quality were smaller—either in magnitude or spatial extent—including rearing habitat areas, stream temperature, and accessible stream length. Historical floodplain habitat mapping provided the highest spatial resolution and certainty in locations and amounts of floodplain habitat lost or degraded, whereas use of the contemporary reference information provided less site specificity for wood abundance and side-channel length change. The models for fine sediment levels and beaver pond areas have the lowest reach-specific certainty, whereas the model of temperature change has higher certainty because it is based on a detailed riparian inventory. Despite uncertainties at the reach level, confidence in subbasin-level estimates of habitat change is moderate to high because accuracy increases as data are aggregated over multiple reaches. Our results show that the largest habitat losses were floodplain and beaver pond habitats, but use of these habitat change results in salmon life-cycle models can illustrate how the potential benefits of alternative habitat restoration actions varies among species with differing habitat preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3210368147,"There are currently no reliable, established serum biomarkers to predict the prognosis of radiotherapy for advanced cervical cancer. We aimed to identify serum biomarkers for survival after radiotherapy for cervical cancer. In this multicenter prospective cohort study, the usefulness of pre- and posttreatment serum protein levels of potential biomarkers, including squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag), apolipoprotein C-II (ApoC-II), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, and MMP2, were evaluated together with clinical factors in 145 cervical cancer patients in order to determine their suitability to predict survival. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, and overall survival (OS), pelvic PFS (PPFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were the secondary endpoints. Blood samples were collected before and 1 month after radiotherapy to measure serum biomarker levels. ApoC-II was measured using a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was developed for this purpose. Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analyses. In multivariate analysis, larger tumor size was independently associated with shorter PFS, OS, PPFS, and DMFS, while longer overall treatment time was independently associated with shorter PPFS. Higher pretreatment SCC-Ag (P < 0.001) was associated with shorter DMFS. Higher posttreatment SCC-Ag (P = 0.017) was also associated with shorter DMFS. Pretreatment ApoC-II was associated with PPFS in univariate analysis (P = 0.048), but not in multivariate analysis. Patients with pretreatment ApoC-II levels ≤ 25.8 μg/ml had shorter PPFS than those with pretreatment ApoC-II levels > 25.8 μg/ml (P = 0.023, log-rank test). Pre- and posttreatment serum SCC-Ag and pretreatment serum ApoC-II levels may be important biomarkers to predict survival outcomes of patients with cervical cancer after radiotherapy. Pre- and posttreatment SCC-Ag and pretreatment ApoC-II might be useful in clinical settings for screening patients to improve treatment strategies in cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3210782533,"Polioviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA picornaviruses and the principal cause of poliomyelitis. Global poliovirus surveillance has relied on poliovirus isolation in cells, which may take a minimum of 10 days, involves maintaining two cell lines, and propagates virus in high titers. With eradication underway, a major objective of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is to develop culture-independent detection of polioviruses as an alternative method to complement the current virus isolation technique. A culture-independent method on poliovirus-positive stool suspensions was assessed with commercially available recombinant soluble poliovirus receptor (PVR) coupled to Histidine (His) tags. Viral RNA was screened by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR using the poliovirus intratypic differentiation kit. Poliovirus recovery was optimized with PVR-His–tagged protein and buffers supplemented with polyethylene glycol. To validate the poliovirus-PVR–His tag purification assay, 182 poliovirus-positive stools of programmatic importance were parallel tested against the GPLN-accepted virus isolation method. The PVR-His tag enrichment method detected poliovirus in 164 of 171 poliovirus-positive stools, whereas the virus isolation method misidentified 38 stools as poliovirus-negative (McNemar χ 2 p &lt;0.0001). Using this method in combination with RNA extraction, viral RNA recovery increased and showed similar (WPV1) or higher (Sabin 1) sensitivity than the World Health Organization accredited variation of the virus isolation method. The PVR-His enrichment method could be a viable addition to poliovirus surveillance; similar methods have the potential to capture other human pathogens such as EV71 using an appropriate soluble His tag receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3211246157,"Background This study aims to understand how participants’ compliance and response rates to both traditional validated surveys and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) vary across 4 cohorts who participated in the same mHealth study and received the same surveys and EMAs on their smartphones, however with cohort-specific time-triggers that differed across the 4 cohorts. Methods As part of the Smart Platform, adult citizen scientists residing in Regina and Saskatoon, Canada, were randomly assigned to 4 cohorts in 2018. Citizen Scientists provided a complex series of subjective and objective data during 8 consecutive days using a custom-built smartphone application. All citizen scientists responded to both validated surveys and EMAs that captured physical activity. However, using Smart Platform, we varied the burden of responding to validated surveys and EMAs across cohorts by using different time-triggered push notifications. Participants in Cohort 1 (n = 10) received the full baseline 209-item validated survey on day 1 of the study; whereas participants in cohorts 2 (n = 26), 3 (n = 10), and 4 (n = 25) received the same survey in varied multiple sections over a period of 4 days. We used weighted One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests and weighted, linear regression models to assess for differences in compliance rate across the cohort groups controlling for age, gender, and household income. Results Compliance to EMAs that captured prospective physical activity varied across cohorts 1 to 4: 50.0% (95% Confidence Interval [C.I.] = 31.4, 68.6), 63.0% (95% C.I. = 50.7, 75.2), 37.5% (95% C.I. = 18.9, 56.1), and 61.2% (95% C.I. = 47.4, 75.0), respectively. The highest completion rate of physical activity validated surveys was observed in Cohort 4 (mean = 97.9%, 95% C.I. = 95.5, 100.0). This was also true after controlling for age, gender, and household income. The regression analyses showed that citizen scientists in Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 had significantly higher compliance with completing the physical activity validated surveys relative to citizen scientists in cohort group 1 who completed the full survey on the first day. Conclusions &amp; significances The findings show that maximizing the compliance rates of research participants for digital epidemiological and mHealth studies requires a balance between rigour of data collection, minimization of survey burden, and adjustment of time- and user-triggered notifications based on citizen or patient input."
https://openalex.org/W4226298632,"Rho-kinase (ROK)-mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases. Previously we demonstrated Fyn tyrosine kinase as an upstream molecule of ROK to mediate actin stress fiber formation that plays an important role in cell migration, but the molecular mechanism between the two kinases was unclear. To discover a novel signaling molecule that exists between Fyn and ROK, we identified paxillin acting downstream of the active Fyn by combined use of pulldown assay and mass spectrometry. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed co-localization of Fyn and paxillin at the ends of actin stress fibers in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs). Surface plasmon resonance assay demonstrated direct binding between constitutively active Fyn (CA-Fyn) and N-terminus of paxillin (N-pax). The sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC)-induced ROK activation, actin stress fiber formation and cell migration were inhibited by paxillin knockdown, which were rescued by full-length paxillin (FL-pax) but not N-pax. N-pax co-localized with CA-Fyn at the cytosol and overexpression of N-pax inhibited the SPC-induced actin stress fiber formation and cell migration, indicating that the direct binding of FL-pax and CA-Fyn at the ends of actin stress fibers is essential for the ROK-mediated actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. Paxillin, as a novel signalling molecule, mediates the SPC-induced actin stress fiber formation and migration in human CASMCs via the Fyn/paxillin/ROK signalling pathway by direct binding of active Fyn."
https://openalex.org/W3209553869,"Spontaneous abortion is an impeding factor for the success rates of human assistant reproductive technology (ART). Causes of spontaneous abortion include not only the pregnant mothers' health conditions and lifestyle habits, but also the fetal development potential. Evidences had shown that fetal chromosome aneuploidy is associated with fetal spontaneous abortion, however, it is still not definite that whether other genome variants, like copy number variations (CNVs) or loss of heterozygosity (LOHs) is associated with the spontaneous abortion. To assess the relationship between the fetal genome variants and abortion during ART, a chromosomal microarray data including chromosomal information of 184 spontaneous aborted fetuses, 147 adult female patients and 78 adult male patients during ART were collected. We firstly analyzed the relationship of fetal aneuploidy with maternal ages and then compared the numbers and lengths of CNVs (< 4Mbp) and LOHs among adults and aborted fetuses. In addition to the already known association between chromosomal aneuploidy and maternal ages, from the chromosomal microarray data we found that the numbers and the accumulated lengths of short CNVs and LOHs in the aborted fetuses were significantly larger or longer than those in adults. Our findings indicated that the increased numbers and accumulated lengths of CNVs or LOHs might be associated with the spontaneous abortion during ART."
https://openalex.org/W3210484048,"Individual patient data (IPD) present particular advantages in network meta-analysis (NMA) because interactions may lead an aggregated data (AD)-based model to wrong a treatment effect (TE) estimation. However, fewer works have been conducted for IPD with time-to-event contrary to binary outcomes. We aimed to develop a general frequentist one-step model for evaluating TE in the presence of interaction in a three-node NMA for time-to-event data.One-step, frequentist, IPD-based Cox and Poisson generalized linear mixed models were proposed. We simulated a three-node network with or without a closed loop with (1) no interaction, (2) covariate-treatment interaction, and (3) covariate distribution heterogeneity and covariate-treatment interaction. These models were applied to the NMA (Meta-analyses of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer [MACH-NC] and Radiotherapy in Carcinomas of Head and Neck [MARCH]), which compared the addition of chemotherapy or modified radiotherapy (mRT) to loco-regional treatment with two direct comparisons. AD-based (contrast and meta-regression) models were used as reference.In the simulated study, no IPD models failed to converge. IPD-based models performed well in all scenarios and configurations with small bias. There were few variations across different scenarios. In contrast, AD-based models performed well when there were no interactions, but demonstrated some bias when interaction existed and a larger one when the modifier was not distributed evenly. While meta-regression performed better than contrast-based only, it demonstrated a large variability in estimated TE. In the real data example, Cox and Poisson IPD-based models gave similar estimations of the model parameters. Interaction decomposition permitted by IPD explained the ecological bias observed in the meta-regression.The proposed general one-step frequentist Cox and Poisson models had small bias in the evaluation of a three-node network with interactions. They performed as well or better than AD-based models and should also be undertaken whenever possible."

https://openalex.org/W3209184187,"Dietary acrylamide is found in certain foods, such as deep frying, baking and roasting, and is associated with higher inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters. The association between dietary acrylamide and physical performance has not yet been explored. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between dietary acrylamide intake and physical performance tests in a large cohort of North American individuals affected by knee osteoarthritis or at high risk for this condition.Dietary acrylamide intake was obtained through a food frequency questionnaire and reported in quartiles and as an increase in deciles. Physical performance was explored using the 20-meter usual pace test, the 400-meter walking distance, and the chair stands time. The association between dietary acrylamide and physical performance tests was explored using linear regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders.4,436 participants (2,578 women, mean age: 61.3) were enrolled. People in the highest quartile of dietary acrylamide reported significantly longer 20-meter walking (15.53±3.32 vs. 15.15±2.91 s), 400-meter walking (312±54 vs. 305±58 s) and chair stands (11.36±4.08 vs. 10.67±3.50 s) times than their counterparts in Q1. In adjusted linear regression analyses, each increase in one decile in dietary acrylamide was associated with a longer time in walking for 20 meters (beta = 0.032; 95%CI: 0.016-0.048; p = 0.04), 400 meters (beta = 0.048; 95%CI: 0.033-0.063; p = 0.002) and chair stands (beta = 0.016; 95%CI: 0.005-0.037; p = 0.04) times.Higher dietary acrylamide intake was significantly associated with poor physical performance, also after accounting for potential confounders, suggesting a role for this food contaminant as a possible risk factor for sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W3209260375,"The analysis of brain-imaging data requires complex processing pipelines to support findings on brain function or pathologies. Recent work has shown that variability in analytical decisions, small amounts of noise, or computational environments can lead to substantial differences in the results, endangering the trust in conclusions. We explored the instability of results by instrumenting a structural connectome estimation pipeline with Monte Carlo Arithmetic to introduce random noise throughout. We evaluated the reliability of the connectomes, the robustness of their features, and the eventual impact on analysis. The stability of results was found to range from perfectly stable (i.e. all digits of data significant) to highly unstable (i.e. 0 - 1 significant digits). This paper highlights the potential of leveraging induced variance in estimates of brain connectivity to reduce the bias in networks without compromising reliability, alongside increasing the robustness and potential upper-bound of their applications in the classification of individual differences. We demonstrate that stability evaluations are necessary for understanding error inherent to brain imaging experiments, and how numerical analysis can be applied to typical analytical workflows both in brain imaging and other domains of computational sciences, as the techniques used were data and context agnostic and globally relevant. Overall, while the extreme variability in results due to analytical instabilities could severely hamper our understanding of brain organization, it also affords us the opportunity to increase the robustness of findings."
https://openalex.org/W3209775712,"Objectives To assess the distribution of bone erosions and two erosion scores in the feet of patients with gout and analyze the association between erosion scores and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT). Materials and methods We included all patients who underwent DECT of both feet between 2016 and 2019 in our radiology department, with positive detection of MSU deposits. Data on sex, age, treatment, serum urate, and DECT urate volumes were obtained. CT images were analyzed to score bone erosions in 31 sites per foot by using the semi-quantitative method based on the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Scoring (RAMRIS) system and the Dalbeth-simplified score. Reproducibility for the two scores was calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Correlations between clinical features, erosion scores and urate crystal volume were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient (r). Results We studied 61 patients (mean age 62.0 years); 3,751 bones were scored. The first metatarsophalangeal joint and the midfoot were the most involved in terms of frequency and severity of bone erosions. The distribution of bone erosions was not asymmetrical. The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was similar for the RAMRIS and Dalbeth-simplified scores (ICC 0.93 vs 0.94 and 0.96 vs 0.90). DECT urate volume was significantly correlated with each of the two erosion scores (r = 0.58–0.63, p &lt; 0.001). There was a high correlation between the two scores (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions DECT demonstrates that foot erosions are not asymmetric in distribution and predominate at the first ray and midfoot. The two erosion scores are significantly correlated with DECT urate volume. An almost perfect correlation between the RAMRIS and Dalbeth-simplified scores is observed."
https://openalex.org/W3210979092,"Predicting the effect of mutations on protein-protein interactions is important for relating structure to function, as well as for in silico affinity maturation. The effect of mutations on protein-protein binding energy (ΔΔG) can be predicted by a variety of atomic simulation methods involving full or limited flexibility, and explicit or implicit solvent. Methods which consider only limited flexibility are naturally more economical, and many of them are quite accurate, however results are dependent on the atomic coordinate set used. In this work we perform a sequence and structure based search of the Protein Data Bank to find additional coordinate sets and repeat the calculation on each. The method increases precision and Positive Predictive Value, and decreases Root Mean Square Error, compared to using single structures. Given the ongoing growth of near-redundant structures in the Protein Data Bank, our method will only increase in applicability and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3208188909,"In cochlear implant (CI) users, measurements of electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) prove the functionality of the neuron-electrode interface. Objective measures, e.g., the ECAP threshold, may serve as a basis for the clinical adjustment of the device for the optimal benefit of the CI user. As for many neural responses, the threshold determination often is based on the subjective assessment of the clinical specialist, whose decision-making process could be aided by autonomous computational algorithms. To that end, we extended the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approach for ECAP threshold determination to be applicable for FineGrain (FG) ECAP responses. The new approach takes advantage of two features: the FG stimulation paradigm with its enhanced resolution of recordings, and SNR-based ECAP threshold determination, which allows defining thresholds independently of morphology and with comparably low computational power. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r between the ECAP threshold determined by five experienced evaluators and the threshold determined with the FG-SNR algorithm was in the range of r = 0.78–0.93. Between evaluators, r was in a comparable range of 0.84–0.93. A subset of the parameters of the algorithm was varied to identify the parameters with the highest potential to improve the FG-SNR formalism in the future. The two steps with the strongest influence on the agreement between the threshold estimate of the evaluators and the algorithm were the removal of undesired frequency components (denoising of the response traces) and the exact determination of the two time windows (signal and noise and noise only).”The parameters were linked to the properties of an ECAP response, indicating how to adjust the algorithm for the automatic detection of other neurophysiological responses."

We assessed the effect of a health voucher scheme (HVS) and micro-health insurance (MHI) scheme on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments and the cost of implementing such schemes.HVS and MHI schemes were implemented by Concern Worldwide through selected NGO health centres, referral hospitals, and private healthcare facilities in three City Corporations of Bangladesh from December 2016 to March 2020. A household survey with 1,294 enrolees, key-informant interviews, focus group discussions, consultative meetings, and document reviews were conducted for extracting data on healthcare utilisation, OOP payments, views of enrolees, and suggestions of implementers, and costs of services at the point of care.Healthcare utilisation including maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) services, particularly from medically trained providers, was higher and OOP payments were lower among the scheme enrolees compared to corresponding population groups in general. The beneficiaries were happy with their access to healthcare, especially for MNCH services, and their perceived quality of care was fair enough. They, however, suggested expanding the benefits package, supported by an additional workforce. The cost per beneficiary household for providing services per year was €32 in HVS and €15 in MHI scheme.HVS and MHI schemes enabled higher healthcare utilisation at lower OOP payments among the enrolees, who were happy with their access to healthcare, particularly for MNCH services. However, they suggested a larger benefits package in future. The provider's costs of the schemes were reasonable; however, there are potentials of cost containment by purchasing the health services for their beneficiaries in a competitive basis from the market. Scaling up such schemes addressing the drawback would contribute to achieving universal health coverage."

The objective was to study the safety and effect of a combination of music and abdominally administered low-frequency vibrations on pain intensity in elderly patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.This trial was an international multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study. Patients at age ≥ 65 years with musculoskeletal pain for ≥ 3 months and a daily pain score ≥ 4 out of 10 were recruited at three centers. They were randomized to receive either a combination of music and low-frequency (20-100 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen, or a combination with the same music but with higher frequency (200-300 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen. Low-frequency vibrations were expected to result in pain reduction measured with a numeric pain rating scale (NRS). Patients in both groups received eight treatments of the music combined with the vibrations in three weeks. Primary outcomes were safety (Serious Adverse Events) and pain intensity measured at baseline, after the last treatment and at six weeks follow-up. Multilevel linear model analyses were performed to study group and time effects.A total of 45 patients were analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle. After 344 treatments, 1 Adverse Event was found related to the intervention, while 13 Adverse Events were possibly related. A multilevel linear model showed that the interaction effect of group by time did not predict pain intensity (F[1, 45.93] = 0.002, p = 0.97) when comparing pain intensity at baseline, after the last treatment and at follow-up.The combination of music and abdominally administered vibrations was found to be safe and well tolerated by the elderly patients. However, over time, neither the low-frequency treatment group nor the high-frequency treatment group provided clinically meaningful pain relief. There is no evidence that the low-frequency treatment elicited vagal nerve stimulation.The trial was prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR: NL7606) on 21-03-2019."
https://openalex.org/W3208414632,"Caloric restriction (CR) is one of the most important behavioral interventions to reduce excessive abdominal adiposity, which is a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance. Previous metabolomics studies have characterized substrate metabolism during healthy conditions; however, the effects of CR and subsequent mass recovery on shifts in substrate metabolism during insulin resistance (IR) have not been widely investigated. To assess the effects of acute CR and the subsequent mass recovery on shifts in substrate metabolism, a cohort of 15-week old Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) and Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were calorie restricted (CR: 50% × 10 days) with or without partial body mass recovery (PR; 73% x 7 days), along with their respective ad libitum controls. End-of-study plasma samples were analyzed for primary carbon metabolites by gas chromatography (GC) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) data acquisition. Data analysis included PCA, Pearson correlation vs previously reported variables (adipose and body masses, and insulin resistance index, IRI), and metabolomics maps (MetaMapp) generated for the most significant group comparisons. All treatments elicited a significant group differentiation in at least one principal component. CR improved TCA cycle in OLETF, and increased lipolysis and proteolysis. These changes were reversed after PR except for gluconeogenesis. Plasma lipid concentrations were inversely correlated to IRI in LETO, but not OLETF. These shifts in substrate metabolism suggest that the CR-induced decreases in adipose may not be sufficient to more permanently alter substrate metabolism to improve IR status during metabolic syndrome."

In England, the aim is to reduce GNBSI cases and further deterioration through enhanced population surveillance of patients with a laboratory-confirmed GNBSI to inform on healthcare policies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with a laboratory-confirmed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella or Pseudomonas aeruginosa GNBSIs, with data obtained from the enhanced data capture for the surveillance of GNBSIs. All patients with a laboratory-confirmed GNBSI at a single centre, admitted between April 2017 and March 2019, were included in this retrospective observational study. Demographic and recent exposure to healthcare risk factors were collected and assessed for the association with in-hospital mortality. In 1113 patients with laboratory-confirmed GNBSIs, the in-hospital mortality rate was 13%. Multivariable analysis confirmed that patients with respiratory (OR = 3.73, 95%CI = 2.05-6.76), gastrointestinal (2.61; 1.22-5.58) or skin (3.61; 1.24-10.54) infection primary focus had a greater risk of in-hospital mortality, compared to upper urinary tract infections. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was also observed in patients with hospital-onset GNBSIs (OR = 1.87; 1.17-2.97) compared with community-onset healthcare acquired GNBSIs, or who were on dialysis at the time of the GNBSI (3.28; 1.01-10.14), as well as in patients who had recently been discharged from hospital (1.55; 1.01-2.38), or had a vascular device recently manipulated (2.41; 1.01-5.74). Results confirm that the data obtained from the enhanced data capture for GNBSIs in England can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with a GNBSI. Several factors associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality have been identified. Results should be reported back to clinicians in order to identify patients at a greater risk of dying in-hospital who may benefit from further monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3208894732,"Searching similar pictures for a given picture is an important task in numerous applications, including image recommendation system, image classification and image retrieval. Previous studies mainly focused on the similarities of content, which measures similarities based on visual features, such as color and shape, and few of them pay enough attention to semantics. In this paper, we propose a link-based semantic similarity search method, namely PictureSim, for effectively searching similar pictures by building a picture-tag network. The picture-tag network is built by ""description"" relationships between pictures and tags, in which tags and pictures are treated as nodes, and relationships between pictures and tags are regarded as edges. Then we design a TF-IDF-based model to removes the noisy links, so the traverses of these links can be reduced. We observe that ""similar pictures contain similar tags, and similar tags describe similar pictures"", which is consistent with the intuition of the SimRank. Consequently, we utilize the SimRank algorithm to compute the similarity scores between pictures. Compared with content-based methods, PictureSim could effectively search similar pictures semantically.

Despite the ubiquity of norovirus outbreaks in child-care centers, little is known about the extent of this burden within the child-care center and the surrounding household clusters. Therefore, we performed an in-depth analysis of a gastroenteritis outbreak to examine the patterns of transmissions, household attack rates and the basic reproduction number (R0) for Norovirus in a child-care facility. We used data from parental interviews of suspected cases sent home with gastroenteritis at a child-care center between 24th of August and 18th of September 2020. A total of 52 persons in 19 household clusters were symptomatic in this outbreak investigation. Of all transmissions, 23 (46.9%) occurred in the child-care center, the rest occurring in households. We found a household attack rate of 36.5% (95% CI 27.3, 47.1%). Serial intervals were estimated as mean 2.5 ± SD1.45 days. The R0, using time-dependent methods during the growth phase of the outbreak (days 2 to 8) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.50, 3.50). The count of affected persons of a child-care center norovirus outbreak is approximately double the count of the total symptomatic staff and attending children. In the study setting, each symptomatic child-care attendee likely infected one other child-care attendee or staff and just over one household contact on average."
https://openalex.org/W3210114124,"Peptide-based vaccines have demonstrated to be an important way to induce long-lived immune responses and, therefore, a promising strategy in the rational of vaccine development. As to malaria, among the classic vaccine targets, the Apical membrane antigen (AMA-1) was proven to have important B cell epitopes that can induce specific immune response and, hence, became key players for a vaccine approach. The peptides selection was carried out using a bioinformatic approach based on Hidden Markov Models profiles of known antigens and propensity scale methods based on hydrophilicity and secondary structure prediction. The antigenicity of the selected B-cell peptides was assessed by multiple serological assays using sera from acute P.vivax infected subjects. The synthetic peptides were recognized by 45.5%, 48.7% and 32.2% of infected subjects for peptides I, II and III respectively. Moreover, when synthetized together (tripeptide), the reactivity increases up to 62%, which is comparable to the reactivity found against the whole protein PvAMA-1 (57%). Furthermore, IgG reactivity against the tripeptide after depletion was reduced by 42%, indicating that these epitopes may be responsible for a considerable part of the protein immunogenicity. These results represent an excellent perspective regarding future chimeric vaccine constructions that may come to contemplate several targets with the potential to generate the robust and protective immune response that a vivax malaria vaccine needs to succeed."

Upon observing a high rate of FHC after hip IACSI, we sought to (1) describe how we addressed the problem through a systematic evaluation of clinical data and institutional care practices followed by process improvement efforts; and (2) report our results.Patients receiving hip IACSI during a 27-month period underwent retrospective review to determine the rate of FHC and to identify associated patient factors or practice shortfalls. Findings led to institution-wide interventions: (1) to improve patient/provider awareness of this association; and (2) to develop/implement practice guidelines. Rates of FHC after hip IACSI and practice patterns among providers before and after intervention were compared.Initial FHC rate after hip IACSI was 20.4%. Patient-related factors included body mass index (p = 0.025), history of cancer therapy (p = 0.012), Vitamin D level (p = 0.030), and multiple injections (p = 0.004). Volume/dose of injectate and post-injection surveillance methods varied widely. Quality improvement (QI) intervention resulted in fewer treatment referrals (from 851 to 436), fewer repeat injections (mean = 1.61 to 1.37; p = 0.0006), and a 5% lower FHC rate (p = 0.1292). Variation in practice patterns persisted, so a systems-based Clinical Pathway was established.When a high rate of FHC after hip IACSI was found to be associated with certain patient and practice factors, introduction of education materials and treatment guidelines decreased number of referrals, number of injections per patient, and FHC rate. In the absence of the systems-based Pathway, the type, dose, and volume of injectate and post-procedure follow-up remained variable."

The objective is to examine, through an occupational lens, the literature reporting objective RTW outcomes and experiences in transgender people to (a) synthesize what is known about return to work (full-time, part-time, or self-employed) and (b) describe which gaps persist.Several databases and the gray literature were explored systematically. Studies between November 1, 2006 and March 1, 2021 revealing RTW quantitative and qualitative data of adult transgender people were eligible. This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019128395) on April 30, 2019.Among the 14,592 articles initially identified, 97 fulfilled the inclusion criteria which resulted in 20 being analyzed. Objective RTW outcomes, such as number of RTW attempts, time to RTW or number of sick days, were lacking; thus, other relevant work outcomes were reported. Compared to the general population, lower employment rates and more economic distress were observed, with trans women in particular saying that their work situation had deteriorated. Research on positive RTW experiences was highlighted by the importance of disclosure, the support from especially managers and coworkers who acted as mediators, personal coping, and a transition plan along with work accommodations. Negative work experiences, such as demotion, lay-offs, and discrimination were often prominent together with a lack of knowledge of trans issues among all stakeholders, including occupational health professionals.Few studies have explored employment characteristics and experiences of transgender people (TP). RTW is a dynamic process along with transition in itself, which should be tailored through supportive policies, education, a transition plan and work accommodations with the help of external experts. Future studies should include more occupational information and report RTW outcomes to enhance our knowledge about the guidance of TP and to make way for interventional studies."

The correctness of the SECCESPP scheme is demonstrated by the consistency of the message and the accuracy of the equation. The security and privacy of the SECCESPP scheme are demonstrated based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model and are formally analyzed with the formal analysis tool ProVerif, respectively. Theory and experimental analysis show that the SECCESPP scheme is more efficient than other schemes."
https://openalex.org/W3211143464,"Despite recent emphasis and implementation of national and international anti-money laundering policies, illegal product markets, and their associated illicit profit remain a global problem. In addition to law enforcement aimed at reducing money-laundering, enforcement also takes place during (1) the production (e.g. crop eradication) and (2) sale (e.g. seizure of products during transportation that interrupts buyer and seller transactions) of the illegal product. Since funds for enforcement come from limited budgets, understanding where in this production-trade-laundering cycle law enforcement is most impactful becomes a global question. Using laboratory experimental markets and a seizure rate of 20%, we find that law enforcement focused on seizing laundered profits does little to reduce illegal market activity when compared to no law enforcement, suggesting that focusing law enforcement on money laundering will likely be ineffective at reducing crime. Results further show the amount of illicit trade is nearly 32% lower when law enforcement is focused at the point of sale, and there may be additional economic incentives that reduce illicit trade in the long run when compared to no law enforcement. Enforcement at the point of production also reduces market activity, but not as effectively as enforcement at the point of sale. Lastly, the empirical findings deviate from equilibrium predictions, suggesting law enforcement policy based on theory alone may lead to inefficient allocation of limited law enforcement resources."
