https://openalex.org/W2121963977,"Soluble oligomers are common to most amyloids and may represent the primary toxic species of amyloids, like the Abeta peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that all of the soluble oligomers tested display a common conformation-dependent structure that is unique to soluble oligomers regardless of sequence. The in vitro toxicity of soluble oligomers is inhibited by oligomer-specific antibody. Soluble oligomers have a unique distribution in human AD brain that is distinct from fibrillar amyloid. These results indicate that different types of soluble amyloid oligomers have a common structure and suggest they share a common mechanism of toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2084880831,"Rapid induction of type I interferon expression, a central event in establishing the innate antiviral response, requires cooperative activation of numerous transcription factors. Although signaling pathways that activate the transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun have been well characterized, activation of the interferon regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 has remained a critical missing link in understanding interferon signaling. We report here that the IkappaB kinase (IKK)-related kinases IKKepsilon and TANK-binding kinase 1 are components of the virus-activated kinase that phosphorylate IRF-3 and IRF-7. These studies illustrate an essential role for an IKK-related kinase pathway in triggering the host antiviral response to viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1990381590,"Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation occurs in many human cancers, but whether this epigenetic change is a cause or consequence of tumorigenesis has been unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we generated mice carrying a hypomorphic DNA methyltransferase 1 ( Dnmt1 ) allele, which reduces Dnmt1 expression to 10% of wild-type levels and results in substantial genome-wide hypomethylation in all tissues. The mutant mice were runted at birth, and at 4 to 8 months of age they developed aggressive T cell lymphomas that displayed a high frequency of chromosome 15 trisomy. These results indicate that DNA hypomethylation plays a causal role in tumor formation, possibly by promoting chromosomal instability."

We describe experiments with poly(1,2-butadiene-b-ethylene oxide) (PB-PEO) diblock copolymers, which form Y-junctions and three-dimensional networks in water at weight fractions of PEOintermediate to those associated with vesicle and wormlike micelle morphologies. Fragmentation of the network produces a nonergodic array of complex reticulated particles that have been imaged by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Data obtained with two sets of PB-PEOcompounds indicate that this type of self-assembly appears above a critical molecular weight. These block copolymers represent versatile amphiphiles, mimicking certain low molecular weight three-component (surfactant/water/oil) microemulsions, without addition of a separate hydrophobe."
https://openalex.org/W2046714103,"Persistent infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are likely to depend on viral inhibition of host defenses. We show that the HCV NS3/4A serine protease blocks the phosphorylation and effector action of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), a key cellular antiviral signaling molecule. Disruption of NS3/4A protease function by mutation or a ketoamide peptidomimetic inhibitor relieved this blockade and restored IRF-3 phosphorylation after cellular challenge with an unrelated virus. Furthermore, dominant-negative or constitutively active IRF-3 mutants, respectively, enhanced or suppressed HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. Thus, the NS3/4A protease represents a dual therapeutic target, the inhibition of which may both block viral replication and restore IRF-3 control of HCV infection."

These ""super"" properties are attributable to a dislocation-free plastic deformation mechanism. In cold-worked alloys, this mechanism forms elastic strain fields of hierarchical structure that range in size from the nanometer scale to several tens of micrometers. The resultant elastic strain energy leads to a number of enhanced material properties."

Here we show that rearing infant rat pups in continuous, moderate-level noise delayed the emergence of adultlike topographic representational order and the refinement of response selectivity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) long beyond normal developmental benchmarks. When those noise-reared adult rats were subsequently exposed to a pulsed pure-tone stimulus, A1 rapidly reorganized, demonstrating that exposure-driven plasticity characteristic of the critical period was still ongoing. These results demonstrate that A1 organization is shaped by a young animal's exposure to salient, structured acoustic inputs-and implicate noise as a risk factor for abnormal child development."

We then ""replayed"" the wing kinematics on a dynamically scaled robotic model to measure the aerodynamic forces produced by the wings. The results show that a fly generates rapid turns with surprisingly subtle modifications in wing motion, which nonetheless generate sufficient torque for the fly to rotate its body through each turn. The magnitude and time course of the torque and body motion during rapid turns indicate that inertia, not friction, dominates the flight dynamics of insects."

https://openalex.org/W1966779855,"Besides driving contraction of various types of muscle tissue, conventional (class II) myosins serve essential cellular functions and are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells. Three different isoforms in the human myosin complement have been identified as non-muscle class II myosins. Here we report the kinetic characterization of a human non-muscle myosin IIB subfragment-1 construct produced in the baculovirus expression system. Transient kinetic data show that most steps of the actomyosin ATPase cycle are slowed down compared with other class II myosins. The ADP affinity of subfragment-1 is unusually high even in the presence of actin filaments, and the rate of ADP release is close to the steady-state ATPase rate. Thus, non-muscle myosin IIB subfragment-1 spends a significantly higher proportion of its kinetic cycle strongly attached to actin than do the muscle myosins. This feature is even more pronounced at slightly elevated ADP levels, and it may be important in carrying out the cellular functions of this isoform working in small filamentous assemblies.

This feature is even more pronounced at slightly elevated ADP levels, and it may be important in carrying out the cellular functions of this isoform working in small filamentous assemblies. Myosins are a superfamily of actin-dependent molecular motors that can be subdivided into at least 18 classes based on sequence (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The “founding members” of this superfamily, the conventional filament-forming myosins that participate in muscle contraction and cytokinesis, are now classified as class II, including three whose products are typically found in the cytoskeleton and are not directly involved in muscle contraction. These three myosins are commonly called non-muscle myosins IIA, IIB, and IIC (NMIIA, 1The abbreviations used are: NMIIA, NMIIB, and NMIIC, non-muscle myosins IIA, IIB, and IIC, respectively; S1, subfragment-1; mant-, N-methylanthraniloyl-; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MDCC-PBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin 3-carboxamide-labeled A197C point mutant bacterial phosphate-binding protein. NMIIB, and NMIIC, respectively). Like their muscle myosin counterparts, these proteins are hexameric with two enzymatically active heads that interact with actin and ATP and a long tail formed by the dimerization of a coiled coil-forming sequence. Each of the two heads is associated with a pair of low molecular mass calmodulin-like light chains. NMIIC was recently found upon publication of the human genome, and little is known about its structure, function, or cellular localization (2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NMIIA and NMIIB proteins have been well studied (3Umemoto S. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expression of these isoforms is regulated in a cell- and tissue-specific manner (6Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Buxton D.B. Golomb E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15449-15455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, neuronal tissues are markedly enriched in NMIIB (8Rochlin M.W. Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas platelets contain only NMIIA (9Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent localization studies have shown that, in some cells, there is little overlap in the distribution of NMIIA and NMIIB, whereas in other cells, there is considerable overlap (9Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Gard D.L. Bui D. Adelstein R.S. Baines I.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both appear to be components of the contractile ring formed during cell division. Enzymatically, NMIIB is one of the slowest myosins in terms of its actin-activated MgATPase activity and the rate at which it translocates actin filaments in vitro (5Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We show that NMIIB subfragment-1 (S1) has generally slower kinetics at most steps than those reported for other myosin II isoforms. The most striking differences in the kinetics of NMIIB compared with that of muscle myosin isoforms are that it has the highest ADP affinity reported so far, which is, surprisingly, further elevated by actin, and that its ADP release kinetics is only about three times faster than the steady-state actin-activated MgATPase rate. This implies that the strongly actin-bound states can constitute a rather significant proportion of myosin molecules during steady-state ATP hydrolysis and that physiological changes in ADP concentration can profoundly affect the mechanical performance of this myosin and thus have consequences in exerting its cellular function. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the NMIIB S1 Protein— cDNA for human NMIIB was truncated at amino acid 843 to create an S1-like fragment and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). Nucleotides (GACTACAAGGACGACGATGATAAG) encoding a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop codon were appended to the C terminus of NMIIB S1 to aid purification. The complete nucleotide sequence of the resulting vector was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The NMIIB gene can be alternatively spliced at both loops 1 and 2 in the motor domain to create longer loops (12Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have expressed a version that contains the unspliced (non-inserted) version at each loop. The myosin heavy chain fragment was coexpressed with essential and regulatory light chains (5Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expressed NMIIB S1 protein was purified as previously described (13Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared (14Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pyrene-labeled as described (15Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Mant-ATP and mant-ADP were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were from Sigma. Steady-state Actin-activated ATPase Measurements—Steady-state ATPase activities were measured by an NADH-coupled assay at 25 °C in buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 40 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 200 μm NADH. Changes in A 340 (ϵ = 6220 m–1 cm–1) were followed in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Stopped-flow Experiments—Unless stated otherwise, all stopped-flow measurements were done in an SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in buffer comprising 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EGTA. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and emission was selected with a band-pass filter having a peak in transmittance at 347 nm. Pyrene-labeled actin was excited at 365 nm, and the emitted light was selected using a 400-nm long-pass cutoff filter. Mant-ATP and mant-ADP were excited via energy transfer from tryptophan (295 nm excitation), and the emitted light was selected using a 400-nm long-pass cutoff filter. Concentrations stated throughout this study refer to cuvette concentrations unless otherwise indicated. The kinetics of Pi release from NMIIB S1 or acto-NMIIB S1 was followed using a mutant bacterial phosphate-binding protein covalently labeled with N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin 3-carboxamide (MDCC-PBP) (16Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The fluorophore was excited at 436 nm (6-nm bandwidth), and the emitted light was selected through a 450-nm long-pass cutoff filter. Experiments were done in sequential mixing mode in the SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus at 25 °C in buffer comprising 4 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 2 mm MgCl2, and KCl at different concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mm). All syringes contained 3 μm MDCC-PBP. All solutions were preincubated with a “phosphate mop” consisting of 0.02 units/ml purine-nucleoside phosphorylase and 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine to remove Pi contamination. Actin filaments were stabilized by addition of an equimolar amount of phalloidin (Calbiochem), which also abolished the background signal arising from breakdown of ATP by actin. Quenched-flow Experiments—Chemical quench measurements were performed using an RQF-3 quenched-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp.). Samples (15 μl) of S1 or acto-S1 were mixed with an equal volume of ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP. After aging in the delay line, reactions were stopped by mixing with a solution containing 22% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm KH2PO4 (to approximately one-third of the total volume). Pi was extracted from the samples immediately by adding 250 μl of 5% ammonium molybdate, 650 μl of 0.6 m H2SO4, 0.3% silicotungstic acid, 0.6 mm potassium Pi, and 1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of isobutyl alcohol and toluene. After vortexing for 30 s and a 1-min incubation at room temperature, 0.5 ml of the organic phase was mixed with scintillation mixture and counted. Total radioactivity in the samples was determined by direct counting of the [γ-32P]ATP solution. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer comprising 8 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. In the absence of actin, addition of 100 mm KCl was required for stability of NMIIB S1. When necessary, ADP contamination was removed from NMIIB S1 samples by incubation with 0.01/ml apyrase (Sigma) at 25 °C for 30 min. Column-purified ATP was used in the experiments to minimize ADP contamination (17Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Modeling—Fitting of the experimental traces was performed using the KinTek software, SigmaPlot 2001, and Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software). Kinetic simulations were performed with Gepasi Version 3.21 (Pedro Mendes, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute). Means ± S.D. reported for the kinetic constants are those of three to four separate rounds of experiment. Preparation and Steady-state Characterization of NMIIB S1—An NMIIB S1 heavy chain fragment containing 843 amino acids from its amino terminus was coexpressed along with regulatory and essential light chains in the baculovirus system. The resulting NMIIB S1 was purified from Sf9 cell extracts using FLAG affinity chromatography. More than 10 mg of protein could be prepared from ∼4 × 109 cells. The expressed S1 had a basal MgATPase activity of 0.007 ± 0.001 s–1 in the absence of actin. MgATPase activities of S1 at various actin concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, giving V max = 0.13 ± 0.01 s–1 and K ATPase ∼ 59 μm at 25 °C (Fig. 1). This is one of the lowest V max values recorded for any myosin. We used a kinetic model of the acto-NMIIB S1 ATPase cycle similar to those used in recent studies of other myosins (18De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 19De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Throughout this work, the numbering of kinetic steps refers to Scheme 1. In this model, the actin-associated pathway of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release is shown in the upper line (AM stands for actomyosin), whereas the lower line represents the same events when myosin (M) is dissociated from actin (A). The main flux pathway of the reaction is highlighted in boldface. The equilibrium constants throughout this work are expressed as viewed in a direction processing to the right in Scheme 1, and those between actin-associated and actin-dissociated states going in the dissociation direction. Similarly, rate constants have positive indices in these directions. ATP binding was modeled as a two-step reaction consisting of a second-order collision step (K 1 or K 1′) and a subsequent isomerization (K 2 or K 2′) that becomes rate-limiting at high ATP concentrations. Although ADP binding (and dissociation) has been shown to consist of similar events (20Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we consider it as a single step (K 5 or K 5′) for simplicity because the substeps were not resolved in the course of this study. The same holds for the ATP hydrolysis step (K 3 or K 3′) that has been resolved to a conformational transition and the actual chemical step (21Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with phosphate release (K 4 or K 4′) probably being similar to it in this respect. Actin Binding—As shown for other myosins (22Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), binding of NMIIB S1 or NMIIB S1·ADP to pyrene-labeled actin decreases pyrene fluorescence (Schemes 2 and Scheme 3), where A* represents the high fluorescence state of actin. The time course of the decrease in pyrene fluorescence upon rapidly mixing with NMIIB S1 in a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer could be fitted to a single exponential equation to yield a pseudo first-order rate constant, k obs (Fig. 2A, inset). The dependence of k obs on actin concentration was linear, and its slope gave an apparent second-order rate constant (k –6) of 0.36 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 2A). This is slower by a factor of 3 compared with that observed for smooth muscle myosin (23Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and slower by a factor of >10 compared with those observed for most other classes of myosin (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Similarly, the binding of NMIIB S1·ADP to actin could be measured (Fig. 2B), where an apparent second-order rate constant (k –10) of 0.26 ± 0.11 μm–1 s–1 was obtained.

The fluorescence amplitude was measured on mixing 5 μm ATP with a pre-mix of 15 nm pyrene-labeled actin and various concentrations of NMIIB S1. Fitting the data to a quadratic binding equation revealed a dissociation constant (K 6) of 3.2 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. 3A) (24Geeves M.A. Jeffries T.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using the same method, the affinity of NMIIB S1·ADP for actin was also measured, giving K 10 = 1.2 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 3B). Hyperbolic fittings of these same data sets gave K 6 = 10 nm and K 10 = 11 nm. Because the dissociation constants are rather low compared with the actin and S1 concentrations used, the determined parameters are likely to represent upper limits for K 6 and K 10. Nevertheless, the results clearly reveal that ADP does not dramatically affect the affinity of NMIIB S1 for actin (Table I). From the equilibrium dissociation constant and the on-rate constant, dissociation rate constants of 0.0012 s–1 (k 6) and 0.0003 s–1 (k 10) could be calculated (Table I). ATP-induced Dissociation of Acto-NMIIB S1— Scheme 4 shows that the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin can also be used to monitor the kinetics of the formation of the weak actin-binding states of myosin upon ATP binding. Rapidly mixing MgATP with pyrene-labeled acto-NMIIB S1 causes an increase in fluorescence levels approaching that of pyrene-labeled actin alone. The time courses of the mixing experiments followed single exponential kinetics, and a plot of the observed rate constant of increase versus MgATP concentration was hyperbolic (Fig. 4A). In the ATP concentration range examined (up to 2.5 mm), the observed rate constant saturated at >150 s–1 with a half-maximum above 400 μm ATP. The apparent second-order association rate constant for MgATP binding to pyrene-labeled acto-NMIIB S1 (K 1′k 2′) obtained from the initial slope of the plot at low ATP concentrations was 0.40 ± 0.11 μm–1 s–1 (average of two experiments) (Fig. 4B). The fluorescent nucleotide mant-ATP increased its fluorescence upon binding to acto-NMIIB S1 (Fig. 4C), as has been shown to occur for other myosins. The fluorescence increase observed when mant-ATP was mixed with acto-NMIIB S1 could be fitted to a single exponential equation to determine the observed rate constant. A plot of k obs versus mant-ATP concentration is linear and gives an apparent second-order rate constant of 0.24 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1, which is in reasonable agreement with the value for K 1′k 2′ measured above for the population of the weakly bound states. ATP Binding—The binding of ATP to myosin in the absence of actin was followed in two ways. In the first case, the change in tryptophan fluorescence that occurs in NMIIB S1 upon mixing with ATP, similar to several other myosin isoforms (20Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S.

In the second case, the fluorescence increase in mant-ATP upon binding to myosin was measured. This reaction was modeled according to Scheme 5. NMIIB S1 showed a 8–10% increase in tryptophan fluorescence upon mixing with ATP that could be fitted to a single exponential (Fig. 5A, inset). The observed rate constant increased hyperbolically with ATP concentration and saturated at a rate of 16.5 ± 0.2 s–1 with a half-saturation at 17.5 μm ATP (Fig. 5A). Thus, at high ATP concentrations, the rate of fluorescence enhancement was limited by the ATP hydrolysis step, and its maximal rate reports the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Scheme 1, k +3 + k –3). At low ATP concentrations, the observed rate was limited by the ATP binding process; therefore, it was linearly dependent upon ATP concentration up to 5 μm ATP, and the slope gave an apparent second-order rate constant (K 1 k 2) of 0.72 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 5B). Using mant-ATP as a substrate, a similar association rate constant (0.65 ± 0.06 μm–1 s–1) was obtained (Fig. 5C). ATP Hydrolysis—The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by NMIIB S1 and acto-NMIIB S1 was measured by chemical quench experiments. Similar to other myosins examined, an initial burst in Pi production was observed upon mixing NMIIB S1 or acto-NMIIB S1 with excess ATP (Fig. 6A), indicating that ATP hydrolysis occurs before the rate-limiting step of the process. The burst phase was exponential with k obs = 19.8 ± 1.0 s–1 in the absence of actin. The k obs of the burst was identical when NMIIB S1 was mixed with 50 and 100 μm ATP, indicating that it is not limited by the nucleotide binding process. Its value is in good agreement with the results of the stopped-flow experiments monitoring the enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence (see above), where the rate saturated at 16.5 s–1. In the presence of actin, the k obs of the burst was 11.0 ± 0.6 s–1 at 50 μm ATP (Fig. 6A). The lower value may result from nucleotide binding being still rate-limiting at this ATP concentration, because the ATP on-rate of acto-NMIIB S1 is significantly slower than that of NMIIB S1 (see above.) The burst was followed by a linear steady-state phase of ATP hydrolysis, where the extent of rate enhancement caused by 20 μm actin was similar to the results of the steady-state ATPase measurements (data not shown). The amplitude of the initial Pi burst (n Pi/n NMIIB S1) can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (K 3). This amplitude was unusually low in both the absence and presence of actin (0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.44 ± 0.05, respectively), indicating that the hydrolysis step is more reversible in NMIIB S1 than in any other myosin isoform examined. Because the accuracy of these results depends on protein concentration measurements and is also affected by the amount of nonfunctional myosin heads in the preparation, we performed single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiments that provide an independent measure of K 3. In these experiments, the fraction of ATP hydrolyzed during the initial process limited by nucleotide binding gives the burst amplitude. Although reactions did not take place under pseudo first-order conditions (NMIIB S1 was at only ∼2–3-fold molar excess over ATP), double exponential fits gave reasonable amplitude data for the burst and slow phases (Fig. 6B). The burst amplitudes (between 0.41 and 0.56) were in good agreement with the results of the multiple turnover experiments described. The equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step calculated using the averages of the burst amplitudes obtained by different methods (K 3 = A/(1 – A), where A is the burst amplitude) was 0.9 ± 0.3 in the absence and 0.9 ± 0.1 in the presence of 20 μm actin. The ATP hydrolysis step is fairly reversible in all myosins investigated (e.g. K 3 = 9 in skeletal muscle myosin) (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar), but this is the lowest K 3 value ever reported. Myosin I isoforms from Acanthamoeba have similarly low K 3 values (∼1.5) (27Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the observed ATP hydrolysis step has been shown to be composed of a conformational transition in the protein and of the actual chemical step (21Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a change in any of these steps can result in the low K 3 value reported here. ADP Binding and Dissociation—The binding of mant-ADP to NMIIB S1 was also monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 7A, inset). The k obs was linearly dependent on mant-ADP concentration over the range tested (Fig. 7A). The slope gave a second-order rate constant (k –5) of 0.81 ± 0.23 μm–1 s–1. The ordinate intercepts reflect the dissociation rate constant (k 5), which was determined to be 0.58 ± 0.13 s–1. A similar linear dependence of k obs on mant-ADP concentration was observed when the nucleotide was mixed with acto-NMIIB S1 (Fig. 7B). Here, the apparent second-order rate constant (k –5′) was determined to be 2.41 ± 0.13 μm–1 s–1. The ordinate intercept gives k 5′ = 0.35 ± 0.03 s–1. This value for the ADP release from acto-NMIIB S1 is surprisingly low. Most myosin II class molecules, when bound to actin, have an ADP release rate that is much higher than the steady-state actin-activated MgATPase rate (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar), but the rate of ADP release from acto-NMIIB S1 is only about two to three times higher than the steady-state ATPase rate. Therefore, a different means to determine its value was used. The decrease in fluorescence upon dissociation of mant-ADP from either NMIIB S1 (Fig. 8A) or acto-NMIIB S1 (Fig. 8B) upon mixing with excess ATP was measured to yield independent values of k 5 and k 5′. Fitting the transients to single exponentials gave rates of 0.48 ± 0.11 and 0.38 ± 0.09 s–1 for the dissociation of mant-ATP from NMIIB S1 alone and acto-NMIIB S1, respectively, in good agreement with the values determined in Fig. 7 from the ordinate intercepts.Fig. 8Mant-ADP dissociation from NMIIB S1 and acto-NMIIB S1.

The cones have nanometer-sized tips, micrometer-sized roots, and hollow interiors with a diameter ranging from about 2 to several tens of nanometers. The cones are composed of cylindrical graphite sheets; a continuous shortening of the graphite layers from the interior to the exterior makes them cone-shaped. All of the tubular graphite cones have a faceted morphology. The constituent graphite sheets have identical chiralities of a zigzag type across the entire diameter, imparting structural control to tubular-based carbon structures.

The commitment to a particular lineage may be regulated by specific transcription factors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), acting in conjunction with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α, has been suggested as a key regulator of adipogenic differentiation. Previous studies have shown that the activation of PPARγ in osteoblasts suppresses osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific protein. However, the mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. We investigated the effect of PPARγ activation on the expression of osteocalcin and analyzed the molecular mechanism. Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells expressed PPARγ, which was transcriptionally active, whereas rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells did not. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and ROS 17/2.8 cells stably transfected with PPARγ2 with the PPARγ activator 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 inhibited the mRNA expression of osteocalcin and Runx2, the latter of which is a key transcription factor in osteoblast differentiation. This decreased expression of osteocalcin and Runx2 was partly explained by the decreased level of Runx2 resulting from the suppressed transcription from the Runx2 promoter. However, in addition to this indirect effect, the activation of PPARγ by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 directly suppressed the Runx2-mediated induction of the activities of the osteocalcin promoter and the artificial promoter p6OSE2, which contains six tandem copies of osteoblast-specific element-2, the Runx2-binding promoter sequence. This inhibition was mediated by a physical interaction between PPARγ and Runx2 and the subsequent repression of the transcriptional activity at the osteoblast-specific element-2 sequence. Thus, this study demonstrates that the activation of PPARγ inhibits osteocalcin expression both by suppressing the expression of Runx2 and by interfering with the transactivation ability of Runx2.

PPARγ is abundantly expressed in both white and brown adipose tissue and has been known to play a critical role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation (10Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Google Scholar). The transfection of fibroblastic cells with PPARγ2 and its subsequent activation with ligand have been shown to be sufficient to initiate adipogenesis (11Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar). Moreover, determined myoblasts with no inherent adipogenic potential can be induced to transdifferentiate into mature adipocytes by the ectopic expression of two adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (12Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Google Scholar). These results suggest that a developmental switch between these highly specialized cell types can be controlled by the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors. A few studies have suggested that PPARγ also acts as a molecular switch between the osteogenic and adipogenic pathways. Lecka-Czernik et al. (13Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Moerman E.J. Kajkenova O. Lipschitz D.A. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 357-371Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of PPARγ2 in stromal cell lines results in the suppression of Osf2 (osteoblast-specific factor-2)/Runx2, a key transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Google Scholar), and osteoblast-like biosynthetic activity while promoting terminal differentiation into adipocytes. Jackson and Demer (14Jackson S.M. Demer L.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 119-124Google Scholar) also reported that the treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with high concentrations of PPARγ ligands inhibits osteoblast maturation. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms underlying aging-related osteoporosis because a decrease in the number and differentiating potential of bone marrow precursors (15Khosla S. Atkinson E.J. Riggs B.L. Melton III, L.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 857-863Google Scholar) and an alteration in the shunting of these cells between the osteoblast and adipocyte lineages (16Meunier P. Aaron J. Edouard C. Vignon G. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1971; 80: 147-154Google Scholar) were demonstrated under this condition.One of the osteoblast-specific proteins known to be suppressed by PPARγ activation is osteocalcin (13Lecka-Czernik B.

Osteocalcin is an ∼6-kDa γ-carboxylated protein and composes up to 15% of the noncollagenous protein of mature bone (17Price P.A. Otsuka A.A. Poser J.W. Kristaponis J. Raman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1447-1451Google Scholar). The expression of osteocalcin is largely restricted to the osteoblasts of bone and the odontoblasts and cementoblasts of teeth (18McKee M.D. Glimcher M.J. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 479-492Google Scholar). The transcriptional control of osteocalcin gene expression has been extensively studied, and two different types of regulation have been identified, viz. hormonal regulation and tissue-specific regulation (19Ducy P. Karsenty G. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 1st Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 183-195Google Scholar). Hormonal regulation is mediated by vitamin D and glucocorticoid through vitamin D-responsive element (20Demay M.B. Roth D.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2279-2282Google Scholar, 21Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V. Collart D. Zambetti G. Stein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1143-1147Google Scholar) and glucocorticoid-responsive element (22Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Google Scholar), respectively, which are both located in the osteocalcin promoter. Recently, transcriptional and post-transcriptional stimulation by thyroid hormone has been also reported (23Gouveia C.H. Schultz J.J. Bianco A.C. Brent G.A. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 667-675Google Scholar). Apart from hormone-responsive cis-acting elements, two osteoblast-specific elements, OSE1 and OSE2, have been identified in the mouse osteocalcin promoter, and these DNA sequences are known to be involved in the regulation of the tissue-specific expression of the osteocalcin gene (24Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). Similar sequences responsible for cell-specific regulation have also been identified in the rat osteocalcin promoter (25Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-782Google Scholar, 26Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Google Scholar). Of the two identified OSEs, OSE2 binds Runx2 (Cbfa1) (core-binding factor A1)/AML3/Pebp2αA, a Runt-related transcription factor that is essential for osteoblast differentiation. Runx2 is the only osteoblast-specific transactivation factor identified to date (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Google Scholar, 27Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar, 28Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1995; 34: 13125-13132Google Scholar), and an expression vector containing Runx2 has been shown to increase osteocalcin promoter activity through OSE2 (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Runx2 might be a target of the PPARγ-mediated suppression of osteocalcin expression observed in previous studies. In this study, we addressed the mechanism through which PPARγ activation inhibits osteocalcin gene expression. The activation of PPARγ by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-dPGJ2) in osteoblasts inhibited osteocalcin expression by direct repression of osteocalcin promoter activity as well as an indirect effect through inhibition of Runx2 expression. We present evidence that PPARγ interacts with Runx2 and that this leads to the decreased binding of Runx2 to OSE2 of the osteocalcin promoter. These results may help to explain why PPARγ activation suppresses osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteoblast-specific genes from mesenchymal precursors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—15-dPGJ2, ciglitazone, and antisera to PPARγ were purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 110-116Google Scholar). The p6OSE2-Luc and p6OSE2m-Luc plasmids contain six copies of the wild-type and mutant OSE2 sequences of the osteocalcin promoter, respectively, followed by a minimal promoter, which directs the expression of luciferase (24Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). The pCbfa1-Luc plasmid contains a 135-bp fragment of the mouse Cbfa1/Runx2 promoter from positions –89 to +46, driving the expression of luciferase, and the OSE2 sites within this Cbfa1/Runx2 promoter segment are mutated in the pCbfa1m-Luc reporter (30Ducy P.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD). The mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were derived from spontaneously immortalized calvaria cells and represent immature osteogenic cells (33Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% FBS. During osteoblast maturation studies, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% FBS supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Either 25 μm 15-dPGJ2 or vehicle was added at confluence and with subsequent medium changes (every 3 days). Murine embryonic mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) are pluripotent cells that retain an immature, fibroblast-like appearance under standard tissue culture conditions. C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in Eagle's basal medium containing 10% FBS. The 3T3-L1 preadipocytic cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Jae Bum Kim (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea). 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in an immature state by culturing in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS and 2.0 mm glutamine.Generation of Stably Transfected Cell Lines—ROS 17/2.8 cells were seeded in p100 dishes (3 × 106 cells/dish) in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. After overnight recovery, the cells were transfected with either pcDNA3-PPARγ2 or pcDNA3 without insert using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were diluted 10-fold and incubated with DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% (v/v) FBS and 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Two weeks later, drug-resistant colonies were selected and expanded, and the expression of the exogenous gene was confirmed by Northern blot analysis as described below.Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell mono-layers using TRI reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels by electrophoresis, blotted onto nylon membranes, and UV-cross-linked. The membranes were then hybridized using 32P-labeled probes made by the random-primed oligonucleotide method (Label A Gene labeling kit, Promega Corp.) in ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at 42 °C overnight and washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, followed by one high stringency wash with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min. The following cDNA probes were used: 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment of mouse Runx2 (6Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Google Scholar), 470-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment of mouse osteocalcin, 600-bp XbaI-HindIII fragment of PPARγ2, and 1.9-kb BamHI fragment of rat β-actin. The level of mRNA was quantitated from digitized autoradiographic images using SigmaScan (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).Reverse Transcription-PCR—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using a reverse transcription system kit (Promega Corp.). PCR was performed using 2 μl of cDNA, 20 pmol of each primer (synthesized by Bioneer Corp.), 200 μm each dNTP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1× Taq polymerase buffer using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 2400. Primers 5′-CTCTGTCTCTCTGACCTCACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC-3′ (antisense), 5′-GAGGGCACAAGTTCTATCTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGGTCCGCGATGATCTTC-3′ (antisense), 5′-ATGGTTGACACAGAGATGCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGCTTTATCCCCACAGAC-3′ (antisense), 5′-GGGTGAAACTCTGGGAGATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGCTTTATCCCCACAGAC-3′ (antisense), and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACAGCAACAGGGTGGTGGA-3′ (antisense) were used to amplify osteocalcin, Runx2, PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, producing bands of 359, 387, 348, 436, and 451 bp, respectively.Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Lysates were sonicated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment particulate material. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured as described by Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randell R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween 20 and Tris-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 3% dry milk at pH 7.4 for 1 h. Polyclonal antibody against PPARγ was added, and the incubation was continued for an addition hour. After washing with 0.1% Tween 20 and Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h. After extensive washing, bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Transfections and Reporter Assays—Transient transfections were performed in triplicate, and the transfection efficiencies were monitored using pCMV-β-gal vectors (Promega Corp.) in parallel cultures. For these experiments, osteoblastic cells were plated at high density (3 × 105 cells/well) onto 12-well plates. Appropriate plasmids were transfected into each well using LipofectAMINE Plus following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates (0.25 ml/well) were prepared using the Promega luciferase assay system, and reporter activity was measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). All luciferase values were normalized against the β-galactosidase activities from the cotransfected pCMV-β-gal plasmid. All values and means ± S.D. are expressed as -fold induction relative to basal promoter activity.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.6% ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In vitro translated mouse PPARγ2 and mRXRα were obtained by transcribing and translating the pcDNA3-PPARγ2 and pCMX-mRXRα expression plasmids, respectively, using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.). Protein concentration was measured using parallel [35S]methionine-labeled reactions.Oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the OSE2 site in the mouse osteocalcin promoter (5′-GATCCGCTGCAATCACCAACCACAGCA-3′) (24Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar) and the optimal consensus PPRE sequence (5′-GATCAGCTACGTGACCTTTGACCTGGT-3′) (36Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Google Scholar) were generated using an oligonucleotide synthesizer (Bioneer Corp.). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The binding reaction was performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear protein from cultured cells or in vitro translated proteins in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 10 μl for 10 min at 25 °C. The labeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for an additional 20 min in ice. To prove specific binding of Runx2 to the oligonucleotide, the nuclear lysates were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-Cbfa1 (Runx2) antibody prior to the addition of poly(dI-dC) and radiolabeled probe DNA. The samples were electrophoresed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed.GST Pull-down Analyses—GST fusion proteins were induced in Escherichia coli BL21 for 3 h at 25 °C by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm final concentration) to a 100-ml bacterial culture (A600 ≈ 0.5). After induction, bacteria were pelleted for 20 min at 3000 × g and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA). Bacteria were lysed by freeze-thawing for 5 min in liquid nitrogen, followed by thawing for 10 min at 37 °C. The lysis procedure was repeated three times. The freeze-thawed bacteria were then subjected at 4 °C to three 10-s rounds of sonication, and the bacterial debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored frozen at –20 °C in 100-μl aliquots until needed. Free GST lysates were prepared in a similar manner from E. coli BL21 transformed with a pGEX-3 vector. Free GST and GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and dialyzed against binding buffer.For GST pull-down assays, equal amounts of purified recombinant GST or GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. 35S-Labeled PPARγ2 and Runx2 were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system), added to immobilized GST or GST fusion proteins, and incubated for 2 h. After binding, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitations—MC3T3-E1 cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Lysates were then precleared for 3 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Runx2 from MC3T3-E1 cells, following incubation with goat anti-Cbfa1 (Runx2) antibody or an isotype-matched control (anti-thyroglobulin antibody), rabbit anti-goat Ig secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used prior to precipitation. PPARγ was immunoprecipitated with anti-PPARγ anti-body or an isotype-matched control (anti-hemagglutinin antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with protein G-Sepharose. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the expression levels of the proteins of interest were verified by Western analyses of the cell lysates using specific antibodies.RESULTSPPARγ Is Expressed in MC3T3-E1 Cells, but Not in ROS 17/2.8 Cells—We determined the expression of PPARγ in rodent osteoblastic and mesenchymal cell lines. MC3T3-E1 cells represent immature osteoblasts derived from mouse calvarial cells, which undergo osteoblast differentiation in culture (33Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Google Scholar). ROS 17/2.8 cells are a rat osteosarcoma cell line often used for the study of osteoblast function (32Majeska R.J. Nair B.C. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 170-179Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that PPARγ was expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells, but not in ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 1A). Embryonic mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells also expressed PPARγ under basal conditions, and the level was increased after treatment with the PPARγ activator 15-dPGJ2. Because PPARγ exists as two isoforms (γ1 and γ2) as a result of alternative splicing, we investigated which isoform was expressed in the MC3T3-E1 cells by reverse transcription-PCR. We were able to demonstrate the expression of PPARγ1 mRNA in this cell line; however, PPARγ2 mRNA was not detectable even up to 35 cycles (data not shown). To determine whether the PPARγ expressed in the MC3T3-E1 cells was transcriptionally active, a PPRE cloned upstream of luciferase (PPREx3TK-Luc) was transiently transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells, and the cells were then treated with 15-dPGJ2. Expression of luciferase activity was significantly induced after 15-dPGJ2 treatment (Fig. 1B), suggesting that MC3T3-E1 cells express functionally active PPARγ.PPARγ Activators Inhibit Osteocalcin Gene Expression in Rodent Osteoblasts—The possibility that PPARγ activators inhibit osteocalcin expression was investigated. ROS 17/2.8 cells, which constitutively express osteocalcin (24Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar), were stably transfected with a PPARγ2 expression construct or an empty vector. Exposure of the cells with an empty vector to 15-dPGJ2 did not alter the level of osteocalcin expression. However, ROS 17/2.8 cells stably transfected with the PPARγ2 construct showe"
https://openalex.org/W1980194309,"Organic-inorganic hybrid zeolite materials containing an organic framework have been synthesized by partially superseding a lattice oxygen atom by a methylene group. The use of methylene-bridged organosilane as a silicon source gives zeolite materials containing an organic group as lattice (ZOL), with several zeolitic phases such as the MFI and the LTA structures. Through various characterization methods, the presence of methylene frameworks (Si-CH 2 -Si) that replace siloxane bonds (Si-O-Si) has been verified, although the Si-C bonds are partly cleaved to give rise to terminal methyl groups. The shape-selective lipophilicity of a ZOL material indicates that it is not a physical mixture of conventional zeolite and amorphous organic-containing material but contains a genuine organic-inorganic hybrid zeolite."
https://openalex.org/W2032546021,"Hepatic cholesterol(ester) uptake from serum coupled to intracellular processing and biliary excretion are important features in the removal of excess cholesterol from the body. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an important role in hepatic cholesterol transport. The liver consists of different cell types, and ABC transporters may exert different physiological functions dependent on the individual cell type. Therefore, in the current study, using real time PCR we compared the mRNA expression of ABC transporters and genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in liver parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells. It appears that liver parenchymal cells contain high expression levels compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells of scavenger receptor class BI (∼3-fold), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α and PPARγ (8–20-fold), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase A1 (>100-fold), and ABCG5/G8 (∼5-fold). Liver endothelial cells show a high expression of cholesterol 27-hydroxylase, liver X receptor (LXR)β, PPARδ, and ABCG1, suggesting a novel specific role for these genes in endothelial cells. In Kupffer cells, the expression level of LXRα, ABCA1, and in particular ABCG1 is high, leading to an ABCG1 mRNA expression level that is 70-fold higher than in parenchymal cells. It can be calculated that 51% of the total liver ABCG1 expression resides in Kupffer cells and 24% in endothelial cells, suggesting an intrahepatic-specific role for ABCG1 in Kupffer and endothelial cells. Because of a specific stimulation of ABCG1 in parenchymal cells by a high cholesterol diet, the contribution of parenchymal cells to the total liver increased from 25 to 60%. Our data indicate that for studies of the role of ABC transporters and their regulation in liver, their cellular localization should be taken into account, allowing proper interpretation of metabolic changes, which are directly related to their (intra)cellular expression level.

Our data indicate that for studies of the role of ABC transporters and their regulation in liver, their cellular localization should be taken into account, allowing proper interpretation of metabolic changes, which are directly related to their (intra)cellular expression level. Transport of cholesterol through the body is an important process in the maintenance of total body cholesterol homeostasis. One specific component is the transport of excessive cholesterol from the periphery to the liver by the high density lipoprotein (HDL). 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; C t, threshold cycle number; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP27, cholesterol 27-hydroxylase; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; LXR, liver X receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class BI. This process is called reverse cholesterol transport and consists of three different stages: the efflux of peripheral cellular cholesterol to HDL, the transport of cholesterol esters through the blood to the liver, and the uptake of cholesterol esters by the liver (1Glomset J.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1980; 25: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol esters are taken up into the liver through selective uptake by the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) (2Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), where they are primarily (∼50%) catabolized to bile acids, through conversion by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) (3Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-D193Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) for biliary excretion via the bile salt export protein (4Akita H. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kinoshita S. Sato N. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A second major catabolic route (∼40%) is the direct efflux of cholesterol from the liver into the bile via the ABC half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, which together function as a biliary sterol efflux regulator (5Lu K. Lee M.H. Hazard S. Brooks-Wilson A. Hidaka H. Kojima H. Ose L. Stalenhoef A.F. Mietinnen T. Bjorkhem I. Bruckert E. Pandya A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Salen G. Dean M. Srivastava A. Patel S.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 278-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Additionally, cholesterol also effluxes from the liver to produce very low density lipoproteins, which are converted to remnants that function as precursors for low density lipoproteins. Native HDL might also be formed by the ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated cholesterol efflux (6Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, another member of the ABC transporter family, ABCG1, has been proposed to play a role in the intracellular trafficking and efflux of cholesterol (7Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of ABCG1 in the liver, especially in relation to ABCG5 and ABCG8, remains to be clarified. The identification of SR-BI and novel members of the ABC transporter family, including ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8, has allowed the molecular characterization of the individual transporters responsible for the intracellular trafficking and excretion of cholesterol (derivatives). In the liver, it has been shown that SR-BI is responsible primarily for the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL (8Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), whereas ABCG5/G8 and ABCG1, and ABCA1, are proposed mediators of efflux to the bile and to HDL, respectively (6Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). However, the liver is a complex tissue and contains, in addition to the parenchymal cells, which are localized around the bile canaliculi, endothelial cells, and tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells). To assess the individual function of the ABC transporters and their regulation by nuclear hormone receptors it is therefore essential to establish their cellular localization in the liver. Here we report that key mediators in liver cholesterol homeostasis, in particular PPARα, PPARγ, and ABCG1, are expressed differentially in specific cell types of the rat liver. Our data stress that it is necessary to focus on the regulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis in the different cell types of the liver to get molecular insight in their mechanism of regulation and the consequences for liver cholesterol transport. Animals—In the study, three male Wistar WU rats (200–250 g) were fed a chow diet containing 4.3% (w/w) fat and no cholesterol, and three rats were fed a high cholesterol diet containing 2% (w/w) cholesterol, 5% olive oil (w/w), and 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid for 2 weeks. Rats were anesthetized and the vena porta was cannulated. Subsequently, the liver was perfused for 10 min with oxygenated Hanks' buffer, pH 7.4, containing HEPES (1.6 g/liter). The perfusion was continued for 10 min with Hanks‘/HEPES buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) collagenase (type IV, Sigma) and 1 mm CaCl2. Parenchymal cells were isolated after mincing the liver in Hanks’ buffer containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, filtering through nylon gauze and centrifugation for three times 10 min at 50 × g. The pellets consisted of pure (>99%) parenchymal cells as judged by light microscopy. The supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g to harvest the non-parenchymal cells. By means of centrifugal elutriation the endothelial cells and Kupffer cells were separated (10Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each cell fraction (>95% for both) was checked by light microscopy, after staining for peroxidase activity with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Analysis of Gene Expression by Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from rat liver parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was DNase treated (DNase I, 10 units/μg of total RNA) and reverse transcribed (RevertAid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Quantitative gene expression analysis was performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green technology. PCR primers (Table I) were designed using Primer Express 1.7 software with the manufacturer's default settings (Applied Biosystems) and validated for identical efficiencies (slope = –3.3 for a plot of the threshold cycle number (C t) versus log ng cDNA). In 96-wells optical plates, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green master mix was added to 12.5 μl of cDNA (corresponding to 50 ng of total RNA input) and 300 nm forward and reverse primers in water. Plates were heated for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C. Subsequently 40 PCR cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C were applied. At the end of the run, samples were heated to 95 °C with a ramp time of 20 min to construct dissociation curves to check that single PCR products were obtained. The absence of genomic DNA contamination in the RNA preparations was confirmed by using total RNA samples that had not been subjected to reverse transcription. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was used as the standard housekeeping gene. Ratios of target gene and HPRT expression levels (relative gene expression numbers) were calculated by subtracting the C t of the target gene from the C t of HPRT and raising 2 to the power of this difference. C t values are defined as the number of PCR cycles at which the fluorescent signal during the PCR reaches a fixed threshold. Target gene mRNA expressions are thus expressed relative to HPRT expression.Table IPrimers for quantitative real time PCR analysisGeneGenBank accessionForward primerReverse primerAmplicon sizeABCA1aPrimer sequences based on an alignment of human (NM005502) and murine (XM109397) ABCA1.ATCTCATAGTATGGAAGAATGTGAAGCTCGTACAACTATTGTATAACCATCTCCAAA132ABCG1NM053502AGGTCTCAGCCTTCTAAAGTTCCTCTCTCTCGAAGTGAATGAAATTTATCG85ABCG5NM053754CGCAGGAACCGCATTGTAATGTCGAAGTGGTGGAAGAGCT67ABCG8NM130414GATGCTGGCTATCATAGGGAGCTCTCTGCCTGTGATAACGTCGA69CYP27M38566GTGTCCCGGGATCCCAGTGTCTTCCTCAGCCATCGGTGA66CYP7A1NM012942CTGTCATACCACAAAGTCTTATGTCAATGCTTCTGTGTCCAAATGCC75HPRTX62085TTGCTCGAGATGTCATGAAGGAAGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAACTTATAG91LXRαNM031627TCAGCATCTTCTCTGCAGACCGGTCATTAGCATCCGTGGGAACA144LXRβNM031626AAGCTGGTGAGCCTGCGCCGGCAGCTTCTTGTCCTG81PPARαNM013196TGAACAAAGACGGGATGTCAAACTTGGGTTCCATGAT106PPARγNM013124CATGCTTGTGAAGGATGCAAGTTCTGAAACCGACAGTACTGACAT131PPARδNM012141GAGGGGTGCAAGGGCTTCTTCACTTGTTGCGGTTCTTCTTCTG97SR-BIU76205GTTGGTCACCATGGGCCACGTAGCCCCACAGGATCTCA65a Primer sequences based on an alignment of human (NM005502) and murine (XM109397) ABCA1. Open table in a new tab Data Analysis—The significance of differences in relative gene expression numbers among the different liver cell types, from three different cell isolations, measured by real time quantitative PCR was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t test on the differences in C t (C t(HPRT)–C t(target gene)). Probability values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The last step in reverse cholesterol transport is the hepatic uptake and cellular processing of cholesterol esters from HDL by SR-BI (1Glomset J.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1980; 25: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA expression of SR-BI in the different cell types of the liver was investigated with quantitative real time PCR to determine which cell type is mainly expressing SR-BI. A significantly higher SR-BI expression was observed in parenchymal cells compared with endothelial (p < 0.05) and Kupffer cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). In the liver, cholesterol is used for bile acid synthesis. Therefore, the mRNA expression patterns of two key enzymes in bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1 and CYP27, in the different hepatic cell types were examined. A relatively high level of CYP7A1 expression was observed in parenchymal cells, which was more than 200-fold (p < 0.001) higher than the expression levels found in endothelial and Kupffer cells (Fig. 2a). Accordingly, CYP27 expression (Fig. 2b) was observed in parenchymal cells and also in endothelial cells. Because a second route of cholesterol disposal from the liver is through direct excretion of cholesterol into the bile via the half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, we investigated whether the expression of ABCG5/8 is also higher in parenchymal cells than in non-parenchymal cells. Fig. 3 clearly indicates that ABCG5 (a) and ABCG8 (b) expression was indeed 5–10-fold higher in parenchymal cells compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells. In the liver, ABCA1 was recently suggested to be involved in the efflux of cholesterol for production of HDL (6Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although no conclusive evidence has been shown, in the liver ABCG1, like ABCG5/G8, is proposed to play a role in biliary efflux (11Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In macrophages, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression is induced in response to cholesterol loading, and both proteins are potentially involved in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (12Fu X. Menke J.G. Chen Y. Zhou G. MacNaul K.L. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Lund E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38378-38387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Because both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are implicated in the same physiological functions, we determined whether both genes also have a comparable expression distribution profile over the different cell types of the liver. Contrary to the assumption, ABCA1 was expressed mainly in parenchymal and Kupffer cells (Fig. 4a), whereas ABCG1 was expressed 76-fold (p < 0.001) and 27-fold (p < 0.01) higher in Kupffer and endothelial cells than in parenchymal cells, respectively (Fig. 4b). In contrast to ABCA1, ABCG1 is thus mainly expressed in non-parenchymal cells, which suggests a limited role of ABCG1 in the excretion of cholesterol directly into the bile under the standard feeding conditions. In addition, ABCG1 expression was analyzed in the different hepatic cells isolated from rats on a high cholesterol diet. Interestingly, hepatic parenchymal cell ABCG1 expression increased ∼4-fold (p < 0.05) in response to a high cholesterol diet, whereas no significant effect on endothelial and Kupffer cell ABCG1 expression was observed (Fig. 5). Although ABCG1 levels were significantly increased in parenchymal cells in response to a high cholesterol diet, ABCG1 expression levels were still, respectively, 10- and 12-fold higher in endothelial and Kupffer cells compared with parenchymal cells.Fig. 5Effect of a high cholesterol diet on the relative ABCG1 mRNA expression levels as determined by real time quantitative PCR in liver parenchymal (PC), endothelial (EC), and Kupffer (KC) cells. Values from rats on a chow diet (black bars) and on a high cholesterol diet (hatched bars) are expressed relative to HPRT expression (mean ± S.E.). *, p < 0.05 compared with the ABCG1 expression on a chow diet (t test, as described under “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of LXR expression in the different cell types was performed to investigate a potential relation with expression patterns of the ABC transporters. LXRα had a distribution pattern comparable to that found for ABCA1, with a relatively high expression in parenchymal (p < 0.01) and Kupffer cells compared with endothelial cells (Fig. 6a). A significantly higher expression of LXRβ was found in endothelial liver cells compared with parenchymal (p < 0.05) and Kupffer cells (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 6b), which suggests that LXRβ may be a more important mediator in endothelial cells. It has been shown that PPARγ activators are able to regulate LXR expression, and thereby indirectly influence ABCA1 mRNA levels (13Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and that ligands for PPARδ directly regulate the expression of ABCA1 via an unknown mechanism (14Oliver Jr., W.R. Shenk J.L. Snaith M.R. Russell C.S. Plunket K.D. Bodkin N.L. Lewis M.C. Winegar D.A. Sznaidman M.L. Lambert M.H. Xu H.E. Sternbach D.D. Kliewer S.A. Hansen B.C. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5306-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also investigated the PPAR gene expression in the different cell types. Fig. 7a clearly indicates that PPARα expression is found mostly in parenchymal cells, with an 82- and 23-fold higher expression (p < 0.001 in both cases) in these cells than in endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, respectively. The PPARγ distribution pattern is comparable with that found for PPARα (Fig. 7b), suggesting a major function of these genes in parenchymal cells. PPARδ mRNA levels were almost equal in the different cells, although endothelial cell PPARδ expression was somewhat higher as compared with parenchymal and Kupffer cells (Fig. 7c). These data indicate that within the various liver cell types PPARδ will have a more general function. Hepatic cholesterol uptake from serum coupled with intracellular processing and bile excretion are important features in the last step of reverse cholesterol transport. It has been shown that disruption of cholesterol homeostasis plays an essential role in the pathology of many diseases such as cholestasis (15Jansen P.L. Strautnieks S.S. Jacquemin E. Hadchouel M. Sokal E.M. Hooiveld G.J. Koning J.H. Jager-Krikken A. Kuipers F. Stellaard F. Bijleveld C.M. Gouw A. Van Goor H. Thompson R.J. Muller M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In the liver, SR-BI plays a crucial role in the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL (2Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies on ABC transporters suggested that hepatic ABCA1 is involved in HDL production (6Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas ABCG5/G8 and ABCG1 were indicated to mediate biliary efflux of cholesterol from the liver (7Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18793-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of mice with synthetic ligands of LXR markedly increased liver ABCG5/G8 expression. In vitro observations by Malerod et al. (18Malerod L. Juvet L.K. Hanssen-Bauer A. Eskild W. Berg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) also indicate that LXR is able to regulate hepatic SR-BI expression through a direct interaction with a newly discovered LXR/retinoid X receptor response element in the SR-BI promoter. It is however still unclear how hepatic ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression is regulated and what the precise consequence of their regulation is on hepatic cholesterol levels and transport. The liver consists of several different cell types, including parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells. It is therefore important to study the expression levels of SR-BI and the ABC transporters in the individual hepatic cell types to get a more detailed view of their specific functions and regulatory mechanisms in the liver. Earlier studies performed by Pieters et al. (19Pieters M.N. Esbach S. Schouten D. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. van Berkel T.J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1459-1467PubMed Google Scholar) showed that uptake of HDL cholesterol esters into liver parenchymal cells is efficiently coupled to a rapid synthesis of bile acids. Accordingly, Fluiter et al. (20Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) observed that the receptor responsible for the selective uptake of cholesterol esters into the liver, SR-BI, has a relatively high expression in parenchymal cells compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells. These combined observations stressed an important role for parenchymal cells in the last step of the reverse cholesterol transport process. In the current study, using real time quantitative PCR, we investigated the mRNA expression of genes involved in hepatic cholesterol transport and metabolism in liver parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells. Real time PCR is a highly sensitive method to quantify mRNA expression levels in vitro and in vivo. mRNA levels have been shown to correlate strongly with protein expression levels, indicating that a substantial portion of changes in protein levels is a consequence of altered mRNA levels rather than post-transcriptional modifications (21Lian Z. Kluger Y. Greenbaum D.S. Tuck D. Gerstein M. Berliner N. Weissman S.M. Newburger P.E. Blood. 2002; 100: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Importantly, Wellington et al. (22Wellington C.L. Walker E.K. Suarez A. Kwok A. Bissada N. Singaraja R. Yang Y.Z. Zhang L.H. James E. Wilson J.E. Francone O. McManus B.M. Hayden M.R. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) showed a high concordance of ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels in the liver. Additionally, we observed in the present study the highest SR-BI mRNA expression in the parenchymal cells compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells, which is in accordance with the high Western blot protein expression data for SR-BI as reported by Fluiter et al. (20Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We thus suggest that our quantitative mRNA data for the various cell types are indicative for the activity of the particular genes of interest and their metabolic function. For SR-BI, the mRNA and protein expression data in parenchymal cells are consistent with our data that the parenchymal cholesterol ester uptake is reduced dramatically in SR-BI deficient mice as compared with non-transgenic littermates. 2J. K. Kruijt and Th. J. C. van Berkel, unpublished data. CYP7A1 and CYP27 are the key enzymes in classical and alternative bile acid synthesis pathways (23Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The relatively high expression of these two bile acid synthesis enzymes observed in parenchymal cells is in agreement with the data provided by Pieters et al. (19Pieters M.N. Esbach S. Schouten D. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. van Berkel T.J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1459-1467PubMed Google Scholar), as it was shown that uptake of HDL cholesterol esters by the parenchymal cells is coupled efficiently to bile acid synthesis. Interestingly, an equally high expression of CYP27 compared with parenchymal cells was observed in liver endothelial cells. In agreement, Reiss et al. (24Reiss A.B. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Martin D.W. Grossi E.A. Galloway A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1026-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have detected the same high levels of CYP27 activity in cultured vascular endothelial cells. The observed difference between the CYP7A1 and CYP27 expression patterns suggests differential functions for these bile acid synthesizing enzymes. Interestingly, Babiker et al. (25Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkheim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) suggested that CYP27-mediated elimination of cholesterol from macrophages and endothelial cells may be an alternative or complement to HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport under low HDL conditions. They observed a high secretion of 3β-hydroxycholestenoic acid, an intermediate of the CYP27-mediated alternative bile acid formation pathway, from endothelial cells and macrophages to albumin containing medium. Efflux of hepatic cholesterol to the serum compartment by ABCA1 for the production of native HDL is a second important route in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (6Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An equally high relative expression of ABCA1 was observed in parenchymal and Kupffer cells, whereas a ∼4-fold lower expression of ABCA1 was seen in liver endothelial cells. In macrophages, ABCA1 is a critical regulator of the specific ATP-dependent cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, leading to an inhibition of foam cell formation (26Argmann C.A. Van Den Diepstraten C.H. Sawyez C.G. Edwards J.Y. Hegele R.A. Wolfe B.M. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Kupffer cells are liver macrophages, which play an important role in the uptake of (modified) lipoproteins (19Pieters M.N. Esbach S. Schouten D. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. van Berkel T.J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1459-1467PubMed Google Scholar, 27de Rijke Y.B. Hessels E.M. van Berkel T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high uptake and an accordingly high efflux of cholesterol from Kupffer cells might be the metabolic mechanism for the relatively high ABCA1 expression level observed in these cells. Haghpassand et al. (28Haghpassand M. Bourassa P.A. Francone O.L. Aiello R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and Van Eck et al. (29Van Eck M. Bos I.S.T. Kaminski W.E. Orsó E. Rothe G. Twisk J. Böttcher A. Van Amersfoort E.S. Christiansen-Weber T.A. Fung-Leung W.-P. van Berkel T.J.C. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6298-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have shown that monocyte/macrophage ABCA1 only minimally contributes to the overall plasma HDL levels. The observed high expression levels of ABCA1 in parenchymal cells, combined with the observation that ABCA1 functions on the basolateral surface of hepatocytes (30Neufeld E.B. Demosky Jr., S.J. Stonik J.A. Combs C. Remaley A.T. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggest that the liver does contribute to HDL production by the efflux of cholesterol from parenchymal cells via ABCA1. A third catabolic route for hepatic cholesterol is the direct excretion into the bile, which accounts for ∼40% of the total liver catabolism. Recently, two members of the ABC transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, have been shown to participate coordinately in the hepatic sterol secretion into bile (31Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 are sufficient to cause sitosterolemia, a disorder that is characterized by elevated plasma levels of sterols (32Heimer S. Langmann T. Moehle C. Mauerer R. Dean M. Beil F.U. von Bergmann K. Schmitz G. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 20: 151Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because parenchymal cells are responsible for bile acid formation, a relatively high expression of the biliary transporters such as ABCG5/G8 in these cells compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells is consistent with their suggested function. The expression pattern of ABCG5 resembled ABCG8, which is in agreement with the statements that these transporters operate as heterodimers to regulate biliary cholesterol efflux (9Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 33Graf G.A. Li W.P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a novel member of the ABC transporter family, ABCG1, has also been proposed to have a function in the intracellular trafficking and biliary efflux of cholesterol in the liver (11Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Contrary to the expectations, ABCG1 expression was observed mainly in non-parenchymal cells of the rat liver. A 76-fold and 27-fold higher ABCG1 expression was observed in Kupffer and endothelial cells than in parenchymal cell under standard feeding conditions. Although Kupffer and endothelial cells only contribute 2.5 and 3.3% to the total liver protein, they do contain 51 and 24% of total liver ABCG1 expression, respectively. Such a high specific ABCG1 expression in Kupffer cells was not expected, although ABCG1 has also been proposed to play a role in the cholesterol efflux from peripheral macrophages (7Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Importantly, after putting rats on a high cholesterol diet for 2 weeks, ABCG1 expression increased 4-fold in parenchymal cells, whereas no significant change in ABCG1 expression in endothelial and Kupffer cells was observed. The absence of a similar induction of ABCG1 in endothelial and Kupffer cells in response to diet feeding may well be caused by an already maximal activity of ABCG1 in these cells even on a chow diet. Also, the differences in expression and intracellular localization of direct activators (e.g. LXRα) and repressors (e.g. ZNF202) of ABCG1 might contribute to the difference in its transcriptional regulation between different cell types as earlier mentioned by Schmitz and Langmann (11Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although endothelial and Kupffer cell ABCG1 expressions were still 10- and 12-fold higher than that in parenchymal cells, the relative contribution of ABCG1 in the parenchymal cells to total liver increased from 25 to 60%. This suggests that under high cholesterol conditions ABCG1 might indeed contribute to the transport of cholesterol in the parenchymal cells. Recent pharmacological interest is focused upon the regulation of SR-BI and the ABC transporters by newly discovered nuclear hormone receptors, the LXRs and PPARs, respectively (34Fitzgerald M.L. Moore K.J. Freeman M.W. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Laffitte B.A. Tontonoz P. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2002; 4: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also studied their cellular localization in the different cell types of the liver. Two different types of the LXR have been discovered so far, LXRα and LXRβ. A relatively high expression of LXRα was observed in parenchymal cells. In the liver, LXRα plays an essential role in the regulation of CYP7A1 and thus the formation of bile acids (36Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Stroup D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 262: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CYP7A1 was found almost exclusively in the parenchymal cells, which coincides with the high expression of LXRα in these cells. Contrarily, equally high LXRα expression levels were observed in Kupffer cells, where CYP7A1 expression was almost absent. In macrophages, however, LXRα plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid efflux via ABCA1 (37Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Kupffer cells also contain high expression levels of ABCA1, which is consistent with a role for LXRα in the regulation of ABCA1 in these cells. Among the different cell types of the liver, LXRβ was ubiquitously expressed, with a somewhat higher expression in endothelial cells versus parenchymal and Kupffer cells. The expression distribution of LXRβ thus does not resemble that found for LXRα, which suggests that in the liver, LXRβ may have a function different from that of LXRα. In the liver, PPARα is suggested to play a role in the formation of bile acids because it is able to bind a PPAR response element in the sterol 12α-hydroxylase promoter, leading to increased levels of cholic acid (38Hunt M.C. Yang Y.Z. Eggertsen G. Carneheim C.M. Gafvels M. Einarsson C. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28947-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This might explain the extremely high expression of PPARα found in parenchymal cells compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells. The high expression of PPARγ observed in parenchymal cells suggests that PPARγ, like PPARα, also has a major function in these cells. Contrarily, PPARδ is expressed ubiquitously among the different cell types of the liver, suggesting a more general function for PPARδ in all cell types of the liver. In conclusion, we have provided data that several ABC transporters and nuclear hormone receptors involved in liver cholesterol homeostasis are expressed differentially in the specific cell types of the liver. To study their intracellular transport function inside the liver it appears to be essential to take into account their cellular localization, as especially evident for ABCG1. This appears specifically true for studies on the regulation of the transporters by nuclear receptors because metabolic changes are coupled directly to the specific (intra)cellular expression level of the cholesterol transporters."

Regulation of the COX-2 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is poorly understood. For example, protein factors that regulate the post-transcriptional mRNA metabolism of COX-2 have not been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein HuR binds to COX-2 mRNA and regulates its expression. We show that there are three binding sites for HuR in the 3′-untranslated region of human COX-2. These sites are located at the following positions in the COX-2 3′-untranslated region: 39–84 nucleotides (nt), 1155–1187 nt, and 1244–1256 nt (hereinafter referred to as Sites I, II and III, respectively).

Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar, 7Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Google Scholar). A better understanding of the molecular basis of COX-2 expression in health as well as disease will require studies to define the factors/mechanisms that regulate COX-2 expression. An increase in COX-2 gene transcription is not sufficient to account for the fold increase in COX-2 expression observed in response to stimuli such as IL-1 (8Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Google Scholar). Indeed, cytokine induction and glucocorticoid repression of COX-2 is achieved, at least in part, by the modulation of the mRNA stability of COX-2 (8Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Google Scholar, 9Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Google Scholar). In early studies, it was shown that IL-1α induces COX-2 and that blocking transcription by actinomycin D at later times had no effect on IL-1α-induced COX-2 levels (8Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Google Scholar), thus implying the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, cytokine-induced COX-2 was down-regulated by the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone, whereby the COX-2 transcript isoforms, 4.6 and 2.8 kb, decayed with different half-lives (9Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Google Scholar), suggesting that sequences in the 3′-UTR are critical for mRNA stability. To define the cis-acting stability-regulating elements, segments of the 3′-UTR of human COX-2 were fused downstream of the luciferase gene, and their influence on the stability of the chimeric transcript was assessed. Using this approach, a proximal stability element (∼1–100 bp of the 3′-UTR) and a distal instability element (that extends from the first canonical poly(A) signal to the end of the 3′-UTR) were identified (10Gou Q. Liu C.H. Ben-Av P. Hla T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 508-512Google Scholar). The 2.8-kb COX-2 isoform lacks the distal instability element, which could explain its increased half-life in response to dexamethasone-induced destabilization of cytokine induced COX-2 (9Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Google Scholar). Another deletion analysis using a similar strategy in human lung fibroblasts identified the proximal 116-nt segment of COX-2 3′-UTR as a prime regulator of COX-2 expression (via translational repression) (11Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Google Scholar). Using tetracycline-suppressible luciferase chimerae mRNAs in rat vascular smooth cells, Murphy and colleagues (12Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23012-23019Google Scholar) identified a distal 130-base AU-rich region in the murine COX-2 3′-UTR that under basal conditions serves as an instability determinant regulated by the p42/44 MAPKs. This 130-nt element, although highly conserved between rat and mouse COX-2 3′-UTRs, aligns poorly with its human counterpart. Deletion analysis of murine COX-2 3′-UTR (by fusing different 3′-UTR segments downstream of luciferase) identified two translational and stability control elements and two stability control elements, as shown in Fig. 1A (13Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Google Scholar). Although these 3′-UTR constructs responded to IL-1-dependent COX-2 induction, they failed to respond to dexamethasone, suggesting that elements within the COX-2 3′-UTR may not be sufficient for its responsiveness. Several groups have identified the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway as an important regulator of transcriptional regulation as well as mRNA stability in response to stimuli such as IL-1β (9Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Google Scholar, 10Gou Q. Liu C.H. Ben-Av P. Hla T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 508-512Google Scholar, 11Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Google Scholar), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (14Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Google Scholar), serum deprivation in MDA-MB-231 cells (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar), and dexamethasone (16Lasa M. Brook M. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 771-780Google Scholar). Using a tetracycline-regulated system, a short ∼1– 123-nt segment of the human COX-2 3′-UTR was identified as the minimal element required for regulation of COX-2 mRNA stability by the p38 (stabilizes COX-2) cascade (17Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar) as well as by dexamethasone, which is known to destabilize COX-2 mRNA (16Lasa M. Brook M. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 771-780Google Scholar). Furthermore protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) has also been implicated in K-Ras-mediated COX-2 expression (18Sheng H. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675Google Scholar). HuR, a member of the ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) family of mRNA-binding proteins, is known to stabilize several inducible mRNAs such as c-Fos and tumor necrosis factor-α (19Ma W.J. Chung S. Furneaux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Google Scholar, 20Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Google Scholar, 21Levy N. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J.

Although the elements that regulate the stability of COX-2 mRNA have been defined (Fig. 1A), the cis-acting factors that mediate this regulation have not been identified unequivocally. Therefore we investigated whether HuR could bind to and stabilize the COX-2 transcript. Plasmids and Cell Lines—The HuR antisense clone was made in the following manner. We isolated the ∼103-bp BamHI-KpnI fragment, encoding the hammerhead ribozyme insert from pBCRZ-2 (a gift from Dr. Gordon Carmichael, University of Connecticut Health Center). The hammerhead ribozyme was then inserted into the 5415-bp vector backbone provided by pcDNA3.1(–) that had been digested with BamHI and KpnI to generate pSS1. We then cut out the poly(A) signal from pSS1 by digesting it with AflII and BbsI, purified the 5332-bp fragment, generated blunt ends using Klenow, and allowed the fragment to religate, thus generating pSS2. The 1.6-kb HuR (antisense) fragment was cut out from pSVZeo (HuR antisense) (a gift from Myriam Gorospe, NIA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using ApaI. The 1.6-kb HuR ApaI fragment was inserted in the vector backbone provided by pSS2 that had been linearized with EcoRV. We used HuR antisense clone 5 (HuRAS#5) to transfect MDA-MB-231 cells and generated stable clones that demonstrated reduced levels of HuR compared with the vector control (MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pSS2). Our HuR antisense clones maintain their phenotype even in late passage numbers. We used the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) for all of our experiments. Growth conditions and other manipulations were done as described previously (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown in the absence or presence of serum for 0, 4, 8, and 24 h. Because the cytoplasmic localization of HuR is known to be increased by various agents such as UV light or actinomycin D (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar), cells were also treated with actinomycin D (2 μg/ml) for 2 h as a control. At each time point, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-HuR monoclonal antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (1:100) for 1 h followed by Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope. Monoclonal antibody against HuR (19F12) (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Clonegene, LLC (Hartford, CT). Preparation of RNA Transcripts—Plasmid DNA digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes or PCR fragments served as templates for in vitro transcription of the desired RNA. To transcribe full-length COX-2 3′-UTR, we used the pCRIICOX-2–3′-UTR plasmid linearized with BglII as the template for in vitro transcription. To map the HuR binding site precisely, we subdivided the COX-2 3′-UTR into six fragments (1 through 6). These stretches were amplified by PCR using primers that contained the T7 polymerase promoter (refer to Table I for details). For a positive control we used the region between residues 568 and 781 of the c-Fos 3′-UTR, which is known to contain a high affinity HuR binding site (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). For a negative control we used the 3′-end of human γ-globin RNA (165 nt), which does not bind HuR (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). pAUFL was digested with HindIII, whereas pSP65H γ (γ-globin) was digested with Sau3AI. c-Fos (AU-rich element) was transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase, γ-globin, and full-length COX-2 3′-UTR with SP6 RNA polymerase and the subfragments of COX-2 3′-UTR (fragments 1–6) with T7 RNA polymerase. Briefly, the RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro, wherein the template was incubated in reactions (0.02 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, ATP/GTP/CTP/UTP, 0.5 mm each, 1 μl of RNasin, 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 30–60 min (specific activity, 0.12 × 106 cpm/pmol). After synthesis all the transcripts were gel-purified. RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the HuR binding sites in fragments 1 and 4 as well as the binding site mutants were synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies. These RNA oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end (specific activity, 1 × 106cpm/pmol) with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP and gel-purified thereafter.Table IPrimers for making in vitro transcription templatesSegment of COX-2 3′-UTRName of fragmentPCR primers usedSequence 5′ → 3′1-365 ntFragment 1 (F1)T7F1FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAGTCTAATGATCATATTTATT7F1REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAatcatggaagatgcattg366-832 ntFragment 2 (F2)T7F2FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGgcattagaagtaactaatgT7F2REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAattctggaatatctcaac833-1211ntFragment 3 (F3T7F3FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGttgtttatatggctggtaT7F3REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAaggcttgattccaatgc1212-1578ntFragment 4 (F4)T7F4FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGggctacctgcatgctT7F4REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAcacaaaccccgtacag1579-1979ntFragment 5 (F5)T7F5FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGactggaaaaagttacgttcT7F5REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAgcctatcctaaggacaa1980-2385ntFragment 6 (F6)T7F6FORtccTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGctatgtgctagcccacaT7F6REVgctATTTAGGTGACACTATAtgtcagcagatcaatg Open table in a new tab RNA Complex Assay—RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out using radiolabeled RNA and protein as described above. After 10 min at 37 °C, 5 μl of gel loading dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 30% glycerol) was mixed therein and one-fifth of the reaction was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel (in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA) at 40–45V for 2.5–3 h. After electrophoresis the agarose gel was dried on DE81 paper and exposed to film. Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assay—For the nitrocellulose filter binding assay, radiolabeled RNA (4–8 fmol; specific activity, 0.12 × 106 cpm/pmol) was incubated with GST or GST-HuR in reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 10 min. Then the reactions were diluted 1:6 with buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.05 mg/ml tRNA) and filtered through nitrocellulose (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). After being washed with 2 ml of buffer F, the nitrocellulose filters containing RNA complexed with protein were placed in scintillation vials and counted. Apparent KDDetermination—Radiolabeled RNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant GST-HuR, and binding was quantitated using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The fraction of RNA bound by the protein was calculated and plotted against the HuR protein concentration. The protein concentration at which half-maximal binding is attained is defined as the apparent Kd value (34Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells grown in complete medium containing 10% FBS. Subcellular fractionation, EMSA, and supershift experiments were done as described elsewhere (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar). The COX-2 3′-UTR fragments were uniformly labeled with [32P]UTP, whereas the Site I and Site III mutant RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP as described above. RNase T1 Selection Assay—Reaction mixtures (.02 ml; as described above) containing 4–8 fmol of radiolabeled RNA and purified GST/GST-HuR were incubated as described above and then treated with RNase T1 (1 μl of 5 units/μl) for an additional 10 min. The reactions were then filtered through nitrocellulose as before. After the nitrocellulose filter was washed with 2 ml of buffer F, the bound RNA was eluted with phenol-chloroform extraction, denatured in formamide buffer (at 70 °C for 3 min), and analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and dried on DE81 paper, and autoradiograms were obtained (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—After the appropriate treatment, the MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized and centrifuged, and the cell pellets were lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer, boiled at 100 °C for 10–15 min, and then stored frozen at –80 °C. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE at around 100 V. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). For HuR Western blot we used 1× TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 0.2 m NaCl, whereas for COX-2/β-actin immunoblot we used the protocol described earlier (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk (in the respective 1× TBS-T buffers) and then incubated with mouse anti-human HuR antibody at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. After washing, the membrane was further incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and developed using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA Isolation and Northern Blots—Total RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 cells using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Northern hybridization was performed as described earlier (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). Inhibition of HuR Expression by Small Interfering RNAs (SiRNAs)— The protocol followed was essentially the same as outlined in Tuschl and co-workers (26Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). The HuR siRNA duplex was synthesized by Dharmacon Inc., and the sequences were: HuR sense, 5′-AAC AUG ACC CAG GAU GAG UUA dTdT-3′; and HuR antisense, 5′-UAA CUC AUC CUG GGU CAU GUU dTdT-3′. Transfection of the siRNA/Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) duplexes was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified HuR Binds to Multiple Sites in the COX-2 3′-UTR— Because HuR is a ubiquitous regulator of mRNA stability, we tested whether it interacted with the COX-2 mRNA. We incubated purified HuR with labeled COX-2 3′-UTR RNA and determined the binding sites using the RNase T1 selection assay (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). The principle of the assay is that the interaction of RNA and protein would select the specific interacting fragment on nitrocellulose filters. Because this enzyme cleaves only after G residues, the precise location of the interaction can be ascertained by gel electrophoresis. The c-Fos 3′-UTR served as positive control, whereas the γ-globin 3′-UTR constituted a negative control. HuR-COX-2 RNA complexes were allowed to form and were then digested with RNase T1. RNA fragments bound to HuR were isolated by adsorption to nitrocellulose followed by elution with phenol-chloroform. As shown in Fig. 1B, purified HuR selected three RNase T1 fragments, 45, 33, and 22 nt from the full-length (FL) COX-2 3′-UTR. In contrast, no fragments are selected from the negative control (γ-globin) mRNA. This suggest that there are three HuR binding sites in the COX-2 3′-UTR. To confirm these data we assayed HuR binding on six subfragments (F1–F6) of the COX-2 3′-UTR (Fig. 1, A–C). These three binding sites are located at nucleotides 39–84, 1155–1187, and 1244–1265 and will be referred to as Sites I, II, and III, respectively (Fig. 1C). The location of these sites was deciphered from the length of the RNase T1-selected fragments and the known RNA sequence for the COX-2 3′-UTR. The specific nature of this interaction of HuR with the three sites on the COX-2 3′-UTR is evident because fragments F2, F5, and F6 failed to bind in this assay. High Affinity Interaction of HuR with COX-2 mRNA—To test the relative affinities of the three HuR binding sites, we incubated different concentrations of GST-HuR with the respective transcripts and then analyzed complex formation by agarose gel electrophoresis. We used c-Fos as our positive control and GST (at the highest concentration) as our negative control. We observed discernible complex formation at HuR concentration of 10 nm for all three fragments containing HuR binding sites as well as the c-Fos control (Fig. 2A), although the Site I-containing fragment interacted somewhat less at lower concentrations. This interaction is specific for HuR because the 3′-UTR fragments did not bind to GST alone at the highest concentration (400 nm). This assay is a measure of both the on-rate and the off-rate. Another independent method to measure the affinity of the three COX-2 3′-UTR binding sites for HuR was utilized. Using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar), which measures the on-rate, we find that the HuR binding constant (apparent Kd) is 10 nm for c-Fos, 20 nm for Site I, 18 nm for Site II, and 20 nm for Site III (Fig. 2B.). Thus all the three sites in COX-2 3′-UTR are high affinity HuR binding sites with apparent Kd values comparable with HuR binding to the AU-rich element of the c-Fos mRNA (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). Precise Identification of HuR Binding Sites I and III—The T1 selection assay provided us with the putative binding sites (I to III) within each of the 3′-UTR fragments F1 and F4 (Fig. 1B). Highly conserved sequence elements were identified in all three fragments (Fig. 3A). In particular, U-rich elements in Sites I and III conform to the previously identified HuR binding site (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). To confirm that HuR binds to conserved elements of Sites I and III, we designed synthetic RNA oligonucleotides spanning the putative binding sites in which the critical U residues have been mutated to Cs and Gs. We end-labeled the mutant oligonucleotides and tested their ability to bind HuR in the RNA complex assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, neither of the mutants showed any HuR binding even at 400 nm of HuR. In contrast, mutant sequences bound Escherichia coli single-stranded binding protein effectively. It is known that at high concentrations single-stranded DNA-binding protein can interact with RNA (28Weiner H.J. Bertsch L.I. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Google Scholar). These data show that HuR binds specifically to multiple sites on the COX-2 3′-UTR. HuR Is Necessary for COX-2 Induction—MDA-MB231 cells were used in functional studies of HuR interaction with COX-2 mRNA because we had shown previously that serum deprivation induces RNA stabilization of COX-2 mRNA via the p38 stress-activated protein kinase pathway in these cells (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). HuR protein was abundantly expressed in these cells as determined by immunoblot analysis (see below). Immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted to determine the effect of serum deprivation on HuR expression and localization. As shown in Fig. 4, HuR is localized primarily in the nucleus. As expected, actinomycin D treatment, which is known to induce HuR translocation into cytosol, resulted in the appearance of HuR primarily in the cytosol. Serum deprivation induced a fraction of HuR to translocate into the cytosol at the 8-h time point. These data suggest that HuR is abundantly expressed in MDA-MB231 cells and that stimuli that induce COX-2 stabilization, namely serum deprivation, induce transient translocation of HuR into the cytosol. Next, we determined whether HuR from MDA-MB-231 cells is capable of binding to COX-2 mRNA. Cell extracts were incubated with radiolabeled RNA, which resulted in the formation of RNA-protein complexes. Incubation of specific monoclonal antibody against HuR (19F12) would result in the formation of “supershift” if HuR was present in the complex. As shown in Fig. 5A, HuR is present in the c-Fos mRNA-protein complex (positive control) and not in the γ-globin mRNA-protein complex (negative control). In vitro transcript derived from the COX-2 fragment 1 (which contains the HuR binding site 1) was also supershifted by the HuR antibody, whereas the transcript from fragment 6 was not. To directly test whether the HuR binding site is important, we performed an RNA-protein binding assay and a supershift experiment with anti-HuR antibody using end-labeled RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type HuR binding site or the mutant (Fig. 5B). As can be seen, a HuR supershift was seen only in the wild-type RNA oligonucleotide. In none of the cases did the control anti-CDC6 monoclonal antibody cause a supershift. These data suggest that HuR in the lysates of MDA-MB231 cells is capable of interacting with COX-2 mRNA at the identified HuR binding sites. To test the requirement for HuR in COX-2 mRNA induction, we used two approaches, namely RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense RNA expression. siRNA (26Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar) directed against HuR specifically reduced HuR levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Such cells, in which RNAi was used to lower HuR levels, were impaired in their ability to induce COX-2 upon serum starvation (Fig. 6A.). Down-regulation of an irrelevant gene (N-cadherin) by siRNA did not affect the induction of COX-2 expression. Down-regulation of endogenous HuR levels via RNAi did not decrease the basal expression of COX-2. However, a reduction in HuR levels abrogated the ability of these cells (both antisense as well as RNAi-treated) to up-regulate COX-2 in the presence of the appropriate signal (in this case serum starvation). In the second approach we generated a stable antisense HuR clone expressing antisense HuR upstream of the self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme. As shown in Fig. 6B. HuR levels in the antisense clones were reduced compared with the vector control. Decreasing HuR attenuates serum deprivation induced levels of COX-2 in the HuRAS#5 when compared with the corresponding COX-2 levels in the vector control (Fig. 6B, Vector#2). However, we also observed a decrease in the basal level of COX-2 protein in the HuR antisense clone, HuRAS#5. A Northern blot of total RNA from the HuRAS#5 cells shows a reduction in COX-2 transcript levels as well, compared with the vector control (Fig. 6C). Previous work (20Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Google Scholar, 29Buzby J. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Google Scholar) has identified RNA binding proteins that bind to the mRNA and either stabilize or destabilize the transcript in question. Thus these RNA-binding proteins have a profound impact on protein expression from such mRNAs. For example, AUF1 and HuR bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) within the 3′-UTR to regulate mRNA stability. Although AUF1 binding accelerates message decay (29Buzby J. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Google Scholar), binding of the ELAV family member HuR impedes decay of the cognate message (20Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that HuR regulates expression of several inducible genes such as tumor necrosis factor-α (30Dean J. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Google Scholar). Therefore we hypothesized that HuR could interact with the ARE-rich 3′-UTR of COX-2 to regulate COX-2 mRNA stability and thus COX-2 expression in general. Here we have presented evidence that HuR is indeed a regulator of COX-2 expression. We tested whether HuR binds to COX-2 in cells. Our work shows that HuR binds to three high affinity HuR binding sites that lie in COX-2 3′-UTR subfragments F1, F3, and F4, named herein Sites I, II, and III. Site III is essentially a U-tract, whereas Site I site contains numerous AREs. This ARE-rich proximal portion of F1 is also known as CR1 (conserved region 1) because this sequence is evolutionarily conserved. Moreover this region has also been identified as the minimal element required for COX-2 regulation in response to p38 MAPK (stabilizes the COX-2 mRNA) and dexamethasone (accelerates COX-2 mRNA decay). Therefore, our finding that this 3′-UTR fragment that plays key role in COX-2 regulation also contains a binding site for the message stability factor, HuR, suggests that HuR may be involved in regulation of COX-2 mRNA stability induced by various factors. Furthermore it provides a basis for altering COX-2 message stability and thus COX-2 levels in response to a wide variety of signals. We find that the residues that are critical for HuR-COX-2 3′-UTR interaction are mostly U residues. This agrees with the consensus binding sequence for HuR (25Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar), which is also pyrimidine-rich and shows a strong requirement for the U residues. It also agrees with the critical residues depicted by the RNA-protein co-crystal of the closely related HuD protein (31Wang X. Tanaka Hall T.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 141-145Google Scholar). Altering these critical residues abolishes the ability of Sites I and III to bind HuR, thus reiterating their importance in this interaction. We tested whether HuR in cell extracts can bind to COX-2–3′-UTR. We have previously shown that MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells exhibit a serum withdrawal-induced post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). This event did not require transcription but required the activity of the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (15Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts of MDA-MB-231 cells with COX-2 3′-UTR fragments indicated the existence of RNA-protein complexes, which were specifically supershifted by the anti-HuR antibody. This suggests that naturally expressed HuR in MDA-MB-231 cells binds to the high affinity site on the COX-2 3′-UTR. Importantly, serum deprivation induced the cytosolic appearance of HuR, an event that is known to stabilize the transcripts for immediate-early genes such as c-fos (32Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Google Scholar). Because the binding data were suggestive of an interaction between HuR and COX-2, we checked whether there was a correlation between the cellular levels of HuR and COX-2. HuR binds to ARE-containing messages and stabilizes them; hence a decrease in HuR levels should bring about a concomitant decline in COX-2 levels. Our data show that reduction of HuR levels by antisense expression of HuR cDNA or siRNA-mediated repression resulted in the reduction of serum withdrawal-induced COX-2 levels. Both treatments resulted in the significant reduction in steady state HuR and COX-2 levels. These data imply that proper level of HuR expression is required for stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. Indeed, recent work in colon carcinoma cells (published during the preparation of our manuscript) suggests that enhanced overexpression of HuR results in exaggerated COX-2 induction (33Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Google Scholar). Our data complement that work and provide insight into the molecular basis underlying this regulation. In conclusion, our data define the biochemical basis for the interaction of the COX-2 3′-UTR with the RNA-binding protein HuR, which may be an effector molecule in regulating COX-2 expression in response to a wide range of stimuli. One of the ways by which factors that enhance COX-2 expression could act would be by simply enhancing the binding of HuR to the COX-2 message, whereas destabilizing agents could bring about the opposite effect. This binding occurs in vivo as well, as evidenced by our experiments with MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, HuR could be involved in the proper trafficking of COX-2 mRNA, without which degradation might occur. Moreover, suppression of HuR expression resulted in the inhibition of COX-2 induction. Therefore, the interaction of COX-2 and HuR could be an important event in pathological conditions in which enhanced expression of COX-2 is observed."

Chelerythrine inhibited the BclXL-Bak BH3 peptide binding with IC50 of 1.5 μm and displaced Bax, a BH3-containing protein, from BclXL. Mammalian cells treated with chelerythrine underwent apoptosis with characteristic features that suggest involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. While staurosporine, H7, etoposide, and chelerythrine released cytochrome c from mitochondria in intact cells, only chelerythrine released cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. Furthermore BclXL-overexpressing cells that were completely resistant to apoptotic stimuli used in this study remained sensitive to chelerythrine. Although chelerythrine is widely known as a protein kinase C inhibitor, the mechanism by which it mediates apoptosis remain controversial.

Although chelerythrine is widely known as a protein kinase C inhibitor, the mechanism by which it mediates apoptosis remain controversial. Our data suggest that chelerythrine triggers apoptosis through a mechanism that involves direct targeting of Bcl-2 family proteins. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of apoptosis. While the precise molecular mechanisms by which these proteins confer their biological activities remain to be determined, they are thought to act directly on the mitochondria (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family can be divided into three subfamilies based on several conserved sequence motifs known as Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; CytC, cytochrome c; H7, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; FP, fluorescence polarization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; CytC, cytochrome c; H7, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; FP, fluorescence polarization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. domains. The antiapoptotic members (Bcl-2, BclXL, Mcl-1, Bcl-1-w, and Ced-9) share all four BH domains, designated as BH1–4; the proapoptotic members Bax, Bak, Bok, and BclXs contain BH1–3 domains, but other proapoptotic members (Bid, Bad, Bik, and Egl1) only have a BH3 domain. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members appear to function, at least in part, by interacting with and antagonizing proapoptotic family members (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). The BH1–3 domains of BclXL form an elongated hydrophobic groove, which is the docking site for the BH3 domains of proapoptotic binding partners (3Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that BH3 domains from Bak and Bad proteins are required for binding to BclXL and for mediating their proapoptotic effect (4Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide derived from the Bak BH3 domain binds recombinant BclXL protein in vitro with high affinity (3Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Furthermore the Bak BH3 peptide alone is able to induce apoptosis when introduced into various cell lines (5Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between the BH3 domains from proapoptotic proteins and BclXL is important in mediating the proapoptotic signal. Therefore small molecular weight compounds that inhibit the BclXL-BH3 domain interaction could potentially act as apoptotic modulators. Indeed significant progress has been made in isolating compounds of this nature (6Baell J.B. Huang D.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). BH3I-1 and BH3I-2 were discovered by screening a library of 16,320 compounds for ones that disrupted the interaction between BclXL and a Bak BH3 peptide (7Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), whereas antimycin A was discovered serendipitously (8Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A few other compounds have also been discovered in silico, and they are of diverse structures (9Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc.

Natural products cover a molecular diversity not available from synthetic libraries with an unrivaled success rate as drug leads (12Nielsen J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, carried out a large scale high throughput screen of natural product extracts to uncover compounds that would disrupt the interaction between BclXL and the Bak BH3 peptide. Here we report the identification of chelerythrine (1,2-dimethoxy-12-methyl[1,3]benzodioxolo[5,6-c]phenanthridinium), which is a natural benzophenanthridine alkaloid and a known protein kinase C inhibitor (13Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), as an inhibitor of BclXL-Bak BH3 peptide binding. Chelerythrine released cytochrome c (CytC) from isolated mitochondria and induced apoptosis in BclXL-overexpressing cells that were completely resistant to staurosporine or etoposide. Chelerythrine thus represents the first BH3 mimetic identified through high throughput screening of natural products. Reagents and Cell Lines—Human SH-SY5Y and MCF7 cells were maintained as described previously (14Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells and FDC-P1 cells were gifts from Bert Vogelstein (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and David C. Huang (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute), respectively. LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the user's manual, and BclXL stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) and maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B after 2–3 weeks of selection. The peptide protease inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was from Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA. Staurosporine, H7 (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine), and etoposide were from Sigma, and BH3I-1 was from Calbiochem. Fluorescence Polarization (FP) Assay—The Bak BH3 peptide labeled with fluorescein at the N terminus was synthesized by Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) and purified by HPLC. The peptide was dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mm. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl/well containing 50 μg/ml glutathione S-transferase (GST)-BclXLΔC19 and a 60 nm concentration of the labeled peptide in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). 5 μl of natural product extracts were added to the wells, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and FP values were determined using a Tecan Ultra plate reader. Isolation of Chelerythrine—A MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1:1) extract from the stems of Bocconia vulcanica (Papaveraceae) was separated using a modified Kupchan solvent partition method (15Pettit G.R. Kamano Y. Aoyagi R. Herald C.L. Doubek D.L. Schmidt J.M. Rudloe J.J. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 985-994Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to give an active CH2Cl2 fraction. The active fraction was fractionated using gradient C18 HPLC (20–30% ACN, H2O buffered with 0.1% formic acid) and preparative TLC on silica gel (1% MeOH, CHCl3) to yield chelerythrine (0.9 mg), identical in all respects to that reported previously (16Hanaoka M. Motonishi T. Mukai C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1986; 1: 2253-2256Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Experiments subsequent to the identification of the compound were performed with chelerythrine chloride purchased from Sigma. Antibodies—Anti-BCL-2 (100), anti-Bcl-xS/L (S-19), anti-Bax (N-20), and anti-Bid (C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Bak (Ab2) was from Oncogene Research Products. Anti-CytC (7H8.2C12) antibody was from BD Biosciences Pharmingen, and antibodies against actin and cytochrome oxidase IV were from Sigma. Production of GST-BclXL— The DNA sequence encoding BclXLΔC19 was inserted into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX-TK4E (14Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL 21, and the fusion protein was isolated as described previously (14Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GSTBclXLΔ19 was eluted with 100 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Eluate was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% glycerol and concentrated to 1 μg/ml using Amicon centrifugal concentrating devices. In Vitro Binding Analysis—Labeled Bax was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of pXJHA-Bax (17Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Bevort M. Ang K.C. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2802-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega. The GST binding assay was performed as described previously (14Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) except that increasing concentrations of chelerythrine were incubated with GSTBclXLΔ19 30 min prior to the addition [35S]Bax. CytC Release from Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were suspended in isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 μm dithiothreitol) and disrupted by 10 expulsions through a 27-gauge needle. Disrupted cells were centrifuged two times at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris and nucleus. The supernatants were centrifuged at 3000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondria pellets were resuspended in assay buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) at 0.5 mg/ml and treated at room temperature with the indicated compounds for 15 min followed by centrifugation. CytC released into the supernatant was subjected to fractionation by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Flow Cytometry—For detection of sub-G1 DNA, cells were washed once, resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in a 50-fold excess of ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed, stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Mitochondrial potential change as measured by JC-1 staining was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed. Identification of Chelerythrine as an Inhibitor of BclXL and BH3 Peptide Interaction—A high throughput screen based on FP (7Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) was devised to identify compounds that disrupt the interaction between BclXL and the BH3 domain of Bak. A total of 107,423 extracts prepared from plants, actinomycetes, fungi, marine invertebrates, and marine bacteria were screened. Twelve extracts were chosen for isolation of active compounds, and the active principle of four extracts from plants was found to be chelerythrine (Fig. 1A). Chelerythrine displaced the fluorescently labeled BH3 domain peptide from a recombinant GST-BcLXL fusion protein with IC50 of 1.5 μm (Fig. 1B). Similar concentrations of chelerythrine with GST protein and the labeled peptide produced no significant change in polarization (Fig. 1B). Chelerythrine Disrupts the Interaction between BclXL and Bax—The ability of chelerythrine to displace the Bak BH3 peptide in the FP assay suggests that it may be able to displace BH3-containing proteins from BclXL. In vitro translated [35S]Bax bound specifically to GST-BclXL immobilized on glutathione beads, and the addition of chelerythrine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Bax binding (Fig. 1, C and D). Chelerythrine was, however, unable to disrupt interaction between the Caenorhabditis elegans sex determination proteins [35S]FEM3 and GST-FEM2 (18Tan K.M. Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44193-44202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) immobilized on glutathione beads (data not shown), suggesting that the action of chelerythrine on Bax and BclXL was specific. The solution structure of Bcl-2 has been solved (19Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and the data suggest that Bcl-2 and BclXL have highly similar three-dimensional structures, including the hydrophobic groove. Interestingly we found that the binding of Bax to Bcl-2 was disrupted by chelerythrine in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Chelerythrine-mediated Apoptosis Exhibits Characteristic Features Similar to Cell Death Induced by Proapoptotic Members of the Bcl-2 Family—Since the mitochondria play a key role in the control of apoptosis and it is the main site where BclXL and Bcl-2 exert their function, we evaluated mitochondrial function in response to chelerythrine with the fluorescent dye JC-1 that allows the analysis of mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm). Treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (20Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with chelerythrine at 2.5 and 5 μm for 16 h induced a substantial decrease in mitochondrial potential as indicated by an increase in JC-1 green fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B). Chelerythrine-induced mitochondrial potential changes were partially inhibited by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD (Fig. 2, A and B), similar to reports showing that Bax-induced mitochondrial potential change was partially sensitive to caspase inhibition (21Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with chelerythrine also induced the appearance of sub-G1 DNA that is indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 2, C and D). The appearance of sub-G1 DNA is totally blocked by the addition of ZVAD (Fig. 2, C and D), which is consistent with the notion that DNA fragmentation is dependent on caspase activation (22Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The ZVAD-treated cells without sub-G1 DNA, however, were not viable since they were unable to grow upon replating on fresh tissue culture plates (data not shown). Similar to apoptosis mediated by proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, inhibition of caspases only slows down but does not abrogate the cell death process (23Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 24Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The change in mitochondrial potential and the appearance sub-G1 DNA upon chelerythrine treatments were observed in two other cell lines, HCT116, a colon carcinoma cell line, and MCF7, a breast cancer cell line (data not shown), suggesting that the effect is not limited to SH-SY5Y cells. Chelerythrine Triggers CytC Release from Isolated Mitochondria—Many death stimuli trigger apoptosis through the release of CytC from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to activate Apaf-1, thus coupling this organelle to caspase activation. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with etoposide, staurosporine, and H7 (20Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as chelerythrine induced mitochondrial potential change, CytC release from the mitochondria (Fig. 3, A and B), and the appearance of sub-G1 DNA (data not shown), which are hallmarks of apoptosis. However, if the action of chelerythrine is on BclXL or Bcl-2 on the mitochondria, it should be able to trigger CytC release directly from isolated mitochondria as observed with proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (25Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). To investigate this, mitochondria were isolated from healthy SH-SY5Y cells and subjected to treatment with various death stimuli. Chelerythrine released CytC from isolated mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). Etoposide and other protein kinase C inhibitors such as H7 and staurosporine were unable to do so (Fig. 3, C and D) even at concentrations exceeding the required amount to induce apoptosis in intact cells (Fig. 3, B–D, and data not shown). The interactions of Bax or Bak with BclXL in the mitochondrial preparation, if any, appeared to be very weak (data not shown). It was therefore technically difficult to determine whether there was a reduction in heterodimerization between the proteins upon chelerythrine treatment. It is possible that the CytC release represents a direct antagonistic effect of chelerythrine on BclXL/Bcl-2 function. Chelerythrine Induces Apoptosis in BclXL-overexpressing SH-SY5Y Cells—Overexpression of Bcl-2 or BclXL is able to block cell death induced by many forms of death stimuli, e.g. radiation and most chemotherapeutic drugs (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar, 27Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). The limited concentrations of endogenous factors serving the apoptotic signaling pathway preceding the mitochondria step enable BclXL overexpression to block these signals. On the other hand, if a compound acts directly on BclXL, it should be able to overcome the effect of overexpression of the protein easily since cellular protein concentration, even in a state of overexpression, is limited in comparison to concentrations achievable with small molecular weight compounds. To test our hypothesis, we generated SH-SY5Y cells that overexpress BclXL. In these cells the level of BclXL is greatly enhanced, while other members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax, Bak, and Bid stay relatively constant with a moderate down-regulation of Bcl-2 level (Fig. 4A). Treatment of BclXL-overexpressing cells with staurosporine up to 1 μm did not induce cell death as indicated by the lack of mitochondrial potential change (Fig. 4B, data not shown) as well as the absence of sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the vector line was very sensitive to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Nearly 100% of the cells exhibited mitochondrial potential change, and 80% of the cells contained sub-G1 DNA when only a 100 nm concentration of the drug was added (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly the apoptotic effects of etoposide (Fig. 4, B and C) and H7 (data not shown) were abolished by BclXL overexpression. Interestingly, although the staurosporine- and etoposide-treated BclXL-overexpressing cells did not undergo apoptosis, they were arrested at the G2 and S phase of the cell cycle, respectively (see the supplemental figure). These observations are consistent with previous reports indicating that cell cycle arrests induced by genotoxic drugs are not affected by BclXL overexpression (28Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of BclXL was able to confer resistance to the killing effect of chelerythrine at low concentration of up to 2 μm. At higher concentrations, chelerythrine overcame the protective effect of BclXL and induced apoptosis in these cells effectively (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with a Bcl-2-overexpressing, mouse interleukin-3-dependent, promyelocytic cell line, FDC-P1, in which chelerythrine at concentrations higher than 1.25 μm was able to overcome the protective effect of Bcl-2 (data not shown). The data suggest that chelerythrine, unlike staurosporine, H7, and etoposide, induces apoptosis by inhibiting BclXL/Bcl-2 directly. Enhanced expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins in cancer cells has been implicated in resistance to currently available antineoplastic agents (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar, 27Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine has been shown to exhibit cytotoxic activity against radioresistant and chemoresistant squamous carcinoma cells and p53-deficient cells (29Chmura S.J. Dolan M.E. Cha A. Mauceri H.J. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 737-742PubMed Google Scholar). It delays tumor growth in an experimental model with relatively mild toxicity to the animal (29Chmura S.J. Dolan M.E. Cha A. Mauceri H.J. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 737-742PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that chelerythrine may act as a BH3 mimetic that is able to circumvent the upstream antiapoptotic barriers in transformed cells and thus can be explored as a potential anticancer therapeutic. The inhibitors of BclXL-BH3 interaction identified so far are all proapoptotic in nature. However, the diverse structural differences among these compounds suggest that they may act through multiple mechanisms in affecting the Bcl-2 family proteins. Interestingly BclXL overexpression confers slight protection against chelerythrine- and BH3I-1-induced apoptosis, while it sensitizes the cells toward antimycin A3 (8Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The identification of chelerythrine as a novel inhibitor of BclXL-BH3 interaction adds to the repertoire of reagents that are invaluable in defining the molecular mechanisms by which proteins of the Bcl-2 family mediate their functions.

The Drosophila insulin receptor (DInR) is required for photoreceptor-cell (R-cell) axons to find their way from the retina to the brain during development of the visual system. DInR functions as a guidance receptor for the adapter protein Dock/Nck. This function is independent of Chico, the Drosophila insulin receptor substrate (IRS) homolog."

The major physiological role of MRP2 is to transport conjugated metabolites into the bile canaliculus, whereas MRP3 is localized in the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes and transports similar metabolites back to the bloodstream. Both proteins were shown to interact with a large variety of transported substrates, and earlier studies suggested that MRPs may work as co-transporters for different molecules. In the present study we expressed the human MRP2 and MRP3 proteins in insect cells and examined their transport and ATPase characteristics in isolated, inside-out membrane vesicles. We found that the primary active transport of estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), a major product of human steroid metabolism, was differently modulated by bile acids and organic anions in the case of human MRP2 and MRP3. Active E217βG transport by MRP2 was significantly stimulated by the organic anions indomethacin, furosemide, and probenecid and by several conjugated bile acids. In contrast, all of these agents inhibited E217βG transport by MRP3. We found that in the case of MRP2, ATP-dependent vesicular bile acid transport was increased by E217βG, and the results indicated an allosteric cross-stimulation, probably a co-transport of bile acids and glucuronate conjugates through this protein. There was no such stimulation of bile acid transport by MRP3.

Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Google Scholar). The lack of functional MRP2 causes the human disease Dubin-Johnson syndrome, which is associated with a large increase of conjugated bilirubin and other conjugated metabolites in the bloodstream. Several animal models are available for modeling this disease condition (14Kitamura T. Jansen P. Hardenbrook C. Kamimoto Y. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ABC transporter ABCB11 (also referred to as sister P-glycoprotein or bile salt export pump (BSEP)) is localized in the canalicular membrane and considered to be the major bile salt transporter (19Gerloff T.

In the enterohepatic cycle a major part, about 95% of the secreted bile salts is reabsorbed in the intestine, whereas the rest is excreted into the feces after bacterial degradation. The relative role of the ABC transporters in this enterohepatic circulation is currently under study. Elevated levels of MRP3 expression have been detected in human hepatocellular carcinoma (22Nies A.T. Konig J. Pfannschmidt M. Klar E. Hofmann W.J. Keppler D. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 492-499Google Scholar) and in Dubin-Johnson patients, when in the absence of a functional MRP2, MRP3 seems to have a compensatory transport function (4König J. Rost D. Cui Y. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Google Scholar, 7König J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Google Scholar, 13Cui Y. König J. Buchholz U. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937Google Scholar). In this case several compounds, normally extruded into the bile, are transported by MRP3 into the sinusoidal blood. MRP3 is also up-regulated under cholestatic conditions and agents (23Donner M.G. Keppler D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 351-359Google Scholar, 24Hitzl M. Klein K. Zanger U.M. Fritz P. Nüssler A.K.

In the present paper we provide data for the interactions of MRP2 and MRP3 with estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide and bile acids, as well as with some pharmacologically important organic anions. A major metabolite of human estrogen metabolism, estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), has been shown to be transported by both MRP2 (7König J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46400-46407Google Scholar). This metabolite, with a significantly increased level during pregnancy and hormone replacement therapy, is secreted into the bile mainly by MRP2 (21Vore M. Lin Y. Huang L. Drug. Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 183-203Google Scholar, 29Takikawa H. Yamazaki R. Sano M. Yamanaka M. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 607-613Google Scholar). Estrogen metabolites and other steroid glucuronides show hepatotoxic effects (30Slikker W.J.R. Vore M. Bailey J.R. Meyers M. Montgomery C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In pregnancy and in hormone replacement therapy, taurocholate decreases E217βG uptake in isolated rat hepatocytes (32Brock W.J. Vore M. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1984; 12: 713-716Google Scholar), and certain MRP3 substrates induce MRP3 overexpression in cholestatic conditions (23Donner M.G. Keppler D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 351-359Google Scholar, 24Hitzl M. Klein K. Zanger U.M. Fritz P. Nüssler A.K. Neuhaus P. Fromm M.F. Pharmacology. 2003; 304: 524-530Google Scholar, 25Scheffer G.L.

All of these data suggest an interrelated transport of bile acids and glucuronide-conjugated metabolites in the liver cells. To explore these relationships we examined the transport properties of human MRP2 and MRP3, expressed at similar high levels in Sf9 cells. In isolated Sf9 membrane vesicles we measured both human MRP2- and MRP3-dependent direct vesicular uptake of labeled compounds, as well as the effects of these compounds on the MRP ATPase activity. Our data suggest that both MRP2 and MRP3 play important physiological roles in the transport of glucuronide conjugates and bile salts and that MRP2 performs a co-transport of glucuronide conjugates and bile salts into the bile canaliculi. In contrast, glucuronide transport into the bloodstream by MRP3 is inhibited by bile salts. We also demonstrate a differential modulation of these transport pathways by pharmacologically active organic anions. These results may help to understand the molecular basis of the complex interactions of metabolite and drug transport in the human liver and intestine.

As documented, all three MRPs were successfully expressed at high levels (with an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa) in the Sf9 insect cells. The comparable amount of the expression of the three different human MRPs (about 5–7% of the total membrane proteins) allowed the direct comparison of the transport activities of these proteins in the following experiments.

In the following experiments we used isolated membranes, forming inside-out membrane vesicles from these human MRP-expressing Sf9 cells. Vesicular Transport of E217βG by Human MRPs—In the following experiments we studied the transport of E217βG, a typical glucuronide conjugate, which may be a physiologically relevant model substrate of these transporters. This compound has been indicated to be transported substrate for both MRP2 and MRP3 (5Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Google Scholar, 7König J. Nies A.T.

By using isolated, inverted Sf9 membrane vesicles, we have directly examined the vesicular transport of E217βG by the three different MRPs and examined the modulation of this transport by bile acids, bile salt conjugates, and organic anions. Fig. 2 documents the ATP-dependent uptake of radiolabeled E217βG in isolated Sf9 cell membrane vesicles expressing MRP3 (panel A) and MRP2 (panel B). The uptake values were obtained by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of AMP (which was low in all experiments). Also, as a control, we used vesicles obtained from Sf9 cells expressing β-galactosidase. In these latter vesicles ATP-dependent tracer uptake was negligible. In all of these experiments the linear phase of the tracer uptake was determined (2 min for E217βG), and this period was used for studying the concentration dependence of the uptake. As documented in Fig. 2A, MgATP-energized E217βG uptake in human MRP3-containing membrane vesicles was a saturable function of the E217βG concentration, with a calculated maximum uptake rate of about 1.3 nmol/mg membrane protein/min, and an apparent Km value of about 25–30 μm. When we measured E217βG uptake in Sf9 membrane vesicles containing comparable amounts of human MRP1, the concentration dependence of E217βG uptake gave a Km value of about 5–8 μm, but the maximum transport rate was significantly lower (about 0.1 nmol/mg membrane protein/min) than that in the case of MRP3 (38Bodó A. Bakos E.́. Szeri F. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Toxicology Let. 2003; 140–141C: 133-143Google Scholar). In contrast to MRP3, as shown in Fig. 2B, membrane vesicles prepared from human MRP2-expressing Sf9 cells had an entirely different concentration dependence of E217βG uptake. The rate of E217βG uptake at low E217βG concentrations (see inset in Fig. 2B) had an S-shaped curve, and saturation of the E217βG uptake was only achieved above 1 mm E217βG concentrations. Moreover, the maximum uptake rate of E217βG by MRP2 was about 10 times higher (12 nmol/mg membrane protein/min) than that for MRP3. These data indicate that MRP3 (and also MRP1) is a relatively high affinity but low capacity transporter for E217βG, whereas MRP2 has a much lower affinity but significantly higher transport capacity for this glucuronate conjugate. The S-shaped curve of concentration dependence seen in the case of MRP2 indicates a complex interaction of this transporter protein with E217βG. Effect of E217βG on the Membrane ATPase Activity of Human MRPs—In the following experiments we have studied the vanadate-sensitive membrane ATPase activity in isolated membranes of Sf9 cells, containing comparable amounts of the MRP proteins (Fig. 1). As documented earlier (33Bakos É. Hegedűs T. Holló Z.S. Welker E. Tusnády G.E. Zaman G.J. Flens M.J. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12322-12326Google Scholar, 34Bakos É.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar), this ATPase activity is closely related to the transport activity of the ABC transporter proteins, and substrate stimulation of the ATPase reflects the interaction of the respective transporter with its transported substrate(s). The E217βG concentration dependence of this vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity for MRP2 and MRP3 is shown in Fig. 3. As documented, we found only a slight (although significant) stimulation of the MRP3 ATPase activity at E217βG concentrations between 20 and 100 μm. In the case of MRP1 only a moderate increase in the ATPase activity was seen (38Bodó A. Bakos E.́. Szeri F. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Toxicology Let. 2003; 140–141C: 133-143Google Scholar), as compared with that in β-galactosidase-expressing Sf9 cell membranes. In contrast, in membranes containing comparable amounts of human MRP2, there was a large increase in the membrane ATPase activity at E217βG concentrations above 100 μm. This ATPase activity increased up to 8–10 nmol/mg membrane protein/min at about 0.5 mm E217βG and did not reach a maximum level even at 1 mm of E217βG concentration (higher concentrations could not be properly applied under the present experimental conditions). It is important to note that the E217βG uptake rate by MRP2, as shown in Fig. 2B, closely correlates with these ATPase measurements, reinforcing that the vanadate-sensitive ATPase reflects transport-associated ATP hydrolysis by MRP2. These membrane ATPase experiments support the conclusions obtained from direct E217βG transport experiments, suggesting that MRP3 (and MRP1) is a higher affinity but a much lower capacity transporter for E217βG than MRP2. Modulation of the MRP3- and MRP2-dependent Vesicular Transport of E217βG by Organic Anions and Bile Salts—In the following experiments we examined the effects of the organic anions, furosemide, probenecid, and indomethacin (IM) on the direct, vesicular uptake of labeled E217βG in MRP3-containing (Fig. 4A) and MRP2-containing (Fig. 4B) membranes, respectively. These experiments were carried out at two fixed E217βG concentrations (1 and 13 μm) for both MRP3 and MRP2, to study these modulatory effects at E217βG concentrations below the respective Km values. We expected that both the inhibitory or the possible allosteric stimulatory effects could be optimally studied under these conditions. We found that in the case of MRP3, E217βG transport was inhibited by all of the three organic anions. The approximate Ki values were 350 μm for furosemide, 400 μm for probenecid, and 60 μm for indomethacin. In the case of MRP3, a slight 20–25% stimulation of E217βG uptake was observed by low concentrations (5–10 μm) of indomethacin. Fig. 4A shows E217βG uptake data measured at 1 μm E217βG concentration, but similar results were obtained at higher (13 μm) E217βG concentrations as well. We have already described (38Bodó A. Bakos E.́. Szeri F. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Toxicology Let. 2003; 140–141C: 133-143Google Scholar) that both indomethacin and furosemide significantly stimulate MRP3 ATPase activity; thus both of these anions are most probably transported substrates of MRP3. Still, their predominant effect on E217βG uptake was inhibitory. As shown in Fig. 4B, in the case of MRP2, the effects of these organic anions were entirely different; furosemide and probenecid, between a wide concentration range of 50–500 μm significantly stimulated the ATP-dependent E217βG uptake by MRP2, and this stimulation reached about 150% of the transport rate measured without these organic anions. Moreover, indomethacin in concentrations between 50 and 100 μm induced a 6–6.5-fold stimulation of E217βG transport activity by MRP2, and a 5-fold stimulation of this transport was still observed at 500 μm indomethacin. Fig. 4B shows the data measured at 13 μm E217βG concentration, but similar results were obtained at lower (1 μm) E217βG concentrations as well. In the following experiments we have studied the effect various bile salt conjugates on the vesicular uptake of labeled E217βG by MRP3 (Fig. 5A) and MRP2 (Fig. 5B), respectively. We have examined the effects of GC, GCDC, TDC, and TCDC, all potential physiological intrahepatic bile salts in humans. Again, these experiments were carried out at two fixed E217βG concentrations (1 and 13 μm) for both MRP3 and MRP2. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the case of MRP3, E217βG transport (measured at 1 μm E217βG) was inhibited by all bile salts examined. In the case of GC this inhibition was more pronounced at about 100 μm, whereas the other bile salt conjugates strongly inhibited E217βG already at 10 μm concentrations. When E217βG uptake was measured at higher (13 μm) E217βG concentrations, all bile salts were inhibitory as well (data not shown). Fig. 5B documents that in the case of MRP2, all bile salts examined significantly stimulated ATP-dependent E217βG uptake (measured here at 1 μm E217βG). This stimulatory effect increased up to 100 μm of bile salt concentrations and reached about 180–200% in the case of GC, TCDC, and GCDC, whereas TDC was somewhat less effective in this stimulation. All of these data indicate that the ATP-dependent active E217βG uptake, carried out by MRP2, is allosterically modulated by various organic anions and bile salt conjugates. To better characterize these interactions, we performed detailed E217βG concentration dependence studies by examining the effects of IM and that of the most abundant physiological bile salt conjugate in humans, GC in MRP2-containing membrane vesicles. We examined fixed concentrations (100 μm) of IM and GC, respectively, at an E217βG concentration range (10–100 μm), in which an S-shaped concentration dependence of E217βG uptake was observed (F"

Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-4 in hypertrophic agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, its role in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is not known. We employed an in vitro mechanical stretch model of cultured cardiomyocytes and used rat B-type natriuretic peptide promoter as stretch-sensitive reporter gene. Stretch transiently increased GATA-4 DNA binding activity and transcript levels, which was followed by increases in the expression of B-type natriuretic peptide as well as atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal α-actin genes. The stretch inducibility mapped primarily to the proximal 520 bp of the B-type natriuretic peptide promoter. Mutational studies showed that the tandem GATA consensus sites of the proximal promoter in combination with an Nkx-2.5 binding element are critical for stretch-activated B-type natriuretic peptide transcription. Inhibition of GATA-4 protein production by adenovirus-mediated transfer of GATA-4 antisense cDNA blocked stretch-induced increases in B-type natriuretic peptide transcript levels and the sarcomere reorganization. The proportion of myocytes with assembled sarcomeres in control adenovirus-infected cultures increased from 14 to 59% in response to stretch, whereas the values for GATA-4 antisense-treated cells were 6 and 13%, respectively.

Cardiac hypertrophy is the primary adaptive mechanism for terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes to increased hemodynamic load. In addition to mechanical stretch, a number of humoral factors, such as G-protein-coupled receptor agonists angiotensin II and endothelin-1 (ET-1) 1The abbreviations used are: ET-1, endothelin-1; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; AP-1, activator protein-1; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; rBNP, rat BNP; ds, double-stranded; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-AT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NKE, Nkx-2.5 binding element; skαA, skeletal muscle α-actin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum. as well as adrenergic receptor agonists released by the activated symphatic nervous system participate in the adaptive process and modify the growth of cardiac myocytes in vivo (for review, see Refs. 1Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Google Scholar and 2Swynghedauw B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 215-262Google Scholar). When the cardiac overload is sustained, this initially compensatory mechanism fails, and the contractile function is impaired, leading to congestive heart failure (1Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Google Scholar). The hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes is characterized by morphologic changes that include increase in cell size and protein synthesis and enhanced sarcomere reorganization as well as specific changes in cardiac gene expression (2Swynghedauw B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 215-262Google Scholar, 3Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Google Scholar). The early genetic response to hemodynamic overload is the activation of immediate early response genes such as c-fos and c-jun, components of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. This is followed by up-regulation of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and reactivation of fetal genes such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), β-myosin heavy chain, and skeletal muscle α-actin (skαA) (2Swynghedauw B.

The mechanisms regulating the genetic reprogramming in cardiac overload has been the subject of intensive research. GATA-4 was originally shown to be a crucial regulator of cardiogenesis and cardiac-specific genes such as ANP and BNP (for review, see Refs. 7Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Google Scholar and 8Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of GATA-4 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. First, hemodynamic overload caused by aortic banding, Arg8 vasopressin infusion, or nephrectomy in vivo (9Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N.

Third, overexpression of GATA-4 in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes by adenoviral gene transfer or in the hearts of transgenic mice was shown to be sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (13Liang Q.

Meloche S. Nemer M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2702-2719Google Scholar). Finally, expression of dominant negative GATA-4 or antisense GATA-4 cDNA blocked GATA-4-directed transcriptional responses and features of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine and ET-1 (13Liang Q.

Although these observations have implicated GATA-4 as sufficient and, in the case of hypertrophic agonist-induced hypertrophy, a necessary mediator of the hypertrophic response, it is not known whether direct mechanical stretch also activates the hypertrophic program via GATA-4-dependent mechanism(s). To directly address the role of GATA-4 and its potential cofactors in mechanical stretch-activated hypertrophic program, we employed an in vitro mechanical stretch model of cardiomyocytes. The model provides the advantage to dissect the mechanical component from the humoral and neural components of hemodynamic overload, which are always present in the whole animal. Stretch of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes has been shown to stimulate BNP transcription (23Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Google Scholar), therefore providing a useful target gene to elucidate the mechanisms of stretch-induced gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Our present data show that GATA-4 is a critical regulator of transcriptional and morphological changes induced by mechanical stretching of cardiomyocytes.

Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Google Scholar). In mutation experiments we used p(Δ–534/+4)BNP subcloned in pGL3 Basic background (Promega, Madison, WI), referred here as –534rBNP, to obtain higher reporter activities (17Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R.

Several candidate clones were sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Plasmid expressing murine Nkx-2.5 (pEF-FLAG-Nkx2.5) was a generous gift from R. P. Harvey (The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Darlinghurst, Australia) (27Ranganayakulu G. Elliott D.A. Harvey R.P. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 3037-3048Google Scholar). The generation of recombinant replication-deficient adenoviruses type 5 expressing a nuclear localization signal-lacZ and antisense directed specifically toward GATA-4 have been described previously (28Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Google Scholar, 29French B.A. Mazur W. Ali N.M. Geske R.S. Finnigan J.P. Rodgers G.P. Roberts R. Raizner A.E. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2402-2413Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Gene Transfer—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (hereafter referred as cardiomyocytes) were prepared and cultured in conditions as previously described (17Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Google Scholar, 25Tokola H. Salo K. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 195-206Google Scholar). Briefly, the ventricular apexes of hearts of 2–4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were digested with disaggregation medium (collagenase type 2, 2 g/liter and 50 μm CaCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 37 °C. The cells were filtered, washed twice, and suspended in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM/F-12-FBS). The cells were pre-plated into 100-mm culture dishes (BD Falcon™, BD Biosciences) for 45 min at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2 to reduce the number of contaminating non-muscle cells. Cells not attached to the pre-plated dishes were plated on Bioflex collagen 6-well plates (Flexcell, McKeesport, PA) or 24-well culture plates (BD Biosciences Falcon™) at a density of 1800 cells/mm2. The next day, when designed, myocytes were transfected with FuGENE™ 6 in fresh DMEM/F-12-FBS for 6–8 h. The total amounts of FuGENE™ 6 reagent and DNA were 6 and 3 μg/1.8 × 106 cells, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. To control the transfection efficiency, luciferase reporter plasmids were cotransfected with Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase plasmids at the ratio of 2:1. The DMEM/F-12-FBS was replaced with complete serum-free medium 24 h after plating. The composition of complete serum-free medium was similar to that described earlier (25Tokola H. Salo K. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 195-206Google Scholar), except that the concentration of triiodothyronine was 0.1 nm. In adenovirus experiments, infections were performed to myocytes 4 h after switching to complete serum-free medium at a multiplicity of infection of 4 by adding the appropriate recombinant adenovirus to the culture media overnight. The media were replaced every 24 h. After experiments, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and quickly frozen at –70 °C. The reporter gene activities were measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with Luminoskan RS luminometer (ThermoLabsystems, Vantaa, Finland). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were plated onto 100-mm culture plates and transfected with 1 μg of pEF-FLAG-Nkx2.5 or pMT2 control plasmid with FuGENE™ 6 reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to nuclear protein extraction. Application of Mechanical Stretch—Stretch was introduced to attached myocytes after 18–24 h in complete serum-free medium by applying a computer-controlled vacuum suction under the flexible-bottomed Bioflex collagen plates with Flexercell Strain Unit FX-3000 (Flexcell). The vacuum varied in two-second cycles at a level sufficient to promote 10–25% elongation of the cardiomyocytes at the point of maximal distension of the culture surface. Immunofluorescence—The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, fixed, and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. Filamentous actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (1:20, Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR). To score for reorganized cells, random fields (minimum of 10 per well) were taken by laser confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss) using green fluorescence channel. The number of cardiomyocytes harboring striated actomyosin fibers extending from one extremity of the cell to the other was counted and divided by the total number of cardiomyocytes in the same field. These observations were performed blindly. Western Blot—Protein extracts were boiled in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Optitran BA-S 85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and then incubated with GATA-4 antibody (H-112) at a 1:5000 dilution in 1% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Antibody binding was detected with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-IgG at a 1:2000 dilution and revealed using ECL+Plus as described by the manufacturer. Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was isolated using the guanidine thiocyanate-CsCl method (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). For the RNA Northern blot analyses, 0.5–6-μg samples were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The cDNA probes complementary to rat ANP, BNP, skαA, and GATA-4 mRNA or ribosomal 18 S RNA were random prime-labeled with Rediprime™ II (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for skαA and GATA-4 were made by reverse transcription-PCR technique and confirmed by sequencing to correspond bases 2950–3184 of rat skαA and 1196–2613 of rat GATA-4 (GenBank™ accession numbers v01218 and l22761, respectively). The membranes were hybridized and washed 3 × 20 min at +62 °C as previously described (25Tokola H. Salo K. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 195-206Google Scholar). Thereafter, the membranes were exposed with PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences), which were scanned with Molecular Imager FX Pro Plus and quantitated using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Northern blot analysis using these cDNA probes revealed one single band of appropriate size. The hybridization signals of specific mRNAs were normalized to that of 18 S RNA in each sample. Protein Extraction and DNA Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells as described by Schreiber et al. (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Cells were washed and scraped with Tris-buffered saline. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, supplemented with 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 6 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) by gentle pipetting and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by adding 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing vigorously for 10 s followed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) for 30 s. Supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA with supplements similar to those in buffer A) and rocked for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. The entire procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Probes were prepared by Klenow fragment-mediated filling of the sticky ends of double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotides and labeled with [α32P]dCTP. Binding reactions contained 3–6 μg of nuclear protein and 2 μg of poly-(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) in a buffer containing 16 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm EGTA, 8% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and when appropriate, various molar excesses of competitor DNAs. When designed, supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with 1 μg of appropriate antibody for 20 min at room temperature before performing the binding reaction. After a 10-min preincubation of extract, the labeled probe was added, and binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixes were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. After drying, the gel DNA-protein complexes were detected and quantitated as the Northern blot membranes. Assay of Immunoreactive ANP and BNP—Radioimmunoassays of ANP and BNP were done as previously described (5Magga J. Marttila M. Mäntymaa P. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2505-2515Google Scholar, 32Vuolteenaho O. Arjamaa O. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 82-88Google Scholar). The sensitivities of the BNP and ANP assays were 2 and 1 fmol/tube, respectively. 50% displacements of the respective standard curve occurred at 16 and 25 fmol/tube. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations were 10 and 15%, respectively. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. For multiple comparisons, data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by a least significant difference post hoc test. For comparison of two groups at each time point Student's t test for unpaired data was used. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mechanical Stretch Induces a Hypertrophic Phenotype—To validate the experimental system we first analyzed the effect of mechanical stretch on the gene expression of BNP, ANP, and skαA, which represents genetic hallmarks of the stretch-induced cardiac hypertrophic program (23Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Google Scholar, 33Komuro I. Katoh Y. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi M. Hoh E. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1265-1268Google Scholar, 34Gardner D.G. Wirtz H. Dobbs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E239-E244Google Scholar, 35Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Google Scholar). Cyclic mechanical stretch elevated BNP mRNA levels significantly after 4 h, peaking at 24 h (2.1-fold, Fig. 1A). Similarly, mechanical stretch caused significant increases in ANP and skαA mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Elevated natriuretic peptide mRNA levels were accompanied by increased peptide secretion from cardiomyocytes into the culture medium (Fig. 1, D and E). Conclusively, because of rapid response at the level of mRNA and the peptide released, BNP provides a sensitive target gene to further study the stretch-inducible signaling mechanisms. Proximal 520 bp of rBNP 5′-Flanking Sequences Is Sufficient to Confer Stretch Inducibility—To identify the rat BNP promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by mechanical stretch, we transfected cardiomyocytes with luciferase reporter constructs driven by various lengths of the rBNP 5′-flanking sequence. Removal of about 1.2 kilobases of the –2200 rBNP 5′-flanking sequence down to –940 resulted in about a 30% decrease in basal reporter activity (Fig. 2). Further deletion down to –520 increased basal promoter activity, in agreement with the suggested presence of repressor elements distally from –520 (21Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the rBNP 5′-flanking region from –2200 to –520 did not significantly change the inducibility of the rBNP promoter in response to mechanical stretch. Yet truncation down to –114 reduced the basal as well as mechanical stretch-induced promoter activity by 70–80% compared with –520rBNP. Further deletion to –60 completely abolished the stretch response. The –60 rBNP possessed only 3% of original basal promoter activity. GATA-4 and AP-1 Are Activated by Mechanical Stretch—The tandem GATA elements within the –520-bp BNP promoter are well conserved between mammalian species (rat, human, and dog, Ref. 26Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Google Scholar). Moreover, these elements have been shown to mediate the activation of rBNP promoter in response to hemodynamic volume overload in vivo (11Marttila M. Hautala N. Paradis P. Toth M. Vuolteenaho O. Nemer M. Ruskoaho H. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4693-4700Google Scholar), suggesting an important role in stretch-activated BNP transcription. Therefore, we used 30-bp ds oligonucleotide probe containing the –90 GATA sites of rBNP (rBNP-90 GATA) as the probe in EMSA to analyze whether mechanical stretch activates nuclear protein binding on these sites. As shown in Fig. 3A, stretch transiently increased GATA DNA binding activity peaking at 1 h. Octamer-1 binding activity remained unaffected by stretch excluding unspecific effect on nuclear protein-DNA interaction (Fig. 3B). To determine the specificity of GATA binding activity, competition analyses were performed (Fig. 3D). The formation of complexes with the rBNP-90 GATA probe was dose-dependently inhibited by the unlabeled self DNA, but not by the mutated BNP GATA site, confirming the specific protein-DNA interaction. Supershift analysis clearly showed complete antibody-induced supershift of the GATA-4 but not GATA-5 or -6 complexes (Fig. 3E). To study the effect of mechanical stretch on GATA-4 gene expression, Northern blot analysis using rat GATA-4 cDNA probe was performed. The activation of GATA-4 binding was accompanied by a transient 1.6-fold increase in GATA-4 mRNA levels peaking at 4 h (Fig. 3F). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of GATA-4 protein were almost undetectable in the cytosolic fraction. In the nuclear extracts of stretched cardiomyocytes GATA-4 protein accumulation appeared to increase; however, this change was not statistically significant (Fig. 3G). Because previous studies suggest functional cooperation between GATA-4 and AP-1 in pressure overload-induced hypertrophy (20Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Google Scholar), we also studied nuclear protein binding on the AP-1 site by using ds oligonucleotide probe containing the rat BNP-373 AP-1 site (rBNP-373 AP-1). Stretch increased AP-1 binding activity, peaking at 1 h (2.5-fold increase) and sustaining for at least 24 h (Fig. 4A). Competition experiments demonstrated specificity of the complex formation, which was effectively inhibited by the unlabeled rBNP-373 AP-1 probe (self) (Fig. 4B), but not by the mutated BNP AP-1 site DNA. To identify the components of the AP-1 complex we performed supershift experiments using antibodies against different Fos and Jun family members. As shown in Fig. 4C, moderate supershifts were observed with JunD-specific antibody and unspecific antibody against Fos family proteins. Instead, when using c-Fos-specific antibody, no supershift complex was seen, suggesting the presence of either Fos B, Fos-related antigen-1 or -2 but not c-Fos in the complex. Weak antibody-induced supershifts were observed also with c-Jun- and JunB-sp"

We have proposed previously (Breazeale, S. D., Ribeiro, A. A., and Raetz, C. R. H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 2886–2896) a pathway for l-Ara4N biosynthesis that begins with the ArnA-catalyzed C-4″ oxidation and C-6″ decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid, followed by the C-4″ transamination of the product to generate the novel sugar nucleotide UDP-l-Ara4N. We now show that ArnB (PmrH) encodes the relevant aminotransferase. ArnB was overexpressed using a T7lac promoter-driven construct and shown to catalyze the reversible transfer of the amino group from glutamate to the acceptor, uridine 5′-(β-l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4″-ulose diphosphate), the intermediate that is synthesized by ArnA from UDP-glucuronic acid. A 1.7-mg sample of the putative UDP-l-Ara4N product generated in vitro was purified by ion exchange chromatography, and its structure was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. ArnB, which is a cytoplasmic protein, was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain of E. coli and shown to contain a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, as judged by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry. The pyridoxal phosphate was converted to the pyridoxamine form in the presence of excess glutamate. A simple quantitative radiochemical assay was developed for ArnB, which can be used to assay the enzyme either in the forward or the reverse direction. The enzyme is highly selective for glutamate as the amine donor, but the equilibrium constant in the direction of UDP-l-Ara4N formation is unfavorable (∼0.1). ArnB is a member of a very large family of aminotransferases, but closely related ArnB orthologs are present only in those bacteria capable of synthesizing lipid A species modified with the l-Ara4N moiety.

LPS consists of three domains, which are the O-specific antigen, the core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A moiety (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Google Scholar, 2Raetz C.R.H.

The latter provides a hydrophobic membrane anchor and is also the active component (or endotoxin) of LPS that is responsible for many of the pathophysiological effects associated with Gram-negative sepsis (1Raetz C.R.H.

Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Lipid A potently activates the innate immune system, inducing a host response that includes the production of cationic antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, clotting factors, and various immunostimulatory molecules (4Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar, 5Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 338-344Google Scholar, 6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit.

In severe infections, high levels of cytokines and pro-coagulant activity lead to Gram-negative septic shock, a syndrome characterized by increased vascular permeability, hypotension, multiple organ failure, and death (7Parillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Google Scholar). The Kdo-lipid A portion of LPS, which is relatively conserved among diverse Gram-negative bacteria, is sufficient to support the growth of Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium (2Raetz C.R.H.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Certain covalent modifications to Kdo-lipid A are induced by environmental stimuli, such as low magnesium ion concentrations and/or low pH, as would be encountered by bacteria in phagolysosomes of macrophages (9Guo L.

Addition of the l-Ara4N and pEtN moieties to the phosphate groups of lipid A confers resistance to polymyxin and various cationic antimicrobial peptides (15Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J.

Resistance is thought to occur by reduction of the net negative charge of lipid A, resulting in a reduced affinity for cationic peptides or polymyxin, thereby preventing these substances from penetrating the outer membrane. The l-Ara4N modification of lipid A is governed by the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system (10Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol.

Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7040-7045Google Scholar), which is switched on by low pH. The transcription factor PmrA activates genes at the pmrE(ugd) and pmrHFIJKLM loci (10Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Google Scholar, 22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). Constitutive mutants of pmrA (pmrAc) have been isolated in E. coli and S. typhimurium; these mutants modify their lipid A with l-Ara4N and pEtN groups under all growth conditions, and they are polymyxin-resistant (17Trent M.S.

However, inactivation of pmrE or of any of the genes in the pmrHFIJKL operon in a pmrAcS. typhimurium mutant results in loss of polymyxin resistance and loss of the l-Ara4N modification of lipid A (10Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of the various genes in the pmr loci have led us to propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of the l-Ara4N moiety and its attachment to lipid A (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). Our hypothesis (Fig. 2) is supported by the following observations. 1) ArnT (PmrK) is an inner membrane enzyme that utilizes the novel glycolipid undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N as the donor of the l-Ara4N moiety to modify lipid A (16Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Google Scholar, 17Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Google Scholar). 2) ArnA (PmrI) is a dehydrogenase/decarboxylase that converts UDP-glucuronic acid to a novel 4″-keto-pentose, designated UDP-Ara4O, which can be isolated in milligram quantities as the hydrated ketone (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). 3) Cell extracts of polymyxin-resistant (but not polymyxin-sensitive) E. coli cells convert UDP-Ara4O to the putative sugar nucleotide UDP-l-Ara4N in the presence of l-glutamate (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). 4) Cell extracts of polymyxin-resistant E. coli cells can further convert the proposed UDP-l-Ara4N to a putative formyl-amino derivative in the presence of N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). We have now cloned, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity the aminotransferase ArnB (PmrH). We demonstrate that ArnB (GenBank™ accession number AAM92146) contains a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and catalyzes the reversible transfer of the α-amine moiety from l-glutamate to the C-4″ position of UDP-Ara4O, generating UDP-l-Ara4N. The structure of UDP-l-Ara4N was validated by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The transamination is highly specific for glutamate as the amine donor. Our biochemical data establish ArnB as the key aminotransferase required for the biosynthesis of the l-Ara4N moiety present on lipid A molecules of polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Obvious ArnB orthologs are present in Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia, all of which are capable of modifying their lipid A with l-Ara4N (24Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 93-114Google Scholar). The purification of ArnB permits the enzymatic synthesis of milligram quantities of UDP-l-Ara4N, which can now be used to probe for the remaining steps in the transfer of l-Ara4N to lipid A. A crystal structure of ArnB (25Noland B.W. Newman J.M. Hendle J. Badger J. Christopher J.A. Tresser J. Buchanan M.D. Wright T.A. Rutter M.E. Sanderson W.E. Muller-Dieckmann H.J. Gajiwala K.S. Buchanan S.G. Structure. 2002; 10: 1569-1580Google Scholar), recently obtained as part of a structural genomics program, is in accord with our enzymatic and biochemical studies. Buffers, Reagents, and Materials—UDP-glucuronic acid, NAD+, 1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, l-glutamate, polymyxin B sulfate, kanamycin, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. The UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes (NdeI, NcoI, and XhoI) were obtained from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase, various oligonucleotides, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Invitrogen. The Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from Merck. DEAE-Sepharose™ CL-6B was obtained from Amersham Biosciences AB. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Strains and Recombinant DNA Techniques—Construction of WD101, a polymyxin-resistant mutant of E. coli W3110, was described previously (17Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Google Scholar). Preparation and transformation of competent cells by the CaCl2 method, genomic DNA purification, and gel electrophoresis of restriction fragments were performed according to published procedures (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar, 28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Restriction enzymes, Pfu DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were used as recommended by their manufacturers. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABIprism 377 instrument at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. Construction of pETArnB, pETArnB-C6H, and pETArnB-N6H—The predicted coding region for ArnB (GenBank™ accession number AAM92146) was amplified by PCR from E. coli W3110 genomic DNA with primers to the arnB 5′ end (5′-CGGGATCCATGGCGGAAGGAAAAGCAATG-3′) and to the arnB 3′ end (5′-CGGGATCCTCGAGTTATTGTCCTGCGAGTTGCTG-3′), containing engineered NcoI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The Opti-Prime™ PCR Optimization kit (Stratagene) was used as described by the manufacturer. The amplification reaction (50 μl) contained the following components: 5 μl of 10× Opti-Prime Buffer 9 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 250 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. After 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min) followed by 1 cycle (94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min), a single product of the predicted size was obtained. This was isolated with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), digested with XhoI and NcoI, and then ligated into the T7lac expression vector, pET28b (Novagen), previously digested with the same enzymes. The presence of the arnB gene (29Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Google Scholar) and appropriate flanking DNA was confirmed by sequencing of final construct, which was designated pETArnB. Amplification of DNA for cloning a modified arnB gene expressing a C-terminal hexa-histidine fusion protein of ArnB (designated ArnB-C6H) utilized the arnB 5′ primer described above for the native protein and the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATCCTCGAGTTGTCCTGCGAGTTGCTGAAG-3′ as the 3′ primer. The latter contained an engineered XhoI restriction site. The PCR (50 μl) contained the following: 5 μl of 10× Opti-Prime Buffer 11 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 35 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 250 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The same temperature parameters described above were used for the PCR. The resulting product was cloned into the expression vector pET28b, as described above, to generate pETArnB-C6H. The final construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Amplification of DNA for cloning a modified arnB gene encoding an N-terminal hexa-histidine fusion protein of ArnB (designated ArnB-N6H) was accomplished using the same reaction conditions as for pETArnB-C6H. The arnB 3′ primer described above for the native protein was used together with the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGATCCATATGGCGGAAGGAAAAGCAATG-3′ as the 5′ primer, which also contained an engineered NdeI restriction site. The PCR product was isolated with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), digested with XhoI and NdeI, and ligated into the pET28b expression vector, previously digested with the same enzymes, to generate pETArnB-N6H. The final construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overexpression of the arnB Gene Product and Purification of ArnB-N6H and ArnB-C6H—Plasmids pETArnB, pETArnB-N6H, or pETArnB-C6H were transformed into E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells (Novagen). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C from single colonies in LB broth (30Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was then used to inoculate a fresh 100-ml culture of the same broth at A600 ∼0.01. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.6. Expression of ArnB was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A, consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl. Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 pounds/square inch. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to give crude cell-free extracts. For the hexa-histidine fusion proteins, the crude cell-free extracts were loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), which was pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer A and 15 column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole; it was then eluted with 15 column volumes of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Proteins were concentrated, and the imidazole was removed by exchanging for buffer B (consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol) with the use of a Centricon® (YM-10) membrane, which was subjected to several cycles of low speed centrifugation and dilution in buffer B. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). The overexpression of ArnB, ArnB-N6H, and ArnB-C6H, as well as the initial purification of the hexa-histidine fusion proteins, was monitored by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel and 8% resolving gel), followed by Coomassie Blue staining (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Enzymatic Synthesis and Isolation of UDP-l-Ara4N—A 10-ml reaction mixture, containing 0.05 mg/ml pure ArnB-N6H, 1 mm UDP-Ara4O, and 10 mml-glutamate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, was incubated at 30 °C for 5.5 h. Protein was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a Centricon® (YM-10) membrane. The enzymatic product was then loaded onto a 10-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose™ CL-6B, pre-equilibrated with 10 mm BisTris, pH 5.9. The column was washed with 50 ml of deionized water, followed by elution of the product with a 0–100 mm BisTris, pH 5.9, gradient (200-ml total volume). Chromatography was monitored by absorbance of the effluent at 254 nm. Fractions (12 ml) containing the desired product, which eluted at about 30 mm BisTris, were pooled and diluted 10-fold with H2O. The diluted material was then loaded onto a 10-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose™ CL-6B, pre-equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The column was washed with 50 ml of deionized water, followed by elution of the product with a 0–100 mm gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (200-ml total volume). Chromatography was again monitored by absorbance at 254 nm. Fractions containing the product (which eluted at about 60 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate) were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization to give the triethylammonium salt of the sugar nucleotide. Conversion to the sodium salt was accomplished by passage over a 1-ml column of AG®50W-X8 resin (sodium form), followed by lyophilization to give the pure compound (1.7 mg, 31% yield). Enzymatic Synthesis and Purification of UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N—Conversion of UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (380 mCi/mmol) to UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N was performed in 400-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm NAD+, 1 mml-glutamate, 0.05 mg/ml ArnA overproducing cell-free extract (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar), 0.05 mg/ml pure ArnB-C6H, and 13 μm UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (2 μCi), previously dried under nitrogen and re-dissolved in a small volume of deionized water. The reaction proceeded for 220 min at 30 °C and was then diluted to 1.5 ml with deionized water before loading onto a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose™ CL-6B, pre-equilibrated with 10 mm BisTris, pH 6. The column was washed with 5 ml of deionized water, followed by elution of the nucleotides with a 0–100 mm gradient of BisTris, pH 6 (40-ml total volume). Fractions containing UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N were pooled, diluted 10-fold with deionized water, and loaded onto a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose™ CL-6B, pre-equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The column was washed with 5 ml of deionized water. The NAD+ was resolved from the desired sugar nucleotide with a 0–100 mm gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (40-ml total volume). The radioactive fractions were concentrated using a Speed-Vac centrifuge and dissolved in 250 μl of deionized water. The yield of UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N was 74% based on the input radioactivity. The product was stored frozen at –20 °C. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—The sodium salt of the putative UDP-l-Ara4N (1.7 mg prepared as described above) was dissolved in 0.6 ml of 99% D2O and placed into a 5 mm NMR tube. Measurements with a 3-mm pH electrode revealed a pD value of 8.00. Proton and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced relative to 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid at 0.00 ppm. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Inova 800 spectrometer equipped with a Sun Ultra 10 computer and a 5-mm Varian triple resonance probe. 1H spectra were obtained with a spectral width of 8.0 kHz, a 76° pulse flip angle (7 μs), a 4.0-s acquisition time, and a 1.5-s relaxation delay, and were digitized using 96,000 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.16 Hz/point. Two-dimensional NMR experiments were performed as described previously (17Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Google Scholar, 22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar, 32Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Res. Chem. 1999; 37: 620-630Google Scholar). ArnB Enzymatic Assays—The rate of formation of UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N by ArnB was quantified using a coupled assay in which overexpressed ArnA was first used to generate UDP-[U-14C]Ara4O in situ from UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid. The UDP-[U-14C]Ara4O is relatively unstable at the low chemical concentrations needed for radioactive assays. Briefly, the initial ArnA reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 90 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm NAD+, and 300 μm UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (0.02 μCi), and 0.1 mg/ml ArnA overproducing cell-free extract from E. coli NovaBlue(DE3)/pETArnA (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). Complete conversion of UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid to UDP-[U-14C]Ara4O was achieved after 120 min at 30 °C. To assay for UDP-l-[U-14C]Ara4N synthesis, the amine donor (usually glutamate) and ArnB were added to bring the final volume to 20 μl; this was set up to yield final concentrations of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 μm UDP-[U-14C]Ara4O (unless otherwise indicated), and 7.5 mm amine donor. Reactions were incubated further at 30 °C. At the desired time points, a 1-μl portion was withdrawn and spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate. The spots were allowed to dry, and the plate was washed in methanol for 5 min. After drying, the plate was developed using 0.4 m LiCl in 0.25 m aqueous acetic acid. The plate was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Remaining substrate and radioactive product were quantified with a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software, Amersham Biosciences). ArnB specific enzymatic activity was calculated in units of nmol/min/mg. Ultraviolet-visible Spectroscopy of ArnB—Purified ArnB-C6H (25 μm)in50mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol was incubated at 30 °C alone or in the presence of 1 mml-glutamate in a total volume of 100 μl. Spectra were recorded on a BeckmanCoulter DU® 640B UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer. Experimental data were exported into Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and plotted. The reactions were blanked against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing the buffer alone (10% glycerol in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of ArnB as a Hexa-histidine-tagged Fusion Protein—The l-Ara4N moiety found on the phosphate groups of lipid A in polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (like pmrA constitutive strains of E. coli or S. typhimurium) is proposed to arise via the novel sugar nucleotide, UDP-l-Ara4N (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). The transamination of the precursor UDP-Ara4O (Fig. 2), a nucleotide synthesized in polymyxin-resistant (but not polymyxin-sensitive) E. coli (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar), could generate UDP-l-Ara4N (Fig. 2). We have shown previously that the E. coli gene arnA encodes a protein that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-GlcUA to give UDP-Ara4O (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the presence of l-glutamate, cell extracts of polymyxin-resistant E. coli can convert UDP-Ara4O to a species with the RF expected for such an amino-sugar nucleotide at the rate of ∼2 nmol/min/mg (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Google Scholar). These preliminary data are consistent with the involvement of a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that utilizes l-glutamate as the amine donor for converting UDP-Ara4O to UDP-l-Ara4N. Upstream of arnA resides arnB (pmrH), another gene required for polymyxin resistance in S. typhimurium (10Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Google Scholar), which is predicted to encode an aminotransferase (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

In addition, it serves as a scaffold for the subcellular targeting of different signaling molecules. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been found associated with filamin; however, details about this interaction and its significance for cell-matrix adhesion-dependent signaling have remained elusive. We performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis using protein kinase Cα as a bait and identified filamin as a direct binding partner. The interaction was confirmed in transfected HeLa cells, and serial truncation fragments of filamin A were employed to identify two binding sites on filamin. In vitro ligand binding assays revealed a Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent association of the regulatory domain of protein kinase C with these sites. Phosphorylation of filamin was found to be isoform-restricted, leading to phosphate incorporation in the C termini of filamin A and C, but not B. PKC-dependent phosphorylation of filamin was also detected in cells. Our data suggest an intimate interaction between filamin and PKC in cell signaling.

PKC isotypes are categorized on the basis of their responsiveness to allosteric activators. Conventional PKC isotypes are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters, binding the C1-fold, and phosphatidylserine (PS) and Ca2+, binding the C2-fold, of their regulatory domain. Novel PKC isotypes do not bind Ca2+, while atypical PKC isotypes are responsive to phospholipids and fatty acids, but do not bind Ca2+, DAG, or phorbol esters (reviewed in Ref. 1Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar). Activation is achieved by translocation of PKC to cellular membranes combined with allosteric changes. Further mechanisms of activity regulation involve phosphorylation of PKC (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Google Scholar) and binding to protein ligands (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). The latter includes binding of substrates and of scaffold proteins that enable PKC to phosphorylate a range of spatially confined substrates (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). All three processes, translocation, phosphorylation, and specificity of ligand binding contribute to the temporal and spatial restriction of PKC activity as has been observed in cells (4Haller H. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Google Scholar, 5Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Google Scholar).PKC isotypes participate in the intracellular signal transduction that regulates cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (6Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). Furthermore, they have been implicated in the organization of the microfilament system, cell adhesion, and cell migration (reviewed in Refs. 7Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Google Scholar and 8Clark E. Brugge D.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). The regulatory role of PKC is based on different mechanisms: PKC directly interacts with transmembrane receptors like β1-integrins (9Parsons M. Keppler M.D. Kline A. Messent A. Humphries M.J. Gilchrist R. Hart I.R. Quittau-Prevostel C. Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Ng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5897-5911Google Scholar), and integrin co-receptors, syndecan 4 (10Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3415-3420Google Scholar) and tetraspanins (11Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Google Scholar). In addition, co-localization of some PKC isotypes with cytosolic components of the microfilament system was observed (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar, 12Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Google Scholar), and a number of actin-binding and modulating proteins, e.g. adducin (13Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Google Scholar), vinculin (14Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Google Scholar), talin (15Turner C.E. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11938-11944Google Scholar), ezrin (16Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Google Scholar), and moesin (17Pietromonaco S.F. Simons P.C. Altman A. Elias L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7594-7603Google Scholar) were identified as PKC substrates in vitro and some also in vivo. These proteins are characterized by their capacity to bind to acidic phospholipids and belong to a group of PKC ligands termed “substrates that interact with protein kinase C” (STICKS) (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). STICKS bind to the PKC regulatory domain in a lipid-dependent fashion and are thus responsible for localizing the kinase to discrete membrane regions (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). Consequences of PKC docking and mutual dependence of phosphorylation, lipid and actin binding have been elucidated for some STICKS, e.g. ezrin (16Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Google Scholar, 18Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Google Scholar) and adducin (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar, 13Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Google Scholar) but not all of them. In particular, our knowledge of the regulation of major microfilament adhesion proteins, like vinculin, talin, and filamin, by PKC is incomplete (19Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Google Scholar, 20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar).Filamins (FLN, previously also named actin-binding protein or ABP) form a family of large actin-binding proteins that share the ability to stabilize three-dimensional networks of actin filaments and link them to cellular membranes (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). This function is provided by the molecular leaf spring structure of filamin dimers. Individual subunits are composed of long rod domains of repetitive β-sheet motifs that connect an N-terminal actin-binding domain to a C-terminal dimerization domain. One to two short hinge regions interrupt the rod domains and allow filamins to cross-link actin filaments in almost any orientation. Membrane association of filamins is achieved by direct binding of the C-terminal β-sheet repeats to transmembrane proteins like von Willebrand factor receptor (21Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2914-2919Google Scholar) or β-integrins (22Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Google Scholar). Interaction with integrins or integrin co-receptors localizes filamin to cell-matrix adhesion sites (focal adhesions) (23Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Google Scholar, 24Nikki M. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11432-11440Google Scholar).There are three human isoforms of filamin: FLNa, FLNb, and FLNc with an overall sequence homology of 60–80% (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). Isoform-specific functions are assumed, but so far demonstrated only in a few cases. For example, the cell line M2 that is derived from a human carcinoma and is deficient in FLNa but not in FLNb, shows defects in membrane stability and migration. Upon reintroduction of FLNa both these functions are restored (25Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Google Scholar). Tissue-specific splicing is a source of further diversity in filamins. A splice variant of FLNa and FLNb with altered binding affinity for β-integrins was isolated from human skeletal muscle and keratinocyte cDNA libraries. Further variants were observed during in vitro differentiation of mouse C2C12 myoblasts (26van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Google Scholar).Filamins are proposed to integrate cell mechanics and signaling (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). To this end, they not only interact with peripheral actin networks, but bind to a variety of other ligand proteins mainly through their C-terminal β-sheet repeats (reviewed in Ref. 20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). These interactions probably influence filamin function in both cell mechanics and cellular signaling. While details of the consequences for many of these ligand interactions remain to be elucidated, two examples may illustrate the potential of filamin as a scaffold for signaling events. First, interactions with Rho family GTPases (27Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Google Scholar) and some of their regulatory cofactors (28Bellanger J.M. Astier C. Sardet C. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Debant A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 888-892Google Scholar) are proposed to assemble a complex on FLNa that regulates the activity of bound GTPases, allowing filamin to participate in dynamics and spatial positioning of actin assembly (28Bellanger J.M. Astier C. Sardet C. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Debant A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 888-892Google Scholar). Second, FLNa transduces stress signals to the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian fibroblasts. This can be concluded from the observation that in cells subjected to shear stress, filamin is recruited to β1-integrin-containing focal adhesions. As a consequence, the stressed cells stiffen and thus are more resistant to subsequent physical strain. Cells lacking FLNa do not show such a “stiffening response” (29Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Google Scholar).While a general role for filamin in signaling events is well established, various signaling steps are believed in turn to regulate filamin function. Binding to phospholipids (30Goldmann W.H. Teodoridis J.M. Sharma C.P. Hu B. Isenberg G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 108-112Google Scholar), phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases (31Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11858-11864Google Scholar), and proteolytic cleavage (32Chen M. Stracher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14282-14289Google Scholar) seem involved. Evidence from in vitro assays indicates that phospholipids inhibit actin organization by turkey gizzard filamin (33Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Hatano S. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1261-1265Google Scholar) and phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II decreases its actin binding affinity (34Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6745-6754Google Scholar). Resistance of FLNa to calpain cleavage is increased after phosphorylation of FLNa through protein kinase A (PKA) (32Chen M. Stracher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14282-14289Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these observations, however, is not established.Here we characterize the interaction of PKCα with filamin in detail. FLNa was identified as a PKC ligand in yeast two-hybrid analyses and in immunoprecipitates obtained from HeLa cells. PKC binding depends on acidic phospholipids and involves two discrete binding sites on FLNa. Stimulation of PKC activity in cells results in FLNa phosphorylation. These data support the concept of a PKC-regulated control of FLNa activity during microfilament (re)organization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Mutagenesis—Constructs used in this study were amplified according to standard PCR protocols, cloned in pCR-blunt (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and verified by DNA sequencing. Bovine PKCα cDNA (a gift of Dr. Peter J. Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) was equipped with an N-terminal birch-profilin epitope tag (35Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). An ATP binding-deficient mutant of PKCα (K368M, Ref. 36Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Google Scholar) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pGBK T7 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). PKCα fragments encoding the regulatory domain (amino acids 1–918), the regulatory domain plus V3 region (amino acids 1–1062), the catalytic domain (amino acids 1062–2069), and the V3 region plus catalytic domain (amino acids 918–2069) were amplified using the bovine PKCα (wild-type) cDNA as template, cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and equipped with an N-terminal BiPro tag. The filamin fragment identified and positively tested in yeast twohybrid assays were equipped with an N-terminal FLAG tag and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The filamin fragments described in Figs. 3 and 4 were generated by PCR using a human FLNa cDNA (a gift of Drs. Yasutaka Ohta and Thomas P. Stossel, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston) as template, cloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and equipped with an N-terminal FLAG tag. FLNb and FLNc fragments, encoding the C-terminal region (repeats 23 to 24), in pET-vector (Invitrogen) (a gift of Dr. Dieter O. Fuerst, University of Potsdam) were equipped with an N-terminal FLAG tag.Fig. 4PKCα regulatory domain binding to FLNa is phospholipid-dependent.A, domain structure of full-length (fl) PKCα comprising a lipid- and Ca2+-binding regulatory domain (rd), an interconnecting hinge region (V3), and a Ser/Thr kinase domain (kd). B, the binding of radiolabeled PKCα in vitro translates to filamin (10 pmol), purified from turkey gizzard (38Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Google Scholar), is strongly enhanced by acidic phospholipids, PIP2, and PS. C, PKCα domain binding to filamin constructs FLNa-[N1–4] and FLNa-[22–24C] (10 pmol each) was tested in the presence or absence (±) of Ca2+ ions and phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS/PIP2 = 9:9:2) and compared with binding to either serum albumin (BSA, 10 pmol) as a negative control or to vinculin tail (Vt, 10 pmol), a binding partner of PKCα regulatory domain (44Ziegler W.H. Tigges U. Zieseniss A. Jockusch B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7396-7404Google Scholar). FLNa constructs, BSA and vinculin tail were incubated with phospholipid vesicles 30 min prior to immobilization on nitrocellulose membrane. Note that PKCα (rd, rd+V3, or fl) binding to FLNa constructs requires Ca2+ and phospholipids as cofactors. PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. D, relative binding affinities expressed as PKCα domain protein (means ± S.E., n = 4) bound to FLNa-[N1–4] (black bars) or FLNa-[22–24C] (dark gray bars). Means were calculated from phosphorimaging data of overlays that were performed in the presence of both cofactors. Controls included vinculin tail (Vt, light gray bars) and BSA (white bars). Enhanced binding of PKCα to the FLNa C terminus was confirmed by variance analysis (*, p < 0,05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Yeast Two-hybrid—An ATP binding-deficient PKCα mutant in the bait vector pGBK T7 was used to screen a mouse embryo (day 17.5) in pGAD T7 (BD Biosciences) and a mouse heart cDNA library in pACT (BD Biosciences). The bait plasmid and cDNA library were co-transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c and plated on medium deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Colonies that grew under these selective conditions were also tested for β-galactosidase activity by filter-lift assay following standard protocols (BD Biosciences). To exclude false positives, constructs in question were re-introduced into yeast together with either the PKCα mutant bait vector, the pGBK T7 original vector or pLAM5′, a vector encoding a human lamin cDNA in the two-hybrid DNA-binding domain vector (BD Biosciences), and assayed for β-galactosidase activity.Co-immunoprecipitation—Expression vectors for BiPro-epitope tagged PKCα and FLAG epitope-tagged filamin delta1 and delta2 were co-transfected transiently into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After 16 h cells were treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) essentially as described in Huttelmaier et al. (37Huttelmaier S. Bubeck P. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1136-1142Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with DSP for 30 min. Excess cross-linker was quenched in 0.2 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). Following adsorption to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with BiPro tag antibody (35Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar) or FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Bound protein complexes were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or PKCα antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL-Plus reagent (Roche Applied Science).Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant FLNa proteins bearing an N-terminal His tag and a FLAG tag in tandem were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain M15. FLNb and FLNc proteins bearing a C-terminal His tag and an N-terminal FLAG tag were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21. Batch purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purity of all proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots using a FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by standard methods. Turkey gizzard FLN was purified according to Feramisco and Burridge (38Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Google Scholar) using a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) instead of a DEAE column.In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Dot Overlay Assay—PKCα full-length and PKCα fragments were synthesized as [35S]methionine-labeled protein by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Phospholipids were prepared as described in Huttelmaier et al. (39Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Google Scholar). Turkey gizzard FLN was incubated without or with a 5-fold molar excess of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylserine and recombinant FLNa fragments were incubated without or with a 5-fold molar excess of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate = 9:9:2) for 30 min at 4 °C and immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane (5–20 pmol of protein/spot) using a dot blotter with circular slots (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The transfer was controlled by Ponceau staining and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 14.8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). In vitro-translated proteins were diluted (1:80–1:160) in TBST without or with 100 μm CaCl2. Membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in TBST, bound proteins were detected by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS-2500) using Aida 2.1 (Advanced Isotope Data Analyser) analysis software (Fuji; Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Means of bound protein, corrected for [35S]methionine labeling of PKCα (rd (8 met), V3 (0 met), kd (12 met)) from four independent experiments were compared by variance analysis (Scheffe, p < 0.05) using Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).Labeling of Cells with [32P]orthophosphate and Immunoprecipitation—An expression vector equipped with a FLAG epitope-tagged FLNa fragment (repeats 22–24) was transfected transiently into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfected and untransfected HeLa cells were grown to confluence in 3.5-cm diameter culture dishes containing 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent monolayers of cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h. Quiescent cells were labeled for 16 h in 0.8 ml of phosphate and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml). 32P-labeled cells were either treated with 0.1 μm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) with 0.1 μm TPA and 0.1 μm bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) or were left untreated. Cells were incubated with BIM for 20 min at 37 °C, then TPA was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min. After the activation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2) and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Precleared lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either filamin antibody (this antibody against swine filamin was generated according to standard protocols) or FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) following adsorption to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transformed onto nitrocellulose membrane. The relative intensity of 32P incorporation was determined by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS-2500). The protein load was determined by Western blotting using enhanced chemiluminescence and densitometry of films (EasyWin32; Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany). Means of relative phosphate incorporation from four to six independent experiments were compared by variance analysis (Scheffe, p < 0.01) using Statview 5.0.In Vitro Phosphorylation of FLN Isoforms—Purified FLN proteins were phosphorylated using either PKCα or PKA. PKCα phosphorylation was analyzed in a mixed micelle assay essentially as described by Marais and Parker (40Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 129-137Google Scholar). The assays were carried out using 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), 0.63 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany), and 120 μm phosphatidylserine (Sigma) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100). The PKA assays were carried out using 0.1 mm ATP, 0,1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In both assays 50 pmol of FLN protein were used per reaction in a total volume of 25 μl. Phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of either 30 ng of recombinant PKCα (Panvera, Madison, WI) or 200 ng of catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega) and carried out at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped after 90 min by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Radiolabeled FLN protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and phosphate incorporation was quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS-2500).RESULTSFilamin, a PKC Ligand at the Cytoskeleton—To identify PKC interaction partners we performed yeast two-hybrid screens analyzing cDNA libraries from mouse embryo (day 17.5) and mouse heart (both from BD Biosciences), with a mutant of PKCα (K368M, Ref. 36Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Google Scholar) deficient in the ATP-binding site as a bait. The inactive mutant of the kinase was employed to stabilize more transient interactions. Among six positive clones, we identified a LIM domain, a protein fold known to interact with PKC (41Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31029-31032Google Scholar) and two filamin fragments. These fragments consisted of β-sheet units located near the N-terminal F-actin binding site of filamin, FLN delta1 (repeats 4–10), and at the C-terminal dimerization site, FLN delta2 (repeats 23–24). Fig. 1 shows size and position of both fragments within the domain structure of filamin. The fragments originated from the FLN isoform that is predominant in the respective cDNA library, namely, FLNa for whole animal/embryo and FLNc for muscle tissue. Within these fragments amino acid identity between isoforms is 75% (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar).Fig. 1Filamin interacts with PKCα Two different yeast two-hybrid libraries were screened, using an ATP binding-deficient mutant of PKCα as a bait. A, graphic view of the filamin A (FLNa) leaf spring-structure adapted from Ref. 20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar. 2 CH, two calponin homology domains. B, two FLN fragments identified in the screens are shown: FLN delta1 from murine filamin A (mmFLNa) and FLN delta2 from murine γ filamin (mmFLNc). Specificity of protein-protein interactions observed in the yeast two-hybrid system was confirmed using GBD-lamin and empty pGBK T7 vector as negative controls (table). GAD, GAL4-activating domain; GBP, GAL4 DNA binding domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction of FLN Fragments with PKC in Mammalian Cells—Association of PKCα with FLN was confirmed in transfected HeLa cells that were maintained in culture medium containing 10% serum. Standard culture conditions result in a basal activation of PKC, which is thought to involve transient membrane localization of the kinase and interaction with different protein ligands (42Parekh D.B. Katso R.M. Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Procyk K.J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 425-433Google Scholar). FLN fragments were equipped with a FLAG tag (35Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar) and subcloned in expression vectors (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) to test their interaction with PKCα, after co-transfection in HeLa cells. A membrane permeant cross-linker was applied prior to lysis of cells to stabilize PKC-ligand interactions. Co-precipitation of PKC and filamin fragments FLN delta1 and FLN delta2 was obtained in both directions, as shown in Fig. 2 (A–C). PKC is a low abundance signaling protein that is not tolerated in cells at levels comparable to that of the highly expressed microfilament proteins (see Ref. 43Garcia-Paramio P. Cabrerizo Y.

Western blot analysis of total membranes of Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing FLAG-tagged NCC revealed the presence of both complex-(140-kDa) and core (100-kDa)-glycosylated monomers and a broad band of high molecular mass (250–350-kDa) complexes. Chemical cross-linking with dithiobispropionimidate eliminated the low molecular weight bands and increased the intensity of the high molecular weight bands, indicating that NCC is present in multimeric complexes. Co-expression of HA- and FLAG-tagged NCC followed by co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these multimers contained at least two complex-glycosylated NCC proteins. The dimeric nature of the multimers was further substantiated by sucrose gradient centrifugation yielding a peak of ∼310 kDa. A concatameric construct of two NCC polyproteins exhibited significant 22Na+ uptake, indicating that the transporter is functional as a homodimer. A concatamer of partially retarded G980R- and wild type (wt)-NCC displayed normal Na+ transport. This demonstrates that G980R-NCC, provided that it reaches the surface, is fully active and that wt-NCC is dominant in its association with this mutant. Conversely a concatamer of fully retarded G741R- and wt-NCC did not reach the cell surface, showing that wt-NCC is recessive in its association with this mutant. Oocytes co-expressing G741R- and wt-NCC did not show G741R staining at the plasma membrane, whereas Na+ transport was normal, indicating that wt-NCC dimerizes preferentially with itself. The results are discussed in relation to the recessive nature of NCC mutants in Gitelman syndrome.

The thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl– cotransporter (NCC) 1The abbreviations used are: NCC, Na+Cl– cotransporter; HA, hemagglutinin; KCC, K+Cl– cotransporter; NKCC, Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter; GS, Gitelman syndrome; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTBP, dimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; AQP2, aquaporin-2. is mainly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. The protein is located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining this part of the renal tubule and is responsible for the reabsorption of ∼5% of the filtered NaCl load. NCC represents the main target of the diuretic thiazide that is frequently administered to patients suffering from hypertension (1Ellison D.H. Velazquez H. Wright F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F546-F554Google Scholar). The cotransporter belongs to a gene family called the electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters, encompassing the NCC (2Gamba G. Saltzberg S.N. Lombardi M. Miyanoshita A. Lytton J. Hediger M.A. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2749-2753Google Scholar, 3Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D.

Genet. 1996; 12: 24-30Google Scholar), two Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporters (NKCC1 and NKCC2) (4Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16355-16362Google Scholar). Genes encoding these transmembrane proteins are highly homologous and share a common predicted membrane topology of 12 transmembrane domains with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (11Mount D.B. Delpire E. Gamba G. Hall A.E. Poch E. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2091-2102Google Scholar). Several studies indicated that members of the electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporter family could form oligomeric structures. Truncation studies performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that both N and C termini are required for KCl cotransport activity of the KCC1. Truncation of the first 117 amino acids of the N terminus of this cotransporter was shown to result in a dominant negative phenotype following co-injection with wild type KCC1 (12Casula S. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Su W. Chernova M.N. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41870-41878Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that truncated and wild type KCC1 formed multimers (12Casula S. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Su W. Chernova M.N. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41870-41878Google Scholar). In addition to KCC, NKCC1 was also suggested to exhibit a homodimeric structure. This conclusion was based on cross-linking experiments using plasma membranes isolated from rat parotid gland (13Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Google Scholar). Using the same approach, NCC was suggested to form high molecular weight complexes in rat renal membranes (14McKee J.A. Kumar S. Ecelbarger C.A. Fernandez-Llama P. Terris J. Knepper M.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2128-2132Google Scholar). However, the exact structural composition of these complexes was not determined. Mutations in NCC have been implicated in the autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder Gitelman syndrome (GS, OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) 263800). The syndrome is characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria (15Gitelman H.J. Graham J.B. Welt L.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 162: 856-864Google Scholar). In a previous study using X. laevis oocytes to assess the functional implications of mutations associated with this disorder, we identified two classes of GS mutants (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). Class I mutants exhibited no significant metolazone-sensitive 22Na+ uptake and a diffuse immunopositive staining just below the plasma membrane. Class II mutants showed a marked metolazone-sensitive 22Na+ uptake, which was, however, significantly lower than that obtained with the wild type transporter. Accordingly these mutants were detected both at and below the plasma membrane. Mutant NCCs were expressed in the absence of wild type NCC. Thus far, however, it is unknown whether mutant forms of NCC can interact with wild type NCC and, if so, whether such complexes are directed to the plasma membrane and what their transport activity will be. In this study, we analyzed representatives of class I (G741R) and class II (G980R) in more detail. In about 40% of the GS patients only one affected allele was detected, which is not consistent with the recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder (3Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 24-30Google Scholar, 17Mastroianni N. De Fusco M. Zollo M.

Goodyer P.R. Carel J.C. Hermes A. Seyberth H.W. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 720-730Google Scholar). There are several explanations for this finding (18Lemmink H.H. Knoers N.V. Karolyi L. van Dijk H. Niaudet P. Antignac C. Guay-Woodford L.M. Goodyer P.R. Carel J.C. Hermes A. Seyberth H.W. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 720-730Google Scholar). First, in the mutation detection strategy applied, PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism, it is known that mutations can be missed. Second, mutations may be present in non-coding regions such as promoter or enhancer segments, intron sequences, or 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions, which have not yet been screened. Third, detection analysis based on individual exons will not identify large heterozygous deletions. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these patients do express the normal protein, which is then, however, inactivated in one way or another by the mutant protein. The aim of this study was to establish the structural composition of the functional NCC and to investigate whether mutant and wild type NCCs can form (in)active complexes. Expression and Transcription Constructs—The generation of the expression constructs pT7Ts-Flag-NCC, pT7Ts-Flag-G741R, and pT7Ts-Flag-G980R has been described in detail previously (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, DNA encoding the HA epitope was cloned at the 5′ site of wild type cDNA. The pT7Ts-HA-NCC construct was generated as described previously (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). In brief, HA tagged-NCC fragments were amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a PCR using pT7Ts-NCC as a template. The primers were 5′-cgcggatcccaggcgacaatggcatacccatacgacgtgccagactacgcagaactgcccacaacagagacg-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ctcctggagcaggtcccg-3′ (reverse primer). The constructs were linearized with EcoRI, and g-capped cRNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. Copy RNA was purified and dissolved in RNase-free water. Integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. Isolation and Injection of Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were isolated from X. laevis and defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase A for 2 h at room temperature. Stage V and VI oocytes were resuspended in modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, and 0.4 mm CaCl2 supplemented with 45 μg/ml gentamycin and stored at 18 °C until use. Oocytes were (co-)injected with 2.5, 5, or 10 ng of cRNA of wild type NCC (HA-wt or Flag-wt) and 10 ng of cRNA of mutant NCC (Flag-G741R or Flag-G980R) and analyzed 2 days after injection. Isolation of Total Membranes—For isolation of total membranes (plasma and subcellular membranes), 50 oocytes were homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A and centrifuged two times for 10 min at 3000 × g and 4 °C to remove yolk proteins. Subsequently membranes were isolated by a 30-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. Cross-linking of Proteins—Membranes of 15 oocytes were dissolved in 50 μl of solubilization buffer (SB) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5μg/ml pepstatin A for 1 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove undissolved membranes. Membrane samples were treated with the cross-linking agent dimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP) (2 mm) for 30 min at room temperature following the manufacturer's protocol. Next samples were incubated in Laemmli buffer in the absence or presence (to break cross-links) of 10% (w/v) dithiothreitol and subjected to immunoblotting. DTBP covalently links proteins at distances comparable to its spacer arm length (11.9 Å), thereby yielding higher molecular weight complex. Immunoprecipitation—Membranes of 15 oocytes co-expressing Flag-wt and HA-wt, Flag-G741R, or Flag-G980R were dissolved in 50 μl of SB for 1 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove undissolved membranes as described previously (19Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F778-F784Google Scholar). 20 μleqof protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) were preincubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of mouse anti-HA (Sigma) in IPP500 containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The solubilized membranes were diluted with 600 μl of sucrose buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Next antibody-bound protein A beads were washed three times with IPP100 containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A and incubated with solubilized membranes for 4–16 h at 4 °C. After three washes with IPP100, the beads were dissolved in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and subjected to immunoblotting. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Membranes of oocytes expressing Flag-wt were dissolved in SB for 1 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for1hat4 °C to remove undissolved membranes. Solutions were prepared of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35% (w/v) sucrose in 533 μl of gradient buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Samples (300 μl) of total membrane proteins in SB were loaded on the gradient followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 16 h at 8 °C. Then 200-μl fractions, designated A–R, were carefully collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Sedimentation markers were yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa) (Sigma). Expression of Concatameric cDNA Constructs—Concatameric constructs were obtained by linking the coding sequences of two NCC subunits in a head-to-tail fashion. To this end, two different NCC constructs were generated. The first construct was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis to remove the stop codon of the Flag-wt construct and introducing a unique EcoRV restriction site (Stratagene). The second construct was obtained by inserting a linker of 8 glutamines (20Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Google Scholar), acting as an intersubunit bridge, in front of the 5′ ATG of pT7Ts-NCC. In brief, the N-terminal linker-NCC fragment containing a 5′ BamHI and EcoRV restriction site was amplified with Pfu polymerase in a PCR using pT7Ts-NCC as a template followed by cloning into pT7Ts-NCC, pT7Ts-Flag-G741R or pT7Ts-Flag-G980R. Primers used were 5′-tggactagtcagatatctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctggcagtaaaaggtgagcacgtt-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ctcctggagcaggtcccg-3′ (reverse primer). Concatameric constructs were obtained by digestion of the second construct with EcoRV and SpeI and insertion of the product into the first construct digested with the same enzymes. All cDNA constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Constructs were linearized with EcoRI to produce cRNA. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 25 mm dithiothreitol, subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to standard procedures. Blots were incubated with either mouse anti-FLAG or mouse anti-HA (both from Sigma) at dilutions of 1:8000 and 1:4000 in TBS-T containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) or 1% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, respectively. Subsequently blots were incubated with sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000. In the case of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the immunoblots were probed with peroxidase-coupled anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:5000. NCC proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). 22Na+Uptake Assay—Oocytes were transferred to a Cl–-free medium containing 5 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 96 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mg/dl gentamycin 24 h prior to the uptake assay (2Gamba G. Saltzberg S.N. Lombardi M. Miyanoshita A. Lytton J. Hediger M.A. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2749-2753Google Scholar). Fifteen to 20 Cl–-depleted oocytes were transferred to 500 μl of uptake medium containing 5 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.5), 58 mmN-methyl-d-glucosamine HCl, 38 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ouabain, 100 μm amiloride, 100 μm bumetanide, and 1 μCi/ml 22Na+ and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the absence or presence of 100 μm hydrochlorothiazide. Ouabain was added to prevent Na+ exit via the Na+-K+-ATPase, bumetanide was added to inhibit the Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter, and amiloride was added to block the Na+-H+ antiporter and Na+ channels. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to inhibit NCC. After 120 min, the uptake reaction was stopped by washing the oocytes five times in ice-cold uptake medium. Each oocyte was solubilized in 200 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS, and radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Interaction between Subunits of NCC—First we investigated whether NCC proteins can form oligomeric structures. Fig. 1 shows an immunoblot loaded with total oocytes membranes treated with the chemical cross-linking agent DTBP. Importantly the complex-(140-kDa) and core (100-kDa)-glycosylated NCC monomers disappeared as a result of the treatment with DTBP, whereas the intensity of a broad band of high molecular mass complexes (250–350 kDa) increased (compare lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that the high molecular weight complexes observed in the absence of DTBP (lane 1) represent NCC multimers. Cross-linking with DTBP is reversible with dithiothreitol, and Fig. 1 shows that addition of this latter agent indeed resulted in reappearance of the NCC monomer (lane 3). The conclusion that NCC forms multimers was substantiated in an immunoprecipitation experiment using oocytes co-expressing HA- and Flag-NCC. The specificity of the applied antibodies is demonstrated in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B (lane 3) shows that Flag-NCC readily co-immunoprecipitated with HA-coupled beads. The molecular mass of the observed band is 130–150 kDa, which is in agreement with its complex glycosylation (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar, 21Hoover R.S. Poch E. Monroy A. Vazquez N. Nishio T. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 271-282Google Scholar). Lane 2 shows that no signal is obtained in the absence of HA-NCC. Previously we showed that Flag-NCC is fully functional in the oocyte expression system (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). The functionality of HA-NCC was confirmed in a 22Na+ uptake experiment in this study (data not shown).Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of NCC subunits. cRNA of HA- and/or Flag-NCC was (co-)injected in oocytes, and total membrane lysate was used for immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblot analysis. A, both HA- and Flag-NCC were expressed, and the applied antibodies did not cross-react. B, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using beads to which anti-HA antibody was bound. The immunoblot was probed with the anti-FLAG antibody. Lane 3 shows a specific band of ∼140 kDa indicating that Flag-NCC and HA-NCC form complexes. ni, non-injected oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NCC Forms Homodimers—Because the above-mentioned experiments suggested that NCC forms oligomeric structures, we subsequently estimated the size of the complexes. To this end, membranes were isolated from oocytes expressing Flag-NCC, solubilized in 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. Analysis of the immunoblot of 18 fractions (A–R) collected from the gradient revealed that the peak intensity of NCC was present in fraction J (Fig. 3A). The sedimentation marker proteins (i.e. phosphorylase B, alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase, and apoferritin) that were loaded on a parallel sucrose gradient peaked in fractions F, H, I, and K-L, respectively (Fig. 3, arrows). A logarithmic plot of the molecular mass of the marker proteins as a function of the fraction of the gradient showed that NCC migrates as a complex with a molecular mass of about 310 kDa suggesting that NCC forms a dimeric complex. Sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS revealed the monomeric NCC complex of 150 kDa (Fig. 3B). Concatameric NCC Exhibits Thiazide-sensitive 22Na+Uptake—To investigate whether NCC is functional as a dimer we generated a concatameric NCC in which two NCC subunits are present in a head-to-tail fashion. Oocytes expressing concatameric NCC displayed a thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ uptake similar to that observed in oocytes expressing wild type NCC (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting of total lysates of these oocytes showed a band of ∼240 kDa confirming the expression of the concatamer (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Wild Type NCC Co-immunoprecipitates with GS Mutant NCC—Mutations in NCC cause the recessive disease GS. Previously we demonstrated the existence of two different sorting mechanisms for mutant NCC expressed in oocytes (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). The role of dimerization in this differential sorting was investigated in the present study using the fully retarded G741R-NCC (class I) and the partially retarded G980R-NCC (class II). Western blot analysis of total membrane of oocytes co-expressing HA-tagged wild type NCC (HA-wt) and either FLAG-tagged wild type NCC (Flag-wt), G741R-NCC (Flag-G741R), or G980R-NCC (Flag-G980R) revealed a clear expression of the proteins (Fig. 5, A and B). The wt- and G980R-NCC were present in both the complex-(130–150-kDa) and high mannose (100-kDa)-glycosylated form, whereas the G741R mutant was only present in the high mannose-glycosylated form. Fig. 5C shows that both Flag-G980R and Flag-G741R co-immunoprecipitated with HA-wt. Despite the abundance of the high mannose-glycosylated wt-NCC (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 2) only complex-glycosylated wt-NCC co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that dimeric wt-NCC is complex-glycosylated. Conversely Flag-G741R co-immunoprecipitated with HA-wt only in the high mannose-glycosylated form, and Flag-G980R co-immunoprecipitated with HA-wt in both the high mannose- and complex-glycosylated form. Functional Analysis of Concatameric Mutant-Wild Type NCC—Concatameric constructs consisting of wild type and mutant NCC were generated to study the functionality and expression of wild type/mutant dimers. The wt/G741R concatamer did not exhibit a significant 22Na+ uptake (Fig. 6A). In contrast concatamer wt/G980R displayed a 22Na+ uptake that was similar to wt/wt concatamer. Immunoblotting of total lysates of these oocytes revealed a specific band with a molecular weight of 240 kDa (Fig. 6A, inset). The absence of Na+ transport in oocytes expressing wt/G741 concatamer suggests misrouting to the plasma membrane or disturbed activity of the transporter. To study these possibilities, sections of oocytes expressing the concatamer were stained with FLAG antibody to reveal the subcellular localization. The sections depicted in Fig. 6B show a plasma membrane staining of wild type NCC (middle panel) that was absent in oocytes expressing the wt/G741R concatamer (right panel). Oocytes expressing the wt/G741R concatamer displayed a noticeable intracellular staining, which indicates that the protein is misrouted and unable to reach the plasma membrane (right panel). Co-injection of Wild Type- and G741R-NCC—Because wild type-NCC and G741R-NCC co-immunoprecipitated and the wt/G741R concatamer lacked plasma membrane localization and thus transport activity, we next investigated whether G741R-NCC has the same effect on wild type function after co-expression of the monomeric constructs. Fig. 7A shows that 22Na+ uptake increased dose dependently with the amount of wt-NCC cRNA that was injected and that the half-maximal effect occurred at 2.5 ng of wt-NCC cRNA/oocyte. In addition, co-injection of 10 ng of G741R-NCC cRNA had no effect on the 22Na+ uptake values obtained with 2.5 and 5 ng of wt-NCC cRNA. Western blot analysis showed that mutant G741R-NCC had no effect on the overall expression of wt-NCC (data not shown). Subsequent immunocytochemistry of oocytes co-expressing wt- and G741R-NCC revealed that the presence of wt-NCC did not result in expression of G741R-NCC on the plasma membrane (Fig. 7B, right panel). The main conclusions of the present study are that (i) the functional NCC expressed on the cell surface is a complex-glycosylated homodimeric structure; (ii) wt-NCC preferentially dimerizes with a wild type subunit when co-expressed with either of two GS mutants, G741R (G741R-NCC) and G980R (G980R-NCC); and (iii) dimers consisting of wt-NCC and G741R-NCC (wt/G741R) or G980R-NCC (wt/G980R) can be formed but are largely (wt/G980R) or completely (wt/G741R) prone to degradation by the quality control system of the cell. The conclusion that the functional NCC is a homodimer is based upon a series of experiments starting with the finding that the cross-linker DTBP reversibly promotes the formation of a high molecular mass complex of ∼250 kDa followed by immunoprecipitation results, demonstrating the interaction between differentially tagged NCC proteins, and sucrose sedimentation centrifugation data showing a peak at ∼310 kDa and finally ending with the observation that a concatameric protein of two wt-NCCs mediates thiazide-sensitive Na+ transport. The idea that the functional NCC may consist of a multimeric complex was first suggested by cross-linking experiments in kidney membranes and urine samples of rat showing a specific band of ∼250 kDa (14McKee J.A. Kumar S. Ecelbarger C.A. Fernandez-Llama P. Terris J. Knepper M.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2128-2132Google Scholar). However, the exact structural composition of the functional transporter was not determined. In the present study, we used sucrose sedimentation centrifugation to establish the dimeric nature of the NCC multimer. We have previously used this technique to elucidate the structure of the epithelial calcium channels TRPV5 and -6 (22Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Google Scholar), the epithelial sodium channel ENaC (23Dijkink L. Hartog A. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2002; 444: 549-555Google Scholar), and the water channel aquaporin-2 (24Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A. Rijss J.P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Google Scholar). From its dimeric nature, NCC resembles the other members of the family of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters. In the case of NKCC1, quantitative analysis of the molecular size of oligomers formed by full-length NKCC1 and an N-terminally truncated version of NKCC1 expressed in HEK293 cells provided evidence that the dominant structural unit of this transporter is a homodimer (13Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Google Scholar). Evidence that KCC1 forms multimers was provided by the observation that a dominant negative loss-of-function mutant co-immunoprecipitated with the full-length polypeptide (12Casula S. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Su W. Chernova M.N. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41870-41878Google Scholar). However, in the latter study the composition of the multimer was not further analyzed. The present finding that the functional NCC is a dimer is in agreement with the general idea that secondary transport proteins with 12 or 14 transmembrane-spanning domains including the tetracycline cation/proton antiporter TetA (25Yin C.C. Aldema-Ramos M.L. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Taylor R.W. Walmsley A.R. Levy S.B. Bullough P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 482-492Google Scholar), the erythrocyte anion transport system Band 3 (26Wang D.N. Sarabia V.E. Reithmeier R.A. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3230-3235Google Scholar), and the renal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 (27Fafournoux P. Noel J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Google Scholar) exist in the plasma membrane as oligomeric structures. Our data show that wt-NCC is present in both the high mannose- and complex-glycosylated form. Importantly, however, only the complex-glycosylated form was co-immunoprecipitated. This indicates that the wt-NCC dimer consists of polyproteins that are complex-glycosylated. Using a purified plasma membrane preparation we have previously proven that only complex-glycosylated NCC is present on the plasma membrane (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). Taken together, these data convincingly demonstrate that complex-glycosylated dimeric wt-NCC is present on the plasma membrane. Recently it has been demonstrated that complex glycosylation, and therefore plasma membrane localization, is essential for NCC function (21Hoover R.S. Poch E. Monroy A. Vazquez N. Nishio T. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 271-282Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated the functionality of dimeric NCC by expressing its concatameric form in oocytes. The same method was used to show that voltage-gated K+ channels (28Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Google Scholar), ENaC (20Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Google Scholar), and TPRV5 and -6 are functional as tetramers (22Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Google Scholar). Mutations in NCC cause the recessive disease GS (3Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 24-30Google Scholar). Recently Ellison (29Ellison D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 538-540Google Scholar) proposed a straightforward classification of ion transporter defects including transporters that are normally synthesized and reach the cell surface but are inactive (type 1), transporters that are normally synthesized but do not traffic correctly to the plasma membrane (type 2), and transporters that are not properly transcribed or translated (type 3). Thus far, no type 1 mutants have been reported in GS. As far as type 2 mutants are concerned, we have recently demonstrated the existence of two classes consisting of fully (class I) and partially (class II) retarded mutant transporters, respectively (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). One of the hitherto unresolved questions is whether these mutant transporters do exhibit Na+ transport activity. In this context, the present finding that Na+ uptake values are not different between oocytes that express equal amounts of wt/wt or wt/G980R concatamer strongly suggests that the G980R mutant is fully active. This conclusion is compatible with individual subunits of the dimer being the minimum functional unit for Na+-Cl– cotransport as has been demonstrated for NHE1 (27Fafournoux P. Noel J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Google Scholar). Because the wt/G741R concatamer was not expressed on the plasma membrane its transport activity could not be determined. Our observations with mixed concatamers of wt- and mutant-NCC suggest that the fully retarded G741R-NCC mutant is dominant in its dimeric association with wt-NCC, whereas wt-NCC is dominant in its dimeric association with the partially retarded G980R-NCC mutant. Comparison of Na+ uptake between oocytes expressing a certain amount of wt-NCC only and oocytes co-expressing the same amount of wt-NCC and an additional amount of G741R-NCC showed that Na+ uptake was not decreased in oocytes co-expressing wt- and mutant-NCC. From this finding it can be concluded that wt-NCC preferentially dimerizes with a wt-NCC. This then suggests that the G741R and the G980R mutations distort the tertiary structure that is required for sorting to the dimerization compartment or for physical interaction between NCC proteins. Similarly mutants of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) fail to tetramerize and therefore do not disturb oligomerization and subsequent membrane trafficking of wt-APQ2 (24Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A. Rijss J.P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Google Scholar). Intriguingly, however, some G741R-NCC was found to co-immunoprecipitate with wt-NCC in these oocytes demonstrating that wt/G741R dimers can be formed. NCCs comprising these dimers were high mannose-glycosylated. This substantiates our concatamer-based conclusion that wt/G741R dimers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed no staining of Flag-G741R was detected on the plasma membrane of these co-expressing oocytes. Therefore, we conclude that wt/G741R dimers, if formed, are degraded by the quality control system of the cell. In contrast to G741R-NCC, G980R-NCC co-immunoprecipitated with wt-NCC showed both high mannose and complex glycosylation indicating that only part of the wt/G980R dimers, if formed, are sorted to the plasma membrane. These findings are in agreement with previous results obtained with oocytes expressing either G741R or G980R alone (16De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Google Scholar). One of the intriguing problems in GS research is that in ∼40% of the screened patients only one affected allele is identified (3Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 24-30Google Scholar, 17Mastroianni N. De Fusco M. Zollo M. Arrigo G. Zuffardi O.

Hermes A. Seyberth H.W. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 720-730Google Scholar). In principle, this finding can be explained in two ways (3Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 24-30Google Scholar, 17Mastroianni N. De Fusco M. Zollo M.

Goodyer P.R. Carel J.C. Hermes A. Seyberth H.W. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 720-730Google Scholar). First, the transcript of the other, unidentified allele is not formed due to defects in promoter or intron regions or the transcript is formed but not properly translated (type 3). Second, the unaffected protein is normally formed but somehow inactivated by the mutant protein. It should be noted, however, that the latter explanation is in conflict with the recessive mode of inheritance known for GS. In light of the above discussion, the present finding that the wt/G741R concatamer did not reach the plasma membrane favors the second explanation. Indeed some G741R-NCC was found to co-immunoprecipitate in a high mannose-glycosylated form with wt-NCC. However, it is unlikely that this will happen predominantly in patients in whom hitherto only one affected allele is found. Therefore, we conclude that the second allele is also affected in the above-mentioned ∼40% of the GS patients.

The LIM superfamily of proteins is defined by the presence of one or more LIM domains, which represent a cysteine-rich double zinc finger motif denoted by the sequence (CX2CX17–19HX2C)X2(CX2CX16–20CX2(H/D/C)) (1Dawid I.B. Toyama R. Taira M. C. R. Acad. Sci. III (Paris). 1995; 318: 295-306Google Scholar). The LIM zinc finger does not interact with DNA but functions as a protein-protein binding module (2Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Google Scholar, 3Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Google Scholar). LIM proteins localize to the nucleus and scaffold the assembly of transcription factors and thereby regulate transcription. In the cytoplasm LIM proteins facilitate the complex association of signaling proteins with the actin cytoskeleton (3Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Google Scholar). A subset of LIM proteins are the LIM-only proteins, which comprise solely multiple copies of LIM domains.

FHL1 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of human cardiomyopathy. Microarray analysis has demonstrated FHL1 mRNA levels are decreased in failing human hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly increased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (13Yang J. Moravec C.S. Sussman M.A. DiPaola N.R. Fu D. Hawthorn L. Mitchell C.A. Young J.B. Francis G.S. McCarthy P.M. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 3046-3052Google Scholar, 14Lim D.S. Roberts R. Marian A.J.

Mouse models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy induced by transverse aortic constriction also show elevated expression of FHL1, suggesting FHL1 may play a significant role in regulating the heart muscle cytoarchitecture (15Loughna P.T. Mason P. Bayol S. Brownson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 136-140Google Scholar). In skeletal myoblasts FHL1 localizes in an integrin-dependent manner to the nucleus, focal adhesions, and stress fibers (9Brown S. McGrath M.J. Ooms L.M. Gurung R. Maimone M.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

To date no protein binding partners have been identified that associate with FHL1 in either the nucleus or cytoskeleton. FHL2 is expressed in cardiac but not skeletal muscle and acts as a transcriptional co-activator for the CREB/CREM transcription factors and the androgen receptor (17Chan K.K. Tsui S.K. Lee S.M.

FHL2 binds a variety of receptors and signaling and structural proteins including the cytoplasmic domains of α and β integrins, insulin-like growth factor receptor-binding protein 5, the Alzheimer's disease-associated protein presenilin-2, the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), and the transcription factor WT1; in addition, FHL2 homodimerizes and forms heterodimers with FHL3 (20Tanahashi H.

Recently, FHL2 has been shown to complex with the metabolic enzymes creatinine kinase, adenylate kinase, and phosphofructokinase (26Lange S. Auerbach D. McLoughlin P. Perriard E. Schafer B.W. Perriard J.C. Ehler E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4925-4936Google Scholar). Interestingly, FHL2 has been shown by two groups to interact with β-catenin and regulate β-catenin T-cell factor-mediated transcriptional events (27Martin B. Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z.

Mice with targeted deletion of FHL2 develop normally but demonstrate enhanced cardiac hypertrophy in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (29Kong Y. Shelton J.M. Rothermel B. Li X. Richardson J.A.

The least characterized protein of the FHL family, FHL3, is the focus of this study. Previous studies (22Li H.Y. Ng E.K. Lee S.M. Kotaka M. Tsui S.K. Lee C.Y. Fung K.P. Waye M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 293-303Google Scholar) have shown FHL3 localizes to the nucleus and focal adhesions in C2C12 myoblasts. Consistent with its nuclear localization, and like FHL2, FHL3 acts as a co-activator for the transcription factor CREB, independent of the CREB-binding protein, thus providing a mechanism for CREB-mediated transcription (10Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Google Scholar, 18Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Google Scholar). In addition, FHL3 strongly activates a GAL-driven luciferase reporter, in response to Rho-GTPase activation (31Muller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Google Scholar). As Rho activation regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics, the localization of FHL3 to the nucleus and focal adhesions is consistent with a transcriptional role for FHL3, downstream of Rho signaling (32Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar). Given FHL3 contains four and a half LIM domains, this protein has the potential to scaffold the assembly of many proteins in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. However, the physiological function of FHL3 in skeletal muscle is unknown. In this study we have demonstrated that integrin engagement regulates FHL3 re-localization from the nucleus to actin stress fibers in myoblasts. By using yeast two-hybrid screening of a skeletal muscle library, we have identified actin as an FHL3 binding partner. The interaction between FHL3 and actin has been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. FHL3 regulates stress fibers by inhibiting α-actinin-mediated actin bundling. Thus, in addition to regulating transcription downstream of Rho activation (31Muller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Google Scholar), FHL3 regulates actin bundling and thereby actin stress fiber remodeling.

The pCGN vector was a gift from Dr. Tony Tiganis (Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). The pEFBOS-FLAG vector was a gift from Dr. Tracey Wilson (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia). The pGEX-5X-1 vector was from Amersham Biosciences. Antipeptide Antibodies—The first and last 6 amino acids of FHL3 were fused together to generate the peptide sequence “MSESFDCSQAGP” and linked to diphtheria toxin at the central cysteine residue. This conjugated peptide was injected subcutaneously into two New Zealand White rabbits. FHL3 antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography from preimmune or immune sera on an FHL3 peptide-coupled thiopropyl-Sepharose resin and eluted in 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5. Immunoblot Analysis of Recombinant FHL Proteins—COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-FHL1, HA-FHL2, or HA-FHL3 by electroporation using 5 μg of DNA. Following transfection, cells were rested for 24–36 h before harvesting. Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and lysed with Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to FHL3 or HA. In some studies the C2C12 myoblast cell line (CRL-1772) was grown at low confluence (50%) in growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1% streptomycin). Differentiation into myotubes was induced by switching cells to differentiation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1% streptomycin) for a further 24–120 h. Cells were harvested and lysates immunoblotted for FHL3. Generation of Full-length FHL3 and FHL3 Truncation Mutants— The full-length FHL3 cDNA was cloned from Marathon Ready skeletal muscle cDNA (Clontech) using a touchdown PCR protocol. Further PCR was performed to introduce specific restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the full-length clone. Full-length FHL3 was cloned in-frame into pEGFP-C2 (EcoRI site), pCGN (XbaI site), and pGEX-5X1 (EcoRI site) generating the N-terminal FHL3 fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP), hemagglutinin (HA), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), respectively. Truncation mutants of FHL3 were generated with 5′ and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites by PCR and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid Matchmaker 3 bait vector pGBKT7 vector via the EcoRI site creating N-terminal GAL-4 fusion “bait” proteins. All PCR products and constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing in both directions. Oligonucleotides used to generate these constructs are presented in Table I.Table IOligonucleotides used for the generation of FHL3 and actin constructsName of construct5′ Oligonucleotide3′ OligonucleotidePolypeptide expressedFHL35′-ggcacgagcccgttcgagggtt-3′5′-gagctgagtcccagaggtggt-3′Used as template for subsequent cloningFHL3-EcoRI5′-tctgaattcatgagcgagtcatttgactgt-3′3′-tctgaattcttagggccctgcctggctaca-3′Full-length FHL3 (aaaaa, amino acids. 1-280)FHL3-XbaI5′-tcttctagaatgagcgagtcatttgactgt-3′5′-tcttctagattagggccctgcctggctaca-3′Full-length FHL3 (aa 1-280)FHL3 LIM 1/2, 1 and 25′-tgtgaattcatgagcgagtcatttgactgtgca-3′5′-tgtgaattcttagcgaggagcaaacttgttctc-3′The 1/2, first and second LIM domains (aa 1-161)FHL3 LIM 2 and 35′-tgtgaattctactgcagtgcgttttcctcg-3′5′-tgtgaattcttacttaggtgcaaagagttctcc-3′The second and third LIM domains (aa 93-220)FHL3 LIM 3 and 45′-tgtgaattctatgagaacaagtttgctcctcgc-3′5′-tgtgaattcttagggccctgcctggctaca-3′The third and fourth LIM domains (aa 154-280)α-Skeletal actin5′-tctgaattcacgcgtatgtgcgacgaagac-3′5′-tctgaattcacgcgttaagaagcatttgcg-3′Full length α-skeletal actin (aa 1-377)a aa, amino acids. Open table in a new tab Intracellular Localization of FHL3 in C2C12 Myoblasts—C2C12 cells were left untransfected or transfected with either HA-FHL3 or HA-β-galactosidase, using LipofectAMINE as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 4 × 105 cells/well onto fibronectin (5 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips for 1 or 3 h. To determine factors mediating FHL3 localization, HA-FHL3-transfected C2C12 myoblasts were plated onto fibronectin or poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml)-coated glass coverslips for 60 or 180 min at 37 °C. In the leptomycin B experiments, HA-FHL3-transfected cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and placed into media containing vehicle or leptomycin B (2 ng/ml) for 60 or 180 min at 37 °C. To determine the effect of cytochalasin D treatment on FHL3 localization, GFP-FHL3-transfected C2C12 cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips for 3 h at 37 °C and then placed into media containing either vehicle (Me2SO), or cytochalasin D (5 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with PBS, 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min. Cells were stained with anti-FHL3 or anti-HA antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. FHL3 antibodies were detected with FITC anti-rabbit IgG and anti-HA antibodies with FITC anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Co-localization was performed with the F-actin stain Texas Red phalloidin, the nuclear stain propidium iodide, or anti-paxillin antibodies. In some experiments cells were triple-labeled with anti-HA (detected with anti-rabbit Cy5), Texas Red phalloidin, and anti-paxillin antibodies. Samples were mounted on glass slides using SlowFade and viewed using confocal microscopy. In some studies to assess cell viability, HA-FHL3 or HA-β-galactosidase-transfected cells were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM) and propidium iodide and added to the media for 5 min. Live cells were then immediately imaged by confocal microscopy and were considered viable if propidium iodide was excluded from the nucleus, and the mitochondrial dye TMRM was taken up by the cell and mitochondrial fluorescence detected. Cells from the same transfection were fixed and stained with anti-HA antibodies to determine transfection efficiency. Intracellular Localization of FHL3 in Mouse Skeletal Muscle Sections—Mice were killed following the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Monash University animal ethics number BAM/2000/17. The soleus muscle was dissected from the hind limbs of the mice and snap-frozen in isopentane at resting length. Muscles were placed in OCT blocks and cryosectioned at –20 °C in 7-μm longitudinal and transverse sections. Sections were placed onto Superfrost Plus glass slides and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked and permeabilized for 15 min with PBS, 10% horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (33Flick M.J. Konieczny S.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1553-1564Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were affinity-purified FHL3 antibodies, α-actinin antibodies at 1:800, and actin antibodies at 1:600. Detection of primary antibodies with secondary antibodies was as follows. FHL3 antibodies were detected with FITC anti-rabbit IgG; α-actinin antibodies were detected with TRITC anti-mouse IgG, and actin antibodies were detected with TRITC anti-goat IgG. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h and then washed with PBS. Sections were mounted using SlowFade and visualized using confocal microscopy. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The Matchmaker 3 GAL-4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with the plasmid encoding the fusion between the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) fused with the N-terminal FHL3 LIM domain bait construct (BD-1/2, -1, and -2). Yeast expressing BD-1/2, -1, and –2 were transformed with a human skeletal muscle cDNA library fused to the GAL-4 activation domain (AD) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Plasmids from positive clones were extracted as described previously (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 13.11.1Google Scholar). Y187 yeast, an opposing mating strain of AH109 yeast, was transformed with the AD-α-skeletal actin expressing plasmid (encoding amino acids 205–377) to investigate FHL3-actin interactions. AH109 yeast expressing bait plasmids of the LIM domains from FHL1, FHL2, FHL3, and KyoT2 were mated with Y187 yeast expressing the AD-actin construct and plated onto selective media as per the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Generation of Full-length Actin Constructs—PCR was performed to add MluI and EcoRI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA encoding the open reading frame of α-skeletal-actin cDNA, (see Table I for oligonucleotides). Subsequently actin was cloned in-frame into pEF-BOS(Flag) at the MluI site. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assays—GST alone or the GST-FHL3 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli by growing the transformed cells at 37 °C to log phase (A600 of 0.6). Fusion protein expression was induced by 100 μm isopropylthiogalactosidase, and cells were incubated at 25 °C for 16 h. Induced cells were lysed with PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature (35James M.F. Manchanda N. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Hartwig J.H. Ramesh V. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 377-386Google Scholar). After extensive washing, fusion proteins were eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). GST-FHL3 proteins were washed to remove glutathione and concentrated using a vivaspin 50,000 molecular weight cut-off concentrator. 0.5 μmol of GST or GST-FHL3 was bound to 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin in 100 μl of XB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.2 mm ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed once with XB buffer. 4 μm actin in 100 μl of XB buffer was added to the resin and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed 3 times with XB buffer and boiled in SDS sample reducing buffer for 5 min and immunoblotted with GST or actin antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of Recombinant and Endogenous Actin and FHL3—Untransfected C2C12 myoblasts or COS-1 cells co-transfected with HA-FHL3 and FLAG-actin were harvested in actin lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C, and the C2C12 soluble lysate was mixed with non-immune sera or anti-FHL3 antibodies and the COS-1 lysates with non-immune sera or 10 μg of FLAG antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with FHL3 or actin antibodies (C2C12 cells) or FLAG and HA antibodies (COS-1 cells). Cell Spreading Assays—C2C12 cells transfected with GFP vector alone or GFP-FHL3 were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well onto fibronectin (5 μg/ml)-coated coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were allowed to spread for 15, 60, or 180 min before fixation and permeabilization (16Robinson P.A. Brown S. McGrath M.J. Coghill I.D. Gurung R. Mitchell C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c681-c695Google Scholar). Fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide to identify the nucleus. Cells were considered spread if the cytoplasmic surface area was at least twice the nuclear surface area. 100 cells on each coverslip were counted and scored for spreading in three separate experiments of three independent transfections. Low Speed Actin Co-sedimentation Assays—Purified rabbit soleus muscle actin (16 μm) stored in Ca-ATP buffer (2 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT and 0.2 mm ATP) was polymerized by the addition of 1/10 volume of exchange buffer (10 mm EDTA and 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1/10 volume of 1 m KCl for 1 h at room temperature. The actin mixtures were then diluted 1/4 with Mg-ATP buffer (2 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT and 0.2 mm ATP) in the presence of purified α-actinin (250 nm) and/or purified GST (250 nm) or GST-FHL3 (250 nm) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. The actin mixtures were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and the pellet were separated and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblotting with actin antibodies. Densitometry was performed on Coomassie-stained actin pellets using a UMAX Astra 1220U scanner and GelPro software in three separate experiments. Electron Microscopy—Actin (16 μm) stored in Ca-ATP buffer was polymerized by the addition of 1/10 volume of exchange buffer for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1/10 volume of 1 m KCl for 1 h at room temperature. The actin mixtures were then diluted 1/8 with Mg-ATP buffer in the presence of purified α-actinin (500 nm) alone or with α-actinin and either purified GST (500 nm) or GST-FHL3 (500 nm), in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. These mixtures were incubated for1hat room temperature. The protein mixtures were adsorbed onto carbon-coated 400 mesh grids for 1 min. Actin filaments were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.4, for 15 s. Grids were visualized using transmission electron microscopy (model H-5700, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV and a nominal magnification of ×100,000. Wounding Assay—C2C12 cells were plated to 100% confluence onto coverslips coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml) and wounded with a plastic pipette. The wound was allowed to close for 24 h, prior to fixation and staining with anti-FHL3 antibodies or phalloidin staining (36Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Google Scholar). Generation of Anti-peptide Antibodies to FHL3—FHL3 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (6Lee S.M. Tsui S.K. Chan K.K. Kotaka M. Li H.Y. Chim S.S. Waye M.M. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 197-202Google Scholar, 12Chu P.H. Ruiz-Lozano P. Zhou Q. Cai C. Chen J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 259-265Google Scholar). To characterize FHL3 in myoblasts and skeletal muscle, anti-peptide antibodies were generated to FHL3 sequence derived from the first six N-terminal and the last six C-terminal amino acids, which were conjugated to diphtheria toxin at the central cysteine residue (Fig. 1A). The human FHL3 amino acid sequence used as a target for antibody production demonstrates 92% identity with mouse FHL3 sequence, 40% identity with FHL1 and FHL2, and less than 20% with ACT. To demonstrate specificity of the FHL3 anti-peptide antibody, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged constructs encoding FHL1, FHL2, or FHL3, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis, using either FHL3 antipeptide antibodies (Fig. 1B, upper panel) or HA monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The HA antibody detected recombinant HA-tagged FHL1, FHL2, and FHL3, migrating at the predicted molecular mass of ∼36 kDa. Probing these same lysates with anti-peptide antibodies specific to FHL3 demonstrated an immunoreactive 36-kDa polypeptide only in FHL3-transfected cells. Affinity-purified FHL3 antipeptide antibodies also detected a 34-kDa polypeptide in immunoblots of the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of adult mouse skeletal muscle lysates, consistent with FHL3 expression (Fig. 1C). Pre-immune sera showed no immunoreactivity against mouse skeletal muscle lysates (data not shown). The level of FHL3 expression remained relatively constant as C2C12 myoblasts differentiated into myotubes, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D). FHL3 Localizes to the Nucleus and Stress Fibers in C2C12 Myoblasts—To determine the localization of FHL3 in skeletal myoblasts, undifferentiated C2C12 cells were plated onto coverslips coated with fibronectin, a ligand for the α5β1 and α4β1 integrin receptors which forms part of the extracellular matrix surrounding skeletal muscle (37Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 38Gullberg D. Velling T. Lohikangas L. Tiger C.F. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1039-D1050Google Scholar). Cells were fixe"
https://openalex.org/W1980420785,"A long-standing question in neurotrophin signal transduction is whether heteromeric TrkA-p75NTR complexes possess signaling capabilities that are significantly different from homo-oligomeric TrkA or p75NTR alone. To address this issue, various combinations of transfected PC12 cells expressing a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-TrkA chimera and the p75NTR-selective nerve growth factor mutant (Δ9/13 NGF) were utilized to selectively stimulate TrkA or p75NTR signaling, respectively. The contribution of individual and combined receptor effects was analyzed in terms of downstream signaling and certain end points. The results suggest two unique functions for the high affinity heteromeric NGF receptor site: (a) integration of both the MAPK and Akt pathways in the production of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, and (b) rapid and sustained activation of the Akt pathway, with consequent long term cellular survival. Whereas activation of TrkA signaling is sufficient for eliciting neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, signaling through p75NTR plays a modulatory role, especially in the increased formation of fine, synaptic “bouton-like” structures, in which both TrkA and p75NTR appear to co-localize. In addition, a new interaction in the TrkA/p75NTR heteromeric receptor signal transduction network was revealed, namely that NGF-induced activation of the MAPK pathway appears to inhibit the parallel NGF-induced Akt pathway.

In addition, a new interaction in the TrkA/p75NTR heteromeric receptor signal transduction network was revealed, namely that NGF-induced activation of the MAPK pathway appears to inhibit the parallel NGF-induced Akt pathway. Neurotrophins transduce their effects by interacting with two types of cell surface receptors, the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). 1The abbreviations used are: p75NTR, common neurotrophin receptor; Akt, serine-threonine kinase (protein kinase B); βNGF, mouse nerve growth factor (β-subunit); BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Δ9/13 NGF, p75NTR-selective βNGF mutant with amino acid residues 9–13 deleted; ECD, extracellular domain; ICD, intracellular domain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC12, pheochromocytoma 12 cell line; PD98059, MEK 1,2-selective inhibitor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PI, propidium iodide; PTR, PDGFR-TrkA chimeric receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TrkA, NGF receptor with tyrosine kinase activity; U0126, MEK 1,2-selective inhibitor; XTT, sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)-benzenesulfonic acid; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These receptors, often present on the same cell, coordinate and modulate the responses of neurons to neurotrophins (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Google Scholar). Two classes of NGF-binding sites are present on the surface of responsive neurons that are distinguished by greater than 100-fold differences in their equilibrium binding constants and have been termed the “high affinity” (Kd ∼10–11m) and “low affinity” (Kd ∼10–9m) receptor-binding sites (2Neet K.E. Campenot R.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Google Scholar). Note that what is termed low affinity in this system still represents quite a high affinity in physiological terms. Cell surfaces containing only the TrkA receptor exhibit low affinity NGF binding (∼10–9m) (3Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Google Scholar, 4Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Google Scholar). Cells expressing p75NTR by itself also exhibit only low affinity NGF binding (10–9m) (2Neet K.E. Campenot R.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Google Scholar, 4Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Google Scholar). When TrkA and p75NTR receptors are co-expressed, the association rate is dramatically increased, creating a new site consistent with the NGF high affinity binding site (Kd ∼10–11m) (4Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Google Scholar). These data support the predominant view in the field today that high affinity binding requires a complex between NGF, TrkA, and p75NTR (5Benedetti M. Levi A. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7859-7863Google Scholar, 6Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Google Scholar, 7Esposito D. Patel P. Stephens R.M. Perez P.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Google Scholar). Thus designating p75NTR as the low affinity receptor and TrkA as the high affinity receptor is misleading, since both p75NTR and TrkA receptors have been shown to contribute to the high affinity NGF-binding site (5Benedetti M.

Biochemical analyses have suggested that neurotrophin receptors can form three different types of receptor complexes: Trk homodimers, p75NTR homo-oligomers, and a mixed complex of uncertain stoichiometry containing both Trk and p75NTR. Demonstrating direct interactions between p75NTR and TrkA receptors has been difficult, hinting at the subtle and, perhaps, weak nature of the interactions. Evidence suggesting a direct physical interaction between the two receptors now includes cross-linking (8Huber L.J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 557-563Google Scholar), co-patching (13Ross A.H. Daou M.C. McKinnon C.A. Condon P.J. Lachyankar M.B. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Wolf D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 945-953Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation (14Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Google Scholar). However, a critical question in neurotrophin signaling is whether heteromeric TrkA-p75NTR complexes possess signaling capacities that are inherently different from those of either TrkA or p75NTR alone. Furthermore, the contribution of each receptor oligomer to downstream signaling and cellular effects remains to be fully elucidated. Functionally, signaling by TrkA and p75NTR may be synergistic, independent, or antagonistic. How the neurotrophin receptors act individually and together to regulate the responses of cells to neurotrophins and the nature of the intracellular signals used by these receptors to exert their effects are key questions in neurotrophin signal transduction. We sought to better understand the contribution of each receptor alone, as well as in combination, by examining differences in signal transduction and consequent cellular effects. A stable PC12 cell line expressing a chimeric PDGFR-TrkA receptor (abbreviated PTR cells) (15Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Google Scholar) has been used previously (16Foehr E.D. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Google Scholar) to stimulate intracellular TrkA signaling alone and demonstrate activation of a TrkA to nuclear factor κB pathway. The chimeric receptor contains the extracellular domain of the human PDGFR fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of TrkA (diagrammed in Ref. 16Foehr E.D. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Google Scholar). Because the PC12 cell line for studying the effects of NGF does not normally express PDGF receptors (PDGFR), addition of PDGF to PTR cells allows selective activation of the PDGF/TrkA chimera and TrkA receptor-specific signaling programs but not the activation of endogenous TrkA (15Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Google Scholar, 16Foehr E.D. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Google Scholar). In addition, the p75NTR-selective NGF mutant, Δ9/13 NGF, that lacks TrkA binding but retains normal binding to p75NTR (3Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Google Scholar, 17Hughes A.L. Messineo-Jones D. Lad S.P. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 10-19Google Scholar), allows specific activation of p75NTR signaling pathways alone. In the present study, we compared the separate but simultaneous activation of TrkA and p75NTR oligomers versus functional analysis of NGF high affinity receptor formation. Thus, the contributions of p75NTR and TrkA receptor homomers and heteromers were separated in terms of two major downstream signaling pathways (Ras-MAPK and PI3-kinase-Akt) as well as specific cellular end points (e.g. differentiation and survival). Although a pre-formed NGF heteromeric TrkA-p75NTR complex was detected, the interaction between the two receptors was greatly stabilized upon NGF addition. In addition, activation of TrkA alone is sufficient for eliciting neurite outgrowth, as expected, with p75NTR signaling playing a modulatory role. The high affinity heteromeric NGF receptor site is necessary for integrating the MAPK and Akt pathways to result in complete neurite outgrowth. Although signaling through either TrkA or p75NTR alone facilitated increased cell survival, activation of the high affinity NGF receptor site was necessary for rapid and sustained activation of Akt and long term cell survival. Furthermore, a novel cross-talk mechanism between downstream receptor pathways exists, with negative regulation of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway by the Ras-MAPK pathway. Antibodies—For immunoprecipitations, anti-TrkA and anti-p75NTR antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoblots, anti-TrkA, anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-MAPK, anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-PDGF was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-tubulin and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—PC12 cells (TrkA+ and p75+) (a kind gift from L. A. Greene) and PTR cells (PDGFR-TrkA+, TrkA+, and p75+) (15Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Google Scholar) were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing serum (“serum medium”: 10% horse serum (Fisher), 5% fetal bovine serum (Fisher), 9 mm glutamine, 10 IU penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 μg/ml amphotericin B (last three combined as antibiotic/antimycotic from Fisher)). PC12 and PTR cells were maintained as described (18Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were kept in serum medium, split every 4–5 days at 90% confluency, and removed from that environment only 24 h before an experiment. Exponentially growing PC12 or PTR cells were split and plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated plates at least 36 h before treatment with growth factor. Growth Factor Stimulation and Cell Lysate Preparation—PC12 and PTR cells were serum-deprived overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS, 9 mm glutamine, 10 IU penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 μg/ml amphotericin B (last three combined as antibiotic/antimycotic from Fisher) and then stimulated for the indicated time at 37 °C with neurotrophin. βNGF was prepared and purified from male mouse submandibular gland (19Luo Y. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12275-12283Google Scholar). The p75-selective Δ9/13 NGF protein was overexpressed and purified from a baculovirus cell system as described previously (3Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Google Scholar). BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 were kind gifts from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA) to KEN. Cells were stimulated for the indicated time with 50 ng/ml NGF, Δ9/13, BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5 in 0.5% serum medium. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice, solubilized with lysis buffer as described below, followed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein (ranging from 50 to 100 μg) were loaded in each experiment. Loading controls were done in most cases. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—After treatment with neurotrophin for the indicated time, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were then sonicated followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and protein concentration was quantitated with the BCA reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (ranging from 500 μg to 1 mg) were then incubated with 2 μg of the appropriate immunoprecipitating antibody, e.g. TrkA or p75NTR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the remaining volume was raised to 500 μl with ice-cold PBS. This mixture was allowed to rock at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by addition of 20 μl of protein A/G slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration. The pellet of beads was then washed 4 times in ice-cold PBS, centrifuging between washes. After the final wash, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 3 min and clarified by centrifugation. 25 μl were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then washed thoroughly with TBST and probed with the indicated primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then washed and incubated with either goat anti-rabbit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) or goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% milk/TBST for1hat room temperature. Blots were then extensively washed and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and Fuji XR film. Bands were quantified by densitometry using LKB image documentation system with Molecular Analyst software. Conclusions were drawn after experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Neurite Outgrowth Bioassay—Neurite outgrowth bioassays were done as described previously (20Reinhold D.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3538-3544Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with collagen (Vitrogen 100) and allowed to dry overnight. Collagen-coated plates were seeded with ∼5 × 103 cells/well either in 0.5% serum medium or defined medium (20 nm progesterone (Sigma), 100 μm putrescine (Sigma), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml selenium, 5 μg/ml transferring (last three combined as ITS from Sigma), 9 mm glutamine (Sigma), 10 IU penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.025 μg/ml amphotericin B (last three combined as antibiotic/antimycotic from Invitrogen)). Neurite outgrowth was allowed to proceed for 3–5 days in serum medium. The percentage of cells with neurites (those bearing processes at least one cell diameter in length) was determined. At least 200 cells were counted per field. Survival Assay—Cells were assayed for survival using the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzenesulfonic acid (XTT) assay (21Barker P.A. Lomen-Hoerth C. Gensch E.M. Meakin S.O. Glass D.J. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15150-15157Google Scholar). Cells were washed 5 times in serum-free medium and seeded into uncoated 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well. Various neurotrophin family members as well as the p75-selective NGF mutant (Δ9/13 NGF) were added with and without inhibitors, and the cells were cultured for 5 days. The fraction of surviving cells was determined in triplicate by color formation of a formazan product using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT; Roche Applied Science). This assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt XTT in the presence of an electron coupling reagent by active mitochondria, only in viable cells, to a soluble formazan salt. The amount of orange color produced was measured using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (TECAN) measuring absorbance at 492 nm and subtracting out the background absorbance at 650 nm. The data are reported relative to untreated controls for each cell line. The amount of formazan dye produced directly correlates with the number of metabolically active cells surviving in the culture. Immunocytochemical Staining and Confocal Microscopy—PC12 and PTR cells were grown on collagen-coated 4-well chamber slides (NUNC) and placed in defined medium in the presence of 2 nm βNGF, Δ9/13 NGF, PDGF, or PDGF plus 9/13 NGF for 48 h. Staining was done according to the manufacturer's protocol with washing in PBS at 37 °C, fixing in methanol at –20 °C, and blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the primary antibodies rabbit anti-TrkA (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-p75NTR (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-β3-tubulin (1:5000) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were added in place of the PBS. Cells were kept overnight in the dark at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with the appropriate mixture of fluorescein- (green), Cy3- (red), or Cy5-conjugated (blue) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were mounted and studied using confocal microscopy. Images were captured with an inverted Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser. Imaging of negative controls was used to establish settings for subsequent qualitative analysis. Serial focal planes were collected using a ×60 oil immersion objective and a confocal aperture sufficiently wide to image multiple immunofluorescence labels at high sensitivity with processes and cell bodies in the same focal plane, thereby increasing the optical section up to 2.5 μm. Figures were composed in Adobe Photoshop 6.0, and conclusions were drawn after experiments were repeated in duplicate. Annexin V Staining—Annexin V binding was performed according to a modified protocol for the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit Number 3 (fluorescein isothiocyanate/annexin V/propidium iodide (PI), Molecular Probes). Cells were plated on polyornithine-coated 4-well chamber slides and allowed to adhere overnight. Subsequently, cells were washed 3 times with serum-free medium, and apoptosis was induced by placing cells in serum-free medium (± growth factor) for a period of 8 h. Cells were washed 2 times with 1 ml of cold PBS and 2 times with Annexin V Binding Buffer. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or –20 °C methanol and stained in 1× Annexin Binding Buffer (5× Annexin Binding Buffer (component C), 15 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 700 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with 25 μl of annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (component A, proprietary Molecular Probes) per 100 μl of binding buffer and 2 μl of PI (component B; 1 mg/ml solution in distilled H2O) per 100 μl of binding buffer for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with binding buffer and examined using a confocal microscope. The plasma membrane of cells in the early stages of apoptosis will have green annexin V-positive patches and no staining by PI. By contrast, healthy cells will lack any green annexin V-positive staining and again not demonstrate red nuclear staining with PI, typical of necrosis. Molecular Modeling—The Wiesmann et al. (22Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Google Scholar) crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1WWW) was used as a frame upon which the Δ9/13 NGF mutant was modeled. A model was constructed using QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego), deleting residues 9–13, fixing residues 15–115, and allowing the N terminus of NGF and the d5 subdomain of TrkA to undergo 500 cycles of energy minimization, such that it resulted in an energetically stable conformation for the mutated N terminus of Δ9/13 NGF. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (version 2.01). Differences between means were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post hoc comparison. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were graphed using SigmaPlot 2000. Systems for Studying TrkA Versus p75NTR Receptor-specific Activation—In order to study receptor-specific signaling in the NGF-TrkA/p75NTR system, one can either make mutations in the NGF ligand or in its receptors (TrkA and p75NTR). In the present study, a combination of the two approaches was used. All of the receptor combinations shown in Table I were performed in the subsequent experiments. The key comparisons are between PC12 cells plus NGF (row 2), which stimulates both p75NTR and TrkA through the high affinity site; with PTR cells plus PDGF (row 6), which stimulates TrkA-ICD only; PC12 plus Δ9/13 (row 3), which stimulates p75NTR only; and PTR cells plus PDGF plus Δ9/13 (row 8), which stimulates p75NTR and TrkA-ICD independently in parallel. Because all data obtained in PC12 cells were nearly identical to the same controls performed in PTR cells, i.e. PTR plus NGF and PTR plus Δ9/13 NGF (rows 5 and 7), respectively, only data for PC12 plus NGF and PC12 plus Δ9/13 NGF (rows 2 and 3) are shown in the following experiments.Table ISummary of individual and combined receptor-specific activationsCell and treatment conditionsTrkA/p75NTR high affinity site hetero-oligomersTrkA homodimersp75NTR homo-oligomers1) PC12 untreated---2) PC12 + NGF+++3) PC12 + Δ9/13 NGF--+4) PTR untreated---5) PTR + NGF+++6) PTR + PDGF-+-7) PTR + Δ9/13 NGF--+8) PTR + PDGF + Δ9/13 NGF-++ Open table in a new tab Structural Modeling of the NGF Δ9/13 Mutant—Because the p75NTR-selective NGF mutant (Δ9/13 NGF) (3Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Google Scholar, 17Hughes A.L. Messineo-Jones D. Lad S.P. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 10-19Google Scholar) was utilized in this study to examine the role of p75NTR alone, the structural basis for its selectivity was delineated by computer graphic modeling. The x-ray crystal structure of NGF in complex with the d5 subdomain of TrkA reported by Wiesmann et al. (22Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Google Scholar, 23Wiesmann C. de Vos A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 748-759Google Scholar) clearly illustrates the importance of the N terminus of NGF in binding to TrkA with residues 3–10 forming a one and one-half turn α-helix encompassing close interactions of NGF His-4, Leu-6, and Phe-7 with TrkA d5 (Fig. 1A). Deletion of the five residues from 9–13 (circled in Fig. 1B, left) has been modeled using Quanta software; the results (Fig. 1B, right) indicate that the N-terminal α-helix of NGF pulls away from the d5 subdomain of TrkA as expected, thereby abolishing extensive interactions with the NGF N terminus needed for complex formation with the TrkA receptor. The rest of the molecule remains the same, with those areas critical for p75NTR binding at the other end of the molecule (2Neet K.E. Campenot R.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Google Scholar, 22Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Google Scholar) left unchanged. This modeling result is in agreement with earlier comparison of CD spectra and denaturation studies of Δ9/13 NGF and wild-type NGF that revealed similar secondary structure and unfolding stability (3Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Google Scholar). Thus, Δ9/13 NGF is a useful tool allowing for the study of p75NTR-specific effects, both in the presence and absence of TrkA, and allows dissection of receptor-specific versus receptor-cross-talk effects. Detection of High Affinity TrkA-p75NTR Heteromeric Receptor Complex—The presence of the NGF high affinity heteromeric receptor complex was detected using a set of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Utilizing the Barde protocol (14Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Google Scholar), PC12 cells were treated with NGF or medium alone for 15 min, and lysates were normalized for protein content and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either the intracellular (ICD) or extracellular domain (ECD) of the TrkA receptor. Samples were then examined by Western blotting with antibodies against p75NTR. Intriguingly, the data suggest the presence of a small amount of preformed TrkA-p75NTR complex that is stabilized upon NGF addition (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the heteromeric complex is detected only when antibodies against the ICD of TrkA were used and is undetectable when antibodies against the ECD of TrkA were used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these findings suggest that NGF binding is important for stabilization of the heteromeric complex (see “Discussion”). These results are supported by recent findings that indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TrkA and p75NTR are critical for high affinity site formation (7Esposito D. Patel P. Stephens R.M. Perez P. Chao M.V. Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32687-32695Google Scholar, 14Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Google Scholar). Specificity of the PDGFR-TrkA Chimeric System—Selective activation of the chimeric PDGFR-TrkA receptor (PTR) upon addition of PDGF was verified in a series of immunoprecipitation experiments. PC12 and PTR cells were treated with 2 nm NGF or PDGF for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with three different antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody to the ICD of TrkA pulled down both endogenous TrkA and the chimeric PTR receptor. As expected, subsequent blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed activation of endogenous TrkA in both PC12 and PTR cells upon NGF addition (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, in PTR cells, selective activation of the PDGFR-TrkA chimera upon PDGF addition, but not NGF addition, was observed (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The extracellular domain of PTR consists of five immunoglobulin-like motifs, whereas TrkA contains only two such motifs. This results in a higher molecular weight and slower migration for the chimeric receptor upon electrophoresis as evidenced by the band at 180 kDa, compared with wild-type TrkA that migrates at 140 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 5). To determine whether activation of the chimeric receptor resulted in nonspecific transactivation of endogenous TrkA, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the ECD of TrkA, such that only endogenous TrkA was pulled down. Once again, activation of endogenous TrkA in PC12 and PTR cells occurred upon NGF addition as expected. However, the absence of this band upon PDGF addition (Fig. 3B, lane 5) ind"

Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-Ca2+ signaling cascade, whereas Cav2.1 is a pore-forming channel protein of P/Q-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. In this investigation, we showed that mGluR1 and Cav2.1 are colocalized at dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and form the heteromeric assembly in both the brain and heterologously expressing COS-7 cells. This assembly occurs through the direct interaction between their carboxyl-terminal intracellular domains. Calcium imaging and whole-cell recording showed that mGluR1 inhibits Cav2.1-mediated [Ca2+]i increases and Ba2+ currents in HEK 293 cells expressing Cav2.1 with auxiliary α2/δ and β1 subunits, respectively. This inhibition occurred in a ligand-independent manner and was enhanced by pre-activation of mGluR1 in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, simultaneous stimulation of mGluR1 and Cav2.1 induced large [Ca2+]i increases. Furthermore, the temporally regulated inhibition and stimulation of [Ca2+]i increases by mGluR1 and Cav2.1 were observed at dendrites but not soma of cultured Purkinje neurons. These data suggest that the assembly of mGluR1 and Cav2.1 provides the mechanism that ensures spatiotemporal regulation of [Ca2+]i in glutamatergic neurotransmission.

Excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate triggers an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) both through extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (1Nakanishi S.

IP3 mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ through interaction with IP3 receptors (9Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). The glutamate-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i plays an important role in regulating a variety of neuronal processes, including neural development, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal cell degeneration (10Choi D.W. Rothman S.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 171-182Google Scholar, 11Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Google Scholar, 12Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Google Scholar). Several Ca2+ signaling molecules are located in close proximity and linked through protein-protein interaction. This assembly of Ca2+ signaling molecules contributes to efficient activation of specific Ca2+ signaling cascades and cross-talk between different Ca2+ signaling pathways (3Fagni L. Chavis P. Ango F. Bockaert J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 80-88Google Scholar, 12Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Google Scholar, 13Blackstone C. Sheng M.

Cav2.1 is a pore forming membrane protein of VSCC and mediates P-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ currents with auxiliary α/δ and β subunits (15Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Both Cav2.1 and mGluR1a, a large splice variant of mGluR1, are highly expressed in the Purkinje neurons (PNs) in the cerebellum (19Hillman D. Chen S. Aung T.T. Cherksey B. Sugimori M. Llinas R.R.

Furthermore, coincident stimulation of mGluR1 and VSCC has been shown to potentiate [Ca2+]i increase in PNs (27Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Hausser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Google Scholar). The coincident rise in [Ca2+]i is important for integrating synaptic inputs to PNs (2Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Google Scholar, 28Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Google Scholar, 29Ito M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 896-902Google Scholar). In contrast, the stimulation of group 1 mGluRs has been shown to inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in cortical and globus pallidus neurons (30Choi S. Lovinger D.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 36-45Google Scholar, 31Stefani A. Spadoni F. Bernardi G. Synapse. 1998; 30: 424-432Google Scholar). However, neither temporally regulated mechanisms of mGluR1-mediated P/Q-type Ca2+ channel modulation nor the physical interaction between mGluR1 and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels have been addressed yet. In this investigation, we report that mGluR1a and Cav2.1 form a protein complex through direct interaction between these two proteins. We also show that the heteromeric assembly of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 plays an important role in temporally regulated [Ca2+]i increase in both cultured PNs and heterologously expressing cells. Immunohistochemistry—All procedures were performed according to guidelines of Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine. Immunohistochemistry of mouse cerebellar sections (40 μm) was performed with use of rabbit anti-mGluR1a antibody (32Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-Cav2.1 antibody (Alomone and Sigma) as described previously (33Watanabe D. Inokawa H. Hashimoto K. Suzuki N. Kano M. Shigemoto R. Hirano T. Toyama K. Kaneko S. Yokoi M. Moriyoshi K. Suzuki M. Kobayashi K. Nagatsu T. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Nakanishi S.

Kengaku M. Sillevis Smitt P. Shigemoto R. Hirano T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1023-1032Google Scholar). For immunostaining of cultured PNs, the cells were first reacted with the human antibody against the extracellular region of mGluR1 (36Sillevis Smitt P. Kinoshita A. Leeuw B.D. Moll W. Coesmans M. Jaarsma D. Henzen-Logmans S. Vecht C. Zeeuw C.D. Sekiyama N. Nakanishi S. Shigemoto R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 21-27Google Scholar) and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 3 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized, blocked, and reacted with rabbit anti-Cav2.1 antibody. Immunoreactive signals were visualized with Alexa568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG (Caltag). For double-immunofluorescence staining, cerebella were cut into sections of 30-μm thickness before fixation. The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min and reacted with human anti-mGluR1 antibody (36Sillevis Smitt P. Kinoshita A. Leeuw B.D. Moll W. Coesmans M. Jaarsma D. Henzen-Logmans S. Vecht C. Zeeuw C.D. Sekiyama N. Nakanishi S. Shigemoto R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 21-27Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-Cav2.1 antibody. Immunoreactive signals were visualized with Alexa488-conjugated anti-human IgG and Alexa594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Pull-down Assay—For COS-7 cell expression, Myc/His tag was introduced into the carboxyl-terminal end of rabbit Cav2.1 (BI-2 clone, GenBank™ CAA40715) (16Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Google Scholar) by PCR. Myc/His-tagged Cav2.1 (Cav2.1-Myc-His) was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The mammalian expression vector for rat mGluR1a was described previously (37Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Google Scholar). Expressed mGluR1a and Cav2.1-Myc-His were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-mGluR1a (32Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar) and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with mouse anti-His (Qiagen) and anti-mGluR1a (BD Transduction) antibodies. For in vitro pull-down assays, the whole carboxyl-terminal region of rat mGluR1a (amino acid residues 841–1199, GenBank™ CAA40799) was fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of His/FLAG-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, Clontech) (HFG-1CT), and HFG-1CT was inserted into pFASTBAC (Invitrogen). Other intracellular regions of rat mGluR1a and rabbit Cav2.1 were constructed by PCR and inserted in-frame into pET-32a (Novagen) and pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively; the regions used for rat mGluR1a were as follows: 1CT-1, residues 841–932; 1CT-2, 933–1013; 1CT-3, 1035–1073; and 1CT-4, 1080–1199; the regions used for rabbit Cav2.1 were as follows: CavNT, residues 1–98; CavI–II, 361–487; CavII–III-1, 715–1036; CavII–III-2, 1011–1253; CavIII–IV, 1521–1575; CavCT, 1821–2424; CavCTa, 1975–2424; CavCTb, 1821–2024; and CavCTc, 1821–2164. Proper in-frame insertions and the absence of any sequence errors of all PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The HFG-1CT protein was produced with use of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) and HighFive cells and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). His-tagged thioredoxin fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The purified proteins we used were more than 90% of purity as analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining after PAGE. One microgram of the purified proteins was used for both protein immobilization and protein binding in pull-down assays. The procedures for transfection, protein purification, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and GST pull-down assays were described previously (38Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar). Calcium Imaging and Electrophysiological Recording of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells expressing the BI-2 form of Cav2.1 together with the auxiliary α2/δ and β1 subunits (HEK-Cav) were established as described previously (39Mori Y. Wakamori M. Oda S. Fletcher C.F. Sekiguchi N. Mori E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matsushita K. Matsuyama Z. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5654-5662Google Scholar), except that the pKCRH2-neo vector (40O'Hare K. Benoist C. Breathnach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1527-1531Google Scholar) was used for expression of BI cDNA. The mammalian expression vector containing mGluR1a was cotransfected with the EGFP-N1 (Clontech) marker-containing vector at a ratio of 10:1 using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). EGFP-expressing cells were identified with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 510 nm. Measurement of Fura-2 fluorescence was performed as described previously (41Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Google Scholar, 42Nishida M. Nagao T. Kurose H. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 350-354Google Scholar). Intensities of fluorescent light emission at 510 nm, using excitation at 340 and 380 nm, were converted to Ca2+ concentrations as described previously (42Nishida M. Nagao T. Kurose H. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 350-354Google Scholar). Whole-cell recording of Ba2+ currents was conducted as described previously (39Mori Y. Wakamori M. Oda S. Fletcher C.F. Sekiguchi N. Mori E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matsushita K. Matsuyama Z. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5654-5662Google Scholar). An external solution contained (mm) 3 BaCl2, 155 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES, and 10 creatine, adjusted to pH 7.2. A pipette solution contained (mm) 85 cesium aspartate, 40 CsCl, 4 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 ATP-Mg, 5 HEPES, and 10 creatine phosphate, adjusted to pH 7.2. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with staurosporin or U73122 for ∼5 min by adding 500 nm staurosporin (Sigma) and 1 μm U73122 (Calbiochem) in the pipette solution or pretreated with 300 ng/ml PTX (Seikagaku) for 24 h. The current-voltage relationship was obtained by holding the membrane potential at –80 mV and then delivering a depolarizing pulse for 30 ms in a stepwise manner with 10-mV increments from –50 to 60 mV. Calcium Imaging of Cultured PNs—Primary culture and calcium imaging of PNs were performed as described previously (35Minami I. Kengaku M. Sillevis Smitt P. Shigemoto R. Hirano T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1023-1032Google Scholar). Briefly, PNs were loaded with Fura-2AM (10 μm, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Recording was made with excitation at 340 and 380 nm for 250 ms and emission at 510 nm. Cells were first stimulated with 25 mm KCl in the culture medium containing 1 μm tetrodotoxin (Sigma), 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (Tocris), and 20 μm bicuculline (Sigma) (Medium A). The medium was replaced with the normal culture medium and incubated in the presence and absence of 50 μm 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (Tocris), 50 μm DHPG plus 10 μm 7-hydroxyiminocyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) (Tocris) and 100 nm ω-agatoxin IVA (Peptide Institute). The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min in a CO2 incubator with 5% CO2/95% air. PNs were then stimulated with 25 mm KCl in Medium A with and without the above agonists or antagonists at 24 °C. Colocalization of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 in Cerebellar PNs—It has been shown that mGluR1a is abundantly expressed in PNs (24Baude A. Nusser Z. Roberts J.D. Mulvihill E. McIhinney R.A. Somogyi P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 771-787Google Scholar, 43Shigemoto R. Abe T. Nomura S. Nakanishi S. Hirano T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1245-1255Google Scholar), whereas Cav2.1 is distributed at both granule cells and PNs (19Hillman D. Chen S. Aung T.T. Cherksey B. Sugimori M. Llinas R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7076-7080Google Scholar, 21Westenbroek R.E. Sakurai T. Elliot E.M. Hell J.W. Starr T.V.B. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6403-6418Google Scholar, 22Sakurai T. Westenbroaek R.E. Rettig J. Hell J. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 511-528Google Scholar). We examined codistribution of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 by immunostaining of mouse cerebellar sections with anti-mGluR1a and anti-Cav2.1 antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). Strong immunoreactive signals of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 were observed throughout the molecular layer of the cerebellum (Fig. 1, A and B). Neither mGluR1a nor Cav2.1 immunoreactivity was seen in cerebellar sections of mGluR1 knockout mice (32Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar, 36Sillevis Smitt P. Kinoshita A. Leeuw B.D. Moll W. Coesmans M. Jaarsma D. Henzen-Logmans S. Vecht C. Zeeuw C.D. Sekiyama N. Nakanishi S. Shigemoto R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 21-27Google Scholar) and Cav2.1 knockout mice, 2A. Kulik and R. Shigemoto, personal communication. respectively, with the antibodies we used. Double immunostaining of cerebellar sections was carried out with anti-mGluR1 and anti-Cav2.1 antibodies. This analysis showed that intense immunoreactive signals of the two proteins overlapped throughout the molecular layer but both signals were weak at the Purkinje cell layer (Fig. 1, C–E). We further characterized mGluR1 and Cav2.1 immunoreactivities in cultured PNs, which extended long dendritic branches during continuing culture. Both immunoreactivities showed punctuate labeling patterns and were colocalized at the dendrites of cultured PNs (Fig. 1F). Immunoreactive signals of Cav2.1 were also seen on soma of cultured PNs, but mGluR1a was poorly immunostained on this region (Fig. 1G). Therefore, in both cerebellar sections and cultured PNs, Cav2.1 and mGluR1a immunoreactivities are abundantly localized at dendritic trees of PNs. Interaction between mGluR1a and Cav2.1 in the Rat Brain and Transiently Transfected COS-7 Cells—We examined the possible protein assembly of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 in vivo by immunoprecipitation of solubilized rat brain membrane fractions. Solubilized membrane fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav2.1 and anti-mGluR1a antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-mGluR1a and anti-Cav2.1 antibodies, respectively. The result showed that anti-Cav2.1 and anti-mGluR1a antibodies mutually coimmunoprecipitated mGluR1a and Cav2.1, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). In control, neither of them was detected in immunoprecipitates with nonimmunized control IgG (Fig. 2, A and B). The complex formation of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 was further examined by cotransfection of mGluR1a and Myc/His-tagged Cav2.1 (Cav2.1-Myc-His) into COS-7 cells. COS-7 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and anti-mGluR1a antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-mGluR1a and anti-His antibodies, respectively. Anti-Myc and anti-mGluR1a antibodies coimmunoprecipitated mGluR1a and Cav2.1-Myc-His in lysates of transiently cotransfected COS-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, lane 6). This coimmunoprecipitation was not seen in cells transfected with either mGluR1a or Cav2.1-Myc-His alone (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 5 and 7) nor from cotransfected cell lysates precipitated with nonimmunized control IgG (Fig. 2, C and D, lane 8). These results indicate that mGluR1a and Cav2.1 form a protein complex in both rat brain and heterologously expressing cells. Direct Interaction between mGluR1a and Cav2.1—To examine the direct protein-protein interaction between mGluR1a and Cav2.1, we dissected the intracellular domains of Cav2.1 and then tested their ability to bind to the whole carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a by in vitro pull-down assay. The amino-terminal domain, the intracellular loops, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cav2.1 were fused to GST (Fig. 3A), expressed in E. coli, and purified. The whole intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a was fused to His/FLAG-tagged EGFP (HFG-1CT), expressed in insect cells, and purified (Fig. 3B). The various GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with HFG-1CT. Bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted with anti-His antibody (Fig. 3, A and C). This analysis showed that the carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a not only bound strongly to the carboxyl-terminal portion of Cav2.1 (amino acid residues 1821–2424; GST-CavCT) but also weakly to the intracellular loop II–III (residues 715–1036; GST-CavII–III-1) of Cav2.1 (Fig. 3C). We further defined the interaction site of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region of Cav2.1 (Fig. 3, A and D). The GST fusion protein containing residues of 1975–2424 of Cav2.1 (GST-CTa) bound to HFG-1CT (Fig. 3D). Two amino-terminal portions covering residues 1821–2024 and 1821–2164 (GST-CTb and GST-CTc) failed to bind to HFG-1CT (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the remaining carboxyl-terminal domain of Cav2.1 is a likely candidate for interaction with mGluR1a. To confirm this observation, we attempted to express GSTs fused to the carboxyl-terminal portions of residues 2025–2424 or 2116–2424 of Cav2.1 in E. coli. However, these fusion proteins could not be detected in E. coli lysates, probably due to their rapid degradation. Although we have not proceeded further with this analysis, it is clear from the data so far attained that the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region of Cav2.1 directly interacts with the intracellular region of mGluR1a. The binding site of mGluR1a was also examined by dividing its carboxyl-terminal portion into four regions, each fused to His-tagged thioredoxin (HT-1CT-1 to HT-1CT-4) (Fig. 3B). The four HT-1CT proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads attached with GST-CavCT. Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-His antibody (Fig. 3E). This analysis showed that the carboxyl-terminal region close to the seventh transmembrane domain of mGluR1a (residues 841–932) is responsible for a strong interaction with the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cav2.1 (Fig. 3E). The interaction between loop II–III of Cav2.1 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1a was not of sufficient strength (Fig. 3C) to allow further characterization of the interacting domain of mGluR1a. Collectively, the results indicate that mGluR1a and Cav2.1 form a complex through direct protein-protein interactions between their intracellular domains. Ligand-independent Inhibition of Cav2.1 by Coexpression of mGluR1a—We examined the functional coupling of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 in heterologously transfected HEK 293 cells. In HEK 293 cells, neither P/Q-type channel nor mGluR1 responses were detected (data not shown). A cell line of HEK 293 cells permanently expressing Cav2.1 together with auxiliary α2/δ and β1 subunits (HEK-Cav) was established (39Mori Y. Wakamori M. Oda S. Fletcher C.F. Sekiguchi N. Mori E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matsushita K. Matsuyama Z. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5654-5662Google Scholar). The HEK-Cav cells were then transiently cotransfected with the mGluR1a or the control vector. Cav2.1-mediated Ca2+ influx was evoked by depolarization with high KCl and measured with calcium imaging. Even when the mGluR1a agonist was not added, cotransfection of mGluR1a significantly inhibited a depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i increase as compared with that of control cells (Fig. 4A). This inhibition was indeed ligand-independent, because an mGluR1 antagonist, CPCCOEt (10 μm), had no effect on the mGluR1a-mediated inhibition of [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of mGluR1a was further confirmed by whole-cell recording of Cav2.1-mediated Ba2+ currents in HEK-Cav cells. When membrane potentials were depolarized from a holding potential of –80 mV to positive potentials, HEK-Cav cells gave rise to inward Ba2+ currents in the Ba2+-containing external solution (Fig. 4C, left panel). The current-voltage relationship of Ba2+ currents showed a bell-shape characteristic of P/Q-type channels (39Mori Y. Wakamori M. Oda S. Fletcher C.F. Sekiguchi N. Mori E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matsushita K. Matsuyama Z. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5654-5662Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C, right panel). Comparison of mGluR1a-expressing and control HEK-Cav cells showed that Ba2+ currents were significantly inhibited by coexpression of mGluR1a at all ranges of depolarization potentials (n = 19 for mGluR1a and n = 18 for control; p < 0.001, repeated measures analysis of variance) (Fig. 4C). When mGluR1a-expressing HEK-Cav cells were pretreated with the Gi/Go inhibitor PTX (300 ng/ml), the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin (500 nm), or the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (1 μm), they failed to relieve the mGluR1a-mediated inhibition of Ba2+ currents (Fig. 4D and data not shown). This finding indicates that the ligand-independent inhibition of Cav2.1 channels is derived from expression of mGluR1a per se rather than involvement of G proteins or their downstream effectors. Temporally Regulated Modulation of Cav2.1 Channels by mGluR1a Activation—We next addressed whether ligand activation of mGluR1a affects depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i increase by calcium imaging. When mGluR1a was activated by application of group 1 mGluR-selective agonist, DHPG, 5 min prior to depolarization, the activation of mGluR1a caused strong inhibition of KCl-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 5A). mGluR1a thus inhibited the Cav2.1-mediated [Ca2+]i increase in both a ligand-independent and a ligand-dependent manner. The ligand-dependent inhibition was further confirmed by whole-cell recording of Ba2+ currents. Preincubation of these cells with glutamate (100 μm) significantly inhibited depolarization-inducedBa2+currents(Fig.5B).Furthermore,this ligand-dependent inhibition was at least partially relieved by pretreatment with PTX (300 ng/ml) (Fig. 5B). However, neither staurosporin (500 nm) nor U73122 (1 μm) showed any suppressive effect on ligand-dependent inhibition of Ba2+ currents (Fig. 5B): percentages of inhibition of Ba2+ currents, relative to Ba2+ currents measured in the absence of glutamate, were 26.9 ± 2.8% for glutamate alone (n = 18), 12.1 ± 1.5% for glutamate plus PTX (n = 5; p < 0.05; Student's t test), 32.1 ± 10.0% for glutamate plus staurosporin (n = 5), and 36.0 ± 6.9% for glutamate plus U73122 (n = 2). The membrane-delimited mGluR1a-Gi/Go signaling is thus most likely implicated in the ligand-dependent, mGluR1a-mediated inhibition of Cav2.1 channels. Application of DHPG alone increased [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 5A) (7Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Google Scholar). When mGluR1a and Cav2.1 channels were simultaneously activated by DHPG and high KCl, [Ca2+]i was markedly increased as compared with a [Ca2+]i increase elicited by either high KCl or DHPG alone (Fig. 5A). This finding indicates that mGluR1a in association with Cav2.1 channels plays an important role in a temporally regulated [Ca2+]i increase. Modulation of P-type Channel Activity by mGluR1 Agonists in Cultured PNs—We addressed whether the coupling of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 modulates [Ca2+]i responses in neurons by calcium imaging of cultured PNs. Depolarization of cultured PNs with high KCl increased [Ca2+]i at dendrites and soma of PNs (Fig. 6, A and B). The [Ca2+]i increases were blocked at both dendrites and soma by the P-type channel blocker ω-agatoxin IVA (n = 3) (Fig. 6C). This finding was consistent with previous pharmacological and electrophysiological studies indicating the predominant role of P-type Ca2+ channels in Ca2+ permeation of PNs (5Groul D.L. Netzeband J.G. Parsons K.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3325-3340Google Scholar, 44Usowicz M.M. Sugimori M. Cherksey B. Llinas R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1185-1199Google Scholar). The mGluR1-mediated modulation of P-type channels was then examined by addition of DHPG (50 μm) before and at the time when P-type channels were activated by high KCl. Extents of P-type channel activation were unchanged when PNs were depolarized twice with a 10-min interval by high KCl (n = 5) (Fig. 6C). When DHPG was added during a 10-min interval, it significantly inhibited the P-type channel-mediated [Ca2+]i increase at dendrites of PNs (Fig. 6). Because mGluR5 was undetectable in PNs with both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (8Abe T. Sugihara H. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13361-13368Google Scholar, 45Shigemoto R. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Sugihara H. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 163: 53-57Google Scholar), the effect of DHPG was attributable to the inhibitory function of mGluR1 on P-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, the inhibition by DHPG was blocked by concomitant incubation of an mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt (10 μm) (data not shown). mGluR1 is thus responsible for inhibition of the P-type channel activity. The simultaneous stimulation of PNs with DHPG and high KCl slightly but significantly increased KCl-induced [Ca2+]i at dendrites of PNs (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, reflecting the predominant localization of mGluR1 at dendrites over soma of PNs (Fig. 1, F and G), both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of mGluR1 on [Ca2+]i increase were confined to dendrites of PNs (Fig. 6). This finding indicates that the functional coupling of mGluR1 and Cav2.1 plays an important role in spatiotemporal modulation of P-type channels at PNs. This investigation has demonstrated that mGluR1a and Cav2.1 are colocalized in dendrites of PNs and form the heteromeric assembly in both the rat brain and heterologously expressing COS-7 cells. This assembly occurs through the direct interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of Cav2.1 and the cytoplasmic region close to the seventh transmembrane region of mGluR1a. The binding region of mGluR1a is relatively hydrophilic (23Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Google Scholar) and possesses Ca2+/calmodulin binding motifs (46Ishikawa K. Nash S.R. Nishimune A. Neki A. Kaneko S. Nakanishi S. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 381-390Google Scholar). This region has been shown not only to interact with Ca2+/calmodulin and E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah (46Ishikawa K. Nash S.R. Nishimune A. Neki A. Kaneko S. Nakanishi S. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 381-390Google Scholar) but also to be essential for coupling to the G protein Gαq (47Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Google Scholar). The discrete binding region of Cav2.1 remains to be determined, but truncation analysis suggests that the distal portion of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region of Cav2.1 is a likely candidate for interaction with mGluR1a. Sequence data analysis of this region has shown the presence of several sequence motifs, including proline-rich (residues 2308–2394), arginine-rich (residues 2202–2404), and histidine-rich sequences (residues 2216–2227), which have been implicated in protein-protein interaction. Recently, evidence is accumulated indicating that several transmembrane receptors and ion channels form heteromers through direct protein-protein interaction. The γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor channels selectively complex with dopamine D5 receptor through the direct interaction between the D5 receptor carboxyl-terminal domain and the intracellular loop of the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, γ2 receptor subunit (48Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.-M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Google Scholar). This interaction confers mutual inhibition in a ligand-dependent manner (48Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.-M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Google Scholar). The sigma receptor also binds to the Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 voltage-gated K+ channels and inhibits the K+ channel activity in different ways in the presence and absence of sigma receptor ligands (49Aydar E. Palmer C.P. Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 399-410Google Scholar). The β2 adrenergic receptor not only associates with l-type Ca2+ channels but also forms a multimolecular signaling complex, thus affording highly localized signal transduction from the receptor to the Ca2+ channels (50Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Google Scholar). mGluR1 binds to key scaffold proteins, homers and tamalin, which form protein complexes with multiple synaptic scaffold proteins and intracellular signaling molecules (38Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 51Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Google Scholar, 52Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F.

Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). The assembly of mGluR1, Cav2.1, and signaling molecules may thus provide mechanisms that ensure specific and efficient signaling in mGluR1-mediated glutamatergic transmission. The inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels by group 1 mGluRs has been reported in several neuronal cells as well as heterologously expressing cells (30Choi S. Lovinger D.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 36-45Google Scholar, 31Stefani A. Spadoni F. Bernardi G. Synapse. 1998; 30: 424-432Google Scholar, 55McCool B.A. Harpold M.M. Stauderman K.A. Brust P.F. Lovinger D.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 239: 89-92Google Scholar). This investigation has indicated that mGluR1a inhibits Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manners, which are mediated by the mechanisms of the membrane-delimited Gi/Go coupling and the physical coupling between the two proteins, respectively. In cultured PNs, Cav2.1 channels are distributed at both soma and dendrites, but mGluR1 is mainly localized at dendrites. Reflecting the specialized localization of mGluR1, the pre-activation of mGluR1 preferentially inhibits P-type channels at the dendrites of cultured PNs. This dendritic inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels may commonly occur in other neurons, because the similar inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels by mGluRs has been reported in isolated hippocampal dendritic segments (56Kavalali E.T. Zhuo M. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 651-663Google Scholar). The physical interaction between mGluR1a and Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels would thus contribute to spatially restricted modulation of Ca2+ influx by activation of mGluR1a. This investigation has demonstrated that the conjunctive activation of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 augments [Ca2+]i increase in both heterologously expressing cells and cultured PNs. In the cerebellar slices, coincident stimulation of parallel fibers (PFs) and a climbing fiber (CF) evokes [Ca2+]i increases at dendritic spines of PNs, which are much larger than the sum of [Ca2+]i increases induced by separate stimulation of PFs and CF (27Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Hausser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Google Scholar). Because IP3 receptors are synergistically coactivated by IP3 and Ca2+ (57Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Google Scholar), IP3 receptors have been proposed to be a candidate coincident detector to induce a supralinear [Ca2+]i increase in PNs (2Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Google Scholar, 27Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Hausser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Google Scholar, 28Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Google Scholar, 29Ito M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 896-902Google Scholar, 58Nakamura T. Barbara J.-G. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. Neuron. 1999; 24: 727-737Google Scholar, 59Emptage N.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 495-497Google Scholar). Our data showed no such supralinear [Ca2+]i increase resulting from simultaneous activation of mGluR1a and Cav2.1. This absence of supralinearity may be due to the use of the high affinity Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, which chelates the cytosolic Ca2+ and reduces Ca2+ signaling (59Emptage N.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 495-497Google Scholar). Importantly, our data have indicated that the simultaneous activation of mGluR1a and Cav2.1 channels, in contrast to mGluR1a pre-activation, enhances [Ca2+]i increase in both cultured PNs and heterologously expressing cells. This different modulation of the Cav2.1 channels could provide a temporal window in [Ca2+]i responses of PNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that the scaffold protein homer links mGluR1a to IP3 receptors and ensures efficient Ca2+ signal transmission from mGluR1a to IP3 receptors in PNs (53Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the close proximity of mGluR1a, Cav2.1, and IP3 receptors may help IP3 receptors sensing changes of Ca2+ influx derived from Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels. Numerous lines of evidence have indicated that an enhanced [Ca2+]i increase by the coincident activation of PFs and CF is essential for long lasting depression in PF synaptic transmission onto PNs (27Wang S.S.-H. Denk W. Hausser M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Google Scholar, 28Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Google Scholar, 29Ito M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 896-902Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the temporally regulated modulation of Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels by mGluR1a contributes to integration of synaptic inputs onto PNs.

https://openalex.org/W2029861521,"The elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is highly regulated and tightly linked to pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Recent studies have implicated an early elongation checkpoint that facilitates the link to pre-mRNA processing. Here we show that the yeast forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, associate with the coding regions of active genes and influence, in opposing ways, transcriptional elongation and termination. These events are coordinated with serine-5 and -2 phosphorylation of the heptad repeat of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII. Our results suggest that, in addition to their documented promoter function, Fkh1p and Fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation and pre-mRNA processing. This may reflect a general feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes."

We have characterized the physiologic effects of previously identified mutations in RyR1 that disrupt FKBP12 binding (V2461G and V2461I) on excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis following their expression in skeletal myotubes derived from RyR1-knockout (dyspedic) mice.

However, maximal voltage-gated Ca2+ release in V2461G-expressing myotubes was reduced by ∼50% compared with that attributable to wild-type RyR1 (ΔF/Fmax = 1.6 ± 0.2 and 3.1 ± 0.4, respectively). Dyspedic myotubes expressing the V2461I mutant protein, that binds FKBP12.6 but not FKBP12, exhibited a comparable reduction in voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release (ΔF/Fmax = 1.0 ± 0.1).

Depolarization of skeletal muscle activates sarcolemmal voltage sensors that trigger the opening of nearby intracellular Ca2+ release channels located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; L-channel, L-type Ca2+ channel; EC, excitation-contraction; RyRs, ryanodine receptors; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release; FKBP, FK-506-binding protein; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. a process termed excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (1Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Homotetramers of the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) function as SR Ca2+ release channels, and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) functions both as the sarcolemmal voltage sensor for skeletal muscle EC coupling and as an L-type Ca2+ channel (L-channel). The coupling between DHPR and RyR1 protein complexes in skeletal muscle is thought to involve a mechanical, and presumably physical, interaction (1Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In fact, DHPR-RyR1 mechanical coupling represents a bi-directional signaling interaction since DHPRs control the gating of SR Ca2+ release channels (orthograde coupling), and the presence of RyR1 enhances the Ca2+ conducting activity and modifies the gating properties of the skeletal L-channel (retrograde coupling) (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen.

SR Ca2+ release channels in skeletal muscle are composed of four identical RyR1 protomers, each of which is tightly associated with a single 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) (5Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). FKBP12 is known to physically associate with RyR1 based on the fact that they are co-purified on linear sucrose gradients, RyR1 is co-immunoprecipitated from crude muscle homogenates by FKBP12 antibodies, both proteins co-localize during immunocytochemistry (6Jayaraman T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9474-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they are found to be associated using electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction (7Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In three-dimensional reconstructions of the release channel, FKBP12 molecules bind to the surface of the RyR that opposes the t-tubule membrane, adjacent to each of the four separate “clamp” regions of the release channel (7Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite adjacent positioning of FKBP12 and the DHPR at the clamp regions of RyR1, the precise role of FKBP12 in modulating skeletal muscle EC coupling has yet to be elucidated. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that the clamp regions represent a control point for skeletal muscle EC coupling and that this control is exerted by complex interactions between the DHPR, RyR1, and FKBP12. The binding of FKBP12 to RyR1 profoundly alters the functional properties of SR Ca2+ release channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers (8Ahern G.P. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. Biophys.

Physiol. 1997; 500: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These studies have clearly shown that FKBP12 coordinates cooperative gating of the four RyR1 subunits, eliminating subconductance states and preferentially stabilizing the fully open and closed states of the channel. FKBP-depleted release channels exhibit longer mean open times, have a greater open probability, and show an increased prevalence of substate activity (8Ahern G.P. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. Biophys.

Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, FKBP12 enhances cooperative gating between neighboring homotetramers, resulting in the “coupled gating” of adjacent release channels (11Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and also regulates ryanodine receptor adaptation (13Xiao R.P. Valdivia H.H. Bogdanov K. Valdivia C. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent results indicate that peptides derived from the skeletal L-channel II-III loop directly activate Ca2+ release channels and that this activation is substantially reduced for FKBP12-stripped channels (14Dulhunty A.F.

Taken together, these results suggest that the FKBP12-RyR1 interaction alters the functional coupling between the DHPR and RyR1 protein complexes. However, the precise role of FKBP12 in modulating EC coupling in intact skeletal muscle remains controversial. For example, immunosuppressant drugs such as rapamycin and FK506 disrupt the FKBP12-RyR1 interaction and cause a loss of depolarization-induced contractile ability in rat muscle fibers (16Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the observation that FKBP12-knockout mice fail to exhibit gross morphological or functional skeletal muscle abnormalities casts doubt on suggestions that FKBP12 plays an essential role in skeletal muscle EC coupling (17Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The RyR1 amino acids that comprise the FKBP binding site have yet to be definitively mapped. However, FKBP12 has been proposed to bind to the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) at a conserved proline-containing hydrophobic di-peptide epitope (LP, VP, or IP), which is found in all known IP3R and RyR isoforms. Mutating the conserved proline residue to a glutamine abolishes FKBP12 binding to IP3R1 (18Cameron A.M. Nucifora F.J. Fung E.T. Livingston D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

However, despite the conservation of the proline-containing hydrophobic di-peptide motif, full-length type I IP3 receptors do not interact with either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 biochemically, suggesting that FKBP binding involves a combination of both the presence of the di-peptide motif and the proper local secondary structure of the interacting peptidylprolyl residues (19Bultynck G.

An analogous proline-containing di-peptide motif is also founding RyR1, which has long been known to robustly bind FKBP12 (6Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S.

More recently, it was reported that FKBP12 binding to RyR1 is abolished by substitution of a glycine, glutamate, or isoleucine residue for the valine residue at amino acid 2461 (Val-2461), which immediately precedes the conserved proline residue in this motif. In addition, mutations of Val-2461 that abolish FKBP12 binding to RyR1 (V2461G, V2461E, and V2461I) result in abnormal gating of mutant release channels monitored following incorporation into planar lipid bilayers (20Gaburjakova M.

Interestingly, although mutation of V2641 to an isoleucine residue (which is the same amino acid found at the corresponding position of the cardiac RyR or RyR2) eliminates FKBP12 binding it permits binding to FKBP12.6, the cardiac FKBP isoform. Moreover, binding of FKBP12.6 to V2461I-containing release channels fully restores normal gating of the channel (20Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Reiken S. Huang F. Marx S.O. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16931-16935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although FKBP binding to RyRs is strongly dependent upon this hydrophobic peptidy-prolyl sequence, this region could either directly participate in FKBP binding or represent an important modulator of the affinity of a site located in a different region of the protein. Gaburjakova et al. (20Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Reiken S. Huang F. Marx S.O. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16931-16935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggested that FKBP12 might bind to and stabilize a twisted amide transition state intermediate of a peptidyl-prolyl bond formed by the Val-2461 and Pro-2462 residues of RyR1. Alternatively, reports from other groups have suggested that the primary site for FKBP binding maps to an entirely different region of RyR1 (21Zissimopoulos S. Lai A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 59aGoogle Scholar, 22Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Given potential problems related to nonspecific actions of rapamycin and FK506 (16Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23duBell W.H. Wright P.A. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. J. Physiol. 1997; 501: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have used a molecular approach to specifically probe the influence of FKBP binding to RyR1 on EC coupling and bi-directional signaling between the DHPR and RyR1 in skeletal muscle. Accordingly, we have characterized orthograde and retrograde coupling in dyspedic myotubes following expression of mutant RyR1 proteins known to disrupt FKBP12 binding to RyR1 (e.g. V2461G and V2461I). Our results indicate that disruption of FKBP binding to RyR1 severely compromises voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release (orthograde coupling) without altering resting [Ca2+], SR Ca2+ release triggered by maximal concentrations of caffeine or CPA, or RyR1-mediated enhancement of L-channel activity (retrograde coupling). Co-expression of FKBP12.6 and V2461I, which binds FKBP12.6 but not FKBP12, completely restored normal voltage-gated Ca2+ release in myotubes confirming that the reduction in voltage-gated Ca2+ release arises from alterations in the ability of RyR1 to bind FKBPs. These data indicate that FKBP12 binding to RyR1 enhances the gain of skeletal muscle EC coupling, possibly by stabilizing the open/closed states of single release channels and/or by ensuring efficient activation of non-DHPR-coupled SR Ca2+ release channels. Preparation and cDNA Microinjection of Dyspedic Myotubes—Myotubes were prepared from primary culture of dyspedic muscle as described previously (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17732-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 4–7 days after the initial plating of myoblasts, nuclei of individual dyspedic myotubes were microinjected (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with cDNAs encoding CD8 (0.2 μg/μl) and either wild-type RyR1, V2461G, P2462Q, V2461G/P2462Q, or V2461I (0.5 μg/μl). In some experiments investigating effects of the V2461I mutation (see Fig. 4), 0.2 μg/μl of FKBP12.6 cDNA was also included in the microinjection solution. Expressing myotubes were subsequently identified 48–72 h postinjection by incubation with CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dyna-beads, Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway). Point mutations in RyR1 were constructed using a standard two-step site-directed mutagenesis strategy with the entire PCR-modified cDNA portion ultimately confirmed by sequence analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation of FKBP12 and RyR1 Constructs—Dyspedic myotubes derived from the 1B5 dyspedic cell line (27Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were infected with HSV-1 amplicon virions encoding RyR1, V2461G, V2461I or P2462Q at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 (28Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. DiFrancesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous FKBP12 and the expressed RyR1 construct was carried out 2 days after viral infection (27Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes were isolated from infected myotubes and diluted with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 12.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin A). For control experiments, junctional SR (JSR) was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle using standard techniques (29Hidalgo C. Jorquera J. Tapia V. Donoso P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged, and protein concentration determined. Control Western blot experiments confirmed FKBP12 and RyR1 expression levels were similar following virion infection with each of the different RyR1 constructs (data not shown). 300 μg of total protein of the lysates was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30.0 μl of anti-RyR monoclonal antibody (34C, Sutko and Airey, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, The University of Iowa), followed by further incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Immune complexes were treated with SDS-sample buffer (5% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8), split in half, and each half separately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 17% for FKBP12 and 6% for RyR1). Following electrophoresis, proteins from both gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either an anti-FKBP12 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Affinity Bioreagent Inc) or a anti-RyR monoclonal antibody (1:100). After washing, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min at room temperature, washed three times with TBST, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSigna®, Pierce). Simultaneous Measurements of L-currents and Intracellular Ca2+ Transients—The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to simultaneously measure L-currents and Ca2+ transients in myotubes in which RyR1 constructs were expressed via nuclear microinjection as described above (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The speed and uniformity of the voltage clamp was maximized in these experiments by selecting morphologically compact myotubes containing 4–6 nuclei such that the time constant for charging the membrane capacitance (τm × RS × Cm) was less than 0.5 ms and the maximal voltage error due to series resistance (Ve × RS × ICa) was always less than 5 mV. Inward L-currents were elicited by 30-ms test pulses of variable amplitude from a holding potential (HP) of –80 mV following a prepulse protocol used to inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels (1 s to –20 mV followed by 25 ms to –50 mV before each test pulse). L-currents were normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF), plotted as a function of the membrane potential, and fitted according to Equation 1. I=Gmax×(Vm−Vrev)/(1+exp[(VG1/2−Vm)/kG])(Eq. 1) Relative changes in intracellular Ca2+ in patch clamp experiments were measured using an internal solution containing 0.2 mm Fluo-3, which does not significantly alter L-channel properties in cultured myotubes (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After rupture of the cell membrane and entry into the whole-cell mode, a waiting period of 5 min was used to allow the dye to diffuse into the cell interior. A 75-watt xenon bulb and high speed DeltaRAM illuminator (Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ) were used to excite the dye (480 ± 20 nm) present in a small rectangular region of the voltage-clamped myotube. A computer-controlled shutter was used to eliminate illumination during intervals between test pulses. Fluorescence emission was measured using a dichroic long-pass mirror centered at 505 nm, an emission filter centered at 535 ± 25 nm, and a photomultiplier detection system operating in analogue mode (Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ). The background fluorescence was measured and cancelled by analog subtraction. Fluorescence traces were analog-filtered (τ × 0.5 ms) before digitization at 10 kHz and expressed as ΔF/F, where F represents the baseline fluorescence immediately prior to depolarization, and ΔF represents the fluorescence change from baseline. The magnitude of maximal voltage-gated calcium release ((ΔF/F)max) was estimated by fitting the data according to Equation 2. ΔF/F=(ΔF/F)max/(1+exp[(VF1/2−Vm)/kF])(Eq. 2) L-currents and intracellular Ca2+ transients were recorded using a pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 Cs-Aspartate, 10 CsCl, 0.1 Cs2-EGTA, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.2 K5-Fluo-3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The external solution contained (in mm): 145 TEA-Cl, 10 CaCl2, 0.003 TTX, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Measurements of Resting Ca2+ and Caffeine-induced Ca2+ Transients in Intact Myotubes—Intracellular Ca2+ was measured in intact (non-patched) myotubes loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, myotubes grown on glass coverslips were loaded by incubation with 6 μm indo-1 AM for 1 h at room temperature in a normal rodent Ringer solution (containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After removal of extracellular Indo-1 AM by washing the dish several times with Indo-free Ringer, myotubes were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to allow for de-esterification of the dye. Coverslips of indo-1-loaded myotubes were mounted on an inverted Olypmus IX70 microscope, bathed in Ringer solution, and excited at 350 ± 10 nm using a DeltaRam illumination system (Photon Technology Inc., Princeton, NJ). Fluorescence emission at 405 and 485 nm was monitored using a ×40 (1.35 NA) oil immersion objective, collected at 100 Hz using a photomultiplier detection system, and presented as the ratio (R) of F405/F485. Although this sampling rate (10 ms/pt) may somewhat underestimate the maximal value of rapid action potential-induced Ca2+ transients in intact myotubes, it was clearly sufficient to resolve the complete magnitude/time course of caffeine- and CPA-induced Ca2+ transients, as well as the declining phase of the rapid Ca2+ transients. The resting F405/F485 ratio was converted to cytosolic Ca2+ levels using an in situ calibration approach described previously (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Relative changes in global Ca2+ levels were subsequently monitored following application of maximal concentrations of either caffeine (10 mm) or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 30 μm) using a rapid perfusion system (Warner Instruments, Inc., Hamlin, CT) that permits fast, local application of agonist as well as rapid washout with control solution (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because of previously reported threshold (or all-or-none) effects of caffeine in myotubes (30Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2509-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), myotubes were perfused with a concentration of caffeine (10 mm) that always produced a maximal caffeine response. Caffeine- and CPA-induced Ca2+ transients were not converted to free Ca2+ since Ca2+ levels above ∼150 nm resulted in contractions that introduce movement artifacts into the in situ calibration (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Multiple myotubes were measured per dish and bulk gravity perfusion (∼10 ml) with control Ringer's was used to wash the dish between each measurement. Peak intracellular Ca2+ changes in response to agonist application are expressed as ΔRatio (Ragonist – Rbaseline). Data were analyzed using FeliX (Photon Technology Inc., Princeton, NJ) and SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) software packages. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. There are several reasons for the use of fluo-3 to monitor relative changes in myoplasmic Ca2+ during whole cell patch clamp experiments and indo-1 to monitor resting and drug-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ in intact myotubes. Fluo-3 free acid, introduced via intracellular dialysis of whole-cell patch clamp myotubes, was used to monitor voltage-gated Ca2+ release because fluo-3: 1) exhibits a lower affinity for Ca2+ in intact cells than Indo-1 or Fura-2 (31Harkins A.B. Kurebayashi N. Baylor S.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 865-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and therefore is less likely to be exhibit saturation at strong depolarizations, 2) is used by several other laboratories conducting similar research in the field and therefore allows for a more meaningful quantitative comparison of our data with that published previously (and in the future), and 3) is excited by wavelengths in the visible spectrum (e.g. 480 nm), and therefore can be conveniently used to monitor relative changes in Ca2+ in myotubes grown on plastic tissue culture dishes. On the other hand, Indo-1 was used to monitor resting Ca2+ and drug-induced elevations in resting Ca2+ in intact myotubes because Indo-1 is a ratiometric Ca2+ dye that exhibits a higher affinity for Ca2+ in intact cells and is therefore better suited for monitoring low resting Ca2+ levels (<100 nm) in myotubes (24Avila G. O'Brien J.J. Dirksen R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4215-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, while several drugs (e.g. caffeine) significantly quench the fluorescence of single wavelength dyes such as Fluo-3, both wavelengths of the dual-emission dye Indo-1 are quenched to comparable levels (32O'Neill S.C. Donoso P. Eisner D.A. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by caffeine, thus eliminating quench-induced artifacts in the resulting ratio. Ryanodine receptors contain a highly conserved hydrophobic peptidyl-prolyl motif (LXPL; where X is either a V or I residue in RyR1 and RyR2, respectively) that strongly influences FKBP binding to these intracellular Ca2+ release channels (Fig. 1A) (20Gaburjakova M.

The enzymes interact directly with molecular oxygen and reduced ferredoxin during catalysis, with the electrons ultimately coming from NADPH via ferredoxin reductase or directly from photosystem I (10Jacobson B.S.

Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Google Scholar). It belongs to the structural class I of large helix bundle proteins, which also includes the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R2) and the hydroxylating subunit of methane monooxygenase (MMOH) (12Nordlund P.

The Δ9 desaturase monomer consists mainly of α-helices with the catalytic di-iron center buried within a four-helix bundle. Two pairs of anti-parallel helices provide ligands to the iron ions: α3-Glu105 plus α4-Glu143 and -His146 and α6-Glu196 plus α7-Glu229 and -His232 (Fig. 1). The distance between the two 5-coordinated iron ions is 4.1 Å, and they have distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry. The structure of the cluster is highly symmetric. Glu105 is a bidentate ligand to one iron ion (Fe1), and correspondingly, Glu196 is a bidentate ligand to the second iron ion (Fe2). Glu143 and Glu229 both act as bridging ligands of the iron center. Besides these carboxylate ligands, each iron ion has one nitrogen atom ligand, Nδ1 of His146 and His232, respectively. A water molecule is loosely coordinated to the iron center at a distance of 3.0 and 3.3 Å to the Fe1 and Fe2 ions, respectively. A narrow, bent, hydrophobic cavity, expected to bind the saturated fatty acid substrate, extends from the surface down into the protein for ∼20 Å. Where it passes the di-iron cluster, the shape favors a gauche substrate conformation, which predisposes the formation of a cis-double bond in the product. Based on this crystal structure, the substrate fatty acid chain length specificity was altered in desaturase by making series of mutations guided by the structure (16Cahoon E.B. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4872-4877Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of soluble desaturases remains to be fully elucidated but is expected to have intermediates in common with other di-iron enzymes of class I, especially methane monooxygenases, since these can catalyze desaturase reactions with some substrates (17Jin Y. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 717-725Google Scholar). To react with molecular oxygen, the resting ferric di-iron center needs to be reduced by ferredoxin in two single-electron transfer steps. Δ9 desaturase has not been observed in a one-electron reduced form, so the addition of the first electron seems rate-limiting for reduction (11Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Google Scholar). The binding surface on Δ9 desaturase for ferredoxin remains to be determined. Reaction of the reduced ferrous center with molecular oxygen gives rise to a peroxo intermediate. This is followed by a highly reactive intermediate, able to abstract hydrogen atoms from the saturated fatty acid bound in the cavity, which has been proposed to be similar to the ferryl “Q” intermediate in MMOH (18Lee S.K. Fox B.G. Froland W.A. Lipscomb J.D. Munck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6450-6451Google Scholar). However, since the outcome of the reaction with natural substrates is different for Δ9 desaturase and MMOH, desaturation versus hydroxylation, this hypothesis remains to be tested. Modeling stearic acid in the hydrophobic cavity of Δ9 desaturase places the C-9–C-10 carbon atoms near the di-iron center. Recent data give some indication that the initial hydrogen abstraction takes place at carbon 10 (19Behrouzian B. Buist P.H. Shanklin J. Chem. Commun. 2001; 5: 401-402Google Scholar, 20Rogge C.E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10141-10148Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism for the desaturation remains to be elucidated. A stable peroxo intermediate can be obtained by mixing chemically reduced Δ9 desaturase with stearoyl-ACP under anaerobic conditions and then exposing the sample to one atmosphere of O2 (21Broadwater J.A. Achim C. Munck E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12197-12204Google Scholar, 22Broadwater J.A. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14664-14671Google Scholar). Chemical reduction with dithionite reduces both subunits of the desaturase dimer in a 4e reduction in contrast to the biological 2e reduction, where one subunit of Δ9 desaturase is reduced at a time. This peroxo-diferric intermediate of desaturase is more stable than similar peroxo intermediates of either MMOH or of mutants of R2 (23Liu Y. Nesheim J.C. Lee S.K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Google Scholar, 24Lee S.K. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4423-4432Google Scholar, 25Bollinger J.M. Krebs C. Vicol A. Chen S.X. Ley B.A. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1094-1095Google Scholar, 26Moenne-Loccoz P. Baldwin J. Ley B.A. Loehr T.M. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14659-14663Google Scholar). It decays without formation of the product oleoyl-ACP or of hydrogen peroxide but through an oxidase reaction forming water (22Broadwater J.A. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14664-14671Google Scholar). We have now determined the structures of an azide complex of Δ9 desaturase to 2.4-Å resolution and an acetate complex to 2.4-Å resolution. We propose that these azide and acetate complexes represent models for the μ-1,2-peroxide intermediate in desaturase catalysis and a model for inhibition by hydrogen peroxide. In addition, we determined the structure of the iron-free apo form of Δ9 desaturase to 3.2-Å resolution and with a single iron ion (Fe1) present in the di-iron center to 2.8-Å resolution. These are compared with crystal structures of other iron-depleted di-iron enzymes, and we discuss the implications for iron insertion in Δ9 desaturase. Protein Preparations—The mature castor protein, lacking the 33-amino acid transit peptide, was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli strain BL21 gold (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cells were grown in a Bioflow 3000 fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, New Brunswick, NJ), in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose to an A600 of ∼3 at which time the cells were induced by adding lactose to 0.4% (w/v) and incubating for 4 h at 30 °C. Dissolved oxygen was maintained above 15% and pH was maintained at 6.5. Cell densities at harvest were ∼12 A600. Cells were resuspended 1:2 (w/v) in 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/g fresh weight of DNase I and were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell with a 70-megapascal pressure drop. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min and applied to a Poros20CM cation exchange column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 20 column volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0–600 mm NaCl. Fractions enriched in desaturase were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated with the use of an Amicon PM30 ultrafilter. The concentrate was subjected to size exclusion chromatography with a TSK G3000SW column (Mac Mod Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA) developed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 70 mm NaCl. Desaturase enriched fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and concentrated as before to ∼0.15 mm desaturase (dimer) prior to crystallization. Crystallizations—The hanging drop vapor diffusion method has been used for all crystallization experiments. The azide complex was prepared by adding 70 mm sodium azide to the protein solution prior to crystallization. Crystals were obtained in 0.08 m cacodylate buffer, pH 5.4, 200 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2% octyl glucoside, and 12–15% polyethylene glycol 4000 as precipitant as published for holoenzyme (15Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Google Scholar). The crystals were cryoprotected by a short soak in well solution with water exchanged for 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,7-pentandiol. The cell parameters in P212121 were as follows: a = 192.9 Å, b = 145.2 Å, and c = 81.8 Å (i.e. ∼3% shorter than the original cell due to the use of cryo conditions described above). They contain three dimers in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beamline 711 at MAX-LAB in Lund and processed with DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the acetate complex were prepared as described earlier for holoenzyme, except for the addition of 20% (v/v) glycerol to the well solution. This results in a different space group, P3112, with cell parameters a = b = 94.1 Å and c = 81.7 Å. They contain only one subunit in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at cryo temperature at beamline X12B at NSLS (Department of Biology, Brookhaven National Laboratory) and processed with MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Google Scholar) and SCALA (29Evans P.R. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend, 1993: On Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (30Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The material used for crystallization of the iron-depleted form of desaturase consisted of a 2:2 complex (2 subunits of Δ9 desaturase plus 2 molecules of stearoyl-ACP from spinach) verified by electrospray ionization (data not shown). The initial objective was to crystallize the complex between these two protein molecules. The iron depletion was achieved unintentionally by the use of N-(2-acetamido)-2-iminodiacetic acid buffer, which acted as a chelator. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C with 8–10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 as the precipitant, 60 mm strontium chloride, 0.1 mN-(2-acetamido)-2-iminodiacetic acid buffer, pH 6.7, and 15% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. The crystals, which were very pH-sensitive, belong to space group P31 with cell axes a = b = 188.0 Å and c = 82.1 Å, and they contain three desaturase dimers in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at cryotemperature at beamline X25 at NSLS and processed with DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals with a single iron present in the active site were made at room temperature with pH 4 using 8–12% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 20% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell parameters a = 192.4 Å, b = 145.8 Å, and c = 81.9 Å and contain three dimers in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beamline 711 at MAX-LAB in Lund and processed with DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—All structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) with the original dimeric structure of Δ9 desaturase (15Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1AFR) as a search model. Initial refinement of all four structures was performed with the use of the CNS program package (32Pannu N.S. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1285-1294Google Scholar). This refinement consisted of anisotropic scaling, bulk solvent correction, simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and isotropic B-factor refinement against the maximum likelihood target. Tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used whenever possible to improve the data to parameter ratio. Averaged maps, calculated by density modification (33Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), were also utilized for model building carried out in O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Final refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) using the maximum likelihood residual, anisotropic scaling, bulk solvent correction, and atomic displacement parameter refinement with the “translation, liberation, screw rotation” (TLS) method (36Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Google Scholar). Each subunit was treated as a rigid group, but all water molecules were excluded. TLS refinement decreased the R-factors by ∼3–4%. Annealed omit maps were used to confirm the binding mode of azide and acetate, respectively. To verify the significance of the shift in position of the side chain of Glu196 in the acetate complex, it was perturbed to its original position in the structure of the reduced holoenzyme. Performing 60 cycles of minimization in REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) confirmed the carboxylate shift. The geometry of the structures was checked with PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Google Scholar), and the final statistics are presented in Table I. Model coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the following accession codes: azide complex, 1OQ4; iron-free form, 1OQ7; acetate complex, 1OQ9; one-iron form, 1OQB. The figures were prepared with Bobscript (38Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 938-940Google Scholar) and Raster3D (39Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Google Scholar). Crystal Packing and Space Groups—Crystals from three space groups, P212121, P3112, and P31, with approximately the same length of their shortest cell axis have been obtained during this work (Table I). During crystallization, the desaturase dimers have a strong tendency to pack along a 3-fold screw axis, being noncrystallographic in the P212121 crystal form, and are described in more detail in the original structure determination. The packing of desaturase dimers along the 3-fold axis gives rise to “rodlike” structures, and the three different space groups are created when these rods pack differently with respect to each other. Quality of the Models—No large conformational changes are observed for the four models presented here compared with the original model (1AFR) of Δ9 desaturase determined at room temperature (Table II). Minor differences are localized to three areas where all of the structures show very high B-factors and in some cases badly defined electron density. These areas comprise residues 18–50, residues 205–215, and in particular residues 338–346, which have been omitted in the acetate complex in P3112, where they appear disordered. In regions of badly defined electron density, side chain occupancies have been set to zero.Table IIRMS differences and number of aligned residues between structures of Δ9 desaturase calculated using the lsq_exp option in the program “O”ShorthandOriginal 2.4 Å, 345 aa, P212121Iron free 3.2 Å, 346 aa, P31One iron 2.8 Å, 346 aa, P212121Acetate complex 2.4 Å, 338 aa, P3112Azide complex 2.4 Å, 346 aa, P212121OriginalIron free0.60 (345)One iron0.44 (345)0.57 (346)Acetate complex0.50 (337)0.60 (338)0.54 (338)Azide complex0.36 (345)0.64 (346)0.45 (346)0.55 (338) Open table in a new tab For the azide complex in P212121 and the acetate complex in P3112, the electron density maps are of excellent quality in the active site. However, due to the absence of iron ions, the two iron-depleted models show considerable disorder of the carboxylate side chains in the active site. In all structures, the iron center bridging Glu229 has more flexibility than other iron center ligands, as evidenced by higher B-factor and less well defined electron density. Azide Binding to the Δ9 Desaturase Di-iron Center—Occupancy of azide in the desaturase active site was high, and difference electron density corresponding to the azide ion was found in all six subunits of the asymmetric unit. No significant structural shifts have been introduced upon azide binding. The azide ion bridges the two iron ions of the desaturase di-iron center with no significant changes in the geometry of the coordinating carboxylate or histidine ligands compared with the original structure of the ferrous di-iron center. Therefore, this structure most likely represents azide bound to the reduced state of desaturase with an iron-iron distance of 4.1 Å. The azide ion binds the iron cluster in a μ-1,3 bridging mode, with iron-nitrogen distances of 2.5–2.6 Å (Fig. 2). Azide has displaced the weakly coordinated water molecule axial to the histidines, and the carboxylates are left in the plane of a distorted octahedron (Figs. 1 and 2). The orientation of the azide ion is clearly defined in the 2Fo – Fc electron density map, but some remaining positive electron density is observed in some subunits in the Fo – Fc map. This could reflect a small population of a second azide conformation that differs from that modeled in our 2.4-Å electron density map. A pathway of eight water molecules (four from each subunit) across the dimer interface connects the iron centers, which are ∼23.5 Å apart (Fig. 3a). These water molecules form hydrogen bonds to main and side chain residues of the protein, and they are well defined in our electron density maps; three of them were also present in the original holo structure. The distance between the azide and the closest water molecule in the pathway is 3.6 Å. This water channel is present in both the azide-P212121 and the acetate-P3112 structure. Acetate Binding to the Δ9 Desaturase Di-iron Center—The overall structure of desaturase is very similar between this P3112 structure and the P212121 original structure (15Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation of 0.50 Å for 337 α-carbon atoms (Table II) is only slightly higher than for the P212121 azide complex, 0.36 Å over 345 C-α atoms. There is a very slight reorientation of the subunits in the dimer in this space group; alignment of the dimer to the original holo structure gives a root mean square value of 0.66 Å versus 0.39 Å for the dimer azide complex. Since the distance between the iron ions is long, 4.0 Å, we presume that the metal center was reduced during x-ray data collection as was previously reported for the holodesaturase crystals. Acetate bridges the iron center, displacing a water molecule, weakly coordinating the two irons in the structure of the reduced enzyme. The oxygen to iron distance is 2.6 and 2.5 Å, respectively. When acetate binds to the desaturase di-iron center (Fig. 4), Glu196, a bidentate ligand in the original structure of the reduced di-iron center (Fig. 1), appears as a monodentate ligand to Fe2. The distance between Fe2 and the oxygen atoms of Glu196 are unchanged for Oϵ1 (2.2 Å), whereas Oϵ2 increases from 2.5 to 3.0 Å between the structures. The 2.4-Å electron density map of the acetate complex is of high quality in the active site, and the small shift observed in Glu196 is therefore considered a valid feature of the structure. The orientation of Glu196 was confirmed by calculation of an annealed omit map, and furthermore, the shift is reproducibly obtained on refinement after perturbation of the side chain to its bidentate configuration. Acetate binding in conjunction with this carboxylate shift results in a distorted octahedral coordination of Fe1 (five protein ligands plus one acetate ligand) and a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination of Fe2 (four protein ligands and one acetate ligand). The One Iron Structure of Δ9 Desaturase—The electron density maps showed unambiguously that one of the iron ions had been lost from the cluster at pH 4. Fe1 remains in its position in the active site with unchanged 5-coordination by ligands from the protein, whereas Fe2 is lost to the surrounding solvent (Fig. 5). No large structural perturbations are observed. Compared with the original ferrous di-iron center structure (Fig. 1), the absence of Fe2 causes some flexibility in its bidentate ligand Glu196 and in the normally bridging Glu229. The positions of the other two carboxylate iron ligands, Glu105 and Glu143, are not changed compared with the reduced di-iron center. Glu229 and Glu196 appear to form a 2.6-Å hydrogen bond between each other, probably caused by protonation of Glu196 Oϵ2 at pH 4. We are unable to distinguish whether the remaining Fe1 is in the ferrous state or in the oxidized ferric state. The Structure of Apo Δ9 Desaturase—Electron density for the iron cluster was completely absent in this structure and the normally liganding residues showed some disorder. The overall structure of the apo form of Δ9 desaturase shows little difference to the ferrous enzyme at this resolution. The protein is thus able to form a stable structure also in the absence of the positive charges provided by the di-iron center. The buried carboxylate side chains of the empty di-iron center shift positions slightly and appear to be protonated, since they are at hydrogen bond distance to each other (Fig. 6); a similar observation was made for the apo form of R2 (40Aberg A. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Nature. 1993; 36"
https://openalex.org/W2163850780,"15-Lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2), the most abundant arachidonate (AA)-metabolizing enzyme expressed in adult human prostate, is a negative cell-cycle regulator in normal human prostate epithelial cells. Here we study the subcellular distribution of 15-LOX2 and report its tumor-suppressive functions. Immunocytochemistry and biochemical fractionation reveal that 15-LOX2 is expressed at multiple subcellular locations, including cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, cell-cell border, and nucleus. Surprisingly, the three splice variants of 15-LOX2 we previously cloned, i.e. 15-LOX2sv-a/b/c, are mostly excluded from the nucleus. A potential bi-partite nuclear localization signal (NLS),203RKGLWRSLNEMKRIFNFRR221, is identified in the N terminus of 15-LOX2, which is retained in all splice variants. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that this putative NLS is only partially involved in the nuclear import of 15-LOX2. To elucidate the relationship between nuclear localization, enzymatic activity, and tumor suppressive functions, we established PCa cell clones stably expressing 15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2sv-b. The 15-LOX2 clones express 15-LOX2 in the nuclei and possess robust enzymatic activity, whereas 15-LOX2sv-b clones show neither nuclear protein localization nor AA-metabolizing activity. To our surprise, both 15-LOX2- and 15-LOX2sv-b-stable clones proliferate much slower in vitro when compared with control clones. More importantly, when orthotopically implanted in nude mouse prostate, both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b suppress PC3 tumor growth in vivo. Together, these results suggest that both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b suppress prostate tumor development, and the tumor-suppressive functions apparently do not necessarily depend on AA-metabolizing activity and nuclear localization. 15-Lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2), the most abundant arachidonate (AA)-metabolizing enzyme expressed in adult human prostate, is a negative cell-cycle regulator in normal human prostate epithelial cells.

Together, these results suggest that both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b suppress prostate tumor development, and the tumor-suppressive functions apparently do not necessarily depend on AA-metabolizing activity and nuclear localization. 15-Lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2) 1The abbreviations used are: 15-LOX2, 15-lipoxygenase 2; 15-LOX2sv-a/b/c, 15-lipoxygenase 2 splice variant a, b, or c; AA, arachidonic acid; CAP, cytoskeleton-associated proteins; Cox-II, cytochrome oxidase subunit II; CSK, cytoskeleton; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NHP, normal human prostate epithelial cells; PCa, prostate cancer; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; WCL, whole cell lysate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 15(S)-HETE, 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HM, heavy membrane; LM, light membrane; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; hrGFP, humanized Renilla GFP; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; UT, untransfected; UG, urogenital; RT, reverse transcription; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; pCMV, cytomegalovirus promoter. is a recently cloned lipoxygenase that shows the highest homology (∼80% amino acid identity) to murine 8-LOX, with ∼40% identity to human 5-LOX, 12-LOX, or 15-LOX1 (1Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar). It has at least three splice variants (termed 15-LOX2sv-a/b/c) (2Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Google Scholar, 3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar) and metabolizes preferentially arachidonic acid (AA) to 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) (1Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar). 15-LOX2 shows an interesting tissue expression pattern, i.e. mainly in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea (1Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Google Scholar, 2Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Google Scholar, 3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P.

This tissue-restricted expression pattern suggests that 15-LOX2 may play a role in the normal development and its abnormal expression/function may contribute to tumorigenesis in these organs. Indeed, work by Shappell et al. (4Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar, 5Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S.

Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 287-303Google Scholar) indicates that 15-LOX2 mRNA, protein expression, and enzymatic activity are decreased in high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer (PCa), and the expression levels of 15-LOX2 are inversely correlated with the pathological grade (Gleason scores) of the patients. We recently reported that 15-LOX2 is a negative cell-cycle regulator in normal human prostate (NHP) epithelial cells (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J.

Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 287-303Google Scholar) together raise the possibility that 15-LOX2 may represent an endogenous prostate tumor suppressor, and its down-regulation may contribute to PCa development. Here we provide experimental data in support of this possibility as restoration of 15-LOX2 expression inhibits PCa cell proliferation in vitro and tumor development in vivo. We further show that the tumor-suppressive functions of 15-LOX2 do not necessarily depend on the AA-metabolizing activity and nuclear localization as 15-LOX2sv-b, a splice variant that does not metabolize AA and is mostly excluded from nucleus, demonstrates similar inhibitory effect on PCa development. Cells and Reagents—Six primary NHP cell strains, NHP1–NHP6, were prepared from six different donors. NHP1, NHP3, NHP4, and NHP6 cells were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD), and NHP2 and NHP5 cells were generated as previously described (7Chopra D.P. Grignon D.J. Joiakim A. Mathieu P.A.

These cells were cultured in serum-free, PrEBM medium (Clonetics) supplemented with insulin, epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, bovine pituitary extract, and cholera toxin, and used during passages 2–6 (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). PCa cell lines, i.e. PPC-1, PC3, and LNCaP, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. HEK 293 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS and antibiotics. Rabbit polyclonal anti-15-LOX2 antibody was described before (4Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-E-cadherin and goat polyclonal anti-lamin A antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-human vinculin (clone hVIN-1) was bought from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Monoclonal anti-actin and anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Cox-II) antibodies were purchased from ICN (Indianapolis, IN) and BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. A monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine) antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Bap31 antibody were kindly provided by Drs. M. Raff and G. Shore, respectively. Anti-GFP (green fluorescent protein) antibodies were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). All secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein isothiocyanate, or Rhodamine) were acquired from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Liposome FuGENE 6 was bought from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). All other chemicals were bought from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Immunohistochemistry of 15-LOX2 Expression in Tissue Sections— Paraffin-embedded sections of normal prostate tissues and PCa were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 in water for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was done by incubating the slides with 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min in a microwave oven. Slides were then blocked for nonspecific binding in 10% goat whole serum (30 min) followed by incubation in anti-15-LOX2 antibody (30 min, room temperature). Slides were finally incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by substrate (dimethyl amino azobenzene) incubation. Immunofluorescence Detection of 15-LOX2 Expression in Cultured NHP Cells—The basic procedure was as described previously (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). For double labeling of 15-LOX2 and E-cadherin or 15-LOX2 and vinculin, cells were first labeled for 15-LOX2 followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. After post-blocking in 15% goat whole serum, cells were incubated with antibodies against E-cadherin or vinculin followed by secondary antibody conjugated to Rhodamine. Western Blotting and Subcellular Fractionation—Whole cell lysate (WCL) was prepared in TNC buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm CaCl2) or complete radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The WCL prepared in TNC generally contains much lower nuclear, cytoskeletal, or cytoskeleton (CSK)-associated organelles (such as mitochondria) or proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by MicroBCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples containing same amounts of proteins were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Subcellular fractionation was carried out in log-phase NHP6 cells as previously described (10Tang D.G. Timar J. Grossi I.M. Renaud C. Kimler V. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 361-375Google Scholar, 11Joshi B. Li L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Ben-Josef B. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355Google Scholar, 12Liu J.-W. Chandra D.

Briefly, heavy membrane (HM) and light membrane (LM) fractions and cytosol were prepared using homogenization combined with differential centrifugation. Nuclei were prepared using the NUCLEI EZ PREP kit (Sigma). To prepare CSK and CSK-associated proteins (CAP) (10Tang D.G. Timar J. Grossi I.M. Renaud C. Kimler V. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 361-375Google Scholar), NHP6 cells were first lysed in TNC buffer by scraping. The Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellet was extracted (10 min, 3×) on ice with high salt, Triton-containing CSK extraction buffer (600 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 7.6, 10 μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml RNase, 1% Triton X-100, and protease mixture). The Triton-resistant residue was designated as CSK, and the Triton-soluble portions from each extraction were pooled and proteins precipitated with an equal volume of ice-cold acetone (10Tang D.G. Timar J. Grossi I.M. Renaud C. Kimler V. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 361-375Google Scholar). The resultant protein pellet was designated CAP (10Tang D.G. Timar J. Grossi I.M. Renaud C. Kimler V. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 361-375Google Scholar). 50–100 μg of each subcellular fraction was used in Western blotting for 15-LOX2. Then the same membrane was stripped and reprobed for various marker proteins as detailed in the text. Establishing Stable PCa Cell Lines Expressing 15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2sv-b—15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2 splice variant cDNAs (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar) were subcloned into pIRES-hrGFP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), in which the target gene (i.e. 15-LOX2 or 15-LOXsv-a/b/c) is driven by pCMV and hrGFP (humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein) is transcribed from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). The resultant vectors were designated p15-LOX2-hrGFP, p15-LOX2sv-a-hrGFP, p15-LOX2sv-b-hrGFP, and p15-LOX2sv-c-hrGFP, respectively. These vectors, along with pIRES-hrGFP empty vector, were first transiently transfected into 293 cells to characterize their expressions. To establish stable clones, PC3 or LNCaP cells were co-transfected with pIRES-hrGFP, p15-LOX2-hrGFP, or p15-LOX2sv-b-hrGFP and pCMV-neo (Invitrogen) as a selectable marker. 48 h after transfection, G418 was added to the medium (800 μg/ml for LNCaP and 1 mg/ml for PC3 cells, respectively). Two weeks later, antibiotic-resistant PC3 cells were harvested and plated at clonal density (i.e. 50–100 cells/10-cm dish) and individual GFP-positive clones were selected, under an inverted fluorescence microscope, using a cloning ring. For LNCaP cells, stable clones were established by first enriching GFP-positive cells using fluorescence-activate cell sorting, followed by a limiting dilution method in 96-well culture plates. Two to four stable clones of each cell type were propagated and characterized by both Western blotting and immuno-fluorescence microscopy. Determination of 15-HETE Production in Stably Transfected PCa Cells by Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectrometry— Untransfected LNCaP or PC3 cells, or these cells stably transfected with pIRES-hrGFP, p15-LOX2-hrGFP, or p15-LOX2sv-b-hrGFP, were used to measure 15(S)-HETE production as previously detailed (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). Effect of 15-LOX2 Expression on PCa Cell Proliferation—Untransfected PC3 cells or stable PC3 cell transfectants (passage 8) were plated, in quadruplicate, in 24-well flat-bottom culture plates at 5000 cells/well. The cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 1, 2, or 5% FBS. In some conditions, AA at 1–25 μm was added in the culture medium. 72 h after plating, the numbers of dead and live cells in each well were determined by harvesting both floating and adherent cells and counting using the trypan dye exclusion assays (9Tang D.G. Li L. Chopra D. Porter A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3466-3479Google Scholar). The results were expressed as a percentage of the control, and the experiment was repeated three times. Effect of 15-LOX2 Expression on PCa Development in Vivo—Surgical orthotopic implantation was carried out to assess the effect of restoration of 15-LOX2 expression on PCa development in vivo. The basic procedure was previously described (14Li L. Zhu Z. Joshi B. Zhang C. Johnson C.R. Marnett L.J. Honn K.V. Crissman J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 61-70Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal Mix (10 μl/g of body weight). Four groups of PC3 cells, i.e. untransfected (UT) or cells transfected with pIRES-hrGFP (GFP), p15-LOX2-hrGFP (15-LOX2), or p15-LOX2sv-b-hrGFP (15-LOX2sv-b), all at passage 8, were orthotopically injected into athymic NCr-nu (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) nude mouse prostate (2 × 106 in 25 μl of RPMI/prostate). Tumor development was monitored 2 weeks after surgical implantation. About 2 months (i.e. 63 days) after implantation, the experiment was terminated, animals were sacrificed, and primary tumors together with the urogenital (UG) organs except bladder were dissected out. Tumor weights (with UG organs) were determined, and prostates from all four groups were used in H-E staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Nuclear Localization of 15-LOX2 and Its Splice Variants—PC3 or LNCaP cells grown on glass coverslips were either untransfected or transiently transfected with various vectors using FuGENE 6 (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection and then processed for 15-LOX2 staining (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). The distribution of 15-LOX2 in the transfected (i.e. GFP+) cells was observed under a fluorescence microscope. In some cases, stable transfectants of PC3 and LNCaP cells were used in similar studies. In other experiments, cells were used in subcellular fractionation. Site-specific Mutagenesis of 15-LOX2 and Nuclear Localization Studies—Site-specific mutagenesis was performed to change the 15-LOX2 R203K204, K214R215, and R220R221 to A203S204, R214S215, and A220S221, respectively, using the QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis system (Stratagene) and p15-LOX2-hrGFP as template. A triple mutant was also made. The successfully mutated sequences were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing analysis. These 15-LOX2 mutants, along with 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-a/b expression constructs, were transiently transfected into PC3 cells, and, 48 h later, cells were processed for 15-LOX2 staining. RT-PCR Analysis of the mRNA Levels 15-LOX2 and Its Splice Variants and Mutants—Log-phase LNCaP cells were transfected with pIRES-hrGFP, p15-LOX2-hrGFP, p15-LOX2sv-a-hrGFP, p15-LOX2sv-b-hrGFP, p15-LOX2sv-c-hrGFP, or four NLS mutants mentioned above. 48 h after transfection, cells were selected by adding G418 (800 μg/ml). Ten days later, these G418-selected LNCaP cells, together with untransfected PC3 cells or PC3 stable clones, were harvested for RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and 0.6 μg of the total RNA was used in RT-PCR analysis using the MasterAmp One-Step RT-PCR kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI). Primers C (5′-ACTACCTCCCAAAGAACTTCCCC-3′, forward) and D (5′-TTCAATGCCGATGCCTGTG-3′, reverse) were used to amplify 15-LOX2 as previously described (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). This pair of primers amplifies 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-c as a 546-bp band and 15-LOX2sv-a and 15-LOX2sv-b as a 459-bp band (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). Plasmids (1 ng) were used as positive controls. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine the statistical differences between various experimental groups with p < 0.05 considered significantly different. 15-LOX2 Is Expressed in the Nucleus and Other Subcellular Locations—15-LOX2 is a negative cell-cycle regulator in NHP cells (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand its molecular mechanisms of action, we studied its subcellular expression in cultured primary NHP cells as well as in benign prostate epithelial cells in vivo. As observed previously (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar), 15-LOX2 was primarily expressed in the cytoplasm. However, significant amounts of 15-LOX2 were also localized at the cell-cell borders (Fig. 1a, small arrows) as well as in the nuclei (Fig. 1a, large arrows). The 15-LOX2 distributed at the cell-cell borders partially co-localized with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (Fig. 1, a–c). In some cells, 15-LOX2 was also observed as discrete dots or clusters at the cell periphery (Fig. 1d, arrows) resembling cell-matrix interaction sites called focal adhesions (15Tang D.G. Chen Y. Diglio C.A. Honn K.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 689-704Google Scholar). Double staining of 15-LOX2 and vinculin, a protein marker for focal adhesions (15Tang D.G. Chen Y. Diglio C.A. Honn K.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 689-704Google Scholar), however, did not reveal any co-localization (Fig. 1, d–f). In vivo, 15-LOX2 was also expressed in the cytoplasm, cell-cell borders, as well as in the nuclei (Fig. 1g). Note that, as previously reported (4Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Google Scholar), 15-LOX2 was specifically expressed in the glandular prostate epithelial cells in vivo but not in basal cells or other cell types including stromal cells (Fig. 1g). Also, as noted previously (5Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S. Smith Jr., J.A. Shappell S.B. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1146-1154Google Scholar), 15-LOX2 staining was reduced in the precursor lesion PIN (prostate intraepithelial neoplasia), and most cells in these lesions homogeneously lost the 15-LOX2 staining (Fig. 1h). However, prominent cell membrane and cell-cell border staining, and, in particular, nuclear staining was still evident in some 15-LOX2-positive cells (Fig. 1h). To confirm the subcellular distribution pattern of 15-LOX2 biochemically, we carried out a fractionation analysis (10Tang D.G. Timar J. Grossi I.M. Renaud C. Kimler V. Diglio C.A. Taylor J.D.

The IRL Press, Oxford, UK1992: 233-270Google Scholar)), and cytosol (i.e. the 100,000 × g supernatant (13Chandra D. Liu J.-W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Google Scholar)). WCL was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 2, consistent with the immunostaining data (Fig. 1), 15-LOX2 was primarily detected in the cytosol, but significant amounts of 15-LOX2 were also detected in the nuclei and CAP. Lower yet easily detectable levels of 15-LOX2 were also observed in all other fractions, including CSK, HM, LM, and microsomes (Fig. 2). As expected, the highest amount of 15-LOX2 was detected in WCL. The purity of each fraction was confirmed by specific markers. For instance, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a cytosolic marker (16Evans W.H. Rickwood D. Preparative Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. The IRL Press, Oxford, UK1992: 233-270Google Scholar), was detected only in the cytosol (Fig. 2), suggesting that there was no contamination of all other subcellular fractions by the cytosol. Similarly, lamin A, a nuclear intermediate filament, was detected only in the nuclei. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Cox-II), a mitochondrial inner membrane respiratory complex protein, was detected, as expected, most prominently in CAP and also in CSK (Fig. 2), because most mitochondria normally are associated with microtubules and some other cytoskeletal elements (17Scheffler I.E. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, New York1999: 26-33Google Scholar). Cox-II was also detected, expectedly, in the HM and LM fractions (Fig. 2), which normally are enriched with the mitochondria (11Joshi B. Li L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Ben-Josef B. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355Google Scholar, 13Chandra D. Liu J.-W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Google Scholar). Note that no lamin A or Cox-II was detected in WCL, probably due to the low levels of nuclei and mitochondria in the WCL prepared using the TNC buffer (see “Materials and Methods”). Finally, Bap31, an integral ER membrane protein (18Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Kuppig S. Reth M. Shore G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4331-4336Google Scholar), was detected in CAP, HM, LM, microsomes, and WCL, but not in the cytosol, nuclei, or CSK (Fig. 2). Collectively, data in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that, in addition to its predominant expression in the cytosol, 15-LOX2 is also expressed at multiple other subcellular locations, including nuclei, cell-cell borders, CSK, and membrane fractions. None of the Three 15-LOX2 Splice Variants Is Localized to the Nucleus—The nuclear localization of 15-LOX2 is particularly interesting, because it suggests that the molecule may play a distinct signaling function in the nucleus. Therefore, our subsequent studies focused on the nuclear localization of 15-LOX2 and its relationship with the enzymatic and functional activities. We previously cloned three 15-LOX2 splice variants termed 15-LOX2sv-a/b/c (3Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16189-16201Google Scholar). These splice variants have spliced out some critical amino acid residues important for the AA-metabolizing enzymatic activities (2Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Google Scholar"
https://openalex.org/W1497446066,"Some Gq-coupled receptors have been shown to antagonize growth factor activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, Akt. We used a constitutively active Gαq(Q209L) mutant to explore the effects of Gαq activation on signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Transient expression of Gαq(Q209L) in Rat-1 fibroblasts inhibited Akt activation induced by platelet-derived growth factor or insulin treatment. Expression of Gαq(Q209L) also attenuated Akt activation promoted by coexpression of constitutively active PI3K in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Gαq(Q209L) had no effect on the activity of an Akt mutant in which the two regulatory phosphorylation sites were changed to acidic amino acids. Inducible expression of Gαq(Q209L) in a stably transfected 293 cell line caused a decrease in PI3K activity in p110α (but not p110β) immunoprecipitates. Receptor activation of Gαq also selectively inhibited PI3K activity in p110α immunoprecipitates. Active Gαq still inhibited PI3K/Akt in cells pretreated with the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. Finally, Gαq(Q209L) co-immunoprecipitated with the p110α-p85α PI3K heterodimer from lysates of COS-7 cells expressing these proteins, and incubation of immunoprecipitated Gαq(Q209L) with purified recombinant p110α-p85α in vitro led to a decrease in PI3K activity. These results suggest that agonist binding to Gq-coupled receptors blocks Akt activation via the release of active Gαq subunits that inhibit PI3K. The inhibitory mechanism seems to be independent of phospholipase C activation and might involve an inhibitory interaction between Gαq and p110α PI3K.

Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Google Scholar). Of the three classes of PI3K, only the class I enzymes preferentially phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate in vivo. Class I PI3Ks are divided into two groups: IA enzymes are heterodimers between a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 or p55 (or their splice variants) regulatory subunit. Mammals have three class IA p110 catalytic subunits (α, β, and δ) that can associate with at least seven regulatory subunits that are generated by alternative splicing of three different genes (p85α, p85β, and p55γ). p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p110δ is present almost exclusively in leukocytes. Class IA PI3Ks can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, and the p110β isoform is also activated by some G protein-coupled receptors (2Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Google Scholar). The p85 regulatory subunit contains two SH2 (Src homology 2) domains that bind to specific phosphotyrosine motifs on receptor tyrosine kinases or their substrates. This binding leads to translocation of p110 to the membrane and enhances its catalytic activity. The class IB PI3K consists of a p110γ catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory protein and is activated by some receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins.An important downstream effector of PI3K is the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt. Akt is activated by phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop of the kinase domain and Ser473 in the C-terminal tail (reviewed in Ref. 3Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Google Scholar). It is believed that phosphorylation of both sites requires an interaction between the N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and membrane phosphoinositides generated by PI3K. Although a few cell treatments have been reported to activate Akt in a PI3K-independent manner (4Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Google Scholar, 5Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Google Scholar), receptor tyrosine kinases that activate Akt also in general activate PI3K.Cell-surface receptors that transmit signals through heterotrimeric G proteins regulate the PI3K/Akt pathway in a variety of ways. Receptors that couple to proteins in the Gi/o family can increase PI3K activity. This effect is mediated mainly by Gβγ heterodimers, which activate both the p110β and p110γ PI3Ks (6Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Recent reports indicate that Gi/o-coupled receptors also active Akt (9Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A. Hemmings B.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28096-28101Google Scholar, 10Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Google Scholar, 11Bommakanti R.K. Vinayak S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38870-38876Google Scholar). Receptors that couple to Gs have also been shown to activate Akt. In some cases, this response is unusual in that it appears to be independent of PI3K (4Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Google Scholar, 12Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, it is thought to be due to activation of PI3K by Gβγ subunits (11Bommakanti R.K. Vinayak S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38870-38876Google Scholar).The data regarding regulation of PI3K and/or Akt by Gq-coupled receptors are more controversial. One body of evidence suggests that some receptors that can couple to Gq might activate PI3K/Akt signaling in certain cellular settings (13Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol.

Indeed, we reported that norepinephrine stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors in human aortic smooth muscle cells increases PI3K activity (20Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Google Scholar). However, this effect is completely blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that it is not mediated by Gαq (20Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Google Scholar). A second body of evidence suggests that Gq-coupled receptors do not activate PI3K or Akt and in fact antagonize activation of these enzymes by growth factors that act through tyrosine kinase receptors (11Bommakanti R.K. Vinayak S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38870-38876Google Scholar, 21Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Google Scholar, 22Velloso L.A. Folli F. Sun X.J. White M.F.

In agreement with these reports, we found that stimulation of the α1A-adrenergic receptor in Rat-1 cells with the agonist phenylephrine (PE) does not increase PI(3,4,5)P3 levels or PI3K activity and does not activate Akt (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α1A-adrenergic receptor inhibits activation of PI3K/Akt in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar, 27Ballou L.M. Tian P.-Y. Lin H.-Y. Jiang Y.-P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40910-40916Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism by which the α1A-adrenergic receptor and other Gq-coupled receptors inhibit PI3K signaling, we used Gαq(Q209L) to test whether activated Gαq inhibits Akt activation by inhibiting PI3K.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant PDGF-A/B, PE, doxycycline, insulin, PI, U73122, GTPγS, and monoclonal antibody to FLAG were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (10–25 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

PCR with primers 5′-CGCCTCGAGGCCACCATGGGCAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGAAG (forward) and 5′-CGCGATATCTCAGGCCGTGCTGCTGGCCGA (reverse) was used to amplify Akt from Akt-HA, and the cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II SK. Akt was excised using XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) to obtain Akt-Myc. The Akt(T308D/S473D) double mutant (referred to as AktDD-Myc) was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and forward primers 5′-GGTGCCACCATGAAGGACTTTTGCGGCACACCT (T308D) and 5′-CACTTCCCCCAGTTCGACTACTCGGCCAGC (S473D).Mouse wild-type p110α and constitutively active myristoylated (myr) p110α in pUSEamp were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. FLAG-p110α was obtained by subcloning p110α from pUSEamp into the XbaI and BamHI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). Mouse p85α was obtained by PCR from mouse liver cDNA (Clontech) using primers 5′-GCGGAATTCATGAGTGCAGAGGGCTACCA (forward) and 5′-GCGGGATCCTCATCGCCTCTGTTGTGC (reverse). The p85α cDNA fragment was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using XbaI and EcoRV. PCR with primers 5′-CGCGGTACCGCCACCATGGCATACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCACTCTGGAGTCCATCATGGC (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGACCAGATTGTACTCCTTCAG (reverse) was used to obtain HA-Gαq from Swiss mouse 3T3 cell cDNA.

Gαq(Q209L) was subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) using NotI and ApaI.Cell Culture—Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing the human α1A-adrenergic receptor (28Kenny B.A. Miller A.M. Williamson I.J. O'Connell J. Chalmers D.H. Naylor A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 871-878Google Scholar) or the human insulin receptor (29McClain D. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T. Ulrich A. Olefsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Google Scholar), human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before agonist treatments, the cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 5 h, the transfection solutions were replaced with growth medium, and cell lysates were prepared 2 days later. Rat-1 cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) following a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Cells at ∼50% confluence were transfected in a mixture containing 3 μl of TransIT-LT1 for each microgram of DNA in growth medium. The cells were left in the transfection solution for 24 h and then incubated in serum-free medium for another 16–18 h prior to the experiment.Stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing Gαq(Q209L) under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter and control cells were generated using the Flp-In T-REx system (Invitrogen) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, Flp-In T-REx/293 cells growing in medium containing Zeocin were cotransfected with either Gαq(Q209L)/pcDNA5/FRT/TO or the empty vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO together with pOG44. Transfected cells were then selected for Zeocin and hygromycin resistance. Clones with inducible expression of Gαq(Q209L) were confirmed by Western blotting.Cell Lysate Preparation—After treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) with either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40 plus 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h and then with 25 μl of protein A- or protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h. The beads were either washed three times with lysis buffer and used for immunoblotting or washed three times with lysis buffer and once with the appropriate kinase assay buffer prior to performing kinase assays.Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of cell lysate protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Signals were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and a chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were stripped as described (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar).PI3K and Akt Assays—PI3K and Akt activities were assayed following methods described previously (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar).Phospholipid Analysis—Rat-1 cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol as described (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar) and treated with agonists. Phospholipids were extracted and analyzed as described previously (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar), except the HPLC gradient was modified to better separate the PI(3,4,5)P3 derivative from other compounds (30Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Google Scholar). The solutions used to develop the gradient were ultrapure water (solution A) and 1.25 m (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.8) (solution B). The gradient was developed as follows: 0% solution B from 0 to 10 min, increased to 15% from 10 to 48 min; 15% solution B from 48 to 60 min, increased to 25% from 60 to 75 min, and increased to 30% from 75 to 100 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The PI(3,4,5)P3 derivative emerged after ∼82 min. Elution positions were confirmed using 32P-labeled standards as described (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.-X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Google Scholar).Purification of Recombinant p110α-p85α—Baculovirus expressing human p85α was purchased from Orbigen (San Diego, CA). To produce baculovirus expressing p110α, mouse p110α from pUSEamp was subcloned into pBlueBacHis2A (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the plasmid and linear Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus viral DNA using the Invitrogen BAC-N-BLUE transfection kit, and a baculovirus clone expressing recombinant p110α protein was isolated. To make the p110α-p85α complex, a 400-ml culture of Sf9 cells was co-infected with the two baculoviruses. Two days later, the cells were pelleted and lysed, and the lysate was passed over a 5-ml HiTrap QFF column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl; PI3K activity emerging at 180–270 mm NaCl was pooled. Material from three QFF columns was passed over a column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.). After extensive washing with 50 mm imidazole, the PI3K complex was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Fractions with the highest activity contained equivalent amounts of two major Coomassie Blue-stained proteins corresponding to recombinant p110α and p85α.Quantitation of Inositol Phosphates—Rat-1 cells expressing the human α1A-adrenergic receptor were seeded in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well. The next day, cells were labeled for 16–24 h in 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol. After labeling, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer A (120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm LiCl, and 25 mm PIPES (pH 7.2)) with or without 5 μm U73122 for 30 min. Cells were then treated with agonists for another 30 min. COS-7 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection with FLAG-p110α and p85α in the presence of either empty vector or HA-Gαq(Q209L). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in 1 ml of growth medium containing 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 16–24 h. Cells were then washed and incubated in buffer A with or without 5 μm U73122 for 1 h. After cell treatments, 1 ml of 16 mm HCl in methanol was added to each well, and the solutions were applied to 500-μl columns of Dowex 1-X8 (formate form). The columns were washed with 5 mm sodium tetraborate and 60 mm sodium formate, and then total inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 ml of 1 m ammonium formate and 100 mm formic acid. Radioactivity in the eluted material was determined by scintillation counting. Assays were performed in triplicate.RESULTSGαq(Q209L) Inhibits Growth Factor Activation of Akt—Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors leads to GTP loading of the Gα subunit and release of the Gβγ subunits. The Gα and Gβγ subunits can then independently exert their effects on downstream effectors. Although the α1A-adrenergic receptor couples mainly to α proteins in the Gq/11 family, the receptor can also activate α proteins in other families (31Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142Google Scholar, 32Ruan Y. Kan H. Parmentier J.H. Fatima S. Allen L.F. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 576-585Google Scholar). Inhibition of Akt upon PE stimulation of the α1A-adrenergic receptor in Rat-1 cells is probably not due to coupling of the receptor to Gαi or Gαs because the effect was not blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, respectively (data not shown). Because Gβγ subunits have been shown to activate PI3K, we decided to explore a possible role for Gαq in PI3K/Akt inhibition. To do this, we used an HA-tagged version of the Q209L mutant of Gαq, which is GTPase-deficient and therefore constitutively activates downstream effectors such as phospholipase Cβ without agonist stimulation of a receptor (33Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Google Scholar).Rat-1 cells were cotransfected with Akt-Myc and with either HA-Gαq(Q209L) or empty vector as a control. The cells were treated with or without PDGF, and Akt activity was assayed in Myc immunoprecipitates. PDGF treatment stimulated Akt activity 3.6-fold in control cells, and this response was suppressed 58% by expression of HA-Gαq(Q209L) (Fig. 1A, graph). Western blotting showed that Akt-Myc and HA-Gαq(Q209L) were expressed appropriately (Fig. 1A, blots). An additional experiment using a different growth factor was done to test the generality of Akt inhibition by HA-Gαq(Q209L). Rat-1 cells stably expressing the human insulin receptor (Rat-1/HIR cells) were transfected with either HA-Gαq(Q209L) or empty vector as a control. The cells were treated with or without insulin, and the activity of endogenous Akt was assayed in Akt immunoprecipitates. Insulin activated Akt 3.4-fold in control cells, and this response was suppressed 38% by expression of HA-Gαq(Q209L) (Fig. 1B, graph). Western blot analysis showed that the reduction in Akt activity was paralleled by a reduction in Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, upper blot). HA-Gαq(Q209L) did not affect the expression of the Akt protein (Fig. 1B, middle blot). The blot was also probed with anti-HA antibody to demonstrate that HA-Gαq(Q209L) was appropriately expressed (Fig. 1B, lower blot). Thus, expression of HA-Gαq(Q209L) opposes the activation of Akt induced by both the PDGF and insulin receptors. The apparently stronger effect of HA-Gαq(Q209L) in Fig. 1A compared with Fig. 1B is due to the fact that Akt-Myc was cotransfected with HA-Gαq(Q209L) in the former experiment, whereas endogenous Akt was analyzed in the latter. Transfection of Rat-1/HIR cells with a vector expressing green fluorescent protein showed that the transfection efficiency under the conditions used in Fig. 1B was ∼60% (data not shown).Gαq(Q209L) Inhibits Myristoylated p110α Activation of Akt—The inhibitory effect of Gαq(Q209L) on Akt activation induced by two distinct receptors raised the possibility that active Gαq might have a direct inhibitory effect on either Akt or PI3K. To test whether Gαq(Q209L) targets Akt, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-Gαq(Q209L) or empty vector as a control and with an activated form of Akt in which the two phosphorylation sites were mutated to Asp (AktDD-Myc). Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to assaying Akt activity in Myc immunoprecipitates. Extracts from cells transfected with AktDD-Myc had four to six times more Akt kinase activity than extracts from cells transfected with Akt-Myc (Fig. 2A). The presence of HA-Gαq(Q209L) did not affect the activity of AktDD-Myc (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that activated Gαq does not have a direct inhibitory effect on Akt.Fig. 2Effect of Gαq(Q209L) on myr-p110α activation of Akt.A, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with Akt-Myc or AktDD-Myc and with combinations of myr-p110α, HA-Gαq(Q209L), or empty vector as a control. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and Akt activity was assayed in Myc immunoprecipitates. Data shown are means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. B, cell extracts from A (representing the first, fourth, and fifth bars) were analyzed on a Western blot probed sequentially with antibodies to phospho-Ser473 Akt (P-S473 Akt-myc), Myc, HA, and p110α. Western blotting was repeated with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of membrane-localized myr-p110α is sufficient to trigger downstream signaling events in the absence of growth factors. It is believed that when p110 is directed to the membrane, the increased availability of lipid substrates leads to increased production of PI(3,4,5)P3 and subsequent activation of Akt, even though the enzymatic activity of myr-p110α is no higher than that of wild-type p110α (34Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Google Scholar). We tested whether activated Gαq can inhibit myr-p110α signaling to Akt. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with Akt-Myc in the presence or absence of myr-p110α or HA-Gαq(Q209L). Cells were serumstarved overnight, and extracts were analyzed on a Western blot to detect phospho-Ser473 in Akt-Myc. (Akt-Myc migrated more slowly than wild-type endogenous Akt on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, so the two proteins were well separated on Western blots.) The level of Ser473 phosphorylation was strongly increased in cells expressing myr-p110α, and coexpression of HA-Gαq(Q209L) reduced the phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Consistent with these results, Akt activity in Myc immunoprecipitates was 40% lower in cells expressing both myr-p110α and HA-Gαq(Q209L) than in cells expressing only myr-p110α (Fig. 2A). The blot was reprobed with antibodies to Myc, HA, and p110α to demonstrate that Akt-Myc, HA-Gαq(Q209L), and myr-p110α were appropriately expressed (Fig. 2B, lower three panels). Together, these results suggest that Gαq(Q209L) might have a direct inhibitory effect on PI3K, but not on Akt.Activated GαqInhibits p110α PI3K Activity—To further examine the effect of constitutively active Gαq on PI3K, a stable cell line that expresses untagged Gαq(Q209L) in a doxycycline-responsive manner was constructed using a commercially available system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Flp-in T-REx/HEK 293 cells containing the empty vector (control) or Gαq(Q209L) were treated overnight with 1 μm doxycycline. Western blotting of cell lysates using antibody to Gαq detected the wild-type endogenous protein in control cells and a stronger signal comprising the wild-type and mutant proteins in Gαq(Q209L) cells (Fig. 3A). Cell extracts were mixed with polyclonal antibody to either p110α or p110β, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI3K activity. The activity in p110α immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Gαq(Q209L) was only 39% of that in immunoprecipitates from control cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PI3K activities in p110β immunoprecipitates from control cells and cells expressing Gαq(Q209L) were not significantly different (Fig. 3B). Western blotting showed that expression of the p110α and p110β proteins was the same in control and Gαq(Q209L) cells (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Effect of Gαq(Q209L) on PI3K activity. Flp-in T-REx/HEK 293 cells containing Gαq(Q209L) or empty vector as a control were treated overnight with 1 μm doxycycline prior to making extracts. A, expression of Gαq(Q209L) was confirmed by Western blotting with antibody to Gαq (upper panel). The blot was reprobed with antibodies to p110α (middle panel) and p110β (lower panel). B, PI3K activity was assayed in p110α or p110β immunoprecipitates (IP). The autoradiogram shows a typical result from four independent experiments. Spots containing radioactive PI(3)P were scraped off the silica gel plates and quantitated by scintillation counting. Mean p110α activity in cells expressing Gαq(Q209L) was 39% of the activity in control cells containing the empty vector (S.E. = 2.3%; p < 0."

The earthquakes we have analyzed predominantly reflect tectonic faultingin the brittle lithosphere rather than magma movement associated with volcanic activity. The tectonic earthquakes may be induced on preexisting faults by stresses of magmatic origin, although background stresses from volcano loading and lithospheric flexure may also contribute."

To understand the basis of WS, a number of groups have investigated WRN protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 23Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 491-506Google Scholar). The collective work indicates that WRN interacts functionally with proteins implicated in replication and DNA repair including replication protein A (RPA), p53, Ku, and polymerase δ. These studies have enabled researchers to speculate about pathways of DNA metabolism in which WRN might participate; however, the precise functions of the WRN gene product in vivo are not well understood. Recently we reported a novel interaction of WRN protein with the human 5′-flap endonuclease/5′ to 3′-exonuclease (FEN-1) (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar), a DNA structure-specific nuclease implicated in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (25Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Google Scholar). WRN protein stimulates FEN-1 cleavage activity by a physical interaction with a COOH-terminal domain of the WRN protein (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). Another member of the RAD2 family to which FEN-1 belongs is human exonuclease 1 (EXO-1) (26Wilson D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Google Scholar). Like FEN-1, EXO-1 is a structure-specific endonuclease as well as an exonuclease (27Lee B.I. Wilson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37763-37769Google Scholar, 28Tran P.T. Erdeniz N. Dudley S. Liskay R.M. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 895-912Google Scholar). EXO-1 has been implicated in a number of DNA metabolic pathways including mismatch correction, mitotic and meiotic recombination, and double strand break repair (29Fiorentini P. Huang K.N.

Westmoreland J.W. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2002; 160: 49-62Google Scholar). A role for EXO-1 in Okazaki fragment processing during DNA replication has been suggested based on its structure-specific endonuclease and RNase H activities that are similar to those of FEN-1 (30Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Google Scholar). Functional overlap between EXO-1 and FEN-1 (Rad27 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been proposed from observations in yeast that exoI: rad27 double mutants are inviable (35Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Google Scholar) and that overexpression of yeast EXO-1 or human EXO-1 complements cellular phenotypes of rad27 mutants (30Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Google Scholar, 35Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The evident sequence homology and similar biochemical activities of EXO-1 and FEN-1, as well as the potential functional redundancy of the two nucleases, suggested to us that WRN might also interact functionally with EXO-1. We have found this to be the case. Evidence is presented that WRN interacts physically with human EXO-1 and stimulates the endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavage activities of EXO-1. The functional interaction is independent of WRN catalytic function and mediated by a COOH-terminal region of WRN which also interacts with FEN-1. Thus, WRN modulates the cleavage activities of both human EXO-1 and FEN-1 by a direct protein interaction, suggesting that either structure-specific nuclease may act together with WRN during DNA replication, recombination, or repair. The physical and functional interaction of WRN with these human nucleases is likely to be important for the cellular role of WRN in the maintenance of genome integrity. Proteins—Hexahistidine-tagged recombinant human EXO-1 protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/insect system and purified as described elsewhere. 2L. A. Uzdilla, J. P. Carney, P. Hungspreugs, D. M. Wilson, and T. M. Wilson, manuscript in preparation. The purified EXO-1 protein was judged to be >97% pure from analysis on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 2A). Baculovirus constructs for full-length recombinant hexahistidine-tagged WRN proteins (wild-type, WRN-K577M, WRN-E84A) or a truncated version of WRN containing only the amino-terminal 368 amino acids of the protein (designated N-WRN1–368) were kindly provided by Drs. M. Gray (University of Washington, Seattle) and J. Campisi (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA). Amplified WRN-encoding baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells for overexpression of WRN protein as described elsewhere (37Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Google Scholar). A recombinant hexahistidine-tagged carboxyl-terminal fragment of WRN (residues 940–1432, designated C-WRN940–1432) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (38Cooper M.P.

Kenny (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). WRN-EXO-1 Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation, HeLa nuclear extract (1.5 mg of protein) was incubated with goat anti-WRN polyclonal antibody (1:40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in buffer D (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C and tumbled with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed three times with buffer D supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were eluted by boiling treatment in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 8% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed using rabbit polyclonal antibody against a recombinant human EXO-1 nuclease domain fragment characterized previously (27Lee B.I. Wilson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37763-37769Google Scholar) (1:5,000; courtesy of Dr. D. M. Wilson III (NIA, NIH)) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or probed for WRN using mouse anti-WRN monoclonal antibody (1:250; BD Pharmingen) followed by goat-anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). EXO-1 or WRN on immunoblot was detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation of purified WRN and EXO-1 was performed in the presence of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). In a 100-μl reaction volume, 500 ng of purified WRN and 500 ng of EXO-1 were incubated with goat anti-WRN polyclonal antibody (1:40) in binding buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein complex was adsorbed on to protein G-agarose beads by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling with SDS sample buffer, and resolved on 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels. After transferring the proteins to PVDF membranes, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with either anti-EXO-1 or anti-WRN antibodies as described above. Far Western Blotting—Far Western blotting was conducted as described previously (40Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 0.2–1.0 μg of each protein was electrophoresed on 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and processed as described previously (40Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K.

Membranes were washed, and conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of EXO-1 using rabbit anti-EXO-1 polyclonal antibody (described above) (1:5,000). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected using ECL Plus. Oligonucleotide Substrates—PAGE-purified oligonucleotides (Midland Certified Reagent Co.) (Table I) were used for preparation of substrates. Substrates were prepared as described previously (41Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 pmol of the appropriate flap oligonucleotide was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using the manufacturer's protocol. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was annealed to 25 pmol of the appropriate template oligonucleotide by heating at 95 °C, then cooling down from 70 to 24 °C. If necessary, 50 pmol of an upstream oligonucleotide was then annealed to the duplex substrate by heating at 37 °C for 1 h and slowly cooling to 24 °C. Two nicked duplex substrates were prepared: 1) nicked duplex A using FLAP00A, TSTEM, and U25; and 2) nicked duplex B using FLAP00B, TSTEM2, and U21. The monodeoxynucleotide (nt) flap was prepared with FLAP01, TSTEM, and U25. For the monoribodeoxynucleotide flap, FLAP01RNA, TSTEM, and U25 were used. The 10-nt flap was created with FLAP10, TSTEM2, and U21. The blunt ended duplex substrate was made using TSTEM-COMP and TSTEM.Table IOligonucleotide sequences for DNA substrates (5′ to 3′)TemplateLengthSequencentTSTEM44GCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGTSTEM242CCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGCTAGCGGGGATCCTCTAFlapsFLAP00A19GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCFLAP00B21TACCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGFLAP0120AGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCFLAP01RNA20AGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCFLAP1031ATTGGTTATTTACCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGPrimersTSTEMCOMP44CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCU2121TAGAGGATCCCCGCTAGCGGGU2424CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACU2525CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACC Open table in a new tab For the nicked duplex substrate with a 3′-end label on the upstream primer, 10 pmol of U24 was annealed to 25 pmol of TSTEM and end labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) at 25 °C for 20 min followed by an additional incubation for 20 min at 25 °C with 50 μm unlabeled dCTP. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by passing over two Sephadex G-25 columns. Klenow was then heat inactivated at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to permit the oligonucleotides to reanneal. 50 pmol of FLAP00 was then added and annealed by heating at 37 °C for 1 h followed by slow cooling. EXO-1 Incision Assay—20-μl reactions contained 0.5 nm DNA substrate (unless otherwise noted) and the indicated concentrations of WRN and/or EXO-1 in 30 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 8 mm MgCl2. WRN was mixed with the substrate on ice prior to the addition of EXO-1. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (unless indicated otherwise), terminated with the addition of 10 μl of formamide dye (80% formamide (v/v), 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol), and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. A PhosphorImager was used for detection, and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) was used for quantitation of the reaction products. The percent incision was calculated as described previously (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). WRN Helicase Assay—20-μl reactions contained 0.5 nm 10-nt 5′-flap DNA substrate (except where indicated) and the indicated concentrations of WRN and/or EXO-1 in the same reaction buffer as used for EXO-1 incision assays except for the additional presence of 2 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, terminated with the addition of 20 μl of helicase stop solution (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using the ImageQuant software. The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated as described previously (42Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Google Scholar). Physical Interaction between WRN and EXO-1—The previously reported physical interaction between WRN and FEN-1 (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar) suggested to us that EXO-1, a RAD2 family member and structure-specific nuclease like FEN-1 (27Lee B.I. Wilson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37763-37769Google Scholar, 28Tran P.T. Erdeniz N. Dudley S. Liskay R.M. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 895-912Google Scholar), might interact directly with WRN. To explore this possibility, we tested for the coimmunoprecipitation of WRN and EXO-1 from human nuclear extracts (Fig. 1). Using 200 μg of protein from HeLa nuclear extract, we detected EXO-1 (Fig. 1, lane 1) that comigrated with the purified recombinant human EXO-1 used in this study (Fig. 1, lane 4) by Western blot analysis. An antibody directed against WRN protein reproducibly immunoprecipitated EXO-1 from 1.5 mg of HeLa nuclear extract as detected by Western blot with an anti-EXO-1 antibody (Fig. 1, lane 2). The immunoprecipitation of WRN from HeLa nuclear extract with anti-WRN antibody was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-WRN antibody (data not shown). Preimmune IgG failed to precipitate either EXO-1 (lane 3) or WRN (data not shown) in control experiments. These results provide evidence that WRN and EXO-1 are associated with each other in human nuclei, suggesting that the two proteins may physically interact with each other. To explore the specificity and nature of the suggested WRN-EXO-1 interaction, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the purified recombinant proteins. Using an antibody directed against WRN, both WRN and EXO-1 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 5). WRN and EXO-1 were also coimmunoprecipitated in the presence of ethidium bromide confirming that the protein interaction is not mediated through DNA (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 6). Approximately 20% of the input EXO-1 protein was precipitated by the WRN antibody. The purified proteins failed to be immunoprecipitated by goat preimmune serum (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 4) or in the absence of antibody (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 2). In control experiments, EXO-1 failed to be immunoprecipitated by anti-WRN antibody when WRN protein was omitted from the binding mixture (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 3), attesting to the specificity of the WRN antibody used for the coimmunoprecipitation studies. These results indicate a direct physical interaction between WRN and EXO-1 and support the evidence that WRN and EXO-1 interact with each other in vivo. We next sought to determine whether the COOH-terminal region of WRN responsible for the physical and functional interaction with FEN-1 also interacted physically with EXO-1. To test for this interaction, we performed far Western blotting experiments. For these studies, we tested the ability of full-length WRN protein, a COOH-terminal fragment of WRN (C-WRN940–1432), and an NH2-terminal fragment of WRN (N-WRN1–368) to bind EXO-1. These proteins are shown in a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig. 2A. The proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes that were subsequently blocked, incubated in buffer alone or buffer containing EXO-1, and washed extensively. The blots were then probed with an antibody against EXO-1. As shown in Fig. 2B, EXO-1 bound to full-length WRN and the COOH-terminal fragment of WRN (lanes 1 and 2) but did not bind to the NH2-terminal fragment of WRN (lane 3). In the control experiment, when a similar membrane was incubated with buffer lacking EXO-1 and probed with anti-EXO-1 antibody, no bands corresponding to the position of full-length WRN, COOH-terminal or NH2-terminal WRN were detected (Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 2, and 3). In control experiments, two faint bands (fast and slow migrating) were detected in lane 4 containing bovine serum albumin, but this signal was caused by nonspecific reactivity of the EXO-1 antibody, as these bands were also detected on membranes that were incubated in the presence or absence of EXO-1 protein. These results together with the immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that WRN and EXO-1 interact physically and that the COOH-terminal region of the WRN protein alone is capable of binding to EXO-1. WRN Stimulates EXO-1 Cleavage of a 1-Nucleotide 5′-Flap Substrate—The physical interaction between WRN and EXO-1 and the ability of WRN to stimulate FEN-1 cleavage by a protein interaction (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar) suggested that WRN might stimulate the incision activities of human EXO-1. Under the same reaction conditions, a 1-nt 5′-flap substrate was susceptible to EXO-1 cleavage that generated the 1-nt product (Fig. 3A, lane 2), whereas FEN-1 cleavage of the same substrate resulted primarily in the 2 nt product, and to a lesser extent the 1-nt product (Fig. 3A, lane 6), consistent with previous observations (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). In the presence of WRN (4 nm), both EXO-1 and FEN-1 cleavage reactions were stimulated to yield the same respective cleavage products (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 7). Using a limiting concentration of EXO-1 (0.125 nm), the cleavage reaction was stimulated 8-fold by 8 nm WRN (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6, and 3C). Using a 2-fold higher concentration of EXO-1 (0.25 nm), 10% of the DNA substrate was cleaved (Fig. 3B, lane 8, and 3C). At this EXO-1 level, WRN stimulated EXO-1 cleavage to 43% of the substrate incised (Fig. 3B, lane 9, and 3C). In comparison, 0.25 nm EXO-1 did not appreciably incise the 5′-32P end-labeled blunt duplex 44-bp substrate, and the presence of 8 nm WRN resulted in only a small stimulation of incision activity (∼1.5%) using 0.25 nm EXO-1; however, at a higher concentration of EXO-1 (1 nm), the blunt duplex DNA substrate was degraded from its 5′-end, and the EXO-1 reaction was stimulated by WRN in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These results indicate that EXO-1 incision at the internally positioned 1-nt flap was primarily responsible for the removal of the unpaired nucleotide rather than 5′ to 3′-exonuclease digestion from the end of the blunt duplex substrate. WRN stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage of the 1-nt flap substrate was also observed in reactions containing 0.5 nm EXO-1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 10 and 11), although the level of stimulation was not as great because a plateau of incision activity (55%) was approached in the reactions containing EXO-1 and WRN (Fig. 3C). 8 nm WRN alone did not catalyze significant cleavage of the 1-nt flap DNA substrate (Fig. 3B, lane 12), consistent with previous observations (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). We also observed a significant stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage of a single ribonucleotide 5′-flap substrate in the presence of WRN using a limiting amount of EXO-1 (0.125 nm). 3S. Sharma, J. A. Sommers, H. C. Driscoll, L. Uzdilla, T. M. Wilson, and R. M. Brosh, Jr., unpublished data. We subsequently studied EXO-1 cleavage as a function of WRN concentration. A limiting amount of EXO-1 (0.125 nm) was used such that cleavage of the 1-nt flap substrate was very low (∼3%) (Fig. 3D). A 3-fold stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage was detected at a WRN concentration of 2 nm (Fig. 3D). In the presence of 4 nm WRN, EXO-1 cleavage increased to 22% incision (Fig. 3D), a 7-fold stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage in the 15-min incubation. At 8 nm WRN, product formation began to plateau at ∼30% (Fig. 3D). Kinetic analysis of the EXO-1 cleavage reaction on the 1-nt 5′-flap DNA substrate demonstrated that the presence of WRN profoundly affected the rate of EXO-1 incision (Fig. 4). In these studies, we used a concentration of WRN (8 nm) which was previously determined to achieve maximal stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage (Fig. 3D). The concentration of EXO-1 (0.125 nm) used resulted in a low, but reproducibly detectable incision of ∼2% of the 0.5 nm DNA substrate in a 15-min reaction in the absence of WRN (Fig. 3D). Stimulation of EXO-1 incision by WRN was detected at time points as short as 1–2 min (Fig. 4). Up to 9 min, EXO-1 cleavage in the absence of WRN was ∼1%; however, in the presence of WRN, EXO-1 incised 19% of the DNA substrate at the 9 min time point. Regression analysis of the linear regions of the slopes yielded reaction rates of 25.9 and 0.7 pmol of product/min for the WRN + EXO-1 and EXO-1 reactions, respectively. This difference represented a 37-fold increase in the rate of EXO-1 cleavage when WRN is present. At 15 min, the EXO-1 cleavage reaction conducted in the presence of WRN achieved a plateau of ∼28% substrate incised. In contrast, EXO-1 alone cleaved only 1.5% of the substrate by the end of 15 min. These results demonstrate conclusively that WRN stimulates the rate of EXO-1 cleavage. Catalytic Activities of WRN Are Not Required for Stimulation of EXO-1 Incision—Our previous work demonstrated that a protein domain of WRN, devoid of catalytic activities and which interacts physically with FEN-1, mediated the functional interaction between WRN and FEN-1 (24Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). However, it was conceivable that WRN might affect the cleavage activity of EXO-1 by a mechanism distinct from that of the WRN-FEN-1 interaction. The three catalytic activities of WRN (ATPase, helicase, exonuclease) might influence the functional interaction with EXO-1. To address this possibility, we tested the effects of full-length recombinant WRN proteins with site-directed mutations in the active sites of its catalytic domains on EXO-1 cleavage. WRN-K577M mutant protein, devoid of ATPase or helicase activity (18Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat.

A rise in temperature from 30 to 37 °C was found to result in both a higher expression and an increased cytoplasmic localization of its regulatory subunit Bcy1. Both of these effects required phosphorylation of serines located in its localization domain. Surprisingly, classic cAPK-controlled processes were found to be independent of Bcy1 phosphorylation, indicating that these modifications do not affect cAPK activity as such. Alternatively, phosphorylation may recruit cAPK to, and thereby control, a specific subset of (perhaps novel) cAPK targets that are presumably localized extranuclearly. Zds1 and Zds2 may play a role in this process, since these were found required to retain hyperphosphorylated Bcy1 in the cytoplasm at 37 °C. Mck1, a homologue of mammalian glycogen synthase kinase 3 and a downstream component of the heat-activated Pkc1-Slt2/Mpk1 cell wall integrity pathway, is partly responsible for hyperphosphorylations of Bcy1. Remarkably, Zds1 appears to act as a negative regulator of cell wall integrity signaling, and this activity is dependent in part on the phosphorylation status of Bcy1. Thus, Mck1 phosphorylation of Bcy1 and Zds1 may constitute an unprecedented negative feedback control on the cell wall integrity-signaling pathway.

Thus, Mck1 phosphorylation of Bcy1 and Zds1 may constitute an unprecedented negative feedback control on the cell wall integrity-signaling pathway. In eukaryotes from yeast to humans, cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AKAP, protein kinase A anchor protein; GSK3, glycogen synthase 3; SC, synthetic complete; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. are ubiquitous signaling proteins. A structural characteristic of cAPKs is that the regulatory and catalytic activities are not covalently linked but are represented by two different subunits. The inactive cAPK holoenzyme consists of a regulatory (R) subunit homodimer with two catalytic subunits associated to it. Binding of the second messenger cAMP to the R-dimer leads to dissociation of the holoenzyme, and the released catalytic subunits are then able to phosphorylate protein substrates at serine or threonine residues comprising a defined consensus sequence. cAPK recognition sequences, however, are of low complexity and therefore insufficient to poise proteins as specific cAPK substrates. Moreover, in a single cell, cAPK can participate in several parallel pathways that control the phosphorylation status of specific substrates in response to different triggers. Compartmentalization of signaling molecules provides an important level of control to achieve additional signaling specificity. In multicellular organisms, protein kinase A anchor proteins (AKAPs) have been identified that target cAPK holoenzymes to specific subcellular locations (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Google Scholar and references therein). These AKAPs function as adapters; one domain associates with an AKAP-binding surface created by dimerization of the R-subunit, whereas another distinct domain interacts with a cellular structure or organelle. AKAP-mediated targeting of cAPK is thought to confer spatio-temporal control of cAPK signaling in order to phosphorylate substrates specifically. In the unicellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cAPK is responsive to fermentable carbon sources. The addition of glucose or sucrose to cells growing on a nonfermentable carbon source results in a transient increase in the cAMP level (2Purwin C. Leidig F. Holzer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1482-1489Google Scholar) and thus (supposedly) of cAPK activity. cAPK controls a multitude of processes involved in growth, metabolism, cell cycle progression, aging, differentiation, and stress resistance (reviewed in Ref. 3Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Google Scholar). Considering the wide variety of cAPK-controlled effectors in one single cell, it seems likely that subcellular targeting of cAPK, like in multicellular organisms, may contribute to signal specificity. In budding yeast, localization of cAPK depends on the growth conditions (4Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar, 5Griffioen G. Anghileri P. Imre E. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1449-1456Google Scholar). In cells growing rapidly on glucose, the cAPK holoenzyme is found almost exclusively nuclear, whereas, in respiring or in stationary phase cells, Bcy1 is more evenly distributed over both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Phosphorylation of serine residues organized in two different clusters in its N-terminal localization domain are required for cytoplasmic localization of Bcy1 in glucose-starved cells. These phosphorylations appear to be dependent to a large extent on Yak1, a protein kinase whose localization is regulated by glucose availability (6Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Google Scholar). Although yeast cAPKs exhibit a strong evolutionary conservation, no classical AKAPs have been identified so far in unicellular organisms (recently discussed in Ref. 7Griffioen G. Thevelein J.M. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 199-207Google Scholar). In budding yeast, however, Zds1 was found to have properties that are reminiscent of AKAPs. First, in a two-hybrid approach, Zds1 was shown to interact with the localization domain of Bcy1, and second, Zds1 appeared to affect the localization of cAPK in glucose-deprived cells (4Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar). Although these data imply that Zds1 is a functional AKAP homologue, no physiologically relevant function of a presumptive Zds1-Bcy1 interaction has been reported, and this is one of the topics of the present study. Zds1 and its partially redundant homologue Zds2 have been isolated in numerous genetic screens, reflecting diverse roles in the cell. Perhaps the best characterized function so far is their role in cell cycle progression. Deletion of ZDS1 results in a prolonged G2 phase of the cell cycle, most likely a direct consequence of high constitutive levels of Swe1 (8Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Google Scholar, 9Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Google Scholar), a negative regulator of the G2 form of yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 (10Sia R.A. Herald H.A. Lew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1657-1666Google Scholar, 11McMillan J.N. Sia R.A. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5981-5990Google Scholar, 12Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Google Scholar). Moreover, zds1 cells possess extremely elongated buds, and Zds1 is therefore implicated as a negative regulator of polarized growth (13Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Google Scholar, 14Yu Y. Jiang Y.W. Wellinger R.J. Carlson K. Roberts J.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5254-5263Google Scholar). As mentioned above, yeast cAPK antagonizes stress-responsive signaling. However, little is known about a presumptive connection between cAPK and stress-controlled pathways. In this paper, we provide data pointing to a cross-talk between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Slt2/Mpk1 and cAPK. Slt2/Mpk1 is activated by conditions that affect cell wall stability (e.g. heat stress) and is essential for remodeling of the cell wall in order to maintain proper cell shape and integrity (15Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Google Scholar, 16Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Google Scholar, 17Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutants defective in Slt2/Mpk1 activation undergo cell lysis, particularly at elevated temperatures. This effect can be prevented by osmotic stabilization indicating inappropriate cell wall biogenesis in such mutants. Upstream of Slt2/Mpk1, cell surface sensors translate cell wall disturbances into activation of Pkc1 kinase (18Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Google Scholar). Pkc1, in turn, activates a linear MAPK cascade, composed of Bck1 (19Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Google Scholar, 20Costigan C. Gehrung S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1162-1178Google Scholar), a pair of redundant MAPK kinases (Mkk1 and Mkk2) (21Irie K. Takase M. Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Araki H. Matsumoto K. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3076-3083Google Scholar), and finally MAPK Slt2/Mpk1 (22Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Google Scholar). Downstream effectors of Slt2/Mpk1 are Rlm1 (23Watanabe Y. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5740-5749Google Scholar) and SBF1 (Swi4/Swi6) (24Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Google Scholar), two transcription factors that activate genes involved in cell wall biogenesis (25Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Google Scholar) and cell cycle progression, respectively. Moreover, expression of MCK1, encoding a yeast homologue of mammalian glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3), is induced by Slt2/Mpk1 (26Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyaoka R. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1074-1085Google Scholar). Remarkably, these studies indicated an interaction between yeast Gsk3 signaling and Zds1. Deletion of SLT2/MPK1, BCK1, or MCK1 in a background were ZDS1 is deleted suppresses an otherwise severe G2 delay of the cell cycle. Here we show that Zds1 may act as a negative regulator of Slt2/Mpk1-Mck1 signaling. Our results suggest a negative feedback control in which Mck1 activates Zds1 by a mechanism that depends on Mck1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcy1.

All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in sterile water, and the pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™; Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by vortexing for 5 min in the presence of glass beads. The resulting suspension was spun down in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, and part of the resulting supernatant was taken up in loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The running gel for separation of Bcy1 phosphoisoforms was buffered with 0.19 m Tris-HCl. Immunodetection of proteins was carried out using mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5), rabbit anti-alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast) (Research Diagnostics, Inc.), mouse anti-trehalase polyclonal antibody (generous gift from S. Wera), mouse anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204)E10 monoclonal antibody (New England BioLabs), and goat anti-Slt2/Mpk1(yN-19) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal™ (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatase treatment of protein extracts was carried out with λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells for fluorescence microscopy were used directly without fixation. Nuclei were stained by the addition of 5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol to the cell suspension. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Images were taken with a Zeiss Axiocam camera and processed in Adobe Photoshop 5.0.2. Biochemical Determinations—β-Galactosidase activity was assayed essentially as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Trehalose and glycogen content and trehalase activity were determined as described previously (30Pernambuco M.B. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Griffioen G. Mager W.H. Thevelein J.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1775-1782Google Scholar, 31Thevelein J.M. Cauwenberg L. Colombo S. De Winde J.H. Donation M. Dumortier F.

Increased Localization, Phosphorylation, and Expression of Bcy1 in Cells Shifted to a Higher Temperature—Previous studies revealed a carbon source-dependent localization pattern of Bcy1 (4Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar, 5Griffioen G. Anghileri P. Imre E. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1449-1456Google Scholar). We further extended these studies and demonstrated that also a rise in temperature from 30 to 37 °C caused a similar response. Whereas at 30 °C GFP-Bcy1wt was found almost exclusively in the nucleus, transfer of the cells to 37 °C led to a slow and progressive increase in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 1A). Quantification of this effect showed that cytoplasmic GFP-Bcy1wt is detectable within 15 min and reaches a maximum 2 h after the shift to 37 °C (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, the phosphorylation status of Bcy1 after transfer from 30 to 37 °C was determined. Western analysis of heat-stressed cells producing a HA-tagged version of Bcy1 revealed the presence of slower migrating forms of Bcy1 within 15 min, and these isoforms were most dominantly present after about 60–120 min (Fig. 1C). Phosphatase treatment prior to Western analysis of extracts from cells that were grown at 37 °C for 2 h resulted in increased mobility, indicating that the slower migrating bands represent (hyper)phosphorylated Bcy1 (Fig. 1D). Apart from the heat-dependent modification, we also observed an increase in Bcy1 levels after transfer to 37 °C (Fig. 1C). Notably, the kinetics of cytoplasmic localization, the appearance of Bcy1 isoforms, and the increase in Bcy1 expression closely correlated, implying a causal relation between these effects (see below). Serine Residues Located in the Bcy1 Targeting Domain Are Required for Heat Stress-induced Phosphorylation and Consequently for Efficient Expression and Cytoplasmic Localization—In previous studies, two serine-rich clusters in the Bcy1 localization domain were identified that are required for carbon source-dependent phosphorylation. To test whether these serines are also subjected to heat stress-induced phosphorylation, we studied migration, expression, and localization of Bcy1 versions bearing substitutions of these residues to alanines. Western analysis showed that replacement of cluster I serines to alanines (Bcy1(S cI A)) reduced to a large extent the formation of slower migrating isoforms (upper and middle panels of Fig. 2A). Remarkably, substitution of cluster II serines (Bcy1(S cII A)) resulted for unknown reasons in a faster mobility relative to wild type Bcy1 irrespective of the temperature and thus clearly is not the consequence of temperature-dependent phosphorylation differences. Nonetheless, all isoforms detectable at 37 °C migrated (unlike wild type Bcy1) with equal or faster mobility compared with the situation at 30 °C, although the effects are undoubtedly less pronounced compared with the cluster I replacements. Finally, Bcy1(S cI+cII A) displayed a dramatically increased migration relative to wild type. Altogether, we conclude that both serine-rich clusters are required for proper Bcy1 phosphorylation after heat stress. Note that even in the case when both clusters of serines are substituted, an isoform was still detectable, possibly representing autophosphorylation of Ser145 (32Werner-Washburne M. Brown D. Braun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19704-19709Google Scholar). These experiments also revealed that the intracellular levels of Bcy1(S cI A) and Bcy1(S cI+cII A) were extremely low, raising the possibility that phosphorylation of the serines comprising cluster I are important for proper expression of BCY1. To gain more support for this hypothesis, we studied whether mimicking constitutive phosphorylation by introduction of negatively charged residues (aspartic acid) at these positions is sufficient to obtain normal levels of intracellular Bcy1. Western analysis revealed that the levels of HA-Bcy1(S cI D) and HA-Bcy1(S cI+cII D), but not of Bcy1(S cI A) and Bcy1(S cI+cII A), were similar to HA-Bcy1wt (Fig. 2B), indeed suggesting that phosphorylation of the corresponding serines is required for appropriate expression of BCY1. To determine whether these phosphorylations affect the subcellular localization, we performed fluorescence microscopy of yeast cells producing these Bcy1 substitution mutants fused with GFP (Fig. 2C). This analysis revealed that replacement of the serines comprising both clusters with alanines led to a relatively high nuclear localization at 37 °C. As has been noted before (4Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar), the subcellular distribution of GFP-Bcy1 in different cells in a culture is not uniform. We therefore quantified the effects on localization of individual cells of each culture (Fig. 2D). This showed that both clusters independently promote cytoplasmic localization. In conclusion, both clusters of serines are subjected to heat stress-instigated phosphorylation, and these phosphorylations are required for efficient cytoplasmic localization. Moreover, phosphorylation of cluster I serines affects expression of Bcy1. Note that expression of Bcy1(S cI A) is also low at 30 °C compared with wild type Bcy1, indicating that even in unstressed cells at least some phosphorylation seems to be required for maintaining appropriate levels of Bcy1. Yeast GSK3s Are Required for Temperature-dependent Phosphorylation of Bcy1—In order to gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of heat-induced phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of Bcy1, we followed these parameters in yeast mutants bearing one or more deletions of genes that encode kinases. In previous studies, Yak1 kinase was found to be required for cytoplasmic localization of Bcy1 in glucosedeprived cells. However, in yak1 cells grown at 37 °C, cytoplasmic targeting of GFP-Bcy1wt was not affected detectably, suggesting that this kinase is not important for temperature-dependent Bcy1 localization. In vitro studies (33Hemmings B.A. Aitken A. Cohen P. Rymond M. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 473-481Google Scholar) demonstrated that GSK3 can phosphorylate RII, the mammalian homologue of Bcy1. In yeast, four closely related genes, RIM11, MCK1, MRK1, and open reading frame YOL128c (we propose to name open reading frame YOL128c as YGK3 (for yeast homologue of glycogen synthase kinase 3) have been identified that encode yeast homologues of mammalian GSK3 (34Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Google Scholar). As a first semiquantitative test of whether yeast GSK3 might control phosphorylation (and consequently localization) of Bcy1, we determined the subcellular distribution of GFP-Bcy1wt at 30 and 37 °C in gsk3 mutants. As expected, microscopic analysis revealed that GFP-Bcy1 is almost exclusively nuclear in both wild type and gsk3 mutant cells when grown at 30 °C (data not shown). At 37 °C, however, in mck1, mrk1, and ygk3, but not in rim11 cells, GFP-Bcy1wt remained more concentrated in the nucleus compared with wild type cells. (Fig. 3, A and B). No additive effect on the extent of nuclear accumulation was detectable in this assay in the double or triple gsk3 mutant cells. However, it should be noted that a microscopic analysis such as performed here does not allow a comparison of the GFP-Bcy1 levels in cytoplasm or nucleus between the different mutants, although BCY1 expression might also be dependent on phosphorylation (Fig. 2). These data revealed that Mck1, Mrk1, and Ygk3, but not Rim11, are required (in a redundant fashion) for cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Bcy1 in heat-stressed cells, thus raising the possibility that these kinases play a role in Bcy1 phosphorylation. To study more directly a function of Mck1, Mrk1, and Ygk3 in Bcy1 phosphorylation, we followed HA-Bcy1wt mobility in the corresponding gsk3 mutants before and after heat shock (Fig. 3C). Western analysis revealed that some of the slower migrating heat stress-induced isoforms of HA-Bcy1wt are absent in mck1 cells. This effect, although somewhat less pronounced, is also observed when using an mrk1 ygk3 deletion strain (in the corresponding single mutants no migration differences could be observed; data not shown). In the triple gsk3 deletion strain, mobility of HA-Bcy1wt appeared to be most dramatically affected. These results show that Mck1, Mrk1, and Ygk3 are required to various degrees for Bcy1 phosphorylation after heat shock. Mck1, however, appears to be most prominently involved in this process. It should be mentioned that even in the mck1 mrk1 ygk3 strain, modification is not completely absent, indicating that kinases other then yeast GSK3 may also promote phosphorylation at 37 °C. Previous studies indicated that Slt2/Mpk1 upon activation by Ca2+ leads to increased Mck1 activity (26Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyaoka R. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1074-1085Google Scholar). Since Mck1 is required for heat-instigated phosphorylation of Bcy1, we studied whether the addition of Ca2+ is sufficient for Bcy1 phosphorylation and to what extent this depends on Mck1, Mrk1, and Ygk3. Western analysis of extracts from gsk3 strains showed that the addition of 0.15 m CaCl2 led to the formation of slower migrating HA-Bcy1wt, and this effect appears to require mainly Mck1 (Fig. 3D). This result further corroborates a function of this kinase in Bcy1 phosphorylation. In the mrk1 ygk3 strain, no mobility differences are observed, excluding them from a dominant role in Ca2+-instigated modification of Bcy1. We addressed the question of whether defectiv"

Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar). HS chains are heterogeneous, with a large number of complex sequences based on variable patterns of N-acetyl, N-sulfate, and O-sulfate groups (2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

The biosynthesis of the polysaccharide chains begins with the synthesis of an oligosaccharide primer co-valently attached to a serine residue in a proteoglycan protein core. HS chains are then generated by the sequential addition of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and d-glucuronate (GlcUA). Along with polymerization the chains undergo a series of modification steps that involve five distinct enzyme families; (i) N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase removes the N-acetyl group from GlcNAc units and replaces it with an N-sulfate group (GlcNS); (ii) GlcUA C5 epimerase converts GlcUA to its C5 epimer l-iduronate (IdoUA); (iii) 2-O-sulfotransferase adds 2-O-sulfate groups to IdoUA and GlcUA residues; (iv) 6-O-sulfotransferase (6-OST), and (v) 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) transfer O-sulfate groups to C6 and C3, respectively, of GlcNAc or GlcNS units (2Lindahl U.

During enzymatic HS modification, only parts of the available target units are modified. As a result the final product shows high structural diversity. The factors that regulate HS biosynthesis remain unclear. Different models for HS biosynthesis have been proposed. One model features an association of all or several of the biosynthetic enzymes in a complex (“gagosome”) that subjects the nascent polysaccharide to consecutive modifications in assembly line fashion (4Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Google Scholar, 17Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Google Scholar). Other proposals predict that the modifications of the HS chain occur by random encounters between the enzymes and the polysaccharide (see Refs. 2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Google Scholar and 3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar for recent reviews). The overall process thus may depend on spatial arrangement (former model) as well as on individual concentrations of the biosynthetic enzymes (latter model). Importantly, in either model the activities of the enzymes would depend on the respective kcat/Kmsaccharide values for all different substrate motifs encountered. The determination of substrate specificities for enzymes involved in HS biosynthesis is complicated by the lack of well defined substrates. Most kinetic parameters determined so far are based on more or less heterogeneous saccharide mixtures. Nevertheless, such analyses have provided information regarding the preferred disaccharide target units of 6-OSTs in heterogeneous substrate populations (9Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Google Scholar), but little data on the influence of flanking disaccharide units. Addressing this question requires access to well defined oligosaccharides of the appropriate structures. In a previous paper (18Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Google Scholar) we described chemically and enzymatically generated 3H-labeled HS-related oligosaccharide libraries, which were used to assess structure-affinity relationships in fibroblast growth factor-HS interactions. We now explore this concept further, by using purified oligosaccharides isolated from a 3H-end labeled octasaccharide library to study the substrate specificity of 6-OST. The library was designed to sample the 2-O-/N-sulfated segment of the HS sequence space, thus assessing the impact of IdoUA 2-O-sulfate groups on the catalytic activity of 6-OST. The technique used in this study provides a general approach to defining the substrate preferences of glycosaminoglycan-metabolizing enzymes. Preparation of 6-O-Desulfated Octasaccharide Substrates—All reagents were commercial products of high purity unless otherwise indicated. Bovine lung heparin (Upjohn) was N- and partially O-desulfated by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (9:1, v/v) for 2 h (19Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Google Scholar, 20Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Google Scholar). The polysaccharide was then re-N-sulfated by incubation with trimethylamine sulfur trioxide (21Levy L. Petracek F.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 190: 901-905Google Scholar). The completely 6-O-desulfated partially 2-O-desulfated heparin was subjected to partial deaminative cleavage using nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (22Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Google Scholar). Approximately 1 mg of O-desulfated heparin was dissolved in 250 μl of 2.5 mm NaNO2, 70 mm H2SO4 and incubated on ice. After 70 min, 80 μl of the reaction mixture, and after 3 h the remaining 170 μl were adjusted to pH ∼ 8 by addition of 4 m NaOH. The oligosaccharide fragments formed were reduced with NaB3H4 (5 mCi, 64 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), to yield reducing terminal 3H-labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol (aManR) residues, followed by reaction with excess unlabeled NaBH4. The labeled O-desulfated heparin oligosaccharides were desalted and lyophilized and were then size fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) column (10 × 1500 mm) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/h. Octasaccharides were recovered, lyophilized, and further separated on a ProPac PA1 anion exchange HPLC column (Dionex, Surrey, UK) using a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, pH 3.0, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Elution profiles were monitored by scintillation counting and the central fractions from distinct peaks were pooled and desalted on PD-10 gel filtration columns (Sephadex G-25) (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting purified octasaccharide preparations were subjected to sequence analysis using a combination of chemical (HNO2) and enzymatic (iduronate 2-sulfatase) cleavage as described previously (18Jemth P.

Expression of 6-OST2 and 6-OST3 in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Cells—A full-length mouse cDNA clone coding for 6-OST2 was amplified from an adult mouse brain QUICK-Clone cDNA library (Clontech) using the sense primer 5′-CATGGATGAGAAATCTAACAA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AGCGCCATGTCTCTACG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). Insertion of the entire coding region for 6-OST2 was confirmed by sequence analysis. The insert was excised with ApaI/SalI and subcloned into the corresponding site of the Bluescript plasmid vector. The mouse 6-OST2 cDNA was then released from the plasmid vector as a KpnI/EcoRI fragment and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), thus creating a stop codon at the 3′-end of the construct. To generate an expression plasmid for mouse 6-OST3 in pcDNA3, pFLAG-CMV2-mHS6ST3 (9Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Google Scholar) was cleaved with HindIII/XbaI and the produced 6-OST3 cDNA was ligated into corresponding sites in pcDNA3. The expression plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell clones expressing the 6-OST2 or -3, and control clones transfected with vector alone, were selected as described (26Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 463-468Google Scholar). Cells were cultured under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml, 100 units of penicillin G/ml, and 400 μg of Geneticin/ml (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen). Enzymatic 6-O-Sulfation of Octasaccharides—Crude enzyme preparations from 6-OST2- or 6-OST3-transfected cells were extracted from stably transfected cell clones as described (16Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5548-5555Google Scholar). Lysates (corresponding to approximately 20 μg of protein) from 6-OST2- or 6-OST3-transfected cells were incubated with 0.1–2 μm octasaccharide, 5 mm PAPS, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.5 μm NaF, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 25 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time (1 min to overnight), depending on the desired degree of 6-O-sulfation and the enzymatic activity. Incubations with microsomal OSTs from a mouse mastocytoma were performed as described (18Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Google Scholar). The reactions were heat inactivated (90 °C for 1 min) and centrifuged, and the supernatants analyzed by anion exchange chromatography using the ProPac PA1 column. The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient, pH 3.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was 10 mm NaCl/ml and the initial concentration of NaCl was adjusted according to the number of O-sulfate groups present in the octasaccharides (see legends to Figs. 1 and 3).Fig. 3Products of 6-OST3-catalyzed O-sulfation.3H-End labeled octasaccharide substrates (see Fig. 2 for symbols) were incubated with PAPS and lysates of 6-OST3-transfected cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting 6-O-sulfated octasaccharide products were analyzed by ProPac PA1 anion exchange chromatography. The arrows indicate the elution positions of substrates before incubation with 6-OST3. Up to three O-sulfate groups were transferred to the oligosaccharide substrates. The NaCl gradients were started at 0.25 m (octasaccharide A), 0.35 m (octasaccharide B), 0.50 m (octasaccharides E), 0.60 m (octasaccharides G), and 0.70 m (octasaccharide H). See “Experimental Procedures” for further details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Determination of Substrate Specificity of 6-OST3 Using Competing Octasaccharide Substrates—The substrate specificity of 6-OST3 for one octasaccharide substrate over another was assessed by incubating two different characterized octasaccharide preparations with 6-OST and PAPS. The reaction conditions were set to allow O-sulfation of ∼2–10% of each of the two octasaccharides (4% (v/v) HEK cell lysate, 5 mm PAPS; reaction time from 1 min up to 30 min at room temperature). Under these conditions (product:substrate ≤ 1:9), product formation was shown to be linear with time, hence giving the respective initial rate, v0. The ratio of these rates (in this case initial rates) gives the substrate specificity according to Equation 1 (27Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar) for substrate Y relative to substrate X. kcat/KMY/kcat/KMX=v0Y[X]/v0X[Y](Eq. 1) [X] and [Y] are the concentrations of the two substrates. Characterization of Octasaccharide Substrate Library—A 3H-labeled, N-sulfated heparin octasaccharide library containing species devoid of 6-O-sulfate groups and with varying degrees of 2-O-sulfation was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These octasaccharides have the general structure [IdoUA ± 2S-GlcNS]3-IdoUA ± 2S-[3H]aManR. Thus, differential 2-O-sulfation of the IdoUA residues can give rise to 16 distinct octasaccharides; one without any 2-O-sulfates, four with one, six with two, four with three, and one with four 2-O-sulfate groups. Accordingly, anion exchange HPLC revealed five oligosaccharide families recognized through sequence analysis and previous analyses of HS and modified heparin octasaccharides (18Jemth P. Kreuger J.

Octasaccharide without O-sulfates was eluted at 0.32 m NaCl and a fragment with four 2-O-sulfate groups at ∼0.78 m, families carrying one, two, or three 2-O-sulfate groups occurring in between. The latter three groups separated into distinct peaks indicating subspecies with distinct 2-O-sulfation motifs. Purified oligosaccharides (see Fig. 1A) were subjected to radiosequencing involving partial nitrous acid depolymerization and iduronate 2-sulfatase digestion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Deduced structures of recovered 8-mers are shown in Fig. 2. The di- and tri-O-sulfated 8-mers could not be completely separated (Fig. 1A), such that each corresponding final substrate preparation was composed of two distinct octasaccharides (that were sequenced in mixture, cf. Refs. 18Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Google Scholar and 25Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L.

Enzymatic 6-O-Sulfation of 3H-Labeled Octasaccharides— The 3H-labeled octasaccharide library was incubated with unlabeled PAPS and, as enzyme source, extracts of either 293 cells expressing 6-OST3 or a microsomal fraction from a heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma. Following incubation with extracts from 6-OST3-transfected cells the octasaccharides assumed overall more retarded elution positions on anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 1B), indicative of 6-O-sulfation. This effect was even more pronounced when the mouse mastocytoma microsomal fraction was used as catalyst 2Previous experiments showed that, under the experimental conditions used, 6-O-sulfation is more readily achieved than 2-O-sulfation using the microsomal fraction as catalyst (18Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Google Scholar). (Fig. 1C). The retarded elution patterns shown in Fig. 1, B and C, suggest that most fragments present in the 2-O-sulfated octasaccharide library were targets for 6-O-sulfation. To further evaluate how 2-O-sulfate groups influence 6-O-sulfation, purified and sequenced octasaccharides with 0 to 4 IdoUA2S units (Fig. 2) were used as substrate for heterologously expressed 6-OST3. Analysis of the products by anion exchange chromatography showed changes in elution positions of the fragments corresponding to the addition of one, two, or three 6-O-sulfate groups (Fig. 3). Thus, all octasaccharides tested, including the tetra-2-O-sulfated fragment, were substrates for the recombinant 6-OST3 and all octasaccharides accepted up to three 6-O-sulfate groups. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using wild type 293 mRNA as template amplified 6-OST1 and 6-OST2S (short form in Ref. 28Habuchi H. Miyake G. Nogami K. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Kusche-Gullberg M. Habuchi O. Tanaka M. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 131-142Google Scholar) cDNAs. No PCR product was observed using primers for 6-OST3, indicating that the 293 cells express 6-OST1 and 6-OST2S mRNA endogenously, as verified by sequencing of the purified PCR fragments (data not shown). The endogenous 6-O-sulfotransferase activity was 10–15-fold lower than that of the overexpressors such that no significant sulfation of the tetra-2-O-sulfated fragment was observed in control incubations performed with cell lysate from vector-transfected cells (data not shown). Positions of Incorporated 6-O-Sulfate Groups—The data in Fig. 3 show that all three N-sulfated glucosamine residues in an octasaccharide are potential acceptors for 6-OST-catalyzed O-sulfation. To determine the preferred site of 6-O-sulfation, purified octasaccharides (see Fig. 2) were incubated with 6-OST3 and PAPS until ∼30–70% of the substrates were consumed. The reaction products were separated by anion exchange HPLC as shown in Fig. 4A for the tri-2-O-sulfated substrate F. The unmodified substrate and the mono-6-O-sulfated product (F and F′, respectively, in Fig. 4A) were purified and subjected to partial deaminative cleavage and the resultant di-, tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides were then again analyzed on the ProPac PA1 column. Note that only fragments containing the terminal [3H]aManR residue will be detected in the cleavage products; i.e. a disaccharide IdoUA ± 2S-[3H]aManR, a tetrasaccharide IdoUA ± 2S-GlcNS-IdoUA ± 2S-[3H]aManR, etc. The elution positions for both disaccharides and tetrasaccharides were identical for substrate F (Fig. 4B) and product F′ (Fig. 4C) indicating that no 6-O-sulfate group had been incorporated on the GlcNS residue closest to the reducing end (in which case the product tetramer would have been retarded, see F′ in Fig. 4D). The elution position of the 8-mer was changed, but also that of the 6-mer, thus excluding 6-O-sulfation of the GlcNS unit closest to the non-reducing end. Instead the internal (middle) GlcNS residue of fragment F, recovered in both the hexa- and the octasaccharide, was the prime acceptor for the first 6-O-sulfate group. Similar results were obtained with all substrates except octasaccharide B, where the first 6-O-sulfate group was found also on the GlcNS unit toward the reducing end (see B′ in Fig. 4D). Substrate Specificities of 6-OSTs—The effects of 2-O-sulfate groups on the substrate preference of 6-OST3 was studied by incubating two distinct 3H-labeled octasaccharides with lysates from 6-OST3-overexpressing HEK 293 cells in the presence of unlabeled PAPS. The initial rate (v0) of the catalyzed transfer of sulfate from PAPS to the octasaccharide acceptors was measured as the amounts of mono-6-O-sulfated products formed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Product formation was linear with time until ∼10% of the substrate was consumed, and then the rate decreased (see Fig. 6). Because all heparin fragments were initially labeled in the same reaction with NaB3H4, the specific 3H activity of the different octasaccharides would be approximately equal (22Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Google Scholar). Thus, the relative concentrations of substrates and products are reflected by the relative 3H peak areas in anion exchange chromatograms (Fig. 5A). Two distinct substrate preparations (Fig. 2) were mixed and incubated with 6-OST3 and PAPS allowing the substrates to compete for access to the active site of the enzyme. The best substrate of the two was identified as the one showing the largest conversion to mono-6-O-sulfated product, taking into account the substrate concentration (Equation 1). For six different combinations of octasaccharide substrates (B + D, B + F, B + G, D + E, E + G, and F + G), the 6-OST3-catalyzed reaction was quenched at different time points and substrates and products were analyzed. For each reaction, initial rates for 6-OST3 toward the two substrates were estimated by fitting linear or exponential equations to data using the inrate program of the SIMFIT package (29Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Results were applied to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) for calculation of relative substrate specificities toward different octamers. Other experiments with two substrates competing for 6-OST3 were conducted for constant periods of time (1–5 independent experiments) under initial rate conditions (i.e. ≤10% substrate consumption, see Fig. 6). Altogether, the results suggest that 2-O-sulfate groups promote the catalytic activity of 6-OST3 (Table I). Di- and tri-2-O-sulfated octamer substrates were favored by 6-OST3 as shown, e.g. by the 3–5-fold increased specificity toward these fragments over the completely O-desulfated octasaccharide A.Fig. 5Examples of experiments used to determine the substrate specificities of 6-OST2 and 6-OST3 for octasaccharides with varying 2-O-sulfation.A, two different octasaccharides, A and G (see Fig. 2), were mixed at similar concentrations, as based on 3H contents. The 6-O-sulfation reaction catalyzed by 6-OST3 was allowed to proceed until ∼5–10% of the respective substrate was consumed. The reaction products formed were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC and the amounts of mono-6-O-sulfated products A′ and G′ formed, measured as the areas of their peaks, were used as estimates of their corresponding initial rates. The sum of substrate and product for the respective fragment was taken as substrate concentration. The relative specificity for the two competing substrates was calculated according to Equation 1. B, the octasaccharides, A and D (see Fig. 2), were mixed and incubated with 6-OST2. The amount of di-6-O-sulfated product D″ formed roughly equals the amount of mono-6-O-sulfated A′. Because the concentration of D′ (the substrate of the reaction giving D″) is lower than the concentration of A, this result suggests that the di-2-O-sulfated octasaccharide D as well as its mono-6-O-sulfated product D′ are both better substrates for 6-OST2 than the O-desulfated octamer A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ISpecificities for competing substrates for 6-OST3 and 6-OST2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab Similar results were obtained for 6-OST2, which likewise displayed a preference for 2-O-sulfated octamers over the fragment devoid of O-sulfates. In these experiments, the reactions were allowed to proceed long enough for di-6-O-sulfated species to emerge from the di-, tri-, and tetra-2-O-sulfated substrates (Fig. 5B). This approach revealed that also the mono-6-O-sulfated di-, tri-, and tetra-2-O-sulfated octamers were better substrates for 6-OST2 than the O-desulfated octasaccharide A. For example, the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5B shows about equal formation of di-6-O-sulfated D″ and mono-6-O-sulfated A′ despite a higher concentration of substrate A than of substrate D′. Moreover, the average time for the production of D″ is shorter than that for formation of A′, because D′ must first be formed from D. The present study demonstrates the use of library-type oligosaccharides in determining substrate specificities of enzymes involved in heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Experiments with competing, well defined, oligosaccharides allow the assessment of relative specificities that define the preferred substrates of the enzymes. We have applied this concept to 6-OSTs that catalyze a late step in biosynthetic polymer modification of HS. Notably, the number and positions of glucosamine 6-O-sulfate groups are important determinants in a variety of biological phenomena (30Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Google Scholar). The 6-O-sulfation reaction is preceded by C5 epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA units, followed by 2-O-sulfation of, in particular, IdoUA units (2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Google Scholar, 3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar, 4Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Google Scholar). In a separate study we have shown that the epimeric configuration of the hexuronate residue directly upstream of the acceptor glucosamine unit influences the substrate preference of the 6-OSTs, an IdoUA residue in this position providing a better acceptor sequence than a GlcUA unit (31Smeds E. Habuchi H. Hjertson E. Grundberg H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 371-380Google Scholar). Because the arrangement of preformed 2-O-sulfate groups on the maturing HS chain might also regulate 6-O-sulfation we studied the substrate specificity of 6-OST3 with regard to distinct octasaccharides with varying degrees and patterns of 2-O-sulfation. The results of these experiments show that 2-O-sulfate groups consistently promote the enzymatic activity of 6-OST3. Octasaccharides with two or more 2-O-sulfate groups were better substrates than octasaccharides with no or only one 2-O-sulfate group. No clear differences in specificity were observed toward substrates of similar charge, suggesting that the mere presence of 2- (and 6-) O-sulfates is more important for substrate discrimination than the exact positions of the sulfates. However, all possible substrates were not tested and we cannot exclude the occurrence of more preferred substrates. Previous work showed that 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA is precluded by 6-O-sulfation of an adjacent GlcN unit (32Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5094-5100Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to note that 6-O-sulfation will readily take place between two 2-O-sulfated IdoUA residues, as demonstrated by sulfation of the tetra-2-O-sulfated substrate H (Fig. 3). The contribution of each 6-OST isoform in generating specific heparan sulfate protein binding sequences is currently not known. Here we have mainly studied the substrate preference of 6-OST3 and to a lesser extent that of 6-OST2. No striking differences were observed in catalytic specificity toward the different octasaccharide substrates. The latter would suggest that distinct complex sequences are unlikely to be formed in vivo by these two enzymes. However, at present it is difficult to assess the significance of the observed differences, because of the paucity of quantitative data for the other biosynthetic enzymes. The most important aspect of the present work is therefore the potential for unbiased comparison of defined saccharide sequences with regard to substrate specificity, which should generate a more detailed understanding of HS biosynthesis as other enzymes and substrates are studied. This development was enabled through the use of the library-based saccharide substrates (pending access to purely synthetic analogs of authentic saccharide structures). In principle, a similar approach should be feasible in studies of a variety of polymer-modifying enzymes. The present work relied on the ability to elucidate the structures of octasaccharide substrates and products. Unfortunately, current sequencing methodology is not readily adapted to physiologically more relevant substrates, because HS oligosaccharides longer than octa/decamers are not easily sequenced. Still, octasaccharide substrates are most probably relevant from an enzymatic point-of-view. There is no crystal structure available for any of the HS O-sulfotransferases, but the structure for the homologous N-sulfotransferase domain of an N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, involved in HS biosynthesis, has been described (33Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Google Scholar). Whereas the sequence similarity between this domain and soluble sulfotransferases such as estrogen and hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase is low their crystal structures are similar (34Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 149-157Google Scholar), and it is thus unlikely that the structures of the 6-OSTs would differ markedly from that of the N-sulfotransferase domain. A homology model of HS 3-O-sulfotransferase based on this N-sulfotransferase structure (35Raman R. Myette J. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1214-1219Google Scholar) underscores the structural similarities of the HS sulfotransferases. The cleft that binds the polysaccharide substrate can contain a hexasaccharide according to the crystal structure of the N-sulfotransferase domain (33Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Google Scholar), whereas the saccharide pocket in the 3-O-sulfotransferase model can accommodate at least a tetrasaccharide (35Raman R. Myette J. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1214-1219Google Scholar). Thus, the polysaccharide moiety interacting with the 6-OSTs probably does not encompass more than three disaccharide units, such that octasaccharides, composed of four hexuronate and three GlcN units, and with a aManR unit at the reducing end, would be a good substitute for the native substrate. Indeed, the finding that the middle GlcNS unit is the preferred position for O-sulfation (Fig. 4) is in line with a binding site that can accommodate a hexasaccharide and utilize the two flanking disaccharide units to increase the affinity for the transition state of the catalyzed reaction."

Based on their mode of tRNA recognition, Gm-methylases can be divided into the following two types: type I having broad specificity toward the substrate tRNA, and type II that methylates only limited tRNA species. Protein synthesized by in vitro cell-free translation revealed that Gm-methylase encoded in the Aquifex aeolicus genome is a novel type II enzyme. Experiments with chimeric tRNAs and mini- and micro-helix RNAs showed that the recognition region of this enzyme is included within the D-arm structure of tRNALeu and that a bulge is essentially required. Variants of tRNALeu, tRNASer, and tRNAPhe revealed that a combination of certain base pairs in the D-stem is strongly recognized by the enzyme, that 4 bp in the D-stem enhance methyl acceptance activity, and that the Py16Py17G18G19 sequence is important for efficient methyl transfer. The methyl acceptance activities of all the A. aeolicus tRNA genes, which can be classified into 14 categories on the basis of their D-arm structure, were tested. The results clearly showed that the substrate recognition mechanism elucidated by the variant experiments was applicable to their native substrates.

EC 2.1.1.34). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to 2′-OH of the ribose ring of G18 in the D-loop of tRNA (4Kumagai I. Watanabe K. Oshima T.

Although Gm18 is found in tRNAs from all three domains, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea, and plant organella (11Marechal-Drouard L. Neuburger M. Guillemaut P. Douce R. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 170-172Google Scholar), only the enzyme isolated from Thermus thermophilus has been purified (5Kumagai I. Watanabe K. Oshima T. J. Biol.

Although in the last few years some enzymes having multisite specificity have been found (15Pintard L. Lecointe F. Bujnicki J.M. Bonnerot C. Grosjean H. Lapeyre B.

Cortese R. Nature. 1980; 284: 143-148Google Scholar, 36Carbon P. Haumont E. Fournier M. de Henau S. Grosjean H. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1093-1097Google Scholar, 37Droogmans L. Haumont E. de Henau S.

RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 395-408Google Scholar).Based on their tRNA recognition, Gm-methylases can be divided into two types. Type I, which includes the enzyme of T. thermophilus, possesses broad specificity toward the substrate tRNA (42Hori H. Yamazaki N. Matsumoto T. Watanabe Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25721-25727Google Scholar), so that all T. thermophilus tRNAs have Gm18 under their optimal temperature (43Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Google Scholar, 44Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Google Scholar). Type I enzymes occur in thermophiles. In the case of type II, which includes the enzymes of E. coli (12Persson B.C. Jager G. Gustafsson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4093-4097Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae (13Cavaille J. Chetouani F. Bachellerie J.-P. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 66-81Google Scholar), only limited tRNA species have the Gm18 residue (43Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Google Scholar). Almost all type II enzymes occur in mesophiles. In a previous report (42Hori H. Yamazaki N. Matsumoto T. Watanabe Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25721-25727Google Scholar), we described the recognition sites in tRNA of type I Gm-methylase. The type I enzyme recognizes common structures of tRNA; the conserved G18G19 sequence and D-arm are essentially required, and U8, purine 15 (Pu15), pyrimidine 17 (Py17), Pu26, G46, U54, U55, and C56 are important for efficient methyl acceptance activity. On the other hand, the substrate recognition mechanism of type II enzymes is still unknown. How do type II enzymes recognize specific tRNA species? The purpose of this paper is to elucidate this and to clarify the difference(s) between the recognition mechanisms of type I and type II enzymes.We report that the genome of Aquifex aeolicus, a hyper-thermophile eubacterium, encodes a novel type II Gm-methylase gene. A. aeolicus, which was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, can grow at nearly 95 °C (45Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. Konig H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Google Scholar). The 16 S rRNA gene of A. aeolicus has been analyzed from the perspective of molecular evolution, and it was suggested that this bacterium is the earliest diverging eubacterium (46Burggraf S. Olsen G.J. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 353-356Google Scholar). Then in 1998, the complete genome sequence was determined (47Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Google Scholar). Study of A. aeolicus Gm-methylase will thus contribute to clarifying the origin of RNA modification.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[methyl-14C]AdoMet (55–60 Ci/mol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligomers were bought from Invitrogen, and DNA-modifying enzymes and human placenta RNase inhibitor were from Takara Bio. T7 RNA polymerase expression system (E. coli BL21/pAR1219) was kindly provided by Dr. F. W. Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratory) (48Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendroff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified by the method of Grodberg and Dunn (49Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Google Scholar). Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade.Transfer RNAs from Native Sources—Purified yeast tRNAPhe (GmAA) was kindly supplied by Dr. C. Takemoto (RIKEN Genome Science Center) and purified E. coli tRNAfMet (CAU) by Dr. T. Suzuki (Tokyo University).Preparation of tRNA Transcripts—Synthesized E. coli tRNASer (CGA), tRNA1Tyr (GUA), and tRNALeu (CAG) genes with T7 promoter were kindly provided by Dr. H. Himeno (Hirosaki University). The other tRNA genes with the T7 promoter were constructed by synthetic oligomers as reported previously (42Hori H. Yamazaki N. Matsumoto T. Watanabe Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25721-25727Google Scholar). Readthrough transcription was carried out, and transcripts were purified by Qiagen Tip20 column chromatography. The purities of the transcripts were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea) electrophoresis. Because T7 RNA polymerase has the activity to add extra residues to the 3′ end, the amount of the by-product derived from this reaction is ∼50% of the correct length of transcript in the case of yeast tRNAPhe. The by-product was purified by 15% PAGE (7 m urea). When the methyl acceptance activity of the by-product was compared with that of the correct length of transcript, the two activities were found to coincide (data not shown), confirming that addition of residues to the 3′ end does not affect the activity of tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase. We therefore used run-off transcripts purified on a Qiagen column.Synthesis, Purification, and Assay of Gm-methylase—A. aeolicus Gm-methylase was synthesized by the method reported previously (50Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Google Scholar). The sample was heated at 65 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was passed through a DE52 column in the presence of 100 mm KCl. After the sample was centrifuged, the supernatant was frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. T. thermophilus recombinant Gm-methylase was purified as described previously (14Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Google Scholar). The quantity of protein was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The standard assay was carried out with 0.38 μm the enzyme, 11 μmE. coli tRNALeu transcript, and 25 μm [14C]AdoMet in 30 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2,6mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl at 60 °C for 10 min.Kinetic Parameter Measurement—The apparent kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the reaction with [3H]methyl-AdoMet. The standard reaction was carried out with 0.1 μm purified enzyme, 50 μm [3H]methyl-AdoMet diluted with cold AdoMet, and the appropriate substrate RNA in 30 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl at 60 °C for 10 min. The ranges of tRNA concentrations and incubation times were changed according to the tRNA species. In the case of the relatively good substrate (E. coli tRNALeu (CAG), A. aeolicus tRNAPro (GGG), and so on), RNA concentrations were basically 0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7.5 μm. In the case of the relatively poor substrate (A. aeolicus tRNAAsp (GUC), tRNAArg (ACG), and so on), RNA concentrations in the reaction mixture were 0, 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 20 μm. In the latter case, incubation time was changed to 20 or 30 min. When 0.1 μm the enzyme and 7.5 μm tRNALeu were used, ∼10% of tRNA was methylated for 10 min. The linearity of the reaction could be observed for 30 min. When incorporation of the [3H]methyl group was below 500 dpm, [14C]methyl group incorporation was measured using a gel electrophoresis-imaging analyzer system. A mixture of 0.38 μm purified enzyme, 25 μm [14C]AdoMet, and the appropriate substrate RNA in 30 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl) was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. RNA concentrations were basically 0, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 μm. In this case, the turnover of the enzyme-tRNA complex was very slow. We monitored the reaction for 24 h to check the linear increase of the methyl group incorporation into the tRNA. Since the linear reaction could be observed for 6 h, we confirmed the turnover of the enzyme-tRNA complex. The reaction mixture (5 μl) was then loaded onto a 10% PAGE (7 m urea). The gel was stained with methylene blue and dried. [14C]Methyl group incorporations were measured with a Fuji Photo Film BAS2000 imaging analyzer.RESULTSA. aeolicus spoU Gene Product Is a Type II Gm-methylase—A. aeolicus putative spoU (trmH, Gm-methylase gene) was retrieved from the NCBI data base by a BLAST search (13Cavaille J. Chetouani F. Bachellerie J.-P. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 66-81Google Scholar, 14Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Google Scholar). The putative gene was encoded on a DNA fragment (accession number AE000479). As shown in Fig. 1A, this gene shares considerable homology with T. thermophilus trmH, a typical type I Gm-methylase gene. Three conserved motifs (motifs 1–3) were also found. These motifs, which are conserved among RNA ribose 2′-O-methyltransferases, are thought to be involved in methyl transfer activity (51Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Google Scholar). In a recent study (14Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Google Scholar), we compared the amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus HB8 Gm-methylase with sequences of previously identified or putative genes for RNA ribose 2′-O-methyltransferases. Several amino acids residues were found to be conserved exclusively among eubacterial Gm-methylases. For example, general motif 1 has been reported as an “N-G- – -R” sequence; however, the conserved Gly residue in the motif is replaced by Ser residue in eubacterial enzymes. Therefore, we expected this gene product to be Gm-methylase. However, since we could not judge from the amino acid sequence whether or not it is a type I enzyme, we cloned the DNA fragment by PCR and tested the expression of the gene product with a pET-30a E. coli expression system. Unfortunately, this strategy was not successful because of severe proteolysis (data not shown).We next tried expressing the gene using a wheat germ in vitro cell-free translation system (50Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the time course of the synthesis of the target protein with [14C]Leu. As shown in the figure, this time no proteolysis was observed. We synthesized the protein with cold amino acids and partially purified it by heat treatment and DE52 column chromatography. We attempted to purify a sample by S-adenosyl-l-homo-cysteine affinity column chromatography (5Kumagai I. Watanabe K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7388-7395Google Scholar, 42Hori H. Yamazaki N. Matsumoto T. Watanabe Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25721-25727Google Scholar), but the enzyme bound to the column tightly and was difficult to recover in a fully active form. Therefore, we decided to use the partially purified enzyme, which had a purity of more than 90% (Fig. 1C). In this fraction, the activities of nucleases and the other RNA methyltransferases were not observed (Fig. 1D). Large scale synthesis (15 ml) provided ∼300 μg of the protein. This cell-free translation system is a very powerful tool for the expression of heterogeneous proteins (50Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Google Scholar), and it enabled us to obtain sufficient A. aeolicus Gm-methylase for the biochemical investigations carried out in this study.First, we analyzed the initial velocities of methyl transfer to various native tRNAs and tRNA transcripts from [14C]AdoMet. Measurements were done at 60 °C to stabilize the L-shaped structure of the transcripts. To compare substrate specificities, T. thermophilus HB8 Gm-methylase, a typical type I enzyme, was used. The results are summarized in Table I. In the table, the 100% values were the initial velocity of the methyl group incorporation into 11 μm tRNALeu for 10 min at 60 °C. The amounts of T. thermophilus and A. aeolicus enzymes in the reaction mixture were 150 and 80 ng, respectively. Because the initial velocities of T. thermophilus enzyme for native yeast tRNAPhe and E. coli tRNAfMet were very fast, we calculated these velocities by the other assay, in which 20 ng of the T. thermophilus enzyme was used. Unexpectedly, A. aeolicus Gm-methylase methylated specific tRNAs efficiently; for example, E. coli tRNALeu (CAG) transcript was a good substrate, whereas methyl transfer to some tRNAs such as E. coli native tRNAfMet (CAU) was not detected by the conventional filter assay (Table I). We further analyzed methyl transfer to tRNAs by gel electrophoresis and an imaging analyzer (see Fig. 1D). In this experiment, long term incubation was carried out with excess enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a result, very slow methyl transfer to the tRNASer (UGA) transcript could be observed (Fig. 1D, lane 4). The initial velocity of the methylation was calculated to be 0.2% of tRNALeu (CAG). The kinetic parameters are given in Table II. However, we could not detect methyl transfer to native E. coli tRNAfMet (CAU) (Fig. 1D, lane 1) nor to tRNATyr (GUA) and tRNASer (GCU) transcripts, despite using imaging analyzer. Their relative initial velocities are estimated to be below 0.05% that of the tRNALeu (CAG) transcript. In contrast, the T. thermophilus enzyme clearly methylated all of the tRNAs tested. Thus, the A. aeolicus spoU gene product is a type II Gm-methylase, even though A. aeolicus is a hyper-thermophile. This is the first reported finding of type II Gm-methylase from a thermophile. The substrate specificity of A. aeolicus Gm-methylase is clearly different from those of other type II enzymes because E. coli tRNASer (GCU) and tRNATyr (GUA) are methylated in the E. coli cell, whereas yeast tRNAPhe (GmAA) is not methylated in the yeast cell. Furthermore, the difference in methyl transfer efficiency between the native yeast tRNAPhe (GmAA) and its transcript suggests that several modified nucleotides in the native tRNA support the methyl transfer reaction. We determined the methylation target site by the method reported previously (14Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Google Scholar), and we confirmed Gm18 formation. We could not find methyl transfer to any other site (data not shown). Consequently, we renamed A. aeolicus spoU (AE000479) as trmH in accordance with the nomenclature established for the gene of E. coli Gm18-methylase (12Persson B.C. Jager G. Gustafsson C.

Open table in a new tab A. aeolicus Gm-methylase Recognizes D-arm Structure of tRNA—To clarify the recognition region in the tRNA structure, we constructed two chimeric tRNA transcripts (Fig. 2). In this paper, nucleotide positions are numbered according to Sprinzl et al. (43Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Google Scholar): conserved Pu26 is the 27th nucleotide from 5′ end due to the insertion of one nucleotide into the D-loop. As noted above, the E. coli tRNALeu (CAG) transcript (Fig. 2A) is a good substrate, whereas the E. coli tRNASer (UGA) transcript (Fig. 2B) is a very poor one. We exchanged their D-arm structures and made two chimera transcripts as shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The kinetic parameter measurements are shown in Fig. 2E and Table II. As expected, tRNASer (UGA) possessing the D-arm of tRNALeu (CAG) (Chimera D, Fig. 2D) was a good substrate for A. aeolicus Gm-methylase, whereas tRNALeu (CAG) possessing the D-arm of tRNASer (UGA) (Chimera C, Fig. 2C) was a very poor one. We measured the melting profiles of chimera transcripts to analyze the interaction of their T- and D-arms. The melting profile of chimera C transcript was very similar to tRNALeu, and the melting temperature was determined as 62 °C in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) (data not shown). This experimental result suggested that chimera C transcript formed the tertiary base pairs between T- and D-arms. The kinetic parameters (Fig. 2E) clearly show that the essential recognition sites are located within D-arm structure of the tRNA.Fig. 2Cloverleaf structures and kinetic parameters of E. coli and chimeric tRNAs.A, E. coli tRNALeu (CAG); B, E. coli tRNASer (CGA).

A micro-helix corresponding to the D-arm structure (from U8 to G26, see Fig. 2) of tRNALeu (CAG) (Fig. 3A) was not methylated at all. Because measurement of enzyme activity for the micro- and mini-helices was done at 50 °C, we also examined this micro-helix at 25 and 37 °C to stabilize the D-arm structure. However, methyl transfer to the micro-helix was still not observed. Because the enzyme activity at 25 °C was only 1/20 that at 60 °C (data not shown), it was difficult to detect the methyl transfer to micro- or mini-helices. Therefore, we added artificial stem structures to the"

Residues 1–59 of SK regulate its capacity to induce an active site in bound Pg by a nonproteolytic mechanism and to activate substrate Pg in a fibrin-independent manner. We analyzed 24 SK mutants to better define the functional properties of SK-(1–59). Mutations within the αβ1 strand (residues 17–26) of SK completely prevented nonproteolytic active site induction in bound Pg and rendered SK incapable of protecting plasmin from inhibition by α2-antiplasmin. However, when fibrin-bound, the activities of αβ1 strand mutants were similar to that of wild-type (WT) SK and resistant to α2-antiplasmin. Mutation of Ile1 of SK also prevented nonproteolytic active site induction in bound Pg. However, unlike αβ1 strand mutants, the functional defect of Ile1 mutants was not relieved by fibrin, and complexes of Ile1 mutants and plasmin were resistant to α2-antiplasmin. Plasmin enhanced the activities of αβ1 strand and Ile1 mutants, suggesting that SK-plasmin complexes activated mutant SK·Pg complexes by hydrolyzing the Pg Arg561-Val562 bond. Mutational analysis of Glu39 of SK suggested that a salt bridge between Glu39 and Arg719 of Pg is important, but not essential, for nonproteolytic active site induction in Pg. Deleting residues 1–59 rendered SK dependent on plasmin and fibrin to generate plasminogen activator (PA) activity. However, the PA activity of SK-(60–414) in the presence of fibrin was markedly reduced compared with WT SK. Despite its reduced PA activity, the fibrinolytic potency of SK-(60–414) was greater than that of WT SK at higher (but not lower) SK concentrations due to its capacity to deplete plasma Pg. These studies define mechanisms by which the SK α domain regulates rapid active site induction in bound Pg, contributes to the resistance of the SK-plasmin complex to α2-antiplasmin, and controls fibrin-independent Pg activation. Streptokinase (SK) binds to plasminogen (Pg) to form a complex that converts substrate Pg to plasmin.

Streptokinase (SK), 1The abbreviations used are: SK, streptokinase; PA, plasminogen activator; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild-type. a protein secreted by several streptococcal species, binds and activates human plasminogen. Streptokinase may play an important role in streptococcal virulence by generating proteolytic activity at the bacterial cell surface, thereby facilitating invasion of host tissues (1Boyle M.D.P. Lottenberg R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1-10Google Scholar). Streptokinase is also used as a clot-dissolving agent to treat thrombotic diseases (2Reddy K.N. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 79-89Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian plasminogen activators, which activate plasminogen by limited proteolysis, streptokinase lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity. Rather, SK binds to plasminogen and induces within it an active site by a nonproteolytic mechanism (3Bajaj A.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 492-498Google Scholar). The SK-plasminogen complex converts free plasminogen molecules to plasmin. Plasminogen within the activator complex also is converted to plasmin by a poorly understood proteolytic mechanism, and the SK-plasmin complex is resistant to inactivation by α2-antiplasmin (4Cederholm-Williams S. De Cock F. Lijnen H. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Google Scholar). Streptokinase consists of 440 amino acids, including a 26-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved during secretion to yield the mature 414-amino acid protein of Mr 47,000 (2Reddy K.N. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 79-89Google Scholar). Streptokinase contains three domains, denoted α (residues 1–150), β (residues 151–287), and γ (residues 288–414) (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J. Tang J. Zhang X. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar). Each domain binds plasminogen, although none can activate plasminogen independently (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J. Tang J. Zhang X. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar, 6Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Google Scholar, 7Rodriguez P. Fuentes P. Barro M. Alvarez J.G. Munoz E. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 83-90Google Scholar, 8Shi G.-Y. Wu D.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that residues 1–59 of the SK α domain play a key role in plasminogen activation. The Lys59-Ser60 peptide bond of SK is cleaved very rapidly upon incubation of SK with plasminogen, and the resulting N-terminal peptide remains associated with the SK-plasminogen complex (8Shi G.-Y. Wu D.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar, 9Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Google Scholar). SK deletion mutants lacking residues 1–59 form complexes with plasminogen that exhibit markedly reduced plasminogen activator (PA) activity, despite the fact that these mutant SK-plasminogen complexes can generate near normal amidolytic activity after prolonged incubation (7Rodriguez P. Fuentes P. Barro M. Alvarez J.G. Munoz E. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 83-90Google Scholar, 10Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Google Scholar, 11Wang S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Google Scholar). Incubation of peptides containing amino acids 1–59 of SK with inactive deletion mutants lacking these residues restores PA activity (8Shi G.-Y. Wu D.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Google Scholar, 9Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Google Scholar, 13Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Google Scholar). Deletion of Ile1 of SK markedly inhibits its capacity to induce an active site in plasminogen, which supports the hypothesis that establishment of a salt bridge between Ile1 of SK and Asp740 of plasminogen is necessary for SK to induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism (11Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar). Residues 1–59 also appear to play an important role in determining the capacity of SK to efficiently activate plasminogen in the absence of fibrin, a property that distinguishes SK from tissue-type plasminogen activator. Whereas full-length SK efficiently activates plasminogen in the absence or presence of fibrin, the very low PA activity of SK-(60–414) is greatly enhanced by fibrin (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). Several questions regarding the function of the amino-terminal fragment (residues 1–59) of the SK α domain remain unanswered. First, what residues play key roles in mediating the functional effects of the amino-terminal fragment on plasminogen activation? Although the role of Ile1 of SK in plasminogen activation has been examined in some detail (11Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar), less is known about the function of other specific residues (16Lee S.H. Jeong S.T. Kim I.C. Byun S.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 199-207Google Scholar, 17Kim D. Lee S. Kim I. Kim S. Byun S. Thromb Res. 2000; 99: 93-98Google Scholar, 18Lee B.R. Park S.K. Kim J.H. Byun S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1085-1090Google Scholar, 19Liu L. Sazonova I.Y. Turner R.B. Chowdhry S.A. Tsai J. Houng A.K. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37686-37691Google Scholar). Second, what is the mechanism by which complexes composed of plasminogen and SK mutants lacking portions of the amino terminus attain normal or nearly normal amidolytic activity, but only after a prolonged lag phase? And third, what are the mechanisms underlying the fibrin specificity exhibited by SK mutants lacking residues 1–59? The purpose of this study was to address these issues by generating and characterizing an extensive panel of recombinant SKs carrying mutations within residues 1–59. Reagents—Glu-plasminogen was purified from human plasma by lysine-Sepharose chromatography (20Deutsch D. Mertz E. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Google Scholar). Purified plasminogen was incubated with d-Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethylketone dihydrochloride (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), a plasmin inhibitor, and dialyzed extensively before use. Plasmin was prepared by incubating plasminogen (2 mg/ml) with urokinase (0.5 units/ml; American Diagnostica). Chromogenic plasmin substrate (S-2251) was from Chromogenix. Human α2-antiplasmin and soluble fibrin fragments (Desafib-X) were from American Diagnostica. Recombinant human plasminogen resistant to hydrolysis at Arg561 (Pg R561A) was generated and purified as described (21Nilsen S.L. Castellino F.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 136-143Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was from Calbiochem. Generation and Purification of Recombinant SK—Mature (i.e. 414 amino acids, N-terminal isoleucine), wild-type SK (derived from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A) was generated and purified as described previously (10Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the streptokinase coding sequence by using the pSELECT mutagenesis vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ile1 and all clusters of charged amino acids within residues 1–59 of SK were mutated to alanine residues, as described previously (22Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J.S. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Google Scholar). SK mutants lacking Ile1 (i.e. SK-(2–414)) or residues 1–59 (i.e. SK-(60–414)) were generated by a PCR-based strategy, as described (23Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M.A. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26084-26089Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant streptokinases were subcloned into pET-3a, expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS as mature length proteins, and purified to homogeneity as described (10Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Google Scholar). Protein sequence analysis of Ile1 point and deletion mutants confirmed the presence of the intended N-terminal residue. Functional Assays—The capacity of streptokinase to generate amidolytic activity when in complex with plasminogen was determined by incubating SK (180 nm), plasminogen (60 nm), and S-2251 (300 μm) in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), at room temperature and monitoring the absorbance of reaction mixtures at 405 nm (A405) for 15 min. The amidolytic activity of each complex, expressed as percentage of wild type, was calculated by dividing the A405/min of mutant complex by the A405/min of wild-type SK complex and then multiplying by 100. Standard curves constructed from different concentrations of wild-type SK-plasminogen complex revealed that A405/min was a linear function of complex concentration. SK plasminogen activator activity was studied by incubating SK (3.5 nm), plasminogen (700 nm), and S-2251 (300 μm) in TBS at room temperature and measuring the A405 15 min later. The plasminogen activator activity of each mutant, expressed as percentage of wild type, was calculated by dividing the A405 of mutant SK by the A405 of wild-type SK and then multiplying by 100. Standard curves of wild-type SK revealed that A405 was a linear function of SK concentration over the range of 0–3.5 nm. To study the role of the SK α domain in the resistance of the SK-plasmin complex to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin, SK (50 nm) and plasmin (10 nm) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and then α2-antiplasmin (50 nm) was added. Five minutes later, residual amidolytic activity of complexes was determined by hydrolysis of S-2251. Effects of Fibrin on Activity of SK-Plasminogen Complex—To study the effects of fibrin on the amidolytic activity of SK-plasminogen complexes, SK (240 nm), Pg R561A (120 nm), and S-2251 (500 μm) were incubated in TBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of Desafib X (desAA fibrinogen X; 1.2 μm), and the A405 of the reaction mixture was monitored. Effects of fibrin on PA activities of complexes of SK and wild-type plasminogen were determined by incubating SK (3.5–16.5 nm), Glu-plasminogen (700 nm), Desafib X (1 μm), and S-2251 (300 μm) and monitoring A405. To study the amidolytic and PA activities of SK-plasminogen complexes bound to insoluble fibrin matrices, fibrin-coated microtiter plate wells (96 wells/plate) were prepared by incubating fibrinogen (1.4 μm) and thrombin (0.5 units/ml) in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) and air-drying plates overnight at 37 °C. Wells were blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin containing d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone dihydrochloride, a thrombin inhibitor (10 μm; Calbiochem), and washed five times with rinsing buffer (0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). Wild-type plasminogen or Pg R561A (50–100 nm in 100 μl of TBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to wells. One hour later, wells were washed extensively, and then SK (0–150 nm) was added. To measure the amidolytic activity of complexes, S-2251 (300 μm) was added to wells in the absence or presence of α2-antiplasmin (240 nm), and the A405 of wells was monitored. To measure the PA activity of fibrin-bound complexes, wells were washed extensively 30 min after adding SK, and then 100 μl of wild-type plasminogen (1 μm) was added to wells. After 20 min at room temperature, 25 μl were removed and transferred to wells containing S-2251 (final concentration 300 μm) to determine plasmin formation. Plasma Clot Lysis—Pooled, citrated human plasma (50 μl), containing a trace amount of 125I-human fibrinogen (Amersham Biosciences), was clotted in the presence of a plastic rod (to facilitate clot washing and transfer) by the addition of thrombin (1 unit/ml) and CaCl2 (5 mm). After 1 h at 37 °C, clots were washed five times with TBS containing hirudin (1 μg/ml) and then suspended in citrated plasma (450 μl) containing streptokinase (10–50 nm) and hirudin (1 μg/ml). After 0–120 min of gentle rocking at 37 °C, the percentage of clot lysis was calculated by comparing radioactive counts in the plasma with those present in the washed clot prior to its placement in plasma. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were measured as described (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). Other Methods—Protein concentrations of purified proteins were determined with the BCA Reagent (Pierce). DNA sequencing was performed by the Sanger method. SDS-PAGE was performed with the PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed as described (21Nilsen S.L. Castellino F.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 136-143Google Scholar). CD spectra analyses were performed at 25 °C with a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter with a 1.0-nm bandwidth and a 0.5-nm step resolution. Effects of Point Mutations on SK PA Activity—We generated an extensive panel of point mutations within residues 1–59 of SK. Mutations targeted by a charged-to-alanine strategy did not significantly decrease SK PA activity (Table I), suggesting that none of the clusters of charged residues in this region was essential for normal activator activity. Of note, a 3-fold increase in PA activity was observed for SK K36A. Mutation of Ile1 of SK to an alanine caused a moderate decrease in PA activity (to 23 ± 7% that of wild-type SK) that was characterized by a lag phase in the appearance of plasmin formation, after which the PA activity of SK I1A was indistinguishable from that of wild-type SK (Fig. 1). A relatively long series of hydrophobic amino acids (residues 11–26), which is missed by a charged-to-alanine mutagenesis strategy, is located within the SK amino-terminal fragment, and deletions into this region are associated with a marked reduction in PA activity (9Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Google Scholar, 10Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Google Scholar, 24Jackson K.W. Tang J. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 693-699Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a series of neutral-to-charged mutations between positions 11 and 26 of SK. Several mutations within this region decreased PA activity to ∼1% that of wild-type SK (i.e. L18D, V20D, V20K, and V22D), whereas the PA activities of SK V19D and SK G24D were reduced to 13.6 ± 5% and 2.5 ± 2% that of wild-type SK, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry of SK S16D, L18D, and G24D revealed that they exhibited a single temperature of maximum heat capacity (Tm) of ∼45 °C, whereas wild-type SK and SK K36A exhibited two Tm of ∼45 °C and 55–60 °C (Table II). However, the secondary structural characteristics of mutants exhibiting abnormal calorimetry profiles (i.e. SK S16D, L18D, and G24D), as evaluated by CD spectroscopy in the near-UV (240–320 nm) and far-UV (190–260 nm) regions, did not differ from those of wild-type SK (data not shown). These results suggested that the mutations introduced between positions 18 and 24 altered the tertiary structure of the α domain of SK.Table IAmidolytic and plasminogen activator activities of streptokinase mutants in complex with plasminogen Data are mean ± 1 S.D. of triplicate experiments.MutantAmidolytic activity of SK-plasminogen complex (percentage of wild-type SK-plasminogen complex)Plasminogen activator activity of SK-plasminogen complex (percencentage of wild-type SK-plasminogen complex)%%I1A<0.123 ± 7E5A97.3 ± 8.4186 ± 8.2D9A,R10A82.0 ± 1.394 ± 15V13D45.7 ± 10106 ± 18V13K94.7 ± 4.624 ± 12S16D62.5 ± 1.4204 ± 68S16K130 ± 2127.9 ± 5.6L18D2.3 ± 2.11.1 ± 1V19D22.7 ± 2.913.6 ± 5V20D<0.10.6 ± 0.7V20K2.3 ± 0.80.7 ± 0.3V22D<0.10.3 ± 0.2G24D1.9 ± 0.82.5 ± 2V26D105 ± 7.9178 ± 28V26K102 ± 12145 ± 47E27A118 ± 26136 ± 38D32A138 ± 7.2220 ± 57K36A217 ± 7.2298 ± 69E39A,D41A168 ± 5.0176 ± 41R45A,H48A110 ± 2276 ± 29K51A,E53A88.5 ± 11160 ± 22K59A,K61A77.9 ± 14100 ± 5.6 Open table in a new tab Table IITemperature(s) of maximum heat capacity (Tm) of recombinant streptokinases Each Tm corresponds to the midpoint of the peak of the raw thermogram.

The amidolytic activity of plasminogen in complex with SK K36A was ∼2-fold greater than that of wild-type complex (Table I and Fig. 2). The amidolytic activity observed during a 15-min incubation of SK I1A with Glu-plasminogen was severely reduced, although gradually increasing rates of S-2251 hydrolysis were observed after a prolonged lag phase (Fig. 2). Similarly, the cluster of mutations between positions 18 and 24 of SK markedly inhibited the amidolytic activity of the activator complex. However, in two-stage assays (in which delayed generation of amidolytic activity during incubation of equimolar SK and plasminogen was confirmed by hydrolysis of S-2251 (stage 1) and then a 200-fold molar excess of plasminogen was added to the reaction mixture to assess PA function (stage 2)), the PA activity of SK I1A was indistinguishable from that of wild-type SK, whereas the PA activities of position 18–24 mutants were not detectable or markedly reduced (data not shown). These results suggested that once an active site was formed, complexes containing mutations at position 1 of SK processed substrate plasminogen normally, whereas complexes containing mutations at positions 18–24 of SK were severely defective in converting substrate plasminogen to plasmin. Analysis of Mechanisms Underlying the Lag in the Generation of Amidolytic Activity by SK α Domain Mutants—We studied the capacity of recombinant SKs (240 nm) to induce amidolytic activity in Pg R561A (120 nm), a mutant zymogen incapable of conversion to plasmin (21Nilsen S.L. Castellino F.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 136-143Google Scholar). Neither SK I1A nor any of the position 18–24 mutants was able to generate amidolytic activity during a 1-h incubation at 37 °C (data not shown). All other point mutants induced amidolytic activity comparable with that of wild-type SK during incubation with Pg R561A, except for SK E39A,D41A, which exhibited an activity of 18.1 ± 5.5% that of wild-type SK. These results suggested that mutations at position 1 or positions 18–24 of SK prevented rapid, proteolysis-independent formation of an active site in complexed plasminogen. The addition of plasmin (1.6 nm) to reaction mixtures of wild-type plasminogen (80 nm) and SK I1A, SK L18D, or SK G24D (each at 240 nm) accelerated S-2251 hydrolysis to a much greater extent than could be explained simply by the amidolytic activity of added plasmin (Fig. 3, B–D) but had no significant effect on wild-type SK (Fig. 3A). However, the addition of trace plasmin did not enable SK I1A, SK L18D, or SK G24D to generate amidolytic activity in Pg R561A (data not shown), suggesting that plasmin catalyzed active site formation by a mechanism that involved hydrolysis of the plasminogen Arg561-Val562 bond. Consistent with these data, SDS-PAGE analysis of equimolar reaction mixtures of SK I1A and wild-type plasminogen revealed that the appearance of amidolytic activity correlated with the delayed conversion of plasminogen within the activator complex to plasmin, whereas the appearance of amidolytic activity of complexes composed of wild-type SK and wild-type plasminogen was immediate and preceded conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (Fig. 4).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE analysis and amidolytic activity of SK I1A-plasminogen complexes. Wild-type SK or SK I1A (7.8 μm) and wild-type plasminogen (7.8 μm) were incubated at 15 °C. At the indicated time points, samples of the reaction mixture were removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions (A, wild-type SK; B, SK I1A) and measurement of amidolytic activity (after 100-fold dilution) by incubation with 300 μm S-2251 (C).

Whereas SKs containing mutations between positions 18 and 24 did not generate significant amidolytic activity in the absence of fibrin, their activities in the presence of fibrin were comparable with that of wild-type SK (Fig. 5). However, fibrin had no significant effect on the markedly reduced capacity of SK I1A to generate amidolytic activity in Pg R561A. Similarly, the PA activities of fibrin-bound complexes containing Pg R561A and SKs with mutations at residues 18–24 were comparable with those containing wild-type SK, whereas the PA activity of fibrin-bound complexes containing SK I1A was markedly reduced, and the PA activity of fibrin-bound complexes containing SK-(2–414) was undetectable (data not shown). These results indicated that 1) point mutations within the β1 strand of the α domain generated SKs that exhibited markedly reduced amidolytic and PA activities in the absence of fibrin but normal or nearly normal activities in the presence of fibrin, and 2) even in the presence of fibrin, Ile1 was required for SK to efficiently induce active site formation in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism. Inhibition of Activator Complexes by α2-Antiplasmin and Modulation by Fibrin—To study the role of the SK α domain in the resistance of the SK-plasmin complex to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin, we incubated SK (50 nm) and plasmin (10 nm) for 5 min and then added α2-antiplasmin (50 nm). Five minutes later, residual amidolytic activity of complexes was determined by hydrolysis of S-2251. No significant inhibition of wild-type SK-plasmin complex by antiplasmin was observed. In contrast, marked inhibition of S-2251 hydrolysis by antiplasmin was observed during incubation of plasmin with the following SK mutants: S16K, L18D, V19D, V20K, V20D, V22D, G24D, and SK-(60–414). Complexes of plasmin and all other point mutants listed in Table I were not inhibited by α2-antiplasmin (data not shown). Consistent with these results, antiplasmin (240 nm) essentially completely inhibited the generation of amidolytic activity during a 1-h incubation of SK L18D or SK G24D (each at 240 nm) with plasminogen (80 nm) and trace plasmin (1.6 nm; Fig. 3, C and D). However, complexes formed by incubating plasminogen and SK L18D or SK G24D in fibrin-coated microtiter plate wells were resistant to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (Fig. 6). These results suggested that the SK α domain contributes to the resistance of the SK-plasmin complex to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin and that mutations within the β1 strand of the α domain generated mutants with fibrin-dependent resistance to antiplasmin. Effects of Fibrin on the Activity of SK-(60–414)—The PA activity of SK-(60–414) is severely reduced, yet it is markedly enhanced by fibrin (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). We performed a series of experiments to identify potential mechanisms underlying the effect of fibrin on SK-(60–414). SK-(60–414) (240 nm) did not generate amidolytic activity during incubation with Pg R561A (120 nm), either in the absence or presence of soluble fibrin fragments (1.2 μm; Fig. 5), suggesting that fibrin could not substitute for residues 1–59 of SK to provide structural elements necessary to induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism. However, fibrin significantly enhanced the capacity of complexes of SK-(60–414) and wild-type plasminogen to generate PA activity, although the specific activity of SK-(60–414) in the presence of fibrin was markedly less than that of wild-type SK (Fig. 7A). The addition of trace plasmin potently accelerated the generation of PA activity during incubation of SK-(60–414) and wild-type plasminogen in the presence of fibrin but not in its absence (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that activation of plasminogen by SK-(60–414) required not only fibrin but also SK-(60–414)-plasmin complex (as opposed to SK-plasminogen complex), with the plasmin provided as a trace contaminant in the plasminogen preparation. However, the rate of plasminogen activation by SK-(60–414)-plasmin, even in the presence of fibrin, was markedly slower than that induced by wild-type SK. Previous studies suggested that SK-(60–414) exhibits a greater fibrinolytic potency than wild-type SK (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). We compared the capacity of wild-type SK and SK-(60–414) to lyse plasma clots. At a concentration of 10 nm, wild-type SK exhibited much greater fibrinolytic potency than SK-(60–414) (Fig. 8A). At a concentration of 50 nm, wild-type SK was superior to SK-(60–414) at early time points (15–30 min) but at later time points SK-(60–414) induced more extensive clot lysis than did wild-type SK (Fig. 8B). Plasma fibrinogen depletion during clot lysis with wild-type SK was relatively mild at a concentration of 10 nm but was severe at a concentration of 50 nm (Fig. 8C). In contrast, minimal depletion of plasma fibrinogen was observed with either concentration of SK-(60–414). These results suggested that SK-(60–414) exhibits greater fibrinolytic potency than wild-type SK only under conditions in which plasma concentrations of wild-type SK are high enough to induce extensive activation of plasminogen in plasma, thereby depleting plasma fibrinogen and plasminogen. Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of purified plasminogen to plasma during clot lysis potentiated the fibrinolytic efficacy of wild-type SK but had no detectable effect on SK-(60–414) (Fig. 8B). None of the mutants generated by a charged-to-alanine mutagenesis strategy exhibited a significant defect in amidolytic or PA activity during incubation with wild-type plasminogen. However, when the panel of charged-to-alanine mutants was screened with Pg R561A (i.e. under conditions in which active site formation can occur only via a nonproteolytic mechanism), the capacity of SK E39A,D41A to induce amidolytic activity was moderately to severely reduced. Residues 39–41 of SK are located in the β2 strand of the α domain. These results suggest an important role of the αβ2 strand in establishing an active site in plasminogen and support the hypothesis that a salt bridge between Glu39 of SK and Arg719 of plasminogen plays an important but not essential role in the formation of an active complex (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J. Tang J. Zhang X. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar). We also observed that mutation of Lys36, located immediately adjacent to the β2 strand, resulted in a significant increase in SK amidolytic activity. Within the activator complex, Lys36 of SK is in close proximity to the active site of plasmin (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J. Tang J. Zhang X. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar). It is possible that mutations at or close to this residue produce steric or charge effects that facilitate substrate access to the active site. These results support the feasibility of using mutagenesis to increase SK function. Mutations in the αβ1 strand (residues 17–26) of SK markedly reduced the formation of an active complex during incubation with plasminogen. Mutations between residues 18 and 24 may have altered the position or mobility of the SK N terminus and prevented Ile1 from assuming a conformation required for it to interact with Asp740 of plasminogen to induce active site formation by a nonproteolytic mechanism (14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar). However, complexes of plasmin and SKs harboring mutations between positions 18–24 were severely defective in PA activity, whereas complexes of SK I1A or SK-(2–414) and plasmin exhibited normal PA activity. These results suggested that 1) although Ile1 of SK plays a key role in inducing an active site in complexed plasminogen (11Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar), Ile1 is not required for normal processing of substrate plasminogen by the complex, and 2) the loss of PA function of position 18–24 mutants was not mediated simply by steric effects on Ile1. Since residues 18–24 reside within the hydrophobic core of the α domain, mutations in this region may have disrupted protein folding and substrate turnover by the activator complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations in this region were associated with apparent structural changes in SK, as assessed by differential scanning calorimetry. However, the lack of significant changes in the CD spectra of these mutants and the observation that fibrin restored the capacity of position 18–24 mutants (but not SK-(60–414)) to induce amidolytic activity in Pg R561A suggested that their potential alterations in α domain structure were not irreversible and were probably minor. The SK αβ1 strand has extensive contact with residues 713–721 of plasminogen, with Arg719 forming a van der Waals contact with Val19 of SK (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J. Tang J. Zhang X. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Google Scholar). Our data support the hypothesis that contact between residues 713–721 of plasminogen and the β1 strand of the SK α domain is essential for rapid formation of a fully functional complex. Mechanism of Delayed Generation of Amidolytic Activity by SK Mutants Lacking Ile1—Although Ile1 of SK appears to be required for SK to induce an active site in complexed plasminogen (11Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar), complexes of plasminogen and SK N-terminal deletion mutants lacking Ile1 can, after a lag phase, generate nearly normal amidolytic activity (7Rodriguez P. Fuentes P. Barro M. Alvarez J.G. Munoz E. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 83-90Google Scholar, 10Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Google Scholar, 11Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Google Scholar, 12Young K.-C. Shi G.-Y. Chang Y.-F. Chang L.-C. Lai M.-D. Chuang W.-J. Wu H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that active (i.e. SK I1A-plasmin) complexes can activate inactive (i.e. SK I1A-plasminogen) complexes by hydrolyzing the latter's Arg561-Val562 plasminogen bond, as hypothesized by Wang et al. (14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar). It appears that SK mutants lacking normal function of Ile1, due to mutation of that residue or due to steric effects of other mutations, require trace amounts of plasmin, which binds to SK to generate active complexes that trigger progressive activation of other complexes, resulting in an activation mechanism similar to that of staphylokinase (25Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. DeCock F. Okada K. Ueshima S. Matsuo O. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11826-11832Google Scholar). Role of Residues 1–59 of SK in Fibrin-independent Plasminogen Activation—Deletion of residues 1–59 of SK renders it fibrin-dependent by a poorly defined mechanism (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). We found that fibrin did not enable SK-(60–414) to generate amidolytic activity in Pg R561A, suggesting that fibrin cannot substitute for the N-terminal fragment of SK to enable formation of an activator complex by a proteolysis-independent mechanism. However, our results suggest that once plasmin is generated, fibrin can partially substitute for the N-terminal fragment of SK to enable a reduced turnover rate of substrate plasminogen, whereas free SK-(60–414)-plasmin complexes are essentially devoid of PA activity. The environment of the fibrin clot is ideally suited to provide plasmin to “prime” SK-(60–414), since fibrin enhances plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator, and fibrin-bound plasmin is resistant to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (26Lee A.Y.Y. Fredenburgh J.C. Stewart R.J. Rischke J.A. Weitz J.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 502-508Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the fibrin selectivity of SK-(60–414) is accounted for by its requirement of both fibrin and plasmin to generate a complex with PA activity, thereby targeting plasminogen activation to the clot surface. Reed et al. found that SK-(60–414) was a superior fibrinolytic agent to wild-type SK at all concentrations studied (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that SK-(60–414) induced less clot lysis than wild-type SK at low concentrations but more lysis than wild-type SK at higher concentrations. The fibrinolytic superiority of wild-type SK over SK-(60–414) at lower concentrations is consistent with our kinetic data. The superiority of SK-(60–414) over wild-type SK at higher concentrations appears to be due to the capacity of wild-type SK, but not SK-(60–414), to activate plasminogen in plasma, thereby leading to “plasminogen steal” and an arrest of clot lysis (27Torr S.R. Nachowiak D.A. Fujii S. Sobel B.E. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 19: 1085-1090Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of purified plasminogen to plasma accelerated clot lysis by wild-type SK, but not SK-(60–414). Since SK N-terminal deletion mutants have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Google Scholar), it is important to realize that their fibrinolytic efficacy depends on their plasma concentration. The effect of fibrin on the amidolytic and PA activities of SK αβ1 strand point mutants was similar to that observed with SK-(60–414), although more potent. In the presence of fibrin, the activities of SK αβ1 strand point mutants were significantly greater than that of SK-(60–414) and comparable with that of wild-type SK. However, even in the presence of fibrin, Ile1 is required to efficiently induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism. We hypothesize that the fibrin dependence of αβ1 strand mutants is explained by conformational changes induced by fibrin that restore the ability of Ile1 of SK to establish a salt bridge with Asp740 of plasminogen, which appears necessary for nonproteolytic active site induction (14Wang S. Reed G. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Google Scholar). Role of SK α Domain in Resistance of the Activator Complex to α2-Antiplasmin—Our studies suggest an important role of the SK α domain in mediating the resistance of the SK-plasmin complex to inhibition by antiplasmin. Previous studies demonstrated that the affinity of SK-(55–414) for plasmin is markedly reduced compared with wild-type SK (28Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Google Scholar), suggesting that residues 1–59 of SK play a key role in maintaining the cohesiveness of the SK-plasmin complex. It is possible that deletion of residues 1–59 or mutation of residues within the αβ1 strand enable antiplasmin to displace SK from the SK-plasmin complex and inhibit plasmin. In summary, our studies identify key residues within residues 1–59 of SK that mediate its functional properties, and they provide insights into the mechanisms by which the SK α domain coordinates the rapid assembly of a functional activator complex, facilitates fibrin-independent plasminogen activation, and contributes to the resistance of the activator complex to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin. Further studies are indicated to examine the potential use of SK α domain mutants as fibrin-specific plasminogen activators."

The role of cis elements flanking the coding region has been clearly recognized (17Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Google Scholar). The adenine/uridine-rich elements (AREs), 1The abbreviations used are: AREs, adenine/uridine rich-elements; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; AUBP, ARE-binding protein; b-ARE, bcl-2 ARE; b-RNA, bcl-2 3′-UTR RNA; myc-RNA, myc 3′-UTR RNA; IL-2 RNA, IL-2 3′-UTR RNA; DIG, digoxigenin; IGFR, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; rSS, rat somatostatin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; rBcl-2, human recombinant Bcl-2; rMyc, human recombinant Myc; DRB, 5,6 dichloro-1-(d-ribofuranosyl)-benzimidazole; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; UVCA, UV-cross-linking assay; nt, nucleotides. identified in a large number of genes, including immediate-early genes (18Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Google Scholar), cell-cycle genes (19Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar), and cytokines and their receptors (20Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Google Scholar), are discrete nucleotide structures located in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs. The importance attributed to ARE results from the discovery of its specific fine-tuning of steady-state levels of many transcripts effectively regulating the level of the encoded protein products in cells (21Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Google Scholar, 22Nair A.P. Hirsch H.H. Colombi M. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 889-898Google Scholar). Actually, ARE functions as the binding site for a number of proteins, the adenine/uridine binding elements or AUBPs (23Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Brewer G. Bevilacqua A.

Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Google Scholar). In previous studies we described an ARE located in the 3′-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA (b-RNA) whose nucleotide structure is similar to the ARE in GM-CSF mRNA (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar) and is required for bcl-2 mRNA decay in vivo (28Capaccioli S. Quattrone A. Schiavone N. Calastretti A. Copreni E. Bevilacqua A. Canti G. Gong L. Morelli S. Nicolin A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 105-115Google Scholar). We have also shown that the activation of an apoptotic program specifically induces ARE-dependent bcl-2 mRNA degradation (29Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Google Scholar). Until now, specific ribonuclease activity in extracts of cells from different lineages has not been evaluated using a transcript carrying the ARE motif. It is possible that the nuclease specificity or efficiency in different lineages regulates the amount of the Bcl-2 protein. It might be of practical importance to understand the determinants of mRNA decay of genes such as bcl-2, expressed at different levels in tissue-specific programs (30Lind E.F. Wayne J. Wang Q.Z. Staeva T. Stolzer A. Petrie H.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5374-5379Google Scholar) or under different metabolic conditions (31Garland J.M. Rudin C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1235-1246Google Scholar). Cell-free degradation assays have been very useful in analyzing mRNA turnover (32Ross J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 459-476Google Scholar, 33DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Jeanteur P. Progress in Molecular & Subcellular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1997: 65-91Google Scholar), and important findings have been made in recent years by taking advantage of such systems (34Doyle G.A. Betz N.A. Leeds P.F. Fleisig A.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5036-5044Google Scholar, 35Wang Z.R. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Google Scholar, 26Chen C.Y. Gherzi R.

Here, we investigated the elements that regulate either the decay rate of the ARE-containing b-RNA in cis or in trans, taking advantage of an in vitro degradation assay. In addition to defining the essential cis elements required for the exonuclease activity, an essential role was found for Bcl-2 protein in activating the degradation machinery on the relevant target. Cell lines, Culture Conditions, and Drug Treatment—Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum added under standard conditions. Viability was monitored by the trypan blue exclusion assay. The following cell lines were used: three human follicular t (14, 18)-positive B-cell lymphomas DOHH2 (36Kluin-Nelemans H.C. Limpens J.

Jurkat-NEO and Jurkat-BCL-2 cells are polyclonal populations of G418-resistant Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells that were transfected with pZIP-NEO and pZIP-Bcl-2 plasmid DNA, respectively, as described previously (47Torigoe T. Millan J.A. Takayama S. Taichman R. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4851-4854Google Scholar). Plasmids—The 5′-primer AGATCTAGTCAACATGCCTGC and the 3′-primer GGATCCGGTGATCCGGCCAACAAC (flanked at the 5′-end by BglII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively) were used in PCR to amplify the 396-bp U1 segment containing the 3′-UTR ARE sequence from the human bcl-2 cDNA fragment (48Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Google Scholar). This segment was cloned in the TA cloning site of the pCRII plasmid according to the TA Cloning Kit specification (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), to produce the pCR-U1 plasmid. A fragment from this plasmid amplified with the 5′-primer GACCATGGGTCGAATCAGCTATTTAC and the 3′-primer GACCCGGGGATTTCCAAAGACAGGAG was subcloned in pCRII to produce the pCR-U3 plasmid used for in vitro transcription of b-ARE. pCR-U1 was also amplified with the following pairs of primers: 5′-primer AGATCTAGTCAACATGCCTGC/3′-primer TTCGACGTTTTGCCTGAAGACT; and 5′-primer CAAAACGTCGAACGACCACTAATTGCCAAGC/3′ primer GGATCCGGTGATCCGGCCAACAAC. The PCR products are partially complementary, so they were annealed and subsequently amplified with the external primers to generate the Δb-RNA fragment. It was cloned in plasmid pCRII to produce plasmid pCR-U2. A 394-bp segment of the human c-myc 3′-UTR, was obtained by PCR amplification using 5′-GCGGGGCCCACTTTTTTATGCTTACCATC-3′ and 5′-GCGCCCGGGCAATAGAAAAAAATCAACTT-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplification product of the myc 3′-UTR segment was inserted into the cloning vector pGEMT, provided with the easy vector system (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy), to obtain pGEMT-MYC-RNA. A DNA fragment containing the 3′-UTR of IL-2 (590–780 bp) was subcloned between the HincII and KpnI sites of pCY2 as described previously (49Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref Google Scholar). The control plasmids pTRI-IGFR and pTRI-GAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX) were linearized with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Amersham Biosciences) and used for in vitro transcription reactions with SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy). The pTRI-GAPDH-Rat antisense control template contains a 316-bp fragment of the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene that is derived from exons 5–8. The pTRI-IGFR-human transcription template contains a 276-bp cDNA fragment of the human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor gene, which spans exons 7–8 in the antisense orientation. The pSS transcription plasmid, obtained by cloning rat somatostatin cDNA into plasmid pSP65 (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy), was kindly provided by Dr. A. Torsello. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunodepletion—Cells (20 × 106) were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C; the pellet was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.25 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris acetate, 40 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol; after autoclaving, we added 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.57 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were vortexed, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used immediately or frozen. Protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). S100 preparation from Jurkat cells and immunodepletion were performed as described previously (26Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Transcripts were synthesized in vitro using SP6 or T7 (for pGEMT-MYC-RNA) RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Italia) incorporating DIG-labeled NTPs (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). The 32P transcripts were obtained as described previously (49Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref Google Scholar). In Vitro Degradation System—The degradation reaction mixture contained 1 μg of lysate, 10 μg of carrier tRNA, and 5 ng of transcript for each time point. Samples of 3 μl of degradation reaction mixture were taken and mixed into 10 μl of urea buffer (7 m urea, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.35 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mg/ml carrier tRNA). 10 μl of phenol/chloroform (1:1), 30 μl of deionized formamide, and 5.75 μl of gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) were added, the mixture was vortexed, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and transferred to a nylon filter (Amersham Biosciences) by a Semi-Dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The DIG-labeled transcripts were detected with the digoxigenin system (Roche Diagnostics). For competition experiments, 0.3 μg of cell extract were incubated on ice for 10 min with unlabeled competitor RNAs in 100-fold molar excess over labeled transcript before the incubation with DIG-labeled RNA. In the experiments using rBcl-2, corresponding to amino acids 1–205 of Bcl-2 of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the cellular extracts (4 μg) were preincubated with rBcl-2 at 25 °C for 10 min and then incubated with the transcripts. Recombinant Myc protein (rMyc), corresponding to amino acids 1–262 of Myc of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used as control. In vitro analysis of 32P-labeled RNA decay was described previously (49Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref Google Scholar). Determination of bcl-2 mRNA Decay in Cells—Cells were treated with the transcription blocker 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuransoylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml for 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted at the indicated times using the NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) in order to avoid possible DNA contamination. The purity and integrity of the RNA were checked spectroscopically and by gel electrophoresis, respectively, before carrying out the analytical procedures. Levels of bcl-2 and GAPDH mRNAs were determined by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. For synthesis of cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Random Hexamers (Promega Italia) using standard manufacturer's conditions. The RT reaction was split into 2 PCR reactions with 2 sets of specific primers. The PCR primer sequences are as follows: bcl-2 (139-bp PCR product) forward: 5′-GTCATGTGTGTGGAGAGCGT-3′ and reverse: 5′-ACAGTTCCACAAAGGCATCC-3′; GAPDH (195-bp PCR product) forward: 5′-ATGACAACTTTGGTATCGTG-3′ and reverse: 5′-CAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCA-3′. The PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl in a Hybaid Omn-E thermal cycler under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min (94 °C for 2 min in the initial cycle), annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final step of 7 min at 72 °C. For every oligonucleotide pair, a preliminary analysis was conducted to define the appropriate range of cycles consistent with an exponential increase in the amount of the DNA product. For each sample 20 μl of PCR amplification product were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. A standard DNA molecular weight ladder (GeneRuler 100-bp DNA Ladder, M-Medical, Genenco, Firenze, Italy) was run to provide appropriately sized markers. The amount of each amplification product was determined by densitometer analysis. The mRNA half-life was determined from a semilogarithmic transformation of the densitometric data plotted against the time of incubation with DRB. Western Blot Analysis—Samples of 4 × 106 cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of lysis buffer (ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with freshly added protease inhibitors), vortexed for 3 s, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at high speed for 20 min at 4 °C. 5 μlofthe supernatant was removed for protein determination, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, mixed with reducing buffer, and heated to 99 °C for 2 min. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a Bio-Rad Trans-blot apparatus at 100 V for 90 min. Blots were processed by an enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL Plus) detection kit as instructed by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were probed with a mouse anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a rabbit anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (REMSA)—REMSAs were performed by incubating the radiolabeled b-RNA and Δb-RNA riboprobes (5 × 105 cpm) with 100 ng of rBcl-2, which were then digested for 20 min at room temperature with 5 units of RNase T1 (La Roche Ltd.), which cuts RNA downstream to guanosine residues into a number of fragments. Samples were separated on a native polyacrylamide gel (6% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide, 60:1). UV Cross-linking Assay (UVCA)—rBcl-2 protein was incubated with the 32P-labeled b-RNA and Δb-RNA riboprobes (109 cpm/μg, 3 × 105 cpm) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml heparan sulfate and 2 μg of tRNA in a microplate (total volume, 10 μl) at room temperature for 10 min. The RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked on ice by exposure to UVC for 5 min with 3000 milliwatts/cm2 in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Samples were incubated with RNase A (1 μl, 1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C to digest unbound RNA. Proteins were separated by 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions. The images were generated with a Cyclone imager (Packard BioScience). ARE-dependent b-RNA Degradation in Vitro—We previously reported that the bcl-2 ARE located in the 3′-UTR is a cis-acting, regulatory element that can target a reporter mRNA for degradation in vivo (29Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Google Scholar). To examine ARE-directed RNA decay in a cell-free system, 3′-UTR fragments of bcl-2 obtained by PCR were cloned in a transcription vector and used for in vitro synthesis of transcripts (Fig. 1) that were labeled by incorporation of the precursor DlG-UTP. We chose to utilize transcripts that were neither capped at the 5′-end with 7mGpppG nor polyadenylated at the 3′-end. Our rationale was to examine ARE-directed RNA decay in its simplest form in the absence of these structures, since ARE-directed degradation of an mRNA can occur in a cap-independent fashion (50Bernstein P. Ross J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 373-377Google Scholar, 51Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Google Scholar, 52Detich N. Ramchandani S. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24881-24890Google Scholar) and in the absence of a poly(A) tract (26Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Google Scholar, 53Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23144-23154Google Scholar). Thus, at least some of the steps in the ARE-directed mRNA decay pathway can be uncoupled from processes that involve the cap structure and poly(A) tract. For decay assays, unfractionated cell lysates, derived from exponentially growing cells, were mixed with the relevant transcripts and incubated at 37 °C for various times. RNA was purified and fractionated in gels for detection and analysis. The in vitro assay shown here, although reproducing findings obtained with the S100 preparations, does not require biochemical fractionations, making the comparisons of extracts from different cell sources easier. Fig. 2A shows that b-RNA was rapidly degraded by a soluble extract prepared from the DOHH2 follicular B-cell lymphoma cell line. The half-life of 30 min was calculated by plotting the intensity of the bands analyzed by densitometry (lanes 1–5 and right panel). In the same assay, the GAPDH control transcript was not significantly degraded, the calculated half-life was longer than 2 h (lanes 6–10 and right panel). The specificity of the reaction was further verified by adding to the same reaction the b-RNA and the ARE-negative IGFR control transcript for the decay assay (Fig. 2B). The two transcripts were degraded with different kinetics. The calculated half-life for the b-RNA was 30 min while that for the IGFR transcript was more than 120 min (Fig. 2B, right panel). Multiple control RNAs were used in Fig. 2, A and B in order to provide substantial evidence that ARE-negative, synthetic RNAs are not significantly degraded under these assay conditions. We conclude from Fig. 2, A and B that an ARE-containing transcript is specifically degraded in this in vitro system. To directly investigate the contribution of the bcl-2 ARE (b-ARE) to b-RNA decay in vitro, the central core of the 107-nt ARE was deleted (Δb-RNA). Δb-RNA was incubated with the DOHH2 extract for the decay assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, the Δb-RNA lacking the consensus sequence degraded more slowly (half-life, 75 min) than the wild-type b-RNA (half-life, 30 min). This result suggests that, while the b-ARE is required for b-RNA decay, ARE-flanking regions in the 3′-UTR contribute to the full destabilizing potency of the bcl-2 3′-UTR. The relevance of b-ARE shown in these studies prompted us to evaluate its decay kinetics. The b-ARE transcript and an unrelated transcript were prepared and incubated with the DOHH2 extract. Fig. 2D shows that the b-ARE was degraded much faster than the control RNA. The calculated 40–45 min half-life of b-ARE shows the crucial relevance of b-ARE for the nuclease activity (Fig. 2D, right panel). There was no measurable degradation of both transcripts when incubated under the same conditions in buffer alone. The effects of competitor RNAs on b-RNA degradation in vitro were next evaluated. Extracts were preincubated with up to a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled b-RNA or with equivalent amounts of a 500-nt rat somatostatin (rSS) synthetic RNA for 10 min prior to adding DIG-labeled b-RNA. Reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for various times to assess RNA decay. Fig. 2E shows the effects of the competitors on the half-life of the labeled b-RNA in the decay assays. The unlabeled b-RNA competitor slowed the decay rate significantly in a dose-responsive fashion compared with the somatostatin RNA (compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3 and 7–9). Table I summarizes these results together with the measured half-lives of all the transcripts used. Taken together, these results suggest that the b-ARE may function through interactions with one or more factors that specifically recognize the ARE.Table IDegradation of b-RNA, mutated and control transcripts incubated with the DOHH2cell extractSynthetic RNAHalf-lifeminb-RNA30 ± 3Δb-RNA75 ± 11b-ARE45 ± 6b-RNA + b-RNA unlabeled>120b-RNA + rSS unlabeled40 ± 4GAPDH>120IGFR>120 Open table in a new tab Decay Activity of Extracts from Different Cell Lines—Using this cell-free mRNA decay system, b-RNA decay was investigated using extracts from a variety of human cell lines representing a spectrum of cell types. Our two goals were, first, to validate the cell-free system by comparing the relative decay rates obtained in vitro with those obtained in whole cells and, second, to determine if cell type-specific degradation of b-RNA occurs. The decay kinetics of RNA in extracts derived from different cell types, evaluated during a 60-min time course, are shown in Fig. 3. Although extracts from all the cell lines degraded b-RNA faster than the control IGFR RNA (half-life >120 min), the b-RNA half-lives varied widely as shown at the left in Fig. 3. Extracts from the three cell lines containing a t (14, 18) translocation (DOHH2, DHL-4, and Karpas 422) and the two neuroblastoid cell lines (LAN-5 and SHSY5Y) displayed the fastest decay rates (b-RNA half-life: 25–30 min). Extracts from the B- and T-lymphoid cell lines (Namalwa, Raji, and MOLT-4) displayed intermediate decay rates (b-RNA half-life: 50–60 min), and extracts from myeloid (HL60) and epithelial (MCF-7) cell lines displayed the slowest decay rates (b-RNA half-life: 70–80 min). These differences were not due to differences in the quality of the extracts, since at least three preparations for each cell line were assayed, and the decay of the stable IGFR RNA was included as a standard control (Table II).Table IIComparison of b-RNA half-life in vitro and cellular Bcl-2 protein levelsCELL LINE extractb-RNA half-lifeIGFR half-lifeBCL-2 levelminminDOHH230 ± 3>120+ + + (57Steube K.G.
