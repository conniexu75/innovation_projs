https://openalex.org/W2069027872,"The scavenger receptor, class B, type 1 receptor (SR-BI) mediates the selective transport of lipids from high density lipoprotein to cells. We describe the structure and subchromosomal location of human SR-BI and provide evidence that it is regulated by the transcription factor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). SR-BI resides on chromosome 12q24.2-qter, spans approximately 75 kilobase pairs, and contains 13 exons. RNA blot analysis of human tissues reveals an expression pattern similar to that described previously for rodents with the highest levels of mRNA in the adrenal gland, ovary, and liver. Unlike rodents, human SR-BI was expressed at high levels in the placenta. The transcription start site for SR-BI was mapped, and DNA sequence analysis revealed a binding site for SF-1 in the proximal 5'-flanking sequence. SF-1, an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor gene family, plays a key role in the regulation of steroidogenesis and is expressed at high levels in steroidogenic tissues. SF-1 binds to the SR-BI promoter in a sequence-specific manner, and efficient transcription from this promoter in adrenocortical Y1 cells is dependent on an intact SF-1 site. These data extend our understanding of SF-1 function within steroidogenic tissues and suggest that SR-BI, which serves to supply selected tissues with lipoprotein-derived lipids, is part of the repertoire of SF-1-responsive genes involved in steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2015391531,"Cox17p was previously shown to be essential for the expression of cytochrome oxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present study COX17 has been placed under the control of the GAL10 promoter in an autonomously replicating plasmid. A yeast transformant harboring the high copy construct was used to purify Cox17p to homogeneity. Purified Cox17p contains 0.2–0.3 mol of copper per mol of protein. The molar copper content is increased to 1.8 after incubation of Cox17p in the presence of a 6-fold molar excess of cuprous chloride under reduced conditions. An antibody against Cox17p was obtained by immunization of rabbits with a carboxyl-terminal peptide coupled to bovine serum albumin. The antiserum detects Cox17p in both the mitochondrial and soluble protein fractions of wild type yeast and of the transformant overexpressing Cox17p. Exposure of intact mitochondria to hypotonic conditions causes most of Cox17p to be released as a soluble protein indicating that the mitochondrial fraction of Cox17p is localized in the intermembrane space. These results are consistent with the previously proposed function of Cox17p, namely in providing cytoplasmic copper for mitochondrial utilization.

These results are consistent with the previously proposed function of Cox17p, namely in providing cytoplasmic copper for mitochondrial utilization. Cox17p is a low molecular weight protein of yeast (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (2Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in COX17 cause a respiratory defect stemming from a specific deficiency in cytochrome oxidase, the activity of which depends on the presence of copper (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The ability of high concentrations of copper in the growth medium to rescue the mutant phenotype indicated that the COX17 gene product is involved in mitochondrial copper metabolism, most likely by targeting cytoplasmic copper to the organelle (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A role of Cox17p in copper homeostasis is also supported by its small size and high cysteine content, both features being common to other copper proteins such as metallothioneins (3Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Atx1p (4Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The latter has recently been shown to mediate the transfer copper to Ccc2p (5Lin S.-J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which functions in the maturation of the high affinity iron transporter Fet3p (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of Cox17p in cytochrome oxidase assembly we undertook to purify the protein with the aim of confirming its metal-binding properties and to eventually develop an in vitro system for studying the mechanism of copper addition to apocytochrome oxidase. Here we report a procedure capable of yielding a homogeneous preparation of Cox17p from a strain of yeast transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing COX17 under GAL10 regulation. The availability of pure Cox17p together with an antibody against a 20-amino acid long carboxyl-terminal peptide has enabled us to quantitate the cellular concentration of the protein, to study its subcellular distribution, and to demonstrate its ability to bind copper. Cox17 was purified from W303ΔCOX17/ST31, a strain of S. cerevisiae with a cox17 null allele (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), transformed with the multicopy plasmid pG74/ST31 (see below for the construction of this plasmid. The wild type parent for this strain is W303-1B (MATαade2-1 his3− leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1). The media used to grow yeast have been described elsewhere (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An 0.8-kilobase pair HindIII fragment containing COX17 was ligated to the HindIII site of YEp52 (7Broach J.R. Li Y.-Y. Wu L.-C.C. Jayaram M. Inouye M. Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression. Academic Press, New York1983: 83-117Crossref Google Scholar) yielding pG74/ST30, placing the gene behind the GAL10promoter. To further increase the level of expression of COX17, this plasmid was modified by introducing a 4.8-kilobase pair BamHI fragment with GAL4 under the control of the ADH1 promoter. The configuration of the two genes in the plasmid, pG74/ST31, is shown in Fig.1. The 20-mer NFIEKYKECMKGYGFEVPSAN, synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. by a modification of the method of Hancock and Evan (8Hancock D.C. Evan G.I Methods Mol. Biol. 1992; 10: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide (20 mg) was dissolved in 30 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, the reduced peptide was separated from dithiothreitol by passage through a Sephadex G-25 desalting column. Fractions absorbing at 280 nm were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml with a final yield of 12.5 mg of protein. BSA (30 mg) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of 10 mmKPO4, pH 7.5, dialyzed against the same buffer for 1.5 h, and activated by slow addition of 0.23 ml of the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 3-maleimidobenzoic acid dissolved in dimethylformamide at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and passed through a Sephadex G-25 desalting column. Fractions with the activated BSA were pooled, concentrated in a SpeedVac, and adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1m NaOH. Coupling was effected at a protein ratio of 4 mg of peptide per 5 mg of BSA by overnight incubation at room temperature. Analysis of the product by PAGE indicated that most of the peptide had been conjugated. This solution was used as antigen after the addition of 0.1 volume of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Rabbits were initially inoculated with 3 mg of protein in complete Freund's adjuvant. After 4 weeks they were boosted at 2-week intervals, the first two times with 1 mg of protein followed by 0.1 mg of protein. Maximal titer was attained 16–20 weeks after the initial injection. W303ΔCOX17/ST31 is grown overnight in 100 ml of YPD medium. The overnight culture (15 ml) is transferred to 800 ml of YPD containing 75 μm CuSO4 and grown for 17 h at 30 °C with shaking. Cells are harvested under semi-sterile conditions by centrifugation at 800 × g av, inoculated to 800 ml of YPGal supplemented with copper (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 75 μm CuSO4), and shaken at 30 °C for 6–8 h. At this stage the culture is stored in the cold overnight for further processing. The following procedure is based on cells obtained from 20 flasks, equivalent to 16 liters of medium. Cells are harvested at 800 ×g av and washed with 1.5 liters of 1.2m sorbitol. The yield should be 200–300 g of cells, wet weight. The washed cells are suspended in Zymolyase digestion buffer (30 ml per 10 g of cells). The Zymolyase buffer consists of 1.2 m sorbitol, 30 mmKPO4, pH 7.5, 0.15 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml Zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biochemicals). The cell suspension is incubated at 37 °C for 2 h or until at least 80–90% of the cells have been converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplast suspension is centrifuged at 2,600 × g av for 10 min in a Sorvall centrifuge and washed twice with 1 liter of 1.2 m sorbitol. The spheroplasts are lysed in 600 ml of 0.4 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized in a Waring blendor for 40 s. The suspension is centrifuged at 640 ×g av for 10 min. The supernatant is separated from the loose pellet and centrifuged a second time in the same way to remove any remaining cells debris. The supernatant from step 3 is centrifuged at 14,700 × g av for 30 min to sediment mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant obtained from this centrifugation contains most of the Cox17p expressed from the plasmid. The post-mitochondrial supernatant can be stored at −80 °C before proceeding to the next step. Solid ammonium sulfate is added to the post-mitochondrial supernatant to bring it to 55% saturation. The precipitate is removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g av for 20 min, and the supernatant is adjusted to 80% saturation in ammonium sulfate. The 55–80% ammonium sulfate precipitate is collected by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g av for 20 min, dissolved in the minimum volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (30–40 mg of protein/ml), and desalted on a 480-ml column of Sephadex G-50 (fine) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. Cox17p elutes as a trail after the main peak (Fig.2). Fractions containing Cox17p clear of the main peak are pooled. The pool from step 5 is applied to an 8-ml Pharmacia Mono Q (FPLC) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Following sample loading, the column is washed with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl and 80 ml of a 0.050m to 0.4 m linear NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions of 8 ml are collected and analyzed for Cox17p. Generally the protein is spread over 5 fractions between 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCl that are pooled and concentrated on a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad HTP gel) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After sample loading, the buffer is changed to 150 mm KPO4, pH 7.5. Fractions of 1 ml are collected. Cox17p elutes in approximately 4 ml as a single protein peak. The concentrated fraction from step 6 is loaded at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min on a 22-ml column (1 cm in diameter) of Red Sepharose (“Procion,” Pharmacia type RL-6B). The column is equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Cox17p does not adsorb on this column, and its elution is best monitored by silver staining. Contaminating proteins are recovered as a second protein peak. The pooled fractions from the Sepharose Red column are concentrated on the Mono Q column (equilibrated in 20 mm Tris pH 7.5). The protein is eluted with 0.35m NaCl and diluted with 4 volumes of 0.05% solution of trifluoroacetic acid. The sample is loaded on a 1 × 25 cm C4 reverse-phase HPLC column (Primesphere 5 μ, Phenomenex, CA) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The column is developed with a linear 0–50% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Cox17p elutes as a single peak at 30–35% acetonitrile. All the contaminating proteins elute between 35–50% acetonitrile. Copper was assayed by a modification of the method of Felsenfeld (9Felsenfeld G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 87: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Samples of protein adjusted to 2.1 ml with water were treated with 0.23 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide and heated at 90 °C for 3 min. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 400 × g avfor 5 min. The following reagents were added sequentially with mixing following transfer of 2 ml of the clarified solution to a fresh tube: 1) 0.5 ml of 0.25% 2,2′-biquinoline in glacial acetic acid, 2) 0.1 ml of 10% hydroxylamine, 3) 0.5 ml of saturated sodium acetate. The copper biquinoline complex was extracted into 0.6 ml of isoamyl alcohol by vigorous mixing for 15 s. The upper phase was separated by centrifugation at 400 × g av, transferred to a spectrophotometer cuvette, and clarified by addition of 30 μl of ethanol. Absorbance was read at 535 nm against a reagent blank treated as above. The concentration of copper was estimated from a standard curve obtained from a known solution of cupric sulfate. For the localization and distribution of Cox17p, yeast mitochondria with intact outer membranes were prepared by the method of Glick and Pon (10Glick B. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction after sedimentation of mitochondria was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g av for 10 min. The 100,000 × gsupernatant is referred to as the post-mitochondrial supernatant. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by PAGE with the buffer system of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The concentration of acrylamide used was generally 15% with 15% glycerol added to the separation gel. Western blots were treated with antibodies against the Cox17p carboxyl-terminal peptide followed by a second reaction with125I-protein A (13Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier experiments, Cox17p was detected as a biotinylated protein with a 7-kDa carboxyl-terminal extension containing a bacterial biotinylation signal (15Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of the biotin tag was necessitated by the lack of an antibody against Cox17p. Most of the biotinylated Cox17p was found in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction, corresponding to the soluble cytosolic proteins of yeast. This was true irrespective of whether the COX17/BIO fusion gene was expressed from a multicopy plasmid or from a single chromosomally integrated copy of the gene (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The availability of an antibody against Cox17p made it possible to re-examine the subcellular localization of the native protein. These studies were done with the parental wild type strain W303-1B and with W303ΔCOX17/ST31, a cox17 null mutant transformed with the wild type gene on an episomal plasmid (this strain will be referred to as “ST31 transformant”). The results of the Western analyses indicated that a substantial fraction of the protein is associated with mitochondria in both the wild type and the ST31 transformant (Fig.3). The relative distributions of the protein in mitochondria and in the soluble post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions are different in the two strains. The concentrations of Cox17p in mitochondria and post-mitochondrial supernatants of wild type yeast are 0.65 μg and 0.04 μg of Cox17p per mg of protein, respectively. When normalized to the total protein recovered in the two fractions, these values indicate that approximately 60% of Cox17p is associated with mitochondria and 40% with the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction. It is unlikely that the Cox17p detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant is due to leakage. Western blot analysis of cytochrome b 2failed to detect this intermembrane protein in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction even when as much as 200 μg of protein of this fraction was applied to a single lane of a polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). The concentrations of Cox17p in the ST31 transformant are 8 times higher in mitochondria and 100 times higher in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction. The transformant, therefore, has 9 times more Cox17p in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction than in mitochondria. The presence of 90% of Cox17p in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction of the ST31 transformant is also inconsistent with leakage of the protein from mitochondria during their preparation, but rather it suggests a limit to the amount of protein that can be taken up by the organelle. The difference in the subcellular distribution of native and biotinylated Cox17p is surprising based on other studies in which the presence of the amino-terminal extension with the biotinylation sequence did not affect correct targeting/localization of the proteins (16Ackerman S. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nobrega F.G. Nobrega M.P. Tzagoloff A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All of the previously biotin-tagged proteins were inner membrane or matrix constituents that are translocated by the energy-dependent protein transport machinery of mitochondria (20Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cox17p differs from these proteins in lacking a mitochondrial import sequence and in having an intermembrane localization (see below). The absence of both a normal matrix targeting presequence and of an intermembrane sorting presequence (21Rospert S. Muller S. Schatz G. Glick B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17279-17288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gruhler A. Ono H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in Cox17p suggests that, like cytochrome c (23Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it may be internalized by a different mechanism. The presence of a 7-kDa sequence could be inhibitory to this process. The purification of Cox17p was attempted from several sources. Attempts to obtain the protein from a strain of E. coli transformed with COX17 on a high expression vector were unsuccessful. The best source of the protein was the post-mitochondrial supernatant of the ST31 transformant. Although the ST31 transformant was routinely grown in medium supplemented with 75 μm CuSO4, the addition of extra metal did not affect the copper content of the purified protein. Cox17p was also purified from the mitochondrial fraction of the transformant and from the post-mitochondrial supernatant of commercial bakers' yeast. The yield of protein on a cell weight basis from the commercial source is about 100 times less, thereby requiring manipulation of much larger volumes. In the absence of a functional assay for Cox17 it was necessary to use an immunological method of detection during the purification. As indicated in Table I, size separation of the 55–80% ammonium sulfate precipitate on Sephadex G-50 achieves a substantial initial purification of Cox17p. To minimize contamination by the major peak corresponding to proteins excluded by the sieving column, some loss of Cox17p is incurred (Fig. 2). Chromatography of the pool from Sephadex G-50 on Mono Q followed by a negative Red Sepharose step removes most of the contaminating proteins. The low levels of extraneous proteins still present at this stage are separated on a C4 reverse phase column (Fig. 4). The purification procedure results in a 240-fold increase in the signal relative to protein as judged by Western blot analysis, with a final yield of 8–10% (Table I).Table IPurification and recovery of Cox17pFractionTotal proteinCox17p1-aThe concentration of Cox17p was determined by quantitative Western blot analysis. Purified Cox17p was used to obtain a standard curve relating amounts of protein to the density of the signals obtained with the antiserum against the carboxyl-terminal peptide.

Open table in a new tab The purity of Cox17p obtained either from the post-mitochondrial supernatant or mitochondria was confirmed by protein sequencing. The amino-terminal 5 residues matched the sequence encoded by COX17 starting from the second residue (threonine). The molar yield of amino acids was consistent with the amount of protein sequenced. There was no evidence of secondary contaminating sequences. The absence of the initiator methionine in the protein indicates that this residue is processed. Cox17p migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 4). The discrepancy in size is unlikely to be due to modifications or dimerization of the protein because the mass measured by mass spectrometry is in accord with the molecular weight calculated from the translated gene sequence. The copper content of purified Cox17p was determined colorimetrically with 2,2-biquinoline as a copper-specific chelator and by atomic emission. Both methods yielded comparable values of 0.3 mol of copper per mol of protein. The latter method also failed to detect any cobalt, nickel, or zinc in the protein. Based on its cysteine content Cox17p is expected to bind 2–3 mol eq of copper. The substoichiometric recovery of copper in the final protein suggests that the metal is lost during the purification procedure. The copper binding capacity of Cox17p was assessed by reconstitution of dithiothreitol-reduced protein with cuprous chloride under limiting oxygen to prevent reoxidation. Under these conditions 1.8 mol of copper was bound per mol of protein. No binding occurred when cupric sulfate was used under aerobic conditions. The Sephadex G-25 chromatography step used in the reconstitution achieves a complete separation of free from protein-bound copper (Fig. 5). Chromatography of the reconstituted protein on the sieving column leads to a release of most of the bound copper, indicating a low binding constant for the metal. This would suggest that the real stoichiometry of copper binding is probably greater than that measured by this method. Cox17p purified from the mitochondrial fraction of the ST31 transformant also had a copper content of approximately 0.3 mol/mol of protein. As indicated above, 60% of Cox17p in wild type yeast is detected in mitochondria. It was of interest to determine whether the protein is located in the matrix or intermembrane space. Mitochondria prepared under conditions favoring maximal integrity of the outer membrane (10Glick B. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) were diluted either with buffered sorbitol or with buffer alone to induce rupturing of the outer membrane. The membrane fractions (mitochondria or mitoplasts) were separated from the soluble proteins released by the two treatments and the distributions of Cox17p, an intermembrane marker (cytochrome b 2), and a matrix protein (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) were assessed by Western blot analysis. Almost all of Cox17p, cytochrome b 2, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase remained associated with mitochondria diluted in the presence of an osmotically stabilizing concentration of sorbitol (Fig.6). Approximately 60% of Cox17p, however, was released into the soluble protein fraction when mitochondria were diluted in the absence of sorbitol. In contrast virtually all of cytochrome b 2 was recovered in the supernatant indicating quantitative lysis of the outer membrane. As expected all of α-ketoglutarate, the matrix marker, remained associated with the mitoplast fraction. The solubilization of most of Cox17p by the hypotonic treatment indicates that the protein is located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (10Glick B. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The complete release of cytochrome b 2 by the osmotic shock of mitochondria indicates that the Cox17p recovered in the membrane fraction is not due to partial lysis of the outer membrane. The fraction of Cox17p present in the mitoplasts is not located in the matrix compartment because of its susceptibility to proteinase K. An alternative explanation to account for its incomplete release is that a fraction of Cox17p may be physically complexed to another component of mitochondria. It is unlikely that Cox17p is bound to Sco1p since its relative distribution is not altered in yeast harboring SCO1on a multicopy plasmid (data not shown). In addition to high concentrations of copper in the medium, the cytochrome oxidase deficiency of cox17 mutants can be partially suppressed by SCO1 when present on a high copy plasmid (24Glerum D.M.

Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to be essential for expression of cytochrome oxidase. These observations were taken to indicate that Sco1p functions in the pathway of copper addition to apocytochrome oxidase (24Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A role of Sco1p in mitochondrial copper metabolism was also supported by the presence in the protein of a domain with sequence similarity to subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (24Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This domain includes two conserved cysteine residues that are known to be copper ligands of subunit 2 (26Tomitake T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Sco1p is an insoluble protein of mitochondria that was localized in the inner membrane (27Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extra membrane domain of Sco1p probably faces the intermembrane space. This is supported by the sensitivity of Sco1p to proteinase K in mitoplasts but not in intact mitochondria (Fig.7). This suggests that the proposed copper binding site of Sco1p and the copper site of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (26Tomitake T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar) face the same mitochondrial compartment as Cox17p. Such a localization would be in accord with our previous model in which Cox17p targets copper specifically to mitochondria by transferring the metal to Sco1p. At present it is still not clear whether Sco1p is a carrier that transports copper to the matrix or whether it acts as a transferase that adds copper directly to cytochrome oxidase. If copper addition occurs after membrane insertion of subunit 2, a role of Sco1p as a copper transferase would the more attractive of the two models (Fig. 8). Since cytochrome oxidase is the only known copper-containing protein of yeast mitochondria, it is not clear whether the presence of copper in the matrix is required.Figure 8Models of the roles of Cox17p and Sco1p in cytochrome oxidase assembly. The model assumes that Cox17p shuttles between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space of mitochondria where it delivers copper to Sco1p. In the upper half of the cartoon, Sco1p functions as a carrier that translocates copper to the matrix. In the lower half Sco1p transfers copper to the copper-bearing subunits 1 and 2 of cytochrome oxidase. The steps between the Ctr1p-dependent uptake of copper (28Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D.

Neurturin is a GDNF-related neurotrophin whose receptor is presently unknown. Here we report that neurturin can bind to either GFRα-1 or GFRα-2, a novel receptor related to GFRα-1. Both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 mediate neurturin-induced Ret phosphorylation. GDNF can also bind to either GFRα-1 or GFRα-2, and activate Ret in the presence of either binding receptor. Although both ligands interact with both receptors, cells expressing GFRα-1 bind GDNF more efficiently than neurturin, while cells expressing GFRα-2 bind neurturin preferentially. Cross-linking and Ret activation data also suggest that while there is cross-talk, GFRα-1 is the primary receptor for GDNF and GFRα-2 exhibits a preference for neurturin. We have also cloned a cDNA that apparently codes for a third member of the GFRα receptor family. This putative receptor, designated GFRα-3, is closely related in amino acid sequence and is nearly identical in the spacing of its cysteine residues to both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2. Analysis of the tissue distribution of GFRα-1, GFRα-2, GFRα-3, and Ret by Northern blot reveals overlapping but distinct patterns of expression.

Recently, a novel neurotrophic factor called neurturin that is 42% identical in amino acid sequence to GDNF was reported (16Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Nature. 1996; 384: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Both GDNF and neurturin are synthesized in pre-pro forms and their precursor molecules are proteolytically processed to yield mature proteins of about 100 amino acids that assemble into disulfide-linked homodimers (7Lin L.H. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar, 16Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Nature. 1996; 384: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Seven cysteine residues are present in both GDNF and neurturin and their spacing is identical (16Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J.

Although the biological activities of neurturin have not yet been thoroughly investigated, initial results indicate that they are very similar to those of GDNF. Both neurturin and GDNF have been shown to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons derived from the superior cervical ganglia and of sensory neurons of both the nodose and dorsal root ganglia (1Yan Q.

The striking structural and biological similarities between GDNF and neurturin suggest that their action may be mediated by the same or related receptors. The receptor for GDNF consists of a complex ofGDNF Family Receptorα-1 (GFRα-1, previously abbreviated as GDNFR-α) and the Ret protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L.

GFRα-1 binds to GDNF but cannot signal independently since it lacks a cytoplasmic domain. GDNF signaling is accomplished via association of the complex of GDNF and GFRα-1 with Ret, resulting in activation of the Ret kinase. GFRα-1 mRNA is widely distributed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues and is expressed throughout embryonic development to adulthood, implying a broad spectrum of biological functions (23Treanor J.J. Goodman L. de-Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S. Goddard A. Moore M.W. Buj-Bello A. Davies A.M. Asai N. Takahashi M. Vandlen R.

Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Ret mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in the kidney (26Pachnis V. Mankoo B. Costantini F.

Targeted disruption of the ret gene in knockout mice results in severe phenotypic defects, including renal agenesis or severe dysgenesis and lack of the entire enteric nervous system (35Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). These defects are very similar to those caused by GDNF null mutations (36Moore M.W. Klein R.D. Farinas I. Sauer H. Armanini M. Phillips H. Reichardt L.F. Ryan A.M. Carver-Moore K. Rosenthal A. Nature. 1996; 382: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 37Pichel J.G. Shen L. Sheng H.Z. Granholm A.C. Drago J. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.P. Saarma M. Hoffer B.J. Sariola H.

Nature. 1996; 382: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), implying that GDNF-mediated signaling through Ret is required for the development of these tissues. Much less severe defects, however, were detected in a number of neuronal structures in which both GFRα-1 and Ret were expressed, such as the trigeminal and vestibular ganglia, the facial motor nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the locus coeruleus (35Schuchardt A.

Barbacid M. Nature. 1996; 382: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). This suggests that either GDNF signaling is not required for the embryonic development of these structures, or that some unknown signaling molecules similar to GDNF or Ret may exist that can substitute for them. Alternatively, the embryonic development of these tissues may rely completely on other as yet unknown signaling systems. In this paper we report the cloning of GFRα-2 and GFRα-3, two novel receptors related to GFRα-1, and provide evidence that GFRα-2 is a receptor for both GDNF and neurturin. Our data also indicate that GFRα-1 is a receptor for neurturin as well as for GDNF. We describe a related cDNA that codes for a protein, GFRα-3, that shares significant amino acid homology with both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 and is likely to be a third member to the family of receptors for GDNF-related ligands. A search of the GenBank data base for sequences related to GFRα-1 resulted in the identification of a single related EST, H12981.Gb_Est1. Primers corresponding to nucleotides 47–65 (5′-CTGCAAGAAGCTGCGCTCC-3′) and 244–265 (5′-CTTGTCCTCATAGGAGCAGC-3′) of H12981.Gb_Est1 were synthesized and used for RT-PCR with human fetal brain mRNA (CLONTECH, catalog number 64019-1) as the template. A 218-nucleotide fragment was amplified, subcloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced. The fragment was then radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using a Random Prime DNA Labeling Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide primers described above were also used as primers for PCRs to screen DNAs isolated from 27 pools (1500 clones each) of a rat photoreceptor cDNA library (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). A single positive pool was identified, leading to the identification of an individual rat cDNA clone from this pool by hybridization to the radiolabeled human PCR fragment described above. Filters were prehybridized at 55 °C for 3.5 h in 200 ml of 6 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Following the addition of 2 × 108 cpm of the radiolabeled probe, hybridization was continued for 18 h. Filters were then washed twice for 30 min each at 55 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film overnight with an intensifying screen. The GenBank data base was searched for sequences related to GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 using the Wisconsin sequence analysis package (Wisconsin Package version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to regions near the ends of an EST AA238748.Gb_New2 were synthesized. Primers corresponding to AA238748.Gb_New2 were used for PCR screening of 83 pools of 1000 clones each from a rat E15 embryonic cDNA library. 2S. Jing, Y. Yu, M. Fang, Z. Hu, P. L. Holst, and G. M. Fox, unpublished data. A single positive pool was identified by this method, and the DNA fragment amplified from this pool was subcloned into a plasmid vector and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones from the cDNA library pool that had been identified as positive by PCR were plated on 15-cm agarose plates and replicated on duplicate nitrocellulose filters for screening by hybridization to the radiolabeled insert. Hybridization conditions were the same as those described in the preceding section. Positive clones were sequenced as described below. DNA sequencing was performed using an automated Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer and Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). Comparison of the GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 sequences with public data bases was carried out using the FASTA computer algorithm (39Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9328) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences of GFRα-1, GFRα-2, and GFRα-3 were aligned using the Lineup program. All sequence analysis programs used were included in the Wisconsin sequence analysis package (Wisconsin Package Version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Recombinant human neurturin was expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble protein sequestered into inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated, solubilized, and the neurturin protein was re-folded and purified by ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography as described previously (7Lin L.H. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). [125I]NTN (∼1800 Ci/mmol) was prepared using the purified E. coli-expressed protein by Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL; custom iodination, catalog number IMQ1057). Recombinant human GDNF was also radioiodinated by Amersham to a similar specific activity (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The isolated human GFRα-2 cDNA was subcloned into an eukaryotic expression plasmid, pBK RSV (Stratagene) to generate the GFRα-2 expression vector pHGLRSV.2 NNR-9, a cell line expressing GFRα-2, was derived from Neuro-2a cells (ATCC catalog number CCL 131) transfected with pHGLRSV. The transfection was accomplished by using the calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfected cells were selected for expression of the plasmid by growth in 400 μg/ml G418 antibiotic (Sigma). G418-resistant clones were expanded and assayed for GFRα-2 expression by Northern blot using the GFRα-2 cDNA as probe. Expression of GFRα-2 in individual clones was confirmed by binding to [125I]NTN. Binding of [125I]NTN and [125I]GDNF to NNR-9 and NGR-38 cells were carried out as described previously (40Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded 1 day before the assay in 24-well Costar tissue culture plates precoated with polyornithine at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were placed on ice for 5–10 min, washed once with ice-cold buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and incubated at 4 °C in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (washing buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 50 pm[125I]NTN or [125I]GDNF in the absence or presence of 500 nm unlabeled ligand for 4 h. Cells were washed 4 times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer and lysed with 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH. The lysates were counted in a 1470 Wizard Automatic Gamma Counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The coding regions of the first 455 amino acids of the human GFRα-1 and the first 451 residues of human GFRα-2 cDNAs were fused in-frame with a DNA fragment encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 tagged with 6 histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus (41Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12857-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These constructs were then inserted into the expression vector pBK RSV as described previously (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The GFRα-1/Fc and GFRα-2/Fc fusion constructs were transfected into 293T cells and conditioned media (CM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 0.5% fetal calf serum) containing the fusion proteins were collected 4 days after transfection. Aliquots of 1 ml of CM plus 50 μl of 1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, were incubated at 4 °C with 2 nm [125I]NTN or [125I]GDNF in the presence or absence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand for 4 h. A 40 mmbis-suberate (BS3 Pierce, Rockford, IL) stock solution in washing buffer was added to each binding mixture to a final concentration of 1 mm, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 μl of 1 m glycine and incubating at room temperature for 15 min. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and the cross-linked product was precipitated directly with 200 μl of Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The cross-linked products were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (1:200 bis:acrylamide ratio) under reducing conditions. Ret autophosphorylation was examined by immunoblot analysis as described previously (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 6-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well. Cells were washed once with binding buffer and treated with various concentrations of neurturin or GDNF (0.5 pm to 50 nm) in binding buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Treated cells and untreated controls were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% aprotinin (Sigma, catalog number A-6279), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, catalog number P-7626), 0.5 mm Na3VO4 (Fisher catalog number S454-50) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Ret antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein-A Sepharose as described (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described by Harlow and Lane (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ret receptor was detected by probing with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (UBI, catalog number 05-321) at room temperature for 2 h. The amount of Ret protein in each lane was determined by stripping and re-probing the same membrane with the anti-Ret antibody. Detection was accomplished using sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody or protein-A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, catalog number NA931) in conjunction with chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions. For blot hybridization analysis, the cloned rat GFRα-1, GFRα-2, and GFRα-3 cDNA was labeled using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat and mouse RNA blots purchased from CLONTECH were hybridized with the probe and washed at high stringency using the reagents of the ExpressHyb Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following exposure on x-ray film, the filters were stripped of probe by boiling in 0.5% SDS for 10 min and rehybridized with a β-actin probe (CLONTECH) as a control for total RNA loading. A human expressed sequence tag (EST) with significant homology to GFRα-1 was found by a search of the publicly available nucleic acid sequence data bases. 3L. Hillier, WashU-Merck EST Project, unpublished data. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the ends of this EST were synthesized and used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with human fetal brain mRNA as the template. A fragment of the expected length was isolated, labeled, and used as a hybridization probe to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. The longest clone isolated in this manner was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a 464-amino acid protein related in sequence to GFRα-1. We have named this protein GDNFFamily Receptor α-2 (GFRα-2). The oligonucleotides described above were also used to screen pools from a rat photoreceptor cDNA library (22Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo L. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) by PCR and a product of the expected length was obtained from a single pool. An individual cDNA clone from this pool was identified by hybridization to the radiolabeled human GFRα-1 PCR product and sequenced. This clone contained an open reading frame coding for a 460-amino acid peptide that is nearly identical to human GFRα-2 and almost certainly represents its rat ortholog. Publicly available sequence data bases were searched using GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 as query sequences and a short EST with homology to both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 was found. 4M. Marra, WashU-HHMI Mouse EST Project, unpublished data. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the ends of this EST were used as primers in RT-PCR with total rat embryo RNA as the template. A 225-nucleotide fragment was amplified, cloned into a plasmid vector, and sequenced to verify that it corresponded to the original GFRα-1/GFRα-2-related EST. Plasmid DNAs isolated f"

Since apoptosis involves progressive cell breakdown, we examined its effect on human keratin polypeptides 8, 18, and 19 (K8, K18, K19) that are expressed in simple-type epithelia as noncovalent type I (K18, K19) and type II (K8) heteropolymers. Apoptosis induces rapid hyperphosphorylation of most known K8/18 phosphorylation sites and delayed formation of K18 and K19 stable fragments. In contrast, K8 is resistant to proteolysis and remains associated with the K18 fragments. Transfection of phosphorylation/glycosylation-mutant K8 and K18 does not alter fragment formation. The protein domains of the keratin fragments were determined using epitope-defined antibodies, and microsequencing indicated that K18 cleavage occurs at a conserved caspase-specific aspartic acid. The fragments are found preferentially within the detergent-insoluble pool and can be generated, in a phosphorylation-independent manner, by incubating keratins with caspase-3 or with detergent lysates of apoptotic cells but not with lysates of nonapoptotic cells. Our results indicate that type I keratins are targets of apoptosis-activated caspases, which is likely a general feature of keratins in most if not all epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis. Keratin hyperphosphorylation occurs early but does not render the keratins better substrates of the downstream caspases.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Keratins are the largest IF protein subgroup and consist of more than 20 polypeptides (K1–K20) that are divided into relatively acidic type I (K9–K20) and basic type II (K1–K8) keratins (4Moll R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All epithelial cells typically express at least one type I and one type II keratin, as noncovalent obligate heteropolymers, in an epithelial cell-type specific manner. For example, simple-type epithelia preferentially express K8/18 with various levels of K19 and K20 (6Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest.

Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). Although the full scope of keratin function is not known, one clear keratin function is to help maintain epithelial cell integrity particularly upon cell stress. This role is supported by several animal studies and a growing list of human epidermal, oral, and ocular diseases that result from keratin mutations (11Fuchs E. Coulombe P.A.

Keratins undergo several modifications that are likely involved in regulating their function (reviewed in Ref. 17Omary M.B. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Price D. Intermediate Filaments, Subcellular Biochemistry Series. Plenum Publishing Co., NY1998Google Scholar), with phosphorylation being the most studied (reviewed in 18Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The use of phosphoepitope-specific antibodies has facilitated the study of IF protein phosphorylation (17Omary M.B. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Price D. Intermediate Filaments, Subcellular Biochemistry Series.

For example, antibody LJ4, which recognizes Ser(P)-73 of K8, does not stain nondividing cells by immunofluorescence but exhibits a strong signal upon induction of apoptosis using anisomycin or etoposide or during mitosis as noted in cultured cells or in mouse liver after partial hepatectomy (23Liao J. Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is asssociated with a number of ordered morphological and biochemical events that ultimately lead to cell death (29Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 30Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Central to this process is the family of “caspase” proteases that cleave at aspartic acid in the context of preferred motifs (31Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 32Fraser A. Evan G.

The importance of caspases is highlighted by the ability of short peptides, whose sequences mimic the sequence context of caspase substrates, to selectively inhibit apoptosis. Identification of in vivo caspase substrates is highly relevant in terms of understanding apoptosis in general and determining the relative importance of these substrates. The list of the caspase substrates is growing and includes pro-caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), nuclear lamins, protein kinase C-δ, MEKK-1, topoisomerases, and fodrin (31Martin S.J.

We show that apoptosis is associated with early keratin hyperphosphorylation that is later followed by preferential caspase-mediated proteolysis of type I (K18 and K19) but not type II (K8) keratins. The apoptosis-induced keratin phosphorylation, which involves most but not all known K8/18 phosphorylation sites, does not affect keratin susceptibility to degradation by the downstream caspases. In addition, K8 and K18 that are mutated at several known phosphorylation and glycosylation sites are equally susceptible to degradation in transfected cells. Our results suggest that apoptosis-induced fragment formation of K18 and K19 is likely to occur in other cytoplasmic IF proteins that have similar predicted caspase-sensitive sequences. The antibodies used were: rabbit antibodies 3055 (26Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J.

Floater and adherent cells were either mixed or separated prior to further processing. Co-transfection of human K8/18, K8/19 cDNA, or a panel of K8/18 phosphorylation and glycosylation mutants into BHK cells was done using LipofectAMINE (20Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J.

The cytosolic fraction was obtained after nitrogen cavitation followed by centrifugation, and the pellet was then solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 to obtain the subsequent fraction upon repelleting (37Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The post-Nonidet P-40 pellet was then solubilized with 1% Emp followed by pelleting to isolate the Emp fraction. Fractions were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes followed by immunoblotting (26Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or were used for immunoprecipitation (except for the final 2% SDS-solubilized pellet). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done using 12% acrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Microsequencing was done as described previously (37Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of An (16 h), followed by solubilization with 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing okadaic acid (0.5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), leupeptin (10 μm), pepstatin (10 μm), aprotinin (25 μg/ml), and EDTA (10 mm) (buffer A) (37Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min), lysates were used for immunoprecipitation of K8/18 with mAb L2A1-protein A-agarose beads. Cells (± An) were similarly solubilized with 1 mmdithiothreitol in buffer A, and this lysate was used as a protease source after pelleting. Immunoprecipitates were then incubated (3 h, 37 °C) with CPP32 buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of CPP32, or with the 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent lysates that were obtained from ± An-treated cells, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE and then staining with Coomassie Blue. Duplicate samples were transferred to a PVDF membrane followed by immunoblotting with anti-keratin antibodies. Previously, we showed that treatment of HT29 cells with An induces apoptosis (23Liao J. Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of K8/18 from An-treated HT29 cells co-precipitates two major bands of 29 and 23 kDa (termed p29 and p23), which were also noted upon cotransfection of BHK cells with K8 and K18 cDNA (Fig.1, A and B). Purification of p29 and p23 from An-treated HT29 cells or from K8/18-transfected BHK cells followed by N-terminal and internal microsequencing showed that both polypeptides represent K18 fragments with p23 being generated by cleavage at K18 Asp-237 (Fig.2). Digestion at Asp and the context of the sequence (i.e. 234VEVD) suggest that apoptosis-activated caspases are likely responsible for generating the K18 fragments. This is supported by inhibition of p29/p23 formation if An-treated HT29 cells are coincubated with cell-permeable caspase-3 (i.e. CPP32) but not with caspase-1 or calpain II inhibitors (not shown). Caspase-mediated digestion of PARP into an 85-kDa fragment (31Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 32Fraser A. Evan G.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was also noted in K8/18-transfected BHK and An-treated HT29 cells (Fig. 1 D). Anti-PARP reactivity with hamster (i.e. in BHK cells) PARP was less than that of human (i.e. in HT29 cells) (Fig. 1 D), and a similar pattern was noted using several other commercial antibodies tested (not shown). The N-terminal acetylation of keratins (39Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) coupled with our inability to obtain N-terminal sequencing of p29 suggest that p29 represents the N-terminal domain of K18. This is supported by sequencing p29 internal fragments (Fig. 2) and by immunoblotting of K8/18 precipitates that were obtained from An-treated HT29 or transfected BHK cells with K18 epitope-specific antibodies that recognize Ser(P)-33/Ser-52 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, antibodies that recognize K8 phosphorylation sites in the head (pS73) and tail (pS431) domains did not recognize p29 or p23 (Fig.1 C), and a separate anti-K18 mAb recognized p23 but not p29 (Fig. 5 B, panel b).Figure 2Microsequencing analysis of K18 p29/p23 fragments. Panel A, K8/18 immunoprecipitates were obtained from An-treated HT29 cells or from K8/18-transfected BHK cells followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, transfer to PVDF membranes, Coomassie Blue staining, and then direct N-terminal sequencing of p29 and p23. Alternatively, gel pieces containing individual p29 or p23 bands were digested with Lys-C protease, followed by HPLC separation of the released peptides, and then microsequencing of internal peptides. All derived sequences had 100% identity with human K18. Panel B, IF proteins share the structural features of N- and C-terminal globular “head” and “tail” domains, respectively, that are separated by an α-helical “rod” domain. The rod domain is divided into subdomains that are separated by short “linker” (L) regions. The K18 amino acid location of the domains, the location of Asp-237 K18 caspase cleavage, and the internally sequenced peptides of p29/p23 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Subcellular distribution of K18 fragments and summary of K8/18/19 fate upon apoptosis. Panel A, cytosolic (C), Nonidet P-40 (NP), Emp and remaining pellet (P) fractions were sequentially obtained from An-treated HT29 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Also, K8/18 precipitates were obtained from the C, NP, and Emp fractions. Aliquots of each were examined by SDS-PAGE and then Coomassie stained.Panel B, samples equivalent to those shown in panel A, lanes 1–4, were transferred to PVDF membranes and then blotted with anti-K18 pS52 (rabbit Ab 3055), anti-K18-p23 (mAb D5), anti-K8 pS73 (mAb LJ4), and anti-K8/18 (mAb 8.13). Anti-K18 pS33 (rabbit Ab 8250) and anti-K8 pS431 (mAb 5B3) had similar blotting patterns to anti-K18 pS52 and anti-K8 pS73, respectively (not shown).Panel C, schematic shows qualitative relative levels of K8, K18, p29, and p23 K18 fragments within the C, NP, Emp, and remaining pellet and summarizes the fate of K8/18/19 after induction of apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anisomycin treatment of adherent HT29 cells generates floater cells that are primarily apoptotic (as determined by annexin V and propidium iodide staining, not shown) while the remaining adherent cells are <10% apoptotic. The p29/p23 K18 fragments, that are associated with K8/18 precipitates, are found preferentially in the floater-cell apoptosis-enriched pool (Fig. 1 E, compare lane 2with lane 3). Of note, although most of K18 is cut, it still remains associated with K8/HK8 (Fig. 1 E, lane 3). A similar immunoprecipitation pattern to that in Fig. 1 E(lane 3) was also obtained using four other antibodies (three antibodies recognize K8 and one recognizes K18, not shown), thereby indicating that the p29/p23 fragments can indeed remain associated with K8. Apoptosis-induced digestion of K18 prompted us to test if similar digestion occurs in K19, which is also expressed in HT29 cells and has a similar233SVEVD potential caspase-cleavable sequence within the L1–2 domain. Comparison of K8/19 and K8/18 immunoprecipitates, that were obtained from An-treated HT29 cells, showed several unique polypeptides that are preferentially associated with K8/19 precipitates (Fig. 1 F). Of these, two major polypeptides (p28 and p20) corresponded to K19 fragments as determined using the epitope-defined anti-K19 antibodies KA4 and B/A2 (Fig. 1 F) which recognize K19 domains IB and II, respectively (see Fig. 2 B for keratin domains). The KA4 mAb recognized p28 (Fig. 1 F, double asterisk), and mAb B/A2 recognized p20 (and K19) while neither antibody recognized the p29/p23 K18 fragments (Fig. 1 F). Similarly, a panel of antibodies that recognize K8 and/or K18 did not recognize K19 or its p28/p20 fragments (not shown). The band that is indicated by a single asterisk (Fig. 1 F), which was recognized by KA4 and B/A2 antibodies, was not investigated and may correspond to an overlapping fragment or may be nonspecific since it was not seen in blots of total cell lysates (Fig.3, panel c). Similar K19 fragments were also noted after transfection of BHK cells with K8/19 and were confirmed by blotting with mAbs KA4 and B/A2 (not shown). We compared the time course of apoptosis-induced keratin proteolysis and hyperphosphorylation. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates with epitope-specific anti-phosphokeratin antibodies showed that K8 (Ser-73/431) and K18 (Ser-52) hyperphosphorylation occurs within 30 min of An exposure, whereas K18 Ser-33 phosphorylation is not significantly altered (Fig.3, panels d-g). In contrast, K18 and K19 fragments begin to appear, as analyzed in the total cell lysate or in association with K8/18 immunoprecipitates, after 4 h of An treatment (Fig. 3,panels a-c). This separation of keratin hyperphosphorylation and digestion suggests that if keratin phosphorylation plays a role in its caspase-mediated digestion then it may be by signaling downstream events and/or by improving the ability of keratins to act as caspase substrates. The role of keratin phosphorylation in its caspase-mediated digestion was tested by subjecting K8/18 precipitates that were obtained from nonapoptotic or apoptotic cells (i.e. endogenous basal and hyperphosphorylated keratins, respectively) to in vitrodigestion by CPP32 or by cell lysates that were obtained from apoptotic or nonapoptotic cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, cell lysates from nonapoptotic cells do not cleave K18 (lanes 5 and 5′) while cell lysates from apoptotic cells cleave K18 regardless of its phosphorylation state (lanes 6 and 6′). Also, CPP32 digested K18 equally well (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 3′) regardless of its source. As expected, control precipitates that were obtained from An-treated cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2′ and 4′) or that were treated with a nonapoptotic cell lysate (lane 5′) had basally associated p29/p23. The role of keratin phosphorylation in keratin fragmentation was also examined in the BHK transfection cell system by transfecting a variety of K8 and K18 mutants that correspond to known phosphorylation and glycosylation sites (20Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11820-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) followed by testing for the presence of the p29/p23 fragments. As shown in Fig. 4 B, transfection with several phosphorylation and glycosylation K8 and K18 mutants afforded similar K18 fragments to those noted upon transfection of wild-type K8/18. We examined the distribution of p29/p23 K18 fragments in the cytosolic, Nonidet P-40, Emp, and remaining pellet fractions of apoptotic HT29 cells. The majority of the K8/18 pool is associated with the Emp and pellet fractions (Fig. 5, A and B) and so is p29/p23. Almost all pellet-associated K18 is degraded as detected by Coomassie staining and immunoblotting (Fig. 5,A and B), as is K18 in floater cells (Fig.1 E). In addition, p23 is distributed in the Emp and pellet fractions (Fig. 5 B, panel b), whereas p29 is found predominantly in the pellet fraction (Fig. 5 B,panels a and d). The findings of this report are summarized in Fig. 5 C. Apoptosis results in selective caspase-mediated proteolysis of type I keratins, K18 and K19, while relatively sparing their partner type II keratin, K8. Although one K18 caspase site was defined (Asp-237) (Fig. 2), it is possible that other cut sites also occur with the potential presence of very small fragments. Given that similar caspase digestion motifs are found in other type I keratins and cytoplasmic IF proteins, it is likely that such proteolysis may be a generalized phenomenon. The time course of keratin degradation was similar to that of PARP (not shown). A significant fraction of K18 p29/p23 fragments remains associated with K8, and the majority of the K18 fragments are insoluble (Fig. 5), as normally found for K8/18 in nonapoptotic cells (17Omary M.B. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Price D. Intermediate Filaments, Subcellular Biochemistry Series. Plenum Publishing Co., NY1998Google Scholar). However, although the cytosolic and Nonidet P-40 fractions have nearly equal amounts of p29/p23, the Emp and pellet fractions contain different proportions of p29 versus p23. This difference may reflect enhanced Emp extractibility of p23versus p29 or may indicate an association of p23 with a cellular protein that is Emp-extractable. The significance of keratin fragmentation remains to be determined. The apoptosis-associated morphological changes suggest that cytoskeletal reorganization is likely to be important in facilitating these changes. Most apoptotic cells (as determined by nuclear staining) manifested keratin filament disruption (not shown), although it remains to be determined if the disruption is due to keratin cleavage and/or hyperphosphorylation, particularly since both modalities can independently cause filament reorganization. For example, keratin filament reorganization may occur in association with a variety of hyperphosphorylated states (17Omary M.B. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Price D. Intermediate Filaments, Subcellular Biochemistry Series. Plenum Publishing Co., NY1998Google Scholar, 19Ku N.-O. Liao J. Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), or after adenovirus infection and subsequent cleavage of the K18 head domain at Met-73 by the viral L3 proteinase (41Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, a similar finding of K18 caspase-mediated fragmentation was noted in apoptotic human SNG-M endometrial and mouse HR-9 parietal cells (42Caulin C. Salvesen G. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis coupled with the known lamin caspase cleavage site (43Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) pointed to Asp-237 as a cleavage site that was verified by the inability of caspases to cleave K18 Asp-237 → Glu (42Caulin C. Salvesen G. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Interestingly, keratin fragments have been identified in sera of patients who harbor any one of a variety of epithelial tumors (45Bjorklund B. TumorDiagnostik. 1980; 1: 9-20Google Scholar, 46Weber K. Osborn M. Moll R. Wiklund B. Luning B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2707-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and may have diagnostic potential (47van Dalen A. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2345-2350PubMed Google Scholar). Keratin hyperphosphorylation occurred early after induction of apoptosis while fragmentation was a late event. Increased keratin phosphorylation involved at least three of four known K8/18 sites (i.e. K8 S73/431 and K18 S52, but not K18 S33). The function of K8 pS73 is not known, but K18 pS52 is important for filament reorganization (20Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and occurs with K8 pS431 during mitosis and growth factor receptor activation (22Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation did not involve K18 Ser-33, which regulates binding to 14-3-3 proteins (37Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar),2 and no binding of 14-3-3 proteins to K8/18 was observed during apoptosis (not shown). It remains to be determined if keratin degradation and hyperphosphorylation are obligate, important, or a bystander phenomenon. Transfection of K8/18 phosphorylation mutants into BHK cells did not decrease fragment formation (Fig.4 B), which indicates that phosphorylation of these sites is not essential for proteolysis. In addition, in vitroreconstitution of caspase-mediated K8/18 digestion appears independent of keratin phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A), which indicates that keratin hyperphosphorylation does not increase keratin susceptibility to caspase digestion. Although the most common locations of human keratin mutations that have been identified to date are at the beginning and end of the rod domain (11Fuchs E. Coulombe P.A.

Such mutations are in immediate proximity to the potential K14 caspase cleavage site, based on sequence similarity of this K14 region (48Marchuk D. McCrohon S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1984; 39: 491-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with K18 and K19 (e.g. K18 and K19 have 234VEVD while K14 has270VEMD sequences). For example, Met-272 → Arg (49Humphries M.M. Sheils D.M. Farrar G.J. Kumar-Singh R. Kenna P.F. Mansergh F.C. Jordon S.A. Young M. Humphries P. Hum.

Our results raise the questions of whether K14 undergoes caspase-mediated proteolysis, and do the K14 Met-272 → Arg (49Humphries M.M. Sheils D.M. Farrar G.J. Kumar-Singh R. Kenna P.F. Mansergh F.C. Jordon S.A. Young M. Humphries P. Hum. Mutat. 1993; 2: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Val-270 → Met mutations interfere with such proteolysis. One clear relevance of these questions is that a decrease in keratin degradation could play a role in the pathophysiology of these mutations.

SLI-1 was identified as a negative regulator of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase (a homologue of the mammalian EGF receptor (EGFR)) (11Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and a similar role has been deduced for the Drosophila homologue of Cbl (12Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Cbl in mammalian cells was also shown to reduce the tyrosine kinase activity of Syk, suggesting that mammalian Cbl may also be a negative regulator of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (7Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, utilizing dominant oncogenic mutants of Cbl, which induce an up-regulation of the PDGFRα signaling cascade in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we have now demonstrated a requirement for the Cbl-PTB domain in tyrosine kinase regulation (14Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data indicated that PTB domain-mediated interactions may be critical for the tyrosine kinase regulatory function of Cbl. Therefore, identification of Cbl-PTB domain-binding sites on its target tyrosine kinases, such as ZAP-70, is likely to elucidate an important aspect of tyrosine kinase regulation. In this study, we have used screening of a phosphopeptide library to identify the Cbl-PTB domain-binding motif. Based on the determined D(N/D)XpY motif, we identify the binding site for the Cbl-PTB domain in ZAP-70 to be the in vivo negative regulatory site Y292 (45Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using mutagenesis of ZAP-70, we confirm that both the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)292) and the Asp at the Y-2 position (Asp290) are important for recognition by the Cbl-PTB domain and show that Tyr292 is required for in vivo association of ZAP-70 with full-length Cbl. These data identify Cbl as a potential negative regulator of ZAP-70 and support a model whereby Cbl may act as a general negative regulator of tyrosine kinases through a Cbl-PTB domain-dependent mechanism. In addition, our results allow prediction of possible binding sites for the Cbl-PTB domain on other tyrosine kinases known to interact with Cbl.

Of the known phosphotyrosine-binding domains, the Src homology 2 domain binds phosphotyrosine in the context of C-terminal amino acids, usually at +1 to +3 positions (26Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), whereas the recently described PTB domains bind phosphotyrosine in the context of N-terminal amino acids. Although Cbl-N lacks any significant primary sequence homology to Src homology 2 or known PTB domains (27Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Band, unpublished data. suggested that it recognized Tyr(P) in the context of surrounding sequences. Therefore, we utilized a phosphopeptide library with degenerate residues at −3 to −1 and at +1 to +3 positions relative to Tyr(P) to determine if the Cbl-PTB domain binding motif was similar to or divergent from those of known phosphotyrosine binding domains (18Songyang Z.

Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. et al.Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). The PTB domain-containing GST-Cbl-N was incubated with the phosphopeptide library, and the sequences of specific bound peptides were analyzed. To determine the amino acid preference, the relative abundance of various amino acids at each position was calculated (18Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The Cbl-PTB domain showed strongest selection for residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. Notably, the Y-2 position was dominated by Asn (4.11-fold) followed by Asp (1.72-fold), and Asp was also strongly favored at Y-3 (2.39-fold) (Fig. 1, top). None of the amino acids showed a greater than 1.65-fold selection at the C-terminal positions relative to Tyr(P) (serine showed a slight enrichment at Y-1, Y+1, Y+2, and Y+3 positions). The loss-of-function point mutant of GST-Cbl-N (G306E) did not show any amino acid preference (data not shown). Together, these data suggested a core Cbl-PTB domain-binding motif of D(N/D)XpY. The nature of screening methodology does not allow an a priori determination of whether both D at Y-3 and N/D at Y-2 are concurrently required or if either one alone would be sufficient. As described below, a motif with Ser instead of Asp at Y-3 position is able to bind to the Cbl-PTB domain. The selection of N-terminal residues is reminiscent of the selectivity observed with other PTB domains (27Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 29van der Geer P.

Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the preference for Asp at the Y-3 position and N/D at the Y-2 position distinguishes the Cbl-PTB domain from Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains that select an NPXpY motif. Interestingly, the Drosophila Numb PTB domain, which shows primary sequence homology to the Shc PTB domain, also showed a preference for a distinct amino acid at the Y-2 position with a consensus of GPpY (35Li S. Songyang Z. Vincent S.J.F. Zwahlen C. Wiley S. Cantley L. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7204-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the characteristics of the identified phosphopeptide motif are consistent with a PTB domain-like mode of binding for the Cbl-PTB domain. Consistent with this idea, the D(N/D)XpY motif is predicted to have a β-turn structure in solution similar to that shown or predicted for other known PTB domain ligands (36Trub T. Choi W.E. Wolf G. Ottinger E. Chen Y. Weiss M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18205-18208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 3Z. Songyang, unpublished data. However, confirmation of this premise must await structural studies of the Cbl-PTB domain. The major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on ZAP-70 induced by TCR ligation include Tyr292, Tyr492, and Tyr493 (37Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and all three of these sites have been demonstrated to regulate ZAP-70 signaling ability in vivo and/or in vitro (43Chan A.C.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that one of these regulatory sites may create a Cbl-PTB domain-binding site. Previous phosphopeptide analysis has demonstrated that only singly phosphorylated Tyr(P)493 or doubly phosphorylated Tyr(P)492-Tyr(P)493 phosphopeptides are found in vivo at detectable levels, reflecting a requirement for Tyr493 phosphorylation before phosphorylation of Tyr492 (43Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphopeptides were synthesized corresponding to the Tyr(P)493, Tyr(P)492/Tyr(P)493, and Tyr(P)292 sites, and tested for their competition of GST-Cbl-N binding to ZAP-70 in lysates of anti-CD3-activated Jurkat T cells (Fig.2). The Tyr(P)493(lanes 5–7), the Tyr(P)492/Tyr(P)493 (lanes 8–10), and the nonphosphorylated Tyr292 peptide (lanes 14–16) had no effect on ZAP-70 binding to GST-Cbl-N at the concentrations tested. In contrast, the Tyr(P)292 phosphopeptide prominently competed off ZAP-70 binding to GST-Cbl-N (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12) with 50% inhibition (IC50) observed at 4.7 μm (based on densitometric analysis, data not shown). These data confirmed the results of the phosphopeptide library screening (a D(N/D)XpY motif versus DGpY in ZAP-70 (TableI)) and strongly suggested that the Tyr(P)292 on ZAP-70 represents the binding site for the Cbl-PTB domain. The failure of Tyr(P)493 and Tyr(P)492/Tyr(P)493 peptides to compete off binding indicates that additional residues in the motif may contribute positively or negatively to the specificity of the extended Cbl PTB domain-binding motif. To determine if the motif encompassing Tyr292 was the major Cbl-PTB domain-binding site on ZAP-70, Y292F, and D290A mutants (mutating either the Tyr or the Asp at Y-2 in the motif) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with vector or ZAP-70 constructs, together with a CD8-ζ chimera (to provide scaffolding) and either wild type Lck or its constitutively active mutant Lck-Y505F (to activate ZAP-70) (3Wange R.L.

Lysates were prepared after a 10-min incubation of cells in 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and their binding reactions with GST-Cbl-N were analyzed by anti-Myc immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). GST-Cbl-N but not GST alone (data not shown) bound specifically to wild type ZAP-70, and the binding was substantially increased upon cotransfection with Lck and even more so with Lck-Y505F (Fig.3 A, top panel, lanes 4–6). Increased ZAP-70 binding upon cotransfection of Lck correlated with an increase in ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, compare top and bottom panels). This is consistent with phosphorylation and activation dependence of Cbl-N binding to ZAP-70 (13Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and the requirement for cotransfected Src family kinases for full activation of ZAP-70 in COS cells (3Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6Latour S. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Y292F mutation of ZAP-70 abrogated the binding to GST-Cbl-N (Fig. 3 A,top panel, lanes 7–9) (∼98% reduction by densitometric analysis, data not shown). Interestingly, a substantial decrease in binding of ZAP-70/D290A to GST-Cbl-N was observed when this mutant was cotransfected with either wild type Lck (64% reduction) or Lck-Y505F (41% reduction) (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Anti-Myc blotting of the whole cell lysates demonstrated equivalent expression of the various ZAP-70 proteins (Fig. 3 A, middle panel,lanes 4–13), and anti-Tyr(P) reprobing demonstrated that overall phosphorylation of ZAP-70 was not altered by either mutation (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). Taken together, these results show that the Tyr(P)292 in vivo negative regulatory phosphorylation site is the major Cbl-PTB domain-binding site in ZAP-70 and verify the importance of the phosphotyrosine and Y-2 positions in Cbl-PTB domain recognition. To assess if the Tyr(P)292 site on ZAP-70 mediates its association with the Cbl-PTB domain in vivo, HA-tagged Cbl-N or its non-binding mutant Cbl-N/G306E were co-expressed with wild type or Y292F mutant ZAP-70 in COS-7 cells. Lysates were prepared after 4 h of incubation in sodium orthovanadate (100 μm), and their anti-HA immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Tyr(P) to visualize ZAP-70. As seen in Fig. 3 B, immunoprecipitation of HA-Cbl-N led to a prominent co-immunoprecipitation of wild type ZAP-70 (lane 3, upper panel). This association was completely abrogated by the G306E mutation in Cbl-N. In contrast, ZAP-70/Y292F showed little co-immunoprecipitation with Cbl-N (lane 4, upper panel), confirming the specificity of the Cbl-PTB domain determined in vitro (above). In view of the reported difficulty in detecting ZAP-70/Cbl complexes in vivo (5Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it was important to determine if Cbl-PTB domain-mediated binding to the Tyr(P)292 site in ZAP-70 could be demonstrated in vivo in the context of full-length Cbl. Therefore, full-length wild type HA-Cbl or its G306E mutant were co-expressed with wild type ZAP-70 or ZAP-70/Y292F in COS cells. Lysates were prepared as in Fig. 3 B, followed by anti-HA immunoprecipitation and anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. As seen in Fig.3 C, wild type but not the G306E mutant of Cbl associated with wild type ZAP-70 (compare lanes 2 and 3,upper panel). Notably, association of ZAP-70/Y292F with Cbl was essentially undetectable (lane 4, upper panel). Thus, both an intact Cbl-PTB domain and the Tyr(P)292 site are required for Cbl/ZAP-70 association. In the above experiments relatively similar levels of ZAP-70 or Cbl constructs were demonstrated by anti-Myc and anti-HA immunoblotting of lysates (lower two panels in Fig. 3, B and C). The proto-oncogene product Cbl has recently emerged as a negative regulator of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (7Ota Y. Samelson L.E.

Identification of a PTB domain within this region provided a biochemical basis for the attachment of Cbl to activated tyrosine kinases to exert a negative regulatory effect. As such, identification of a binding motif for the Cbl-PTB domain represents a significant step forward in understanding the mechanisms whereby Cbl regulates tyrosine kinases. Here, we identify a novel binding motif, D(N/D)XpY, for the Cbl-PTB domain. Our analyses directly demonstrate that the Cbl-PTB domain binds to a negative regulatory site on ZAP-70 (Tyr(P)292), which corresponds to a motif predicted by the phosphopeptide library screening."

The purified protein is an efficient inhibitor of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), having an apparent second-order rate constant of 6.2 × 105m−1 s−1 for the two-chain form. However, unlike other known plasminogen activator inhibitors, neuroserpin is a more effective inactivator of tPA than of urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Neuroserpin also effectively inhibited trypsin and nerve growth factor-γ but reacted only slowly with plasmin and thrombin. Northern blot analysis showed a 1.8 kilobase messenger RNA expressed predominantly in adult human brain and spinal cord, and immunohistochemical studies of normal mouse tissue detected strong staining primarily in neuronal cells with occasionally positive microglial cells. Staining was most prominent in the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, select neurons of the hypothalamus and hippocampus, and in the myelinated axons of the commissura. Expression of tPA within these regions is reported to be high and has previously been correlated with both motor learning and neuronal survival. Taken together, these data suggest that neuroserpin is likely to be a critical regulator of tPA activity in the central nervous system, and as such may play an important role in neuronal plasticity and/or maintenance.

Sequence analysis of the neuroserpin cDNA has suggested that it is likely to be a functional serine proteinase inhibitor with specificity for trypsin-like enzymes. However, until now no functional activity has been shown for neuroserpin. In the present study we show that neuroserpin is a fully functional inhibitory serpin that reacts preferentially with tPA, a serine proteinase implicated in both CNS development and maintenance. Consistent with this, tPA gene expression is prominent in the developing embryonic and neonatal brain (3Carroll P.M. Tsirka S.E. Richards W.G. Frohman M.A. Strickland S.

Emeis J.J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 601-608PubMed Google Scholar). Specific expression of tPA has been shown in adult rodent brains in cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, as well as the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, neurons in the hypothalamus, and cells of the ventricular ependyma (3Carroll P.M.

A role in synaptic remodeling has been suggested for tPA since elevated mRNA and protein levels were detected specifically in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of rats retrained to negotiate a pegged runway (9Seeds N.W. Williams B.L. Bickford P.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1992-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Long term potentiation, another form of synaptic plasticity thought to be important for long term memory, has also been correlated with the induction of tPA mRNA expression in granular cells of the dentate gyrus (10Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). tPA has also been implicated in the regulation of neuronal survival in response to excitotoxin. In these studies, neural degeneration of the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus appeared to be mediated by tPA, since mice deficient in tPA were protected from neural degeneration (11Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 12Tsirka S.E. Rogove A.D. Strickland S. Nature. 1996; 384: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasminogen, which is the only known target substrate for tPA, also appears to be required for excitotoxin-mediated neuronal cell death, since plasminogen-deficient mice are similarly protected from neuronal death (13Tsirka S.E. Rogove A.D. Bugge T.H. Degen J.L. Strickland S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 543-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter result suggests that a proteolytic cascade may be involved in the excitotoxin-induced neural degeneration. That disregulation of tPA activity has the potential for such a severe outcome implies that its regulation in the brain is critical, and for this reason there is likely to be a need for balancing tPA's proteolytic activity with the opposing activity of an inhibitor.In this report we suggest that neuroserpin may provide that inhibitory activity within the CNS. Our data demonstrate that neuroserpin rapidly inhibits both the single- and two-chain forms of tPA, and show by immunohistochemistry it's localization within neurons of the normal mouse brain. Moreover, most of the regions within the brain where neuroserpin is observed are also sites were either tPA message or protein have been found previously. Together, these data imply that neuroserpin may be an important inhibitor of tPA activity within the CNS and as such could play a significant role in regulating either neuronal plasticity and/or survival.

https://openalex.org/W2000862518,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced Ras activation is required for G1 progression in Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (IIC9 cells). Ras stimulates both extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation and RhoA activation in response to PDGF stimulation. Inhibition of either of these Ras-stimulated pathways results in growth arrest. We have shown previously that Ras-stimulated ERK activation is essential for the induction and continued G1 expression of cyclin D1. In this study we examine the role of Ras-induced RhoA activity in G1 progression. Unstimulated IIC9 cells expressed high levels of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1. Stimulation with PDGF resulted in a dramatic decrease in p27KIP1 protein expression. This decrease was attributed to increased p27KIP1 protein degradation. Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Ras or RhoA completely blocked PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation, but only dominant-negative Ras inhibited cyclin D1 protein expression. C3 transferase also inhibited PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation, thus further implicating RhoA in p27KIP1 regulation. Overexpression of dominant-negative ERK resulted in inhibition of PDGF-induced cyclin D1 expression but had no effect on PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation. These data suggest that Ras coordinates the independent regulation of cyclin D1 and p27KIP1 expression by the respective activation of ERK and RhoA and that these pathways converge to determine the activation state of complexes of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase in response to mitogen.

Inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway blocks mitogen-induced expression of cyclin D1 in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in mediating the mitogenic signals responsible for cyclin D1 induction (20Lavoie J.N.

The increase in cyclin D·CDK activity is a result of both an increase in cyclin D and a decrease in G1cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor expression (1Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem.

Although several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors have been identified as potent inhibitors of cyclin·CDK complexes, p27KIP1 is the only cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose protein expression decreases as mitogen-induced cells enter the cell cycle (7Sherr C.J.

The decrease in p27KIP1 expression occurs through protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (26Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The retention of inhibitory levels of p27KIP1 appears to be involved in the growth-inhibitory properties of transforming growth factor-β, rapamycin, and cyclic AMP (27Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J.

In contrast, overexpression of p27KIP1 antisense cDNA results in mitogen-independent G1 progression, demonstrating the importance of p27KIP1 in maintaining cell quiescence (30Coats S. Flanagan W.M.

PDGF stimulation causes the rapid activation of Ras and the subsequent downstream activation of ERK (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17320-17326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, Ras also stimulates the downstream activation of RhoA presumably to induce changes in cytoskeleton structure associated with growth (32Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 33Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

However, RhoA activation has not been linked directly to the regulation of the cell cycle. In this study we demonstrate that Ras coordinates G1progression through two independent pathways: ERK regulation of cyclin D1 expression and RhoA regulation of p27KIP1 degradation to ensure the proper activation state of cyclin D1·CDK complexes following mitogenic stimulation. Cell Culture and Reagents—IIC9 cells, a subclone of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (37Low D.A. Scott R.W. Baker J.B. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1982; 298: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma). Subconfluent (60–70%) were growth arrested by washing once with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and reculturing in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h. Human recombinant PDGF-BB (Calbiochem) was added to cultures at 10 ng/ml in all experiments. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were preincubated with 10 μm PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) before the addition of PDGF. Dominant-negative ERK2 (dnERK−) was a generous gift from Dr. Jacques Pouyssegur (University of Nice, France). Dominant-negative Ras (dnRas−) and RhoA (dnRhoA19) and constitutively active RhoA (RhoA63) were constructed as described previously through site-directed mutagenesis of Thr to Asn at codon 17 and 19 or Gln to Leu at codon 63, respectively, with the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) (38Qui R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of IIC9 cells (50–60% confluence) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer consistently resulted in >90% expression efficiency as visualized by β-galactosidase staining. PDGF was added to growth-arrested IIC9 cells in the presence (+) or absence (−) of PD98059 (10 μm), C3 transferase (40 μg/ml), or various dominant-negative plasmids. Cells were harvested 0–24 h after the addition of PDGF by scraping in cold 1 × PBS. Harvested cells were lysed and sonicated in solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes; 300 mmNaCl; 0.2 mm EDTA; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 0.1% Triton X-100; 20 mm β-glycerophosphate; 0.1 mm sodium vanadate; 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay as recommended by the manufacturer. Western blots were performed on lysates/proteins (20 μg) as described previously (21Weber J.D.

Membranes were probed with cyclin D1, p27KIP1, or CDK4 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), conjugated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase, and developed with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence; Amersham Corp.) as recommended by the manufacturer. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into IIC9 cells was measured as described previously (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J.

Approximately 17 h after the addition of PDGF, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were washed twice with cold 1 × PBS and incubated for an additional 30 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated DNA was washed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 2% sodium bicarbonate and 0.1 n NaOH. After neutralization with 5% trichloroacetic acid, precipitated [3H]DNA was quantitated by scintillation counting. ERK1 activity was measured as described previously (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M.

Briefly, growth-arrested or PDGF-stimulated IIC9 cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in 300 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 1 mm sodium vanadate; 10% glycerol; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2 mm EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 50 mm β-glycerophosphate; and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). ERK1 was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal ERK1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). ERK1 immune complexes were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein as described previously (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J.

Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Briefly, IIC9 cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS and lysed in IP buffer (50 mmHepes; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1 mm sodium vanadate; 1 mm EDTA; 2.5 mm EGTA; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 10 mm β-glycerophosphate; 0.1% Tween 20; 10% glycerol; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and sonicated briefly. Cyclin D1 complexes were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal cyclin D1 antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with IP buffer. Cyclin D1 immune complexes were resuspended in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 μm ATP). Resuspended complexes were incubated with 2 μg of soluble GST-Rb fusion protein (generous gift from Dr. Mark Ewen) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and developed on a PhosphorImager. Protein levels of p27KIP1 are increased in contact-inhibited or serum-deprived cells and decrease when cells are stimulated by mitogen to enter the cell cycle (7Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 23Winston J. Dong F. Pledger W.J. J. Biol.

Various mitogens including epidermal growth factor, PDGF, and serum are capable of stimulating cell cycle entry and p27KIP1 degradation (23Winston J. Dong F. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11253-11260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M.

However, the mechanism by which these mitogens stimulate p27KIP1 degradation remains unclear. We have shown previously that PDGF is a potent mitogen for IIC9 cells, and addition of PDGF to quiescent IIC9 cells resulted in up-regulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and D-type cyclin-dependent kinase activity (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 22Weber J.D. Cheng J. Raben D.M. Gardner A. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17320-17326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stimulation with PDGF also resulted in the time-dependent degradation of p27KIP1 protein (Fig. 1). 2 h after PDGF stimulation, p27KIP1 protein levels decreased approximately 50%, and by 24 h they were nearly undetectable (Fig. 1). Levels of CDK4, which we have shown previously do not increase with PDGF stimulation (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), were measured to ensure equal protein loading (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that loss of p27KIP1 protein occurs via a ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway (26Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, incubation of IIC9 cells with a calpain I inhibitor resulted in the appearance of polyubiquitinated forms of p27KIP1 (data not shown). We have shown previously that PDGF-induced G1 progression requires the sustained activation of ERK in a MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1)-dependent manner (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The sustained activation of ERK following PDGF stimulation was responsible for the continued accumulation of cyclin D1, and inhibition of this activity resulted in the loss of cyclin D1 protein expression (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDGF-induced ERK activation also contributed to the degradation of p27KIP1, we overexpressed a dnERK− in IIC9 cells. Although dnERK− inhibits PDGF-induced G1 progression (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it did not inhibit the PDGF-induced loss of p27KIP1 (Fig.2 A). IIC9 cells preincubated with an inhibitor of MEK1 activation, PD98059, displayed normal PDGF-induced p27KIP1 protein degradation with p27KIP1 protein levels being reduced to 10% maximal levels by 16 h (Fig.2 B). These data suggest that downstream effectors of MEK1 and ERK are not responsible for the degradation of p27KIP1. We next looked at Ras, an upstream activator of the MAP kinase pathway, which we have shown previously is activated rapidly by PDGF (22Weber J.D. Cheng J. Raben D.M. Gardner A. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17320-17326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The addition of PDGF to IIC9 cells overexpressing dnRas− did not affect p27KIP1 protein levels, demonstrating the requirement of Ras activation for PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation. These data demonstrate clearly that mitogen-regulated destruction of p27KIP1 is downstream of Ras. It has become apparent that both MAP kinase and Rho pathways are important in the control of cell proliferation (20Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

To investigate the importance of PDGF-induced RhoA activity, we transfected IIC9 cells with dnRhoA19 and examined the effect of dnRhoA19 expression on several proteins that control progression through G1. Overexpression of dnRhoA19 inhibited PDGF-induced reduction of p27KIP1 protein levels in IIC9 cells (Fig. 3 A) similar to that seen in dnRas−-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that RhoA is a downstream Ras-dependent signaling molecule required for PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation. Incubation with C3 transferase, an inhibitor of RhoA activity, also resulted in the inhibition of PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation, further implicating RhoA activation in p27KIP1 destruction (Fig.4 A). Overexpression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant, RhoA63, resulted in the mitogen-independent decrease in p27KIP1 protein expression (Fig. 3 B) identical to that of PDGF-stimulated IIC9 cells. These data demonstrate that activated RhoA alone is sufficient for loss of p27KIP1. The requirement of RhoA for PDGF-induced p27KIP1 degradation and the ability of RhoA63 mutant to stimulate p27KIP1 degradation independently show clearly that RhoA activation has an important role in G1progres"
https://openalex.org/W2029543048,"Hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau is the major proteinaceous component of the paired helical and straight filaments which constitute a defining neuropathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and a number of other neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently shown that full-length recombinant tau assembles into Alzheimer-like filaments upon incubation with heparin. Heparin also promotes phosphorylation of tau by a number of protein kinases, prevents tau from binding to taxol-stabilized microtubules, and produces rapid disassembly of microtubules assembled from tau and tubulin. Here, we have used the above parameters to study the interactions between tau protein and a number of naturally occurring and synthetic glycosaminoglycans. We show that the magnitude of the glycosaminoglycan effects is proportional to their degree of sulfation. Thus, the strongly sulfated glycosaminoglycans dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and heparin were the most potent, whereas the non-sulfated dextran and hyaluronic acid were without effect. The moderately sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate had intermediate effects, whereas keratan sulfate had little or no effect. These in vitro interactions between tau protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycans reproduced the known characteristics of paired helical filament-tau from Alzheimer's disease brain. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are present in nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease brain in the early stages of neurofibrillary degeneration, suggesting that their interactions with tau may constitute a central event in the development of the neuronal pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

Thus, the strongly sulfated glycosaminoglycans dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and heparin were the most potent, whereas the non-sulfated dextran and hyaluronic acid were without effect. The moderately sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate had intermediate effects, whereas keratan sulfate had little or no effect. These in vitro interactions between tau protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycans reproduced the known characteristics of paired helical filament-tau from Alzheimer's disease brain. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are present in nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease brain in the early stages of neurofibrillary degeneration, suggesting that their interactions with tau may constitute a central event in the development of the neuronal pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

Some of these sites are not phosphorylated in tau from normal brain, whereas others are phosphorylated to a greater extent in PHF-tau than in tau from normal brain. Many phosphorylated sites are serine/threonine-prolines.

Moreover, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylate tau at specific sites in vitro, some of which are also phosphorylated in PHF-tau (22Steiner B.

J. 1996; 316: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of tau results in its inability to bind to microtubules and is believed to precede PHF assembly (25Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 26Yoshida H. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Braak E. Braak H. Mandelkow E.M. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 554-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether hyperphosphorylation of tau is either necessary or sufficient for PHF formation. We have recently shown that a phosphorylation-independent interaction between recombinant tau and sulfated glycosaminoglycans leads to the formation of Alzheimer-like filaments under physiological conditions in vitro (28Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 29Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Klug A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 565-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three repeat-containing tau isoforms gave rise to paired helical-like filaments, whereas four repeat-containing isoforms formed straight filaments, thus suggesting an explanation for the two tau assemblies present in Alzheimer's disease brain. We also showed that heparin prevents tau from binding to microtubules and promotes microtubule disassembly. Heparan sulfate and hyperphosphorylated tau have been found to co-exist in nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease brain at the earliest known stages of neurofibrillary pathology (28Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of tau by cdc28, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, GSK3, and several SAP kinases is markedly stimulated by heparin (11Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Lee V.M.-Y. Ihara Y.

Taken together, these findings suggest that an interaction between tau protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycans may be a central event in the development of the neurofibrillary pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we show that the degree of sulfation of glycosaminoglycans is of crucial importance for their ability to induce tau filament formation, to prevent tau from binding to microtubules, and to promote microtubule disassembly. Of those tested, dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and heparin are the most sulfated, followed by dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Hyaluronic acid and dextran are not sulfated (see Table I for degrees of sulfation). We also show that the phosphorylation of tau by MAP kinase, NCLK, and GSK3β is markedly stimulated in the presence of heparin, at heparin concentrations lower than those required for tau filament formation. Phosphorylation of tau by MAP kinase, NCLK, and GSK3β is also stimulated by heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, and pentosan polysulfate, but not by dextran and hyaluronic acid, with the magnitude of stimulation of tau phosphorylation being proportional to the degree of glycosaminoglycan sulfation. Tau phosphorylation by MAP kinase, NCLK, and GSK3 is also stimulated in the presence of nucleic acids and tubulin. Nucleic acids had little effect on the binding of tau to microtubules. However, incubation of tau with tRNA led to the formation of filaments, in confirmation of a recent report (33Kampers T. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Table IDegrees of sulfation of glycosaminoglycansSulfates/disaccharide unitDextran sulfate4–6Pentosan polysulfate4–6Heparin1.6–3Dermatan sulfate1–3Heparan sulfate0.4–2Keratan sulfate0.9–1.8Chondroitin sulfate0.1–1.3Hyaluronic acid0Dextran0 Open table in a new tab These results raise the possibility that an interaction between tau protein and negatively charged polymers with a sugar backbone, as found in sulfated glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids, results in a conformational change in tau that induces polymerization of tau molecules via the microtubule-binding repeats of individual tau molecules, resulting in the formation of filaments like those present in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The 3-repeat 381-amino acid (htau37) and the 4-repeat 441-amino acid (htau40) isoforms of human tau (34Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

Heparin (from bovine intestinal mucosa), dextran, dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and poly-l-glutamic acid were purchased from Sigma. Heparan sulfate (from bovine kidney), chondroitin-4-sulfate (from bovine trachea), dermatan sulfate (from porcine skin), keratan sulfate (from bovine cornea), and hyaluronic acid (from human umbilical cord) were obtained from Fluka Chemie AG. Tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. Double-stranded DNA was obtained from CLONTECHand tRNA from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides (30–60-mers) were made on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Phosphorylation assays (0.050 ml) were carried out at 30 °C and comprised 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 μm PKI (a specific inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase), protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin), tau protein (4 μm), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (approximately 106 cpm/nmol), and 1 unit/ml activated p42 MAP kinase, 1 unit/ml GSK3β, or 5 units/ml recombinant reconstituted NCLK. Reactions were initiated with ATP and aliquots were removed at various times ranging from 10 min to 24 h and used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunoblots were performed as described (15Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Lawler S. Cuenda A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Alternatively, incorporation of 32P radioactivity was measured after adsorption to Whatman P-81 paper, as described (14Goedert M. Cohen E.S. Jakes R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids were included in the assays at 50 μg/ml and tubulin at 20 μm. For microtubule binding, recombinant htau40 (4 μm, 0.18 mg/ml) was incubated with different concentrations of glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml) in assembly buffer (80 mmPIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.8) for 10 min at 37 °C, then added to 10 μm taxol-stabilized microtubules and incubated for a further 20 min. Following ultracentrifugation, aliquots of supernatants (free tau) and pellets (microtubule-bound tau) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were estimated by scanning the gels with a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer (Model 300 A), and were expressed as percentage of tau bound to microtubules in the absence of glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids (taken as 100%). For microtubule assembly, recombinant htau40 (2 μm) was incubated with tubulin (10 μm) in assembly buffer at 37 °C. After 5 min, glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids (100 μg/ml) were added and incubated for a further 5 min. Polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules were monitored by measuring the turbidity at 350 nm. Purified recombinant htau37 (40 μm) or htau40 (40 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids (ranging from 5 to 20 μm) in 25 μl of 30 mm MOPS, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride (Calbiochem), pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 48 h, as described (28Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In some experiments various concentrations of CaCl2, MgCl2, ZnCl2, and AlCl3 were added. Control experiments consisted of using tau alone, glycosaminoglycans alone, tau plus di- and trivalent cations, and glycosaminoglycans plus di- and trivalent cations. Samples were examined by electron microscopy, as described (28Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Recombinant htau40 was incubated for various times (ranging from 10 min to 24 h) with 5 units/ml recombinant reconstituted NCLK, in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml heparin. After 24 h tau incorporated 3.8 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in the absence of heparin and 11.4 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1). The stimulation of tau phosphorylation by heparin was apparent throughout the incubation period and was particularly evident at early time points (Fig. 1). A dose-response curve showed that the effect was maximal at 30 μg/ml heparin. Phosphorylation of tau by NCLK in the presence of heparin produced the epitopes of phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies which recognize (S/T)P sites in tau, as shown in Fig.2 for antibody AT8 which recognizes tau phosphorylated at Ser-202 and Thr-205 (8Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 192: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, tau was immunoreactive for antibody 12E8 which recognizes the phosphorylated non-(S/T)P sites Ser-262 and/or Ser-356 (9Seubert P. Mawal-Dewan M. Barbour R. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Phosphorylation of htau24S262A, htau24S356A, and htau24S262AS356A by NCLK plus heparin showed that Ser-262, but not Ser-356 was phosphorylated (Fig. 2). The effects of glycosaminoglycans (50 μg/ml) other than heparin on tau phosphorylation by NCLK were investigated after 18 h of incubation (Fig. 3). Dextran sulfate produced a large effect, resulting in an approximately 3-fold stimulation of tau phosphorylation. Heparan sulfate and pentosan polysulfate also produced a large effect, with smaller effects for dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Hyaluronic acid, dextran, and poly-l-glutamic acid were without a significant effect. Addition of 50 μg/ml nucleic acids also stimulated tau phosphorylation by NCLK, with tRNA producing a larger effect than DNA (Fig. 3). Incubation of tau with NCLK in the presence of 20 μm tubulin led to an approximately 50% stimulation of tau phosphorylation (Fig. 3).Figure 2Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutated recombinant htau24 (383-amino acid isoform of human tau) with 5 unit/ml recombinant reconstituted NCLK + 50 μg/ml heparin.

As shown before, phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β was strongly stimulated by heparin. Dextran sulfate had a similar effect, with an almost 5-fold stimulation of phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Addition of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and dermatan sulfate resulted in a 2.0–3.0-fold stimulation of tau phosphorylation by GSK3β, whereas keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, dextran, and poly-l-glutamic acid were without a significant effect. RNA and DNA produced a 2.5–3.0-fold stimulation of tau phosphorylation by GSK3β; an effect of similar magnitude was obtained upon addition of tubulin (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of htau40 by MAP kinase was stimulated 1.5–3.0-fold by heparin, heparan sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, dextran sulfate, and RNA (Fig. 3). Chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, dextran, poly-l-glutamic acid, and DNA were without a significant effect. Incubation of tau with GSK3β or MAP kinase in the presence of 20 μm tubulin led to a 3-fold stimulation of tau phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Recombinant htau40 was incubated with different concentrations (50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml) of glycosaminoglycans or nucleic acids and added to taxol-stabilized microtubules, followed by ultracentrifugation to separate unbound tau from microtubule-bound tau. The addition of heparin, dextran sulfate, and pentosan polysulfate resulted in a dose-dependent inability of tau to bind to microtubules, with IC50 values of approximately 100 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate produced a smaller, but significant, reduction which amounted to 40% at 1 mg/ml (Fig. 4). Only small reductions in the ability of tau to bind to microtubules were observed upon addition of RNA and DNA. Hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and poly-l-glutamic acid had no significant effect, even at high concentrations (Fig. 4). Recombinant htau40 was incubated with tubulin and microtubule assembly monitored by an increase in turbidity. After 5 min, when assembly was maximal, glycosaminoglycans or nucleic acids (100 μg/ml) were added and microtubule disassembly monitored for a further 5 min by a decrease in turbidity. Addition of heparin, pentosan polysulfate, dextran sulfate, and DNA caused rapid and complete microtubule disassembly (Fig. 5). Heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate had an intermediate effect (Fig. 5). RNA and poly-l-glutamic acid produced only a small effect on microtubule disassembly, whereas addition of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and dextran had no significant effect (Fig. 5). Incubation of the three repeat-containing tau isoform htau37 with glycosaminoglycans led to bulk assembly into twisted filaments with a morphology similar to the PHFs from Alzheimer's disease brain (Table II, Figs.6 and 7). As observed before (28Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 29Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Klug A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 565-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), incubation of four repeat-containing tau isoforms with glycosaminoglycans gave straight filaments with a morphology similar to the SFs from Alzheimer's disease brain (data not shown). Incubation of htau37 with heparin of molecular masses ranging from 3 to 30 kDa gave large numbers of twisted filaments (Fig. 6,A and B). A second class of filament appearing as thinner, wavy structures was also observed (shown in Fig.6 C). These may correspond to half-twisted filaments, as they are sometimes seen extending from the ends of twisted filaments. This would imply that the filaments formed in vitro are two-stranded, like Alzheimer filaments (37Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2288-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The relative numbers of each type of filament were strongly dependent on the tau:heparin ratios, with a 2-fold change in the ratios being sufficient to switch from a predominance of half-filaments to a preponderance of twisted PHF-like filaments. Filaments with very similar morphologies were observed, when heparan sulfate was used instead of heparin (Fig.6 C). However, the total number of filaments was always higher with heparin. Addition of 1–10 μmZnCl2 significantly increased the number of twisted filaments formed following addition of heparan sulfate to htau37 (Fig.6 D). Addition of 10 mm MgCl2 led to a small increase in the number of twisted filaments, whereas CaCl2 and AlCl3 were without effect. Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate induced the assembly of tau into filaments with a morphology similar to those formed after addition of heparin or heparan sulfate (Fig. 7, A and B). However, the number of filaments was small relative to that observed after addition of heparin. Keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, dextran, and poly-l-glutamine failed to induce filament formation (Table II). This contrasted with the results obtained using the highly sulfated synthetic glycosaminoglycans dextran sulfate and pentosan polysulfate which induced the formation of very large numbers of short twisted tau filaments (Fig. 7, C and D, TableII). In contrast to the filaments obtained with naturally occurring sulfated glycosaminoglycans, these filaments were much shorter, consisting mostly of pieces less than one turn. We also examined the effects of tRNA and both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA on tau filament"
https://openalex.org/W2064858516,"The existence and function of a Hsp40-Hsp70 chaperone machinery in mammalian cells in vivo was investigated. The rate of heat inactivation of firefly luciferase transiently expressed in hamster O23 fibroblasts was analyzed in cells co-transfected with the gene encoding the human Hsp40 (Ohtsuka, K. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 197, 235–240), the human inducible Hsp70 (Hunt, C., and Morimoto, R. I. (1985)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 6455–6459), or a combination of both. Whereas the expression of human Hsp70 alone in hamster cells was sufficient for the protection of firefly luciferase during heat shock, expression of the human Hsp40 alone was not. Rather, this led to a small but significant increase in the heat sensitivity of luciferase. The expression of the human Hsp40 only led to heat protection when the human Hsp70 was expressed as well. Under such conditions the rate of luciferase reactivation from the heat-inactivated state was increased, but the rate of inactivation during heat shock was not affected. Using constructs that direct firefly luciferase either to the cytoplasm or to the nucleus (Michels, A. A., Nguyen, V.-T., Konings, A. W. T., Kampinga, H. H., and Bensaude, O. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem.234, 382–389), it was demonstrated that these chaperone functions are found in both compartments. Our data provide the first evidence on how the Hsp40/Hsp70 chaperone complex acts as heat protector in mammalian cells in vivo.

Biochem.234, 382–389), it was demonstrated that these chaperone functions are found in both compartments. Our data provide the first evidence on how the Hsp40/Hsp70 chaperone complex acts as heat protector in mammalian cells in vivo. Cells that have been subjected to a priming heat shock become less susceptible to a following challenging heat shock. This transient thermotolerant state is accompanied by a temporary increase in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; Hsc, heat-shock cognate; hu, human; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; nuc, nuclear; cyt, cytoplasmic; PF, protection factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus. There is a large body of evidence that it is indeed this increase that protects the cells against heat (1Hahn G.M. Li G.C. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 79-100Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of single HSPs during in vivo heat protection is unknown, but overexpression of only one HSP (for example Hsp70) can be sufficient for thermoprotection in terms of clonogenic survival (2Angelidis C.E. Lazardis I. Pagoulatos G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Li G.C. Li L. Liu Y.K. Mak J.Y. Chen L. Lee W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1681-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Being molecular chaperones, one of the mechanisms of protection of individual HSPs could be in preventing thermally denatured proteins from subsequent aggregation (4Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Indeed, for Hsp70, indirect evidence (5Stege G.J.J. Li G.C. Li L. Kampinga H.H. Konings A.W.T. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1994; 10: 659-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has suggested that its overexpression can protect cells from heat-induced protein aggregation in vivo. Such a function is consistent with the suggested in vitro chaperone capacity of the Hsp70 family (4Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Hsp70 and the cognate Hsp70 (Hsc70) chaperones participate in many biological processes in which protein folding is involved. These include protein translocation, protein translation, protein assembly and disassembly, and protein degradation (4Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 6Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-593Google Scholar). Chaperone functions have been investigated in vitro and in vivo using reporter proteins such as luciferase, β-galactosidase, citrate synthase, and dihydrofolate reductase. Overexpression of Hsp70 protects luciferase against thermal denaturation in vivo (7Li G.C. Nussenzweig A. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 425-449Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, neither overexpression nor deletion of the prokaryotic Hsp70, DnaK, affects heat-induced inactivation of the foreign reporter enzyme luciferase in Escherichia coli (8Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Also, heat-induced luciferase aggregation within yeast mitochondria is not influenced by mutations in mitochondrial Hsp70 (9Prip-Buus C. Westerman B. Schmitt M. Lamger T. Neupert W. Schwarz E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several studies in prokaryotes have shown that the bacterial homologue of Hsp70, DnaK, is assisted by two co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE (6Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-593Google Scholar, 10Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 209-249Google Scholar). DnaJ stimulates the ATPase function of DnaK (12Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) whereas GrpE enhances the ADP/ATP exchange on DnaK (10Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). DnaJ has a chaperone function of its own. Like DnaK, DnaJ is capable of binding to substrate proteins and can prevent luciferase from aggregation in vitro (8Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). A bovine DnaJ homologue was found to reduce the amount of Hsc70 needed to refold heat-inactivated DNA polymerase in vitro (13Ziemienowicz A. Zylicz M. Floth C. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15479-15484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In human cells, Hsp40 (HDJ-1), a heat-inducible DnaJ homologue (14Ohtsuka K. Masuda A. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was found to co-localize with Hsc/Hsp70 before and after heat shock (15Hattori H. Kaneda T. Lokeshwar B. Laszlo A. Ohtsuka K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp40 is able to assist Hsc70 in the de novo protein folding in in vitro translation systems (16Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In vitro, Hsc70 binding to substrates prone to thermal aggregation was found to rely on the Hsp40-enhanced ATP hydrolysis (17Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Together with Hsc70, Hsp40 can protect luciferase and rhodanese from, respectively, heat and chemically induced aggregation in vitro (17Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This is suggested to be related to the finding that Hsp40 is capable of enhancing the reactivation of thermally denatured luciferase in vitro in a reaction in which bovine Hsc70 is included (17Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 18Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This human DnaJ homologue is also capable of stimulating Hsp70- and Hsc70-assisted refolding of chemically denatured firefly luciferase and E. coli β-galactosidase (19Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study was to examine the role of human Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the protection against and the recovery from heat-induced protein denaturation in mammalian cells. As a model system, firefly luciferase was expressed in mammalian cells. This foreign reporter protein is inactivated upon mild heat treatment of the mammalian cells and can be reactivated during recovery after stress (21Pinto M. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13941-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of luciferase inactivation was found to be reduced in thermotolerant cells (22Nguyen V.-T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Considering the heat-induced Hsp40/Hsp70 relocalization from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, recombinant luciferases localized either in the cytoplasm (cyt-luciferase) or in the nucleus (nuc-luciferase) were used as reporters of damage in either compartment (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By coexpressing human Hsp70 (hu-Hsp70) and/or human Hsp40 (hu-Hsp40) with luciferase in O23 hamster cells, we examined whether these HSPs would function as chaperones on their own and/or whether they could cooperate in the heat protection of firefly luciferase in vivo. Plasmid pRSVLL/V (24De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), encoding for a cytoplasmic localized firefly luciferase, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Subramani, University of California, San Diego, CA. To direct luciferase into the nucleus, we recently described the construction of pRSVnlsLL/V (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmids pCMV40 and pCMV70 are used to express the human Hsp40 or the human-inducible Hsp70, respectively. To construct plasmid pCMV40, a HindIII-BamHI fragment encoding the cDNA sequence of human Hsp40 (25Ohtsuka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BglII-HindIII sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 (kindly donated by Dr. M. Stinski, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Plasmid pCMV70 was constructed by inserting a HindIII fragment encoding the cDNA for Hsp70.1, the human inducible DnaK homologue (26Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) (kindly donated by Dr. L. Weber, Reno, Nevada), into the HindIII site of pCMV5. O23 hamster fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. J. Landry, Quebec, Canada) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 25-cm2 culture dish. They were transfected after 24 h with either 1 μg of pRSVLL/V or pRSVnlsLL/V with or without (combinations of) 1 μg of pCMV40 and pCMV70 following the standard calcium phosphate method (27Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression. A Laboratory Manual. Stockton Press, New York1990: 96-98Google Scholar). The plasmid quantity was kept equal to 10 μg/25 cm2 dish by the addition of plasmid pSP64 (Promega). One day after transfection, the transfected cells were treated with trypsin and distributed equally into cell culture tubes (Nunc); 40 tubes (1 × 104 cells/tube) were seeded out of a 25-cm2 culture dish, and 20 mm MOPS was added to the medium to increase its buffering capacity. Heat shocks were given 2 days after transfection. For inactivation experiments, the tubes were preincubated in a water bath at 37 °C and transferred to a second water bath at the indicated temperatures ± 0.1 °C. The transfer took less than 3 s and was taken as time 0. For recovery experiments, the medium was replaced 30 min before heat shock by medium containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis. The inhibition of protein synthesis was checked by 35S incorporation (data not shown). After various heat shocks, cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C. For both inactivation and recovery experiments, the activity before heat shock was taken as 100%. Immediately after treatment, cells were cooled to 4 °C and lysed. The lysis procedure was initiated by a brief wash with ice-cold PBS and subsequent cell lysis in 500 μl of buffer A (25 mmH3PO4/Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysates were kept frozen at −20 °C before measurement of luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were measured in a Berthold Lumat 9501 for 10 s after the addition of substrates (1.25 mm ATP and 87 μg/ml luciferin (Sigma) in buffer A). O23 cells in a 25-cm2 dish were transfected with pCMV40 or pCMV70 or pCMV5 as a control and trypsinized 2 days after transfection. SDS (1% (w/v)) and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the cells, and they were sonicated and subsequently heated for 5 min at 90 °C. After electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel, the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll). Luciferase was detected with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (1:2,000 dilution) (Promega). Hsp40 was detected with an anti-Hsp40 antiserum (1:2,000 dilution) (28Hattori H. Liu Y.-C. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Kaneda T. Kobayashi T. Tanabe K. Ohtsuka K. Cell. Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and Hsp70 was detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against the inducible Hsp70 (1:2,000 dilution) (C92F3A-5, Stress-gen). This was followed by binding of a 1:5,000-diluted peroxidase-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit (Amersham) (Hsp40) and 1:2,000-diluted peroxidase-conjugated sheep-anti-mouse (Amersham) (Hsp70) and detection of the proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). O23 cells in a 25-cm2 dish were transfected with 10 μg pRSVLL/V, pRSVnlsLL/V, pCMV40, or pCMV70. For determination of protein solubility, heated and unheated cells were lyzed in buffer A and fractionated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min into supernatants and pellets. SDS (1%: v/v) and 2-mercaptoethanol (1%: v/v) were added to the supernatants. The pellets were dissolved in SDS (1%: v/v) and 2-mercaptoethanol (1%: v/v). The samples were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels and analyzed for the presence of luciferase, Hsp40 or/and Hsp70 by Western analysis. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV40 or pCMV70. One day after transfection, cells were plated on coverslips. One day after plating, the coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then washed sequentially 3 × 5 min with PBS and incubated 15 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS then 10 min with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Thereafter the coverslips were soaked for 30 min in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS, and the cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:150 dilution of either anti-Hsp70 (C92F3A-5, Stress-gen) or an anti-Hsp40 serum (28Hattori H. Liu Y.-C. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Kaneda T. Kobayashi T. Tanabe K. Ohtsuka K. Cell. Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS (Tween/PBS). The coverslips were washed in Tween/PBS and incubated for 1 h with a 1:150 dilution of a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham) (Hsp70) or a fluorescein-conjugated (FITC) anti-rabbit antibody (Nordic) (Hsp40). After 3 washes in Tween/PBS, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The fluorescence was detected by a Molecular Dynamics laser-scanning confocal microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63 ×/1.40 oil immersion objective. Image processing did not involve either background or contrast adjustments. To express nuc-luciferase or cyt-luciferase, O23 hamster cells were transiently transfected with either pRSVnlsLL/V or pRSVLL/V, respectively. The cells were heated at various temperatures, and luciferase activity in the lysates was followed as a function of time (Fig.1). The activity decayed following a first order reaction from 2 to 10 min heating at 40 °C, 2 to 6 min at 42 °C, or 2 to 4 min at 44 °C. Upon heat shocks exceeding the above-mentioned intervals, the inactivation kinetics departed from an exponential decay. Luciferase inactivation rate constants (k) were determined from the initial portion of the curves (Table I). When the temperature was elevated from 40 to 44 °C, the inactivation rates (k) increased 8–11-fold in control cells transfected with either nuc-luciferase or cyt-luciferase. As described before in murine cells (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in O23 hamster cells nuc-luciferase was more rapidly heat-inactivated than cyt-luciferase at all temperatures tested.Table IThermal inactivation rates of nuclear and cytoplasmic luciferase and effects of hu-Hsp40 and hu-Hsp7040 °C42 °C44 °CkPFkPFkPFmin −1min −1min −1nuc-luciferase control0.12 ± 0.01(1.0)0.48 ± 0.04(1.0)0.96 ± 0.08(1.0) hu-Hsp400.13 ± 0.020.920.54 ± 0.010.891.1 ± 0.10.87 hu-Hsp700.056 ± 0.012.10.29 ± 0.021.70.68 ± 0.031.4 hu-Hsp70 + 400.049 ± 0.0152.40.32 ± 0.021.50.67 ± 0.551.4cyt-luciferase control0.067 ± 0.019(1.0)0.35 ± 0.02(1.0)0.78 ± 0.03(1.0) hu-Hsp400.077 ± 0.0080.870.42 ± 0.010.830.97 ± 0.040.8 hu-Hsp700.017 ± 0.013.90.12 ± 0.012.90.32 ± 0.032.4 hu-Hsp70 + 400.018 ± 0.0133.70.13 ± 0.022.70.40 ± 0.042.0 Open table in a new tab Next, the effect of expression of the hu-Hsp40 on firefly luciferase thermostability was examined. O23 cells were transiently transfected with the pCMV40 expression vector, carrying the cDNA for the human DnaJ homologue (14Ohtsuka K. Masuda A. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of the hu-Hsp40 was evaluated by Western blotting (Fig.2). In lysates from unstressed, nontransfected cells or cells transfected with the pCMV5 empty vector, a weak Hsp40 band but no Hsp70 band was detected. In contrast, high amounts of both Hsp40 and Hsp70 were observed in untransfected cells that had been made thermotolerant by a priming heat shock followed by a recovery at 37 °C. Lysates from O23 cells transfected with pCMV40 showed a substantial increase in Hsp40 expression levels. No induction of the hamster Hsp70 was seen, indicating that expression of the hu-Hsp40 did not induce a general stress response and that the observed increase in Hsp40 signal can be assigned to the expression of the hu-Hsp40 and not the endogenous hamster Hsp40. In cells co-transfected with either cyt-luciferase or nuc-luciferase expression vectors and the pCMV40 expression vector, no protective effect of hu-Hsp40 on heat inactivation of luciferase was seen (Fig.3). Rather, inactivation rates were higher in cells expressing the hu-Hsp40 (open circles) compared with control cells (closed circles). For better quantitative comparison of protein inactivation in the absence or presence of HSPs, a protection factor (PF) was calculated by dividing the rate constant determined in the presence of co-transfected HSP by the rate constant of the corresponding control (Table I). At all temperatures tested, the PF for the hu-Hsp40 was below 1, indicating an unexpected heat sensitization rather than a protecting effect of this HSP. Expression of the hu-Hsp70 using pCMV70 as expression vector was possible in hamster O23 fibroblasts without inducing a general stress response. As can be seen in Fig. 2, control cells did not show any expression of the heat-inducible hamster Hsp70, whereas the expression of Hsp70 was clearly visible in the pCMV70-transfected cells. This occurred without any concurrent changes in the expression level of the stress-inducible hamster Hsp40. In cells expressing the hu-Hsp70, both luciferases were protected against heat inactivation at all temperatures tested (Fig. 3,closed squares; Table I). The PF for hu-Hsp70 was higher than 1 under all heat shock temperatures and decreased with increasing heat shock temperatures. The level of protection of nuc-luciferase was lower than of cyt-luciferase at all temperatures tested (Table I). Next, it was tested whether the hu-Hsp40 might affect the protective action of the hu-Hsp70. Cells were co-transfected with either cyt-luciferase or nuc-luciferase together with both hu-Hsp70 and hu-Hsp40 (Fig. 3, open squares) and subsequently heated at different temperatures. It is clear from both Fig. 3 and the PFs indicated in Table I that the co-transfection of the hu-Hsp40 with the hu-Hsp70 did not enhance (nor reduce) the protective action of the hu-Hsp70 alone. Loss of solubility can be used as an indicator of protein denaturation in addition to the loss of enzymatic activity. The solubility of recombinant luciferases, Hsp40 and Hsp70, in nondenaturing lysis buffer was examined. Lysates from cells expressing one of the recombinant proteins were fractionated by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g into a supernatant (S) and a pellet (P) containing the nuclei, the mitochondria, and part of the cytoskeleton. The distribution of the recombinant proteins in the fractions was probed by Western blotting (Fig.4). Both luciferases, Hsp40 and Hsp70, were detected in the soluble fraction from unstressed control cells. Markedly different results were obtained when lysates from heat-shocked (0, 5, 10, and 20 min 43 °C) cells were fractionated. As described before (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) both luciferases were redistributed into the pellet fractions, the nuclear luciferase more rapidly than the cytoplasmic luciferase. Like the luciferases, Hsp40 could be detected in the insoluble fraction after heat-shock. Overexpressed Hsp70 remained soluble under these conditions. Overexpression of hu-Hsp40 or hu-Hsp70 affected inactivation kinetics of both nuclear and cytoplasmic luciferases. Both HSPs have been reported to be localized predominantly in the cytoplasm before heat shock and to relocalize to the nucleus after heat shock (15Hattori H. Kaneda T. Lokeshwar B. Laszlo A. Ohtsuka K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar, 29Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4501-4513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the localization of transfected hu-Hsp40 and hu-Hsp70 was checked. Cells transfected with the appropriate transfection vectors were processed by indirect immunofluorescence and were examined by confocal microscopy (Fig.5). In cells overexpressing the hu-Hsp40 or hu-Hsp70, the proteins were not exclusively located in the cytoplasm. Clear staining was observed in the nucleus of nonheat-shocked cells as well. Therefore, with the current model we cannot detect whether heat-induced translocation or/and (low) pre-heat shock levels of these HSPs are responsible for their effects on luciferase inactivation in the nuclear compartment. It has been shown that a variety of mammalian cells expressing wild type, cytoplasmic, or nuclear luciferase were capable of partially reactivating these heat-inactivated reporter enzymes when allowed to recover at 37 °C in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor (21Pinto M. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13941-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We first examined whether O23 cells were also capable of recovering luciferases from the heat-inactivated state. After mild heat shocks of 15 min at 42 or 43 °C for example (Fig.6), both cyt-luciferase and nuc-luciferase could be recovered. Recovery was less for nuc-luciferase (circles) compared with cyt-luciferase (squares), but this might relate to a higher initial inactivation of the nuclear luciferase. Measurements on (differences in) luciferase recovery were not hampered by protein degradation. Fig.7 shows that the total amount of both luciferase proteins detected by Western blotting did not change during heating or up to 60 min thereafter.Figure 7Luciferase degradation during heat shock and recovery. O23 cells transiently transfected with pRSVnlsLL/V (NUC) or pRSVLL/V (CYT) were heated for 30 min at 44 °C and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0–60 min. Control cells were kept at 37 °C. Cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was present throughout the treatment to inhibit new protein synthesis. Cell lysates were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. These were probed with an anti-luciferase antibody.Upper lanes are for nuc-luciferase, bottom lanesare for cyt-luciferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Luciferase recovery was dependent on the severity of the inactivating heat shock as e.g. hardly no luciferase reactivation was seen in control cells within 60 min after a severe heat shock of 30 min at 44 °C (Fig. 8 A,closed circles). However, in cells expressing the hu-Hsp70, the recovery of both cytoplasmic and nuclear luciferase was strongly enhanced (closed squares). In contrast, in cells expressing the hu-Hsp40 alone, no recovery was observed within 60 min (open circles). The recovery in the hu-Hsp40-expressing cells was even reduced compared with the small recovery that could be observed when the control cells were allowed to recover 4 h after this severe stress (Fig. 8 B). It should be kept in mind that hu-Hsp70 expression markedly protected luciferase against heat inactivation, whereas in hu-Hsp40-expressing cells, the initial inactivation was found to be higher. When the hu-Hsp40 was expressed together with the hu-Hsp70 (open squares), the recovery of the cytoplasmic luciferase from a heat shock of 30 min at 44 °C was the same as with the hu-Hsp70 alone (closed squares) (Fig. 8 A, CYT). Intriguingly, this was not the case for the nuclear luciferase. In this case, the recovery of heat-inactivated luciferase was enhanced when the hu-Hsp40 was coexpressed with the hu-Hsp70 (open squares) compared with expression of the hu-Hsp70 alone (closed squares) (Fig. 8 A, NUC). This effect was not due to differences in the extent of heat inactivation of the nuclear luciferase as hu-Hsp40 did not affect hu-Hsp70-mediated luciferase protection (Fig. 1 and Table I). Thus, after a heat shock of 30 min at 44 °C, the recovery of the nuc-luciferase but not the cyt-luciferase in the presence of the hu-Hsp70 was enhanced by coexpression of the hu-Hsp40. In vitro studies have shown that the level of Hsp70-mediated recovery of luciferase from its denatured state is highly dependent on the stoichiometry of Hsp70 and luciferase (30Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the coexpression of hu-Hsp40 might have changed the Hsp70/luciferase ratio in the cell. Cells were transfected with either luciferase and pCMV70 alone or with luciferase and both pCMV70 and pCMV40, and lysates containing equal luciferase activities were probed for Hsp70 levels (Fig. 9).

In malignant cancer formation cells in the primary neoplasm undergo phenotypic changes and progress to invasive and metastatic stages (1Nicolson G.L. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1991; 3: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Tumor cells metastasize by a multistep process as follows: proliferation and invasion of malignant cells at primary sites; penetration into the lymphatics, blood circulation, and body cavities; transport; extravasation at distant tissue or organs; and invasion and growth at the secondary site (1Nicolson G.L. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1991; 3: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The tumor cells must also evade immune destruction during the metastatic process. Many of these processes involve aberrant properties of tumor cell surfaces (2Nicolson G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 175-224PubMed Google Scholar), which are acquired through altered expression of cellular genes. One of the critical steps in the metastasis process is detachment of tumor cells from the primary neoplasm. Molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly understood (2Nicolson G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 175-224PubMed Google Scholar). For tumor cells to be released from the primary site, tumor cell adhesions to neighboring cells and the basement membrane must be partially or completely abolished. Decreased levels of integrins and/or E-cadherin are found in many invasive and metastatic cancer cells, suggesting that the poor adhesiveness of the cancer cells may be a pre-requisite for malignant cancer with a high metastatic potential (3Sommers C.L. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Gui G.P.H. Puddefoot J.R. Vinson G.P. Wells C.A. Carpenter R. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, other metastatic cancer cells retain their normal levels of adhesion molecules (3Sommers C.L. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One explanation for these observations is that the surface of these metastatic cancer cells is covered by anti-adhesive molecules, such as membrane mucins (5Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway III, K.L. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hilkens J. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.Y. Trends Biochem.

Fregien N. Carraway III, K.L. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). It is distinct in size and composition from other well known membrane mucins, such as MUC1 and leukosialin (CD43) (7Carraway K.L. Hull S.R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Van Klinken B.J.-W. Dekker J. Buller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar). SMC is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex composed of a large mucin subunit ASGP-1 and a transmembrane subunit ASGP-2 (9Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O.A. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The complex is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide, encoded by a single gene (10Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cleaved into its two subunits at an early stage of its biosynthesis (12Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mucin subunit ASGP-1 contains 11 full repeats of ≈125 amino acid residues each plus two partial repeats (11Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is heavily O-glycosylated on serine and threonine residues (13Sherblom A.P. Buck R.L.

Chem. 1984; 259: 4866-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that the SMC may be involved in a protective function, diminishing cancer cell killing mediated by NK cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T-cells (5Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway III, K.L. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar,15Sherblom A.P. Moody C.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4543-4546PubMed Google Scholar, 16Moriarty J. Skelly C.M. Bharathan S. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6800-6805PubMed Google Scholar). In normal epithelial tissues membrane-associated mucins are expressed only on the apical surface of the cell (5Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway III, K.L. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In contrast, mucins are often overexpressed in nonpolarized tumor cells, raising the question whether mucins dispersed over the cell surface facilitate tumor metastasis by altering the adhesion properties of the cells. Studies of the modulation of cell adhesion by mucins such as epiglycanin and episialin (MUC1) suggest that these mucins prevent integrin-mediated cell-matrix and E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions (18Ligtenberg M.J.L. Buijs F. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kemperman H. Wijnands Y. Wesseling J. Niessen C.M. Sonnenberg A. Roos E. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed by immunological analyses of human breast cancer cells in solid tumors and tumor effusions that the more aggressive cells in effusions tend to express SMC, whereas cells within the solid tumors did not (21Wu K. Salas P.J.I. Yee L. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3139-3147PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for SMC in tumor progression. Furthermore, we have observed more than a 100-fold decrease in the expression of SMC in cells of an ascites 13762 subline after selection for growth in culture (22Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We propose that overexpression of SMC causes tumor cell release from a primary site by its potent anti-adhesion effect which ultimately leads to metastasis. We have therefore tested the anti-adhesive effects of SMC in vitroby transfecting the SMC gene into human cancer cell lines. For this purpose we have generated recombinant cDNAs for SMC which vary in the number of mucin repeats. These cDNAs were transfected and expressed under the control of tetracycline-responsive inducible promoter. Here we show that the human melanoma cell line A375 cells undergo a distinct morphological change and lose cell adhesion to plastic and to neighboring cells in culture when SMC expression is induced to the high levels that are found in 13762 ascites cells. Most importantly, the tetracycline-regulated expression enabled us to vary the cell surface level of SMC and to demonstrate a reversible transition between the adhesive and nonadhesive states of cells which is controlled by SMC level. The oligonucleotide W8 (GATCTGACCGTTATC) was used to prime the reverse transcription reaction to synthesize the first strand cDNA encoding the 5′-half of the entire cDNA sequence. cDNA was then amplified by PCR between L33 (L33 (TCTGTGCTGTGGAGATTCCTGAGGGAGCCTAAG) and R33 (GTAGATGATCGCTGAGTAGACTGTCTGTGCGCT) primers (Fig. 1 A). The SMC-specific oligonucleotide primers used for the hybridization were T5 (TGTCGTGGTTGTTGTAGAGGTCTC), A1-S (TTCTCTGGAGCCATGCGAGG), and A1-R (CTCCTACTGGAAGTAGATGG) (Fig. 1 A). The amplimers obtained were ligated with the 3′ 5-kbp clone at a unique DraIII site to generate cDNA constructs for the functional SMC analogs. These constructs were then subcloned into mammalian expression vectors. The inducible expression vector puHD10-3 and the transactivator plasmid tTA for expressing transactivator gene were kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen Kelly (National Institutes of Health). pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego). A375 human melanoma cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were grown in the complete media recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. These cell lines were transfected with cDNAs for SMC analogs and tTA using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then cultured in the G418- and hygromycin-containing media for the selection of the transfectants. Drug concentrations for the selection were 0.8 mg/ml G418 and 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin for A375 cells and 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.07 mg/ml hygromycin for MCF-7 cells. Clones with high expression levels of the SMC analogs were selected from the drug-resistant populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting following the cell surface staining with the anti-ASGP-2 mAb 4F12 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Monoclonal antibodies against ASGP-2 (4F12 and 13C4) were described previously (22Rossi E.A. McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Anti-ASGP-1 polyclonal antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide contained in the sequence near the C terminus of human ASGP-1, and reacts with the ASGP-1 from rat mammary adenocarcinoma 13762 cells. Cells from subconfluent cultures were detached gently from the plate by treating with PBS- and EDTA-containing dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed 2–3 times with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 3% BSA. Subsequently, cell suspensions were incubated with anti-ASGP-2 mAb 4F12 or anti-integrin α5 mAb (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). The fluorescence intensity was determined by FACScan analysis. The number of SMC molecules per cell was estimated by comparison with 13762 ascites cells, whose SMC content was determined from their sialic acid analyses (13Sherblom A.P. Buck R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 783-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were detached from the plate by treating with dissociation buffer as described above. After rinsing three times with PBS, cells were seeded at 3 × 106 cells/ml in complete media into 24-well plates coated with agarose. The formation of cell aggregates was observed microscopically 24–72 h later. Fibronectin was purchased from Sigma. Laminin and collagen IV were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Non-tissue culture-treated 6-well plates (Sarstedt) were coated with 20 μg of fibronectin (Sigma), laminin, or collagen IV (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were rinsed once with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Exponentially growing cells were detached from plates by treating with dissociation buffer, as described above. After rinsing three times with PBS, cells were resuspended in the adhesion assay media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.25% BSA). The viability of the cells was checked by trypan blue exclusion. At least 95% viability was confirmed before each assay. Cell suspensions (1 × 105 cells in 1.5 ml) were added to each ECM-coated well and incubated at 37 °C for the different times. After removal of the non-adherent cells by washing the wells twice with PBS, the remaining adherent cells were lysed with 0.8% Triton X-100 in PBS. The relative cell number was determined from aliquots of cell lysates using the CytoTox 96 assay kit (Promega), as described by the company. The number of adherent cells was determined as the percentage of the total number of cells added to each well. For correction of the nonspecific binding of cells, the number of cells bound to the BSA-coated wells was subtracted from the value of the experimental wells. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. The 9-kbp sequence of the sialomucin complex precursor (pSMC-1) mRNA was determined from several overlapping cDNA clones which were obtained by several different cloning methods, including 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technology (10Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single, contiguous cDNA containing the complete pSMC-1 coding region has never been isolated. To perform functional analyses of the sialomucin complex by transfection and expression in different mammalian cell lines, it was necessary to generate pSMC-1 cDNA in an appropriate expression vector. The largest single cDNA previously obtained is the 3′ 5 kbp of the pSMC-1 message. This cDNA contains the entire ASGP-2 coding region and 544 bases of the ASGP-1 3′ sequence, beginning in the repeat region (Fig. 1 A). The strategy for constructing the full-length cDNA required generating the remaining 5′ end of the pSMC-1 mRNA by RT-PCR and ligating this amplification product to the 3′ 5 kbp cDNA sequence. For this purpose, first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using poly(A)+ RNA from 13762 MAT C-1 ascites cells as a template and W8, which is contained near the 5′ end of the 3′ 5-kbp cDNA clone and is 3′ of a unique restriction endonuclease site DraIII, as a primer. This site could be used for the subsequent ligation of the 5′ and 3′ cDNAs (Fig. 1 A). The 5′ cDNA was then amplified by PCR between 5′ primer L33 from the 5′-untranslated region and 3′ primer R33 which is nested to the W8 primer (Fig. 1 A). The expected PCR product is about 5 kbp in size and contains part of the 5′-untranslated region, the translation initiation codon, all of the tandem repeat sequence, and a part of the ASGP-1 3′-unique sequence. Following RT-PCR, amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to nitrocellulose, and further identified by hybridization with an additional oligonucleotide, T5, which is contained in the mucin repeat sequence of ASGP-1. Surprisingly, many bands were observed, ranging from the size of ≈400 base pairs to ≈6 kbp (data not shown). To investigate the origin of these products, they were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and screened for the presence of ASGP-1 sequences by hybridization with two additional gene-specific oligonucleotide probes: A1-S, whose sequence spans the translation initiation site of pSMC-1, and A1-R, a sequence from the 3′-unique region of ASGP-1 (Fig.1 A). Positive hybridization to these oligonucleotides indicated that the inserts of these plasmids were authentic amplification products of the pSMC-1 message, since they included these nested sequences from both the 5′ and 3′ ends. The sizes of these inserts were determined by digesting the plasmid DNA with EcoRI and separating the fragments on an agarose gel and found to vary between 500 base pairs and 4 kbp, corresponding to the products observed from the original RT-PCR (Fig. 1 B). Further confirmation that these were indeed cDNA sequences encoding ASGP-1 was obtained by DNA sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the 3′ and 5′ ends of selected clones, clone R15 (3.8 kbp), clone h (2.4 kbp), clone e (1.5 kbp) and clone f (800 base pairs) were determined (Fig. 2 A). As expected, sequencing indicated that these clones were identical to ASGP-1 and contained the 5′- and 3′-unique sequences and the repeat region (Fig. 2 A). These observations lead to the interpretation that differences in the sizes of the RT-PCR products result from the fact that each amplimer contains a different number of the tandom repeats. Sequencing within the repeat domains is difficult because of annealing of the primers at multiple sites in the repeat sequences. Thus, it was possible to perform complete sequencing of only the two smallest clones, clone f and clone e. The number of mucin repeats in each clone was estimated by the sizes of the insert. Clone R15, clone h, clone e, and clone f contain ≈8, 5, 3, and 1 repeats, respectively. Amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence showed a high content of serine (20%), threonine (31%), and proline (6%) residues in the repeat sequence, as expected for mucin-type glycoproteins (Fig. 2 B). These observations provided evidence that we have generated recombinant cDNAs for ASGP-1 by RT-PCR which are different only in the number of mucin repeats. The mechanism for the generation of these multiple amplimers undoubtedly resides in the high degree of homology in the tandem repeat sequences (Fig. 3). During the polymerase chain reaction, especially with long PCR times, DNA polymerase often terminates before completing the replication of the template strand. In the case of pSMC the incomplete copy often ended within the repeated sequence domain. These incomplete strands accumulate during the cycles and can undergo annealing, due to the high homology within the repeat sequences. The polymerase would then act as a primer from the ends of these partial sequences and fill in the remaining portion to complete the synthesis of a shortened, double-stranded ASGP-1 sequence, creating a deletion within the repeat domain. These shorter ASGP-1 sequences would then be amplified in the later PCR cycles. Therefore, recombinant cDNAs for ASGP-1 with the different number of repeats have been produced. These derivatives permit us to investigate the role of mucin size and repeat number in mucin function. Each of the different ASGP-1 cDNAs was ligated to the 5-kbp 3′ clone at the DraIII site to yield ASGP-1/ASGP-2 cDNA constructs, rep8, rep5, rep3, and rep1. Relative sizes of these recombinant cDNAs were compared with the native form (Fig.4). To express SMC in mammalian cell lines under the control of tetracycline-responsive promoter, constructs rep8, rep5, and rep3 were subcloned into the inducible expression vector pUHD10-3. Construct rep1 was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for constitutive expression. Contributions of sialomucin complex to cell surface properties can be best studied by transfecting the SMC gene into cell lines and altering the expression level using an inducible system. We transfected SMC cDNA constructs into A375 human melanoma and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines to determine whether SMC cell surface expression alters the adhesive properties of these cells. The two cell lines were chosen because neither contains endogenous SMC at a detectable level. The tetracycline-responsive expression system has been established for highly efficient regulation of transfected genes in mammalian cells (23Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar). In this system tTA protein, a fusion protein of the tet repressor of Escherichia coli and the activating domain of herpes simplex viral protein VP16, binds to tet operator sequences from Tn10 (tetO) fused to a minimal promoter sequence and activates transcription of the gene inserted downstream of the tetO promoter. The tetO promoter is virtually silent without activation by tTA. Since tTA does not bind to the tetO sequence in the presence of the antibiotic tetracycline, transcriptional activation by tTA can be repressed by addition of tetracycline to the culture media. For the regulation of the expression of SMC, cDNAs for SMC in tetO vector (PCH10-3) and transactivator (tTA) gene were co-transfected into the cell lines. During selection of inducible transfectants, cells were grown in tetracycline-containing media (2 μg/ml) to repress expression of SMC. Expression of SMC was induced in transfectants by removing tetracycline from the culture media, and protein products were characterized by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with anti-ASGP-2 mAb 13C4. Transfectants of both A375 and MCF-7 cells expressed ASGP-2 with a size similar to ASGP-2 in 13762 ascites cells (Fig. 5 A). The sizes of ASGP-2 protein expressed from all four different cDNAs, Rep8, Rep5, Rep3, and Rep1, were identical in each cell type. These data indicate that precursors of the recombinant proteins are processed in the same manner as the native sialomucin complex in ascites cells by proteolytic cleavage of the precursor into two subunits and co-/post-translational glycosylation (12Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was confirmed by a pulse-chase analysis in which mature ASGP-2 first appears in a 30-min chase (Fig.5 B). A375 cells expressing Rep1 SMC analog were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 10 min and chased for the indicated times. Cells were then lysed in 0.5% SDS lysis buffer, and after the addition of Nonidet P-40 to the cell lysate, the precursor protein and mature ASGP-2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-ASGP-2 polyclonal antibodies. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by fluorography. In this pulse-chase experiment, the ASGP-1 molecule disappears after the cleavage of the precursor protein pSMC, because association of the two subunits is disrupted by SDS lysis. Next, we compared the molecular weight of ASGP-1 expressed from the different cDNA constructs. Each transfectant was lysed in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and SMC was immunoprecipitated using anti-ASGP-2 mAb 13C4. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of ASGP-1 and its molecular weight by immunoblotting with anti-ASGP-1 polyclonal antibody HA-1 following SDS-PAGE. ASGP-1 was detected in each transfectant, with the apparent M r varying between 170 and ≈300. The apparent correspondence in migration of the 5 and 8 repeat forms is not too surprising, since migration of large, highly glycosylated proteins on SDS-PAGE is often anomalous, because it is dependent on charge as well as size. Overall, these results have demonstrated that the two subunits, ASGP-1 and ASGP-2, are associated and present as a complex in these transfected cell lines, as they are in 13762 ascites cells, and that the size of ASGP-1 differs depending on the size of the transfected cDNA construct (Fig. 5 C). By CsCl density gradient centrifugation, we also demonstrated that the densities of SMC molecules increase with the increasing number of mucin repeats, indicating an increased amount glycosylation on the SMC proteins (data not shown). These results show that the expressed SMC analogs have the properties expected and required for the study of SMC function. Induction of SMC expression and analyses of the expression levels on the cell surfaces in the transfectants were monitored by FACScan analysis. When induced, SMC was strongly expressed on the cell surface of A375 transfectants, and levels of expression were comparable to those found on the 13762 ascites cells (>106 molecules/cell) (Fig. 6 A). A375 transfectants with the constitutive expression of Rep1 were also expressed at a similar level. When inducible transfectants were cultured with 1–2 μg/ml tetracycline, lower levels of SMC (approximately 10,000 molecules/cell) were expressed, indicating that the expression of transfected genes was not completely abrogated by tetracycline. Nevertheless, the induction of expression resulted in a nearly 100-fold increase in the cell surface level of SMC. For cell adhesion assays comparing the cells expressing different levels of SMC, cell surface levels of integrin α5 were determined in the presence and absence of tetracycline. FACScan analysis using anti-human integrin α5 mAb showed that removal of tetracycline and induction of SMC expression have no effect on the cell surface levels of this adhesion molecule, and the levels are similar to those on parental cells (Fig.6 B). Similar results were obtained from FACScan analyses for MCF-7 transfectants. Both A375 and MCF-7 transfectants are therefore useful for analyses of anti-adhesive effects of SMC. If cell surface SMC suppresses cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, it should affect cell morphology, adhesiveness, and motility. For malignant tumor cells with abundant SMC, inhibition of cell adhesion might be potent enough to cause tumor cell detachment from solid tumor mass, allowing tumor cells to circulate in body fluid without attaching to neighboring tissues. Supporting this idea, previous analyses in human breast cancers showed that a higher fraction of tumor cells from effusions expressed SMC than cells within solid tumors (21Wu K. Salas P.J.I. Yee L. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3139-3147PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore compared the cell surface levels of SMC of 13762 adenocarcinoma ascites MAT-B1 cells growing in the peritoneal fluid of the rat with those of its adherent derivative subline selected to grow on plastic dishes. FACScan analysis showed ascites cells expressed over 106 molecules of SMC on the cell surface, whereas adherent sublines showed >100-fold decreased expression (Fig.7). These findings raised a question whether the transition between adherent and non-adherent state of metastasizing tumor cells can be modulated by cell surface level of SMC. To answer this question in vitro, we varied the cell surface levels of SMC in A375 cell lines using the inducible expression system. At low levels of cell surface expression (≈10,000 molecules/cell), SMC did not show a significant effect on the morphology of these cells compared with the parent line. When overexpression (>106 molecules/cell) was induced, however, SMC demonstrated a potent anti-adhesive effect. In the absence of tetracycline in the culture media, A375 clone Rep8, expressing the eight-repeat mucin, completely altered its cell morphology to a spherical shape and became detached from the tissue culture dish (Fig.8, A and B). Cells remained in suspension and did not aggregate even at high density, indicating that overexpression of SMC on the cell surface strongly disrupts both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Moreover, reduction of SMC level ≈100-fold by addition of tetracycline to the culture media restored cell adhesion within 48 h (Fig. 8, B and C). The transition between the suspension and adherent states of the cells was fully reversi"

In contrast, the domain had little or no affinity for Ca(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and Ni(II) relative to copper. Neutron activation analysis of the copper bound to the domain showed a copper:protein ratio of 6.5–7.3:1. Both Cu(II) and Cu(I) were found to have a higher affinity for the domain relative to Zn(II). In addition, a sharp, reproducible transition was only observed in competition experiments with copper, which may suggest that copper binding has some degree of cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W2054816184,"A biological role for MEF2 (myocyteenhancer factor 2) activity during mammalian myogenesis has been inferred but not directly proven because of its role in the transcriptional activation of many muscle-specific genes. Therefore, our purpose was to determine whether MEF2 activity is absolutely required for mammalian myogenesis. Using a dominant-negative approach to address this question, we constructed a mutated MEF2A protein comprised of the amino-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain of MEF2A without its trans-activation domain as a bacterial fusion protein (GST-131) or in a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA-131). GST-131 and the protein encoded by pcDNA-131 bind specifically to the MEF2cis element and abrogate trans-activation of a MEF2-responsive luciferase reporter gene by wild type MEF2A, thus serving a role as trans-dominant inhibitors of MEF2 function. In congruence with their ability to interfere with wild type MEF2 function, microinjection of GST-131 or pcDNA-131 into L6E9 or C2C12 myoblasts inhibited myotube formation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the expression of myogenin, myosin heavy chain, and MEF2A were inhibited in the GST-131 or pcDNA-131-injected cells compared with GST or pcDNA-injected controls. We also document that this trans-dominant MEF2 inhibitor impairs the myogenic conversion of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts by MyoD.

The MEF2 (myocyte enhancerfactor 2) genes have been implicated in the complex hierarchical regulation of muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation.

The MEF2 proteins bind as homo- and heterodimers to a cis element with the consensus (C/T)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A) via interactions between their amino-terminal MADS/MEF2 domain and the major groove of DNA (11Sharrocks A.D. von Hesler F.

The MEF2 proteins are also involved in complex heterotypic protein-protein interactions with members of the myogenic bHLH family (14Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), p300/CBP (15Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and these interactions may fulfill modulatory roles and confer tissue-specific regulation. The precise role of MEF2 proteins during myogenesis is controversial. Kaushal et al. documented that MEF2A protein does have the ability to activate the muscle gene expression program (17Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a property originally ascribed to the myogenic bHLH 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MHC, myosin heavy chain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MCK, muscle creatine kinase. proteins as the ability to convert certain nonmuscle cell lines to muscle (18Lassar A.B.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Conversely, Molkentin and co-workers found that MEF2 factors lack this ability, although they have reported that MEF2 proteins potentiate the myogenic activity of the bHLH proteins and that this potentiation is due to physical interactions between the MADS-MEF2 domain of the MEF2 proteins and the bHLH proteins (14Molkentin J.D.

A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Despite these discrepancies concerning the “myogenic potential” of the MEF2 proteins, several related lines of genetic and biochemical evidence suggest an important role for the MEF2 proteins during mammalian myogenesis: (a) the presence of the MEF2 enhancer in the regulatory regions of many muscle structural genes (reviewed in Ref. 21Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), (b) the synergistic trans-activation of muscle-specific target genes by the interaction of the MEF2 and myogenic bHLH proteins (13Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N.

Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), (c) the role of MEF2 proteins in stabilizing myogenin expression during myogenesis (22Edmondson D.G. Cheng T. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and (d) the observation that the functional inactivation of the single DrosophilaMEF2 homologue results in a disruption of normal muscle formation (23Bour B.A. O'Brien M.A. Lockwood W.L. Goldstein E.S. Bodmer R. Taghert P.H. Abmayr S.M. Nguyen H.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,24Lilly B. Zhao B. Ranganayakulu G. Paterson B. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Science. 1995; 267: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Perhaps another approach to further characterizing the biological relevance of the MEF2 proteins for muscle formation is to ask whether the MEF2 proteins are essential for myogenesis in mammalian cells. Loss of function assays using gene targetting in mice is one elegant approach to this question, although it may be initially complicated by functional redundancy due to the overlapping function of the four MEF2 genes, as has been shown to be the case for the myogenic bHLH proteins (25Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 26Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J. Olson E.N.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because dominant inhibitory genes are potentially useful in generating loss-of-function mutations, we approached this question by constructing a trans-dominant MEF2 inhibitor, which, when expressed in differentiating muscle cells, would abrogate the function of the endogenous MEF2 proteins, thus revealing their cumulative effect on the myogenic program. Here we report that a GST-MEF2A fusion protein (GST-131) or an expression plasmid encoding the same polypeptide (pcDNA-131 or pMT2–131), in which the carboxyl-terminal trans-activation domain of MEF2A (amino acids 132–507) is deleted, is capable of binding specifically to the MCK MEF2 site, inhibiting trans-activation by the wild type MEF2A protein, extinguishing myogenin, myosin heavy chain and MEF2A expression, and inhibiting the myogenic differentiation program in C3H10T1/2 converted by ectopic MyoD expression and L6E9 and C2C12 muscle cells. Thus, these experiments provide the first evidence that the trans-activation function of the endogenous MEF2 proteins during mammalian myogenesis is critical for muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation. Mammalian myoblast cell lines, C2C12 and L6E9, were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in plastic dishes coated with 1% gelatin. Differentiation into myotubes was induced by changing the medium to DMEM + 5% horse serum. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 1–131 amino acids of MEF2A was cloned into PGEX-2T (GST-131). GST-131 and GST fusion proteins were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol by column purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The DNA binding assays were carried out as described previously (5McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.-T. Andres V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosytems synthesizer. For the DNA binding assays, the incubation reaction contained 0.2 μg of GST fusion protein (GST-131 or GST alone), 0.2 ng of radiolabeled MCK MEF2 site probe (the core nucleotide sequence of the probe being 5′-cgctctaaaaataaccct-3′), 0.45 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 100 ng of single stranded oligonucleotide, in a total volume of 20 μl. The bound fraction was separated from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide-bis, 29:1) at 4 °C. For the immuno-gel shift analysis, where appropriate, 1 μl of antiserum or preimmune serum was added to the preincubation reaction. HeLa cells were grown in 60-mm dishes in DMEM+10% fetal bovine serum to approximately 60% confluence. For standard reporter assays the appropriate reporter/expression plasmid combination was transfected into HeLa cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. The cells were glycerol shocked after 24 h and harvested after 4 days. Each plate of cells was transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate luciferase or CAT reporter construct and 2 μg of pSV β-galactosidase, which served as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. For the overexpression studies 2.5 μg of an additional construct was transfected comprising either the MEF2A coding region in a pMT2 expression vector or the pMT2 vector alone as a control. The pcDNA-131 or pMT2–131 expression vector was added (at either 1 or 5 μg) to the transfection mix where appropriate (see figure legends for details in individual experiments). Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity was determined as described by the manufacturer (Promega). CAT activity was determined as previously reported (31Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reporters consisted of the following: the MEF2-responsive region of the c-jun promoter upstream of a basal promoter luciferase construct (nucleotides −225 to +150 of the c-jun promoter pJLuc) or a corresponding control (nucleotides −53 to +42 of the c-fos basal promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene p0FLuc) (32Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The CAT reporters consisted of the following: the embryonic myosin heavy chain promoter (MHC emb) CAT gene downstream of two copies of the MCK MEF2 sites, inserted in a concatemerized orientation at the −102 position of the MHC emb promoter in plasmid PE102CAT (PE102CAT2xMEF2), or the same vector without the MEF2 sites present (PE102CAT). 1000 HeLa cells for each combination of protein (0.5 mg/ml GST or GST-131) and plasmids (50 ng/ml pMT2-MEF2A and 50 ng/ml pJLuc) were injected as described below, and then growth medium was replaced with DMEM + 5% horse serum. After 48 h. cells were collected into 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, and freeze-thawed four times, and total protein was determined using the Bradford protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were used for estimating luciferase activity in different cell extracts, according to the luciferase assay kit (Promega). For microinjection assays, L6E9 or C2C12 muscle cells were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips for 2 days. L6E9 or C2C12 muscle cells were injected directly into the nucleus with 0.5 mg/ml solution of GST or GST-131 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, with an Eppendorf injection system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 35m microscope. Each cell was injected for 0.2 s at constant pressure of 150 hectopascal, receiving approximately 0.5 pg of protein/cell in 10 femtoliters. Dishes were rinsed after injection with serum-free DMEM and replenished with differentiation medium (DMEM + 5% horse serum). Myogenesis was evident in GST-injected cultures after 3–4 days. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as recently described (31Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, three times, and fixed for 5 min in cold methanol at −20 °C. Cells were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-MEF2A, anti-myogenin monclonal antibodies (F5D), or anti-myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibodies (MF20). As secondary antibodies, we used fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma; 1:1000). Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were counterstained for nuclei with ethidium bromide at 2 μg/ml for 2–5 min. Coverslips were examined using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 laser-scanning confocal imaging system equipped with the Bio-Rad COMOS operating software. Photographs were made on Kodak TMAX 100 film. C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, the cells were plated at 5 × 105 on 60-mm diameter dishes 1 day prior to transfection with plasmid DNA (15 μg of total DNA adjusted with pMT2) by the standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. 6 μg of pMT2-MyoD or pMT2-MEF2A and 5 μg of pMT2–131 expression plasmid were used. Cells were washed 16 h later, subjected to 15% glycerol shock, and refed with growth medium. 1 day later, the cells were switched to differentiation medium (5% horse serum). Myotube formation was evaluated by morphology and myosin heavy chain staining after 6 days. Confluent cultures of myotubes (L6E9 and C2C12) grown on 100-mm dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell monolayers were freeze-thawed once by floating the dishes on liquid nitrogen for 10 s and then in a warm bath (37 °C). 300 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added per dish, and lysed cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes. The lysate was sonicated on ice (2 times, 10 s. each) and cleared by centrifugation. To 300 μl of cell lysate 1 μl of GST-131 fusion protein (2.5 mg/ml) was added along with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and the mixture was allowed to rock on a nutator for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of the anti-myogenin hybridoma supernatant (F5D) was combined with the lysate and incubated for 2 h as mentioned above, followed by adding 2 μl of rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, 2.8 μg/μl) and incubation for another 2 h. 10% protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) was added for overnight incubation. The beads were briefly washed three times with lysis buffer, and 30 μl/tube of complete 2 × Laemmli SDS sample buffer was used to prepare samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 10% polyacrylamide mini-gels were loaded with 10 μl of sample/lane, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with specific antibodies (anti-myogenin, anti-MEF2D, or anti-GST antiserum). The highly conserved MEF2 DNA-binding domain has been well characterized in terms of its location within the MEF2 proteins, amino acid sequence constraints, and its binding specificity (11Sharrocks A.D. von Hesler F. Shaw P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Nurrish S.J. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4076-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This information allowed us to construct a trans-dominant MEF2 inhibitor by using the DNA-binding domain of MEF2A (amino acids 1–131) with the carboxyl-terminal trans-activation region (amino acids 132–507) of the protein deleted. The rationale being that such a molecule would act in a dominant-negative manner by binding to DNA without being able to activate transcription, thus displacing the binding, and subsequently abrogate the trans-activation function of the wild type MEF2 proteins. Initially we tested the capacity of a GST-MEF2 amino-terminal fusion protein (GST-131) to bind to a double stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide comprising the previously characterized MCK enhancer MEF2 site (Fig.1, A, B, and C). The specificity of the protein-DNA complex was determined by using an unlabeled MEF2 site as a competitor and a previously characterized antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 108–122 of MEF2A (Fig. 1 A). The results of these experiments show that the GST-MEF2A fusion protein can bind specifically to DNA, whereas GST alone cannot (Fig.1 A). Also a MEF2A antibody recognizes and “supershifts” the GST-131-binding complex (Fig. 1 B). The GST-131 fusion protein does not heterodimerize with the wild type MEF2 because no intermediate DNA-binding complex was formed when the GST-131 protein and extracts from C2C12 myotubes were mixed (Fig. 1 C). This is probably due to the fusion protein already existing in a stable dimeric form when it is produced. We have noticed in other assays that efficient dimerization of the MEF2 proteins requires co-translation, but it is difficult to determine if this is a peculiarity of in vitro translation and bacterial fusion protein production or whether stable dimers actually form during translation in vivo. These experiments show that GST-131 protein is capable of efficient binding to DNA but may be compromised in its ability to exchange dimerization partners. We next attempted to assess if the GST-131 could antagonize trans-activation of a MEF2-responsive element of the c-jun promoter by the wild type MEF2A protein. To do this we microinjected a MEF2-responsive reporter construct, pJLuc (32Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a MEF2A expression vector (pMT2-MEF2A) and the GST-131 protein (or GST alone) into HeLa cells. Data from these experiments show that the GST-131 protein essentially negates the trans-activation of the pJLuc reporter by wild type MEF2A, whereas GST alone does not (Fig.2 A). The data in Fig.2 B indicate that MEF2A activates pJluc in standard reporter assays and that a basal reporter (p0Fluc) is not influenced by overexpression of MEF2A. The level of luciferase activity with pJLuc when pMT2 is co-transfected is quite high compared with the basal reporter (p0FLuc). This activity is due to the activation of the pJLuc reporter by endogenous factors and not by pMT2. In addition to the MEF2 site, the c-Jun enhancer (pJLuc) also contains AP1, GC box, CAAT, and other elements. The luciferase activity of pJLuc is not different if one compares its activity with or without co-transfection with pMT2 (data not shown). Even though the fusion protein does not contain a trans-activation domain and therefore probably does not contact the basal transcription machinery, we wanted to ascertain that the effect that we observe is not due to a general “squelching” of transcription factors associated with the basal transcription machinery. We reasoned that this type of effect would probably result in a more general inhibition of transcriptional activation. We therefore tested if overexpressed pMT2–131 affected the activation of the enhancer/promoter from the cyclin A gene that is not activated by MEF2 factors and does not contain a MEF2 site. In this assay we could not detect any inhibitory influence of pMT2–131 (the region encoding amino acids 1–131 of MEF2A cloned into the pMT2 mammalian expression vector) on the transcriptional activation of the cyclin A promoter, indicating that the effect we observe is specific to promoters containing the MEF2 site and is not due to a general squelching of basal transcription factors (Fig. 2 C). Also, to independently confirm that it is indeed the MEF2 part of the GST fusion protein that is inhibiting MEF2 activity, we performed a complementary experiment in which we co-transfected pMT2–131 along with wild type MEF2A and MEF2C and observed that it inhibited the trans-activation function of the wild type MEF2A and MEF2C proteins, indicating that the effect of the MEF2A dominant-negative also inhibits MEF2C trans-activation (Fig. 2 D). Together, these data show that the MEF2A-131 amino terminus can bind specifically to the MEF2 site and also inhibit the trans-activation of MEF2 site bearing target genes by the wild type MEF2A and MEF2C proteins. We reasoned that if MEF2 activity is absolutely required for mammalian myogenesis, the introduction of a fusion protein that interferes with MEF2 function into muscle cells might inhibit myogenesis. Having characterized GST-131 as a good candidate to fulfill a role as a trans-dominant MEF2 inhibitor, we microinjected this protein into the nucleus of L6E9 cultured muscle cells. To assess the effect of the mutated protein we studied the morphology of the GST-131-injected cells compared with GST-injected cells within the same culture dish under identical culture conditions. In these experiments, the injection per se did not interfere with the differentiation process because the GST-injected controls always formed myotubes in the normal time frame for these cells. In terms of gross morphology we found that the GST-131-injected cells were inhibited in forming myotubes compared with the GST-injected cells (Fig.3 A, Phase contrast). This experiment was repeated 14 times (with 1600–2000 cells being injected per experiment), and the same result was observed in each experiment. As with the transcriptional inhibition assays we then sought to perform an analogous experiment with the pcDNA-131 expression vector. Again using microinjection technology we show that nuclear injection of pcDNA-131 into myogenic cells results in an inhibition of differentiation (Fig. 4, Phase contrast). In these experiments we observed a more complete block of differentiation with the expression plasmid than with the injection of the fusion protein. In these experiments a small number of GST-131- or pcDNA-131-injected cells do express muscle markers, although myotubes are not formed by these cells (Figs. 3 and 4). It is conceivable that for an unknown reason these cells are refractory to the effect of the GST-131- or pcDNA-131-encoded protein or simply that these cells were inadvertantly not injected even though they were in the injection field (typically 800–1000 cells are injected for each condition). Also, the inhibition of myogenesis by the GST-131 protein is a reversible phenomena because we can eventually see myotube formation in the GST-131-injected cells. Using an antibody against the GST portion of the fusion protein, we have determined that the differentiation of the GST-131-injected cultures occurs 1–2 days after the loss of immunodetectable GST-131 fusion protein in the cells, thus indicating that the “escape” is due to the eventual degradation of the fusion protein (data not shown). When we inject the expression plasmid (pcDNA-131), the block of myogenesis is more complete and was apparent for at least 6 days. These data therefore suggest that the inhibition of myogenesis by GST-131 or pcDNA-131 is reversible but prevails as long as the protein is present. To further characterize the effects of GST-131 and pcDNA-131 beyond the morphological level, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze the expression of markers of muscle differentiation (MEF2A, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain) in the injected cells. We found that the GST-131- or pcDNA-131-injected cells did not express detectable levels of myogenin at the same time as the GST- or pcDNA-injected cells (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively). It has previously been reported that the MEF2 site in the myogenin promoter is required for stabilizing myogenin expression during muscle formation (22Edmondson D.G. Cheng T. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the contribution of MEF2 for transcriptional regulation of myogenin expression is physiologically important. We also observed that GST-131- or pcDNA-131-injected cells did not express myosin heavy chain in parallel with the GST- or pcDNA-injected cells, consistent with the morphological and immunological data showing an inhibition of expression of important structural and regulatory proteins for myotube formation in the GST-131- or pcDNA-131-injected cells (Figs. 3 and4, respectively). In a further attempt to assess the anti-myogenic effect of pcDNA-131 we utilized the well documented C3H10T1/2 myogenic conversion assay, in which one of the myogenic bHLH cDNAs is transfected into C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, which subsequently undergo myogenesis (18Lassar A.B.

Using this assay it has also been previously shown that co-transfection of MEF2A or MEF2C with MyoD results in a substantial potentiation in the number of myogenic colonies formed realative to MyoD alone. We therefore transfected MyoD into C3H10T1/2 along with MEF2A and also co-transfected pMT2–131 to test if it inhibited this potentiation. The results from these experiments are presented in Table I. These assays show: (a) that MEF2 by itself is not myogenic in CH310T1/2 co"

To elucidate some of the structural requirements and functional consequences of the association of Bcr-Abl with Hck, their interaction was investigated in transiently transfected COS7 cells.

Finally, experiments with a series of kinase negative Bcr-Abl mutants showed that Hck phosphorylated Bcr-Abl and induced the binding of Grb2 to Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl preferentially binds inactive forms of Hck by an Abl kinase-independent mechanism. This physical interaction stimulates the Hck tyrosine kinase, which may then phosphorylate the Grb2-binding site in Bcr-Abl. bcr-abl, the oncogene causing chronic myeloid leukemia, encodes a fusion protein with constitutively active tyrosine kinase and transforming capacity in hematopoietic cells.

However, the precise mechanisms of transformation by p210 bcr-abl are unknown, and some characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia, like induction of blast crisis after chronic phase or prolonged viability of chronic myeloid leukemia cells under serum starvation, are still unexplained. Some critical domains of Bcr-Abl that are necessary for transformation and induction of leukemia have been identified. The coiled-coil oligomerization domain, localized at the N terminus of Bcr-Abl, seems to induce tetramerization of Bcr-Abl, which is in turn necessary for the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase of Bcr-Abl, as well as for the complex formation with other Src homology (SH) 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; k.n., kinase negative; Ab, antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild type; IP, immunoprecipitation; DOTAP,N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate. 2-containing proteins (22Tauchi T.

Further important residues or domains within Bcr are the tyrosine at position 177, which is a binding site for the Ras adaptor protein Grb2 (24Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H.

Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), that binds SH2 domains by a phosphotyrosine-independent mechanism. The N-terminal portion of Abl mainly consists of molecular modules with homology to corresponding domains of the tyrosine kinase c-Src, therefore called SH domains 3 and 2 (27Ramakrishnan L. Rosenberg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 209-224PubMed Google Scholar). The putative function of these domains is to direct the subcellular localization of Bcr-Abl to compartments where it interacts with specific proteins via specific binding motifs (28Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The optimal binding motif for SH3 domains is polyproline (PXXP) (29Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), whereas SH2 domains predominantly bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in a specific amino acid context (30Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, the SH3 and SH2 domains of Bcr-Abl seem to regulate the tyrosine kinase activity as well as the transforming capacity of Abl proteins in vivo (26Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 31Mayer B. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

As in Src family kinases, a kinase domain (SH1 domain) is located next to the SH2 domain. The C-terminal part includes proline-rich motifs that are the molecular anchor for the adaptor protein CRKL (33Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C. J. Biol.

Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), a DNA-binding domain (36Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and an actin binding site allowing interaction with the cytoskeleton (37McWhriter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have recently described the activation and association of two members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, p53/56 lyn and p59 hck, with Bcr-Abl (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Src kinases are composed of a N-terminal unique domain, a PXXP-binding SH3 domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain, a tyrosine kinase domain, and a C-terminal tail, which is closely involved in negative regulation of the kinase activity (39Brown M. Cooper J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). One of the common features of Src family kinases seems to be their mechanism of autoregulation. Two cooperative mechanisms negatively regulate the activity of Src family kinases (40Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar): the interaction of the SH3 domain with a polyproline type II helix located between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain and an interaction of the tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal tail (Tyr501 in Hck) with the SH2 domain. On the contrary, phosphorylation of a conserved autophosphorylation site within the activation loop of the kinase domain (Tyr390 in Hck) positively regulates the kinase activity (41Cooper J. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated Src retains significant activity even if phosphorylated at the negative regulatory tyrosine in the C-terminal tail (42Boerner R. Kassel D. Barker S. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study presents experiments on structural and functional requirements for the interaction of Bcr-Abl with Src kinases. Using several mutants of Bcr-Abl and Hck we were able to demonstrate that the mechanism of interaction of Bcr-Abl with Src-Kinases is independent of Src and Abl kinase activity and is not mediated by any of the known Bcr-Abl-binding motifs. Moreover, the experiments showed that Tyr177 is phosphorylated by Hck, because coexpression of Hck induced the binding of Grb2 to k.n. Bcr-Abl; this effect was abrogated by a Y177F point mutation. Reagents for cell lysis were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (Deisenhofen, Germany). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with chemicals provided by Bio-Rad (München, Germany) with the exception of acrylamide/bisacrylamide, which was purchased from Boehringer Bioproducts (Ingelheim, Germany). The polyclonal antibodies (Abs) against Hck (N-30), Lyn (44Druker B.J. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bcr (N-20 and 7C6), Abl (K-12), and Grb2 (c-23) and the anti-phosphotyrosine Ab PY20 as well as the corresponding blocking petides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-Abl Ab Ab3 was purchased from Oncogene Sciences (Uniondale, NJ). For immunoblotting, all primary Abs were used at 1:1000 dilutions, with the exception of PY20 and anti-Abl Ab3, which were used in a 1:500 dilution. Secondary Abs were either purchased from Bio-Rad (coupled with alkaline phosphatase) or Amersham (coupled with horseradish peroxidase; ECL detection system) and used in dilutions from 1:2000 to 1:5000. The wild type cDNA clone of bcr-abl was provided by Dr. George Daley (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (43Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 247: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The point mutations Y177F, R1053L, and Y1294F were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Bio-Rad mutaphage kit. For the introduction of the Y177F mutation, a bcr-abl subfragment containing the bcr sequences up to the AccI restriction site was used. This fragment was subsequently recloned into full-length bcr-abl using StuI/NsiI digests. The R1053L and Y1294F mutations were introduced into a KpnI/EcoRI fragment. Thereafter, a KpnI/KpnI fragment from pUCbcr-abl (one KpnI site form pUC, the other at position 3082 in bcr-abl) containing bcr and the abl 5′ sequences up to the KpnI site was added to reconstitute full-length bcr-abl. All mutated fragments were completely sequenced to confirm the mutations and to exclude additional mutations. Double and triple mutants of these residues were accomplished by substitution of the DraIII/DraIII fragment of the R1053L mutant with a corresponding fragment containing the Y1294F mutation and/or by substitution of the HindIII/HindIII fragment (first HindIII site from pUC19 and second HindIII site at position 2609 in bcr-abl) of the R1053L and Y1294F single mutants and of the R1053L/Y1294F double mutant with a corresponding fragment containing the Y177F mutation. The A-/B-box deletion (ΔA-/B-box) was introduced by digesting a BsiEI/SacI subfragment of Bcr-Abl cloned into pUC19 with EcoNI and BglII. Following religation the fragment was sequenced to ensure that the reading frame had been saved. Finally, the mutation was repackaged into full-length bcr-abl using BsaAI/NheI digests. The double mutants bcr-abl k.n./Y177F and bcr-ablk.n./ΔA-/B-box were obtained using the same strategy as used for the generation of the Y177F/R1053L or Y177F/Y1294F double mutants. Deletion of amino acids 1–223 of bcr-abl was accomplished by PCR mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-ggcgaattcatgggggatgcatccaggcccccttac-3′ and 5′-ccggaattctcattttgaactctgcttaaatccagt-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pUC containing an EcoRI/HindIII fragment of wild type bcr-abl using EcoRI/NheI digests. This fragment was converted to full-length by ligating the deleted subfragment with a HindIII fragment containing the missing bcr and abl sequences. For deletion of the noncatalytical C-terminal portion of Bcr-Abl (amino acids 1426–2031), a similar strategy was used. The primer sequences were 5′-cacgccagtcaacagtctggag-3′ and 5′-gggcaggaattctcactgcagcaaggtactcacaga-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the KpnI/EcoRI sites of pUC19. This fragment was converted to full-length by ligation of the subfragment with a KpnI fragment containing the residual bcr-abl sequences. All PCR reactions were run with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Fragments were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced during the PCR reactions. All bcr-abl mutants were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) for expression in COS7 cells. The wild type (wt) cDNA clone of hck was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, Maryland). Tyr501 was mutated to phenylalanin by PCR modification using the following primers: 5′-gaatgtgaattcatggggtgcatgaagtccaag-3′ and 5′-tggatagaattctcazggctgctgttgaaactggctctc-3′. The resulting full-length hck fragment was subcloned into pUC19 and sequenced subsequently. The mutations K269R and Y390F were accomplished using a two-fragment PCR strategy; wt hck was cloned into a pUC vector that had been modified by deleting one PvuI site. The resulting vector, pUCΔNdeI/XbaI was used as a template for two PCR reactions producing PCR fragments overlapping at the remaining PvuI site within in the ampicillin resistance (AmpR) gene of pUC and meeting within the hck insert near the triplet to be mutated. Thus, the primers binding in hckallowed us to obtain PCR fragments that could be blunt end-ligated without introducing a deletion; one of these primers contained a mutagenic triplet. Finally, the PCR fragments were PvuI-digested and ligated. For mutation of Lys269 the following primers were used: 5′-gtggcagtgcggacgatgaagccaggg-3′ and 5′-cttggtgtgcttgttgtaggtggc-3′. Sequences for primers used for the mutation of Tyr390 were 5′-gacaacgagtttacggctcgggaaggg-3′ and 5′-gtcaatgacccgggccaggccaaagtc-3′. The sequences for the primers binding in pUC were 5′-ccagccagccggaagggccgagcg-3′ and 5′-ctcttactgtcatgccatccg-3′. All hck constructs as well as a wt lyn cDNA were cloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pApuro (vector and lyn cDNA provided by Dr. Seth Corey, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA). 32D, 32D k.n.bcr-abl (K1172R) and 32D wt bcr-abl (32Dp210) cells were obtained from Dr. Brian J. Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). 32D cells were transfected by electroporation as described (44Druker B.J. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 32D and 32D bcr-abl k.n. cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Boehringer Bioproducts, Ingelheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Boehringer Bioproducts) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium to provide murine interleukin-3. 32Dp210 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS7 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose. For transient transfection, cells of one confluent 175-cm2 flask were diluted 1:3 and replated into 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks. 18–24 h thereafter, cells grown to >95% confluency were transiently transfected by lipofection using DOTAP (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. Briefly, 50 μg of bcr-abl cDNA and/or 25 μg of hck cDNA were diluted to concentrations of 0.1 μg/μl and preincubated for 15 min with a 6-fold excess (in μg) of DOTAP. For transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics was used. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggersheim, Germany) and serum-deprived by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0 g/liter glucose and 0.5% fetal calf serum. Transfected cells were normally harvested 48 h after transfection by trypsinization. To protect cells from forming unresuspendible aggregates, 10 μg/ml aprotinin was added to the cells immediately after trypsinization. 32D cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Brij97 as described previously (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). For lysis, COS7 cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove remaining serum. Thereafter, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA as well as 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and in most cases 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. In general, pelleted cells from one 175-cm2 tissue culture flask (about 5 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer solution and incubated on ice for 25 min. Thereafter unsoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Afterward lysates were checked for protein concentrations using a Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 150 μl of COS7 cell lysate was diluted by the addition of 450 μl of incubation buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatase activity where desired. Lyn, Hck, and Bcr-Abl were precipitated by adding 5 μg of the appropriate Abs,i.e. anti-Lyn 44 for precipitation of Lyn, anti-Hck N-30 for precipitation of Hck, and either anti-Bcr 7C6 or anti-Abl K-12 for precipitation of Bcr-Abl. IP reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating plate. After 18 h of incubation, 125 μl of Sepharose A beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Freiburg, Germany) diluted 1:1 in IP buffer (0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) were added to each sample. Following an additional 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the precipitates were washed three times with IP buffer and subsequently boiled in 2× sample buffer before loading on SDS gels. Peptide blocking experiments were performed as described previously (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). For immune complex kinase assays of Src kinases precipitated from 32D cells, cell lysis, and the IP protocol were slightly modified; IP incubation periods were reduced to 3 h, and three times of washing with IP buffer were followed by washing the precipitates one time with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmMnCl2). Kinase reaction and analysis of autophosphorylation was performed as described (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed using standard methods. Proteins were either transfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) or nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). Immunoblots with PY20 were developed by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary Abs at a dilution of 1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin when polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed. For detection of phosphorylated proteins transferred to nitrocellulose or other membranes, secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Abs were used. The ECL detection system was used according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Dephosphorylation was achieved by omitting orthovanadate, a potent phosphatase inhibitor, from the lysis buffer, followed by preincubation of cleared lysate at 4 °C for 24 h prior to IP. We have recently described the association and activation of two kinases of the Src family, p53/56 lyn and p59 hck, with or by Bcr-Abl (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism and function of this interaction is unknown. This led us to investigate the structural and functional requirements for the complex formation of Bcr-Abl with Hck kinase, a Src family member preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. To establish an expression system that would allow the rapid screening of Bcr-Abl and Hck mutants, wt full-length cDNAs of bcr-abland hck were cloned into appropriate mammalian expression vectors (pcDNA3 or pApuro) and prepared for transient transfection into COS7 cells. cDNAs were introduced into these cells using lipofection (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig.1 A demonstrates that considerable amounts of Bcr-Abl (lane 2) and Hck (lane 3) were expressed 48 h post-transfection when compared with lysates from cells transfected with control vector (lane 1). Cotransfection of bcr-abl and hck cDNAs (lane 4) lead to expression of Bcr-Abl and Hck similar to that of single cDNA transfections. To demonstrate that the expressed kinases were active in vivo, the blot was stripped and reblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab, PY20. Fig. 1 Bshows that both kinases were highly (auto)phosphorylated and that expression of these kinases resulted in an increased overall phosphotyrosine content in cellular proteins. Because both kinases, Bcr-Abl and Hck (lanes 2 and 3), seemed maximally activated, no synergism was detectable by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting when Bcr-Abl and Hck were coexpressed. We then wished to demonstrate that Bcr-Abl and Src kinases were found in a complex in COS7 cells, similar to our previous findings in myeloid cells (38Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, lysates of transiently transfected COS7 cells coexpressing Bcr-Abl and Hck were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal anti-Abl Ab K-12. Subsequent immunoblotting with the anti-Hck Ab N-30 demonstrated that Hck (Fig.1 C, lane 1) formed a complex with Bcr-Abl. Coprecipitation was completely blocked by the addition of corresponding blocking peptide, indicating that the coprecipitation of Hck with Bcr-Abl was not caused by unspecific binding (lane 2). Similar results were obtained when Bcr-Abl was precipitated using the polyclonal anti-Bcr Ab 7C6 (not shown). Moreover, we could also coprecipitate Bcr-Abl in anti-Hck IPs (not shown). Finally, similar results were obtained in cotransfection and coprecipitation experiments with Lyn and Bcr-Abl in COS7 cells (not shown). Several domains have been described as functionally relevant protein interaction modules of Bcr-Abl (Fig. 2 A) (8Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 45Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem.

To investigate which of these regions were necessary for the interaction of Bcr-Abl with Src kinases, several mutations were introduced into bcr-abl cDNAs (Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, none of these mutations introduced into bcr-abl alone or in combination was able to disrupt or diminish the formation of Bcr-Abl-Hck complexes in COS7 cells (Fig.2 D). Fig. 2 B shows a typical example of such an experiment. The hck gene was cotransfected into COS7 cells either in combination with a control vector (lane 1) or with various single, double, or triple bcr-abl mutants containing amino acid substitutions recently shown to be critical for Ras activation by Bcr-Abl (8Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar): Tyr177, a binding site for the Grb2 adaptor protein; Arg1053, an amino acid embedded in the conserved FLVRESE motif of the Abl SH2 domain that is essential for SH2-directed binding to phosphorylated tyrosines; and Tyr1294, a major autophosphorylation site located in the Abl kinase domain. Lysates of transiently transfected cells were used for anti-Abl IPs. Subsequent immunoblot analysis demonstrated that considerable amounts of Hck were coprecipitated with wt Bcr-Abl (Fig.2 B, middle panel, lane 2). However, similar amounts of Hck were found in complexes with all single, double, and triple mutants (lanes 3–9). Similar results were obtained when Lyn was coexpressed with these mutants (not shown). Anti-Grb2 immunoblots showed that the association of Bcr-Abl with the Ras adaptor protein Grb2 was constantly disrupted by the Y177F mutation (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lanes 3,6, 7, and 9). Anti-Abl immunoblots demonstrated that equal amounts of Bcr-Abl were precipitated from Bcr-Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Finally, control blots of whole cell lysates showed that comparable amounts of Hck and Grb2 were expressed in the different cells used for the experiment (Fig. 2 C). Longer exposure of films during chemoluminiscence detection also revealed that small amounts of Hck could be coprecipitated with endogenous c-Abl (fa"

Two complementary DNAs (GluClα and GluClβ) encoding chloride channels that are gated by avermectin and glutamate, respectively, were isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans. To study the role of these subunits in conferring avermectin sensitivity we isolated a mutant C. elegansstrain with a Tc1 transposable element insertion that functionally inactivated the GluClα gene (GluClα::Tc1). GluClα::Tc1 animals exhibit a normal phenotype including typical avermectin sensitivity. Xenopus oocytes expressing GluClα::Tc1 strain mRNA elicited reduced amplitude avermectin and glutamate-dependent chloride currents. Avermectin binding assays in GluClα::Tc1 strain membranes showed the presence of high affinity binding sites, with a reduced B max. These experiments suggest that GluClα is a target for avermectin and that additional glutamate-gated and avermectin-sensitive chloride channel subunits exist in C. elegans. We isolated a cDNA (GluClα2) encoding a chloride channel that shares 75% amino acid identity with GluClα. This subunit forms homomeric channels that are gated irreversibly by avermectin and reversibly by glutamate. GluClα2 coassembles with GluClβ to form heteromeric channels that are gated by both ligands. The presence of subunits related to GluClα may explain the low level and rarity of target site involvement in resistance to the avermectin class of compounds.

The presence of subunits related to GluClα may explain the low level and rarity of target site involvement in resistance to the avermectin class of compounds. Extensive use of parasiticides and pesticides has resulted in the emergence of resistant strains of target organisms. Characterization of the molecular targets of such compounds would help elucidate their mode of action and mechanisms of resistance. Avermectins are a class of macrocyclic lactones with insecticidal and nematocidal activity. Abamectin (avermectin B1) is a miticide and insecticide used in crop protection. Ivermectin (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1) is an anthelmintic used to treat Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) infections in dogs and onchocerciasis (river blindness) in humans (1Campbell W.C. Ivermectin and Abamectin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Avermectins have been shown to increase chloride permeability in insect and crustacean muscles (2Cull-Candy S.G. J.

Using Xenopus oocytes as an expression system, two functional cDNAs (GluClα and GluClβ) encoding C. elegans glutamate-gated and avermectin-sensitive chloride channel subunits were isolated (16Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The individual subunits expressed functional homomeric channels that were selectively responsive to ivermectin or glutamate, respectively. Coexpression of GluClα and β lead to formation of heteromeric channels that exhibited the rapidly activating reversible glutamate- and irreversible ivermectin-sensitive currents found in C. elegans mRNA injected oocytes (15Arena J.P. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 35-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,16Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that GluClα and GluClβ represent an evolutionarily distinct class of ligand-gated ion channels that may be orthologous to the vertebrate glycine receptors (17Vassilatis D.K. Elliston K.O. Paress P.I. Hamelin M. Arena J.P. Schaeffer J.M. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cully D.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Extensive use of avermectins has led to the appearance of resistance to this class of compounds. Low level (3–10-fold) ivermectin resistance has only been detected in parasitic nematodes of goats and sheep. In most cases multiple resistance to other groups of drugs is involved (18Shoop W.L. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that either ivermectin acts on multiple targets or that the target site is involved in essential processes. The extensive genetic characterization of C. elegans makes it a useful system to study the function of GluCl channels in vivo and the mechanisms of resistance to ivermectin. In an attempt to understand the role of GluCl channels in conferring avermectin sensitivity and their physiological function, we determined the chromosomal localization of the GluClα and GluClβ genes and searched for known mutations mapping to these loci. However, mutations attributed specifically to these genes could not be identified. We then identified a C. elegans strain with a Tc1 transposable element insertion in the GluClα gene. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of this mutant strain and the isolation of a novel subunit (GluClα2) with properties similar to GluClα. Grids with ordered YAC clones were hybridized with32P-labeled probes using the Random Priming Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Cosmid clones spanning the regions of the hybridizing YAC clones were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Coulson (Medical Research Council, Cambridge). Cosmid clone DNA isolation was performed by alkaline lysis using Wizard Mini- and Maxiprep kits (Promega). Hybridizations were done at 42 °C in 50% formamide overnight, and washed at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Pools of DNA lysates corresponding to a mutant bank of frozen C. elegans strains with random Tc1 transposable element insertions were screened by PCR (19Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Van Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7432-7435Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Specific primers for the GluClα gene included the nested primers DKV1.3 (5′-TAATGGAGGACCAGTTGTGG-3′) and DKV1.4 (5′-GTGATTCTCACTGTTGGAC-3′) and for Tc1 RI (5′-GCTGATCGACTCGATGCCACGTCG-3′) and RII (5′-GATTTTGTGAACACTGTGGTGAAG-3′) (Fig. 2). Three orthogonal matrices of 10 96-tube trays were screened with each set of the GluClα-specific nested primer pair one-dimension at a time in quadruplicate. A single lysate corresponding to a particular frozen stock in the mutant library was identified. This stock was thawed and a single animal with a Tc1 insertion in the GluClα gene was identified by single worm PCR (19Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Van Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7432-7435Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A homozygote strain for the GluClα::Tc1 insertion was identified in the progeny of the original animal by Southern analysis. The GluClα::Tc1 strain was backcrossed five times to remove the mutator locus and other possible Tc1 insertions. Some of the strains used were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. GluClα::Tc1 hermaphrodites were backcrossed to dpy-5/+ males. dpy-5 balances the mut-2 locus. Homozygous Dpy F2 progeny that no longer carry the mut-2 locus were identified. These animals were used for further backcrosses to unc-76/+ males. The use of the unc-76 marker helped to balance the GluClα::Tc1 insertion. The presence of the GluClα::Tc1 mutation after each backcross was verified by Southern analysis and nested PCR reactions. The exact location of the Tc1 insertion was identified by nested PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the GluClα::Tc1 strain using the DKV1–3, DKV1–4, and RI and RII primers, and subcloning into the TA cloning vector (Promega). The sequence of the insertion point was determined using the dideoxy termination method (Amersham). C. elegans strains N2 and GluClα::Tc1 maintained on seeded agar Petri dishes were used to start 1-liter liquid cultures in S Basal media (20Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Methods: Bulk Growth on Bacteria. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 602-603Google Scholar). The resuspended bacterial pellet of a 1-liter overnight culture of Escherichia coli (OP50) in LB was added to the S Basal and the cultures were shaken overnight at ambient temperature. The bacteria were replenished 24 h later and the incubation continued overnight. The worms were isolated by flotation on 35% sucrose as described and stored at −80 °C (20Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Methods: Bulk Growth on Bacteria. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 602-603Google Scholar). DNA and RNA were isolated following the Trireagent protocol (21Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated by two rounds of purification on oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (5′-3′). The mRNA was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in RNase-free water, and stored at −80 °C. Restriction endonuclease-digested C. elegans genomic DNA was fractionated on agarose gels. The genomic fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes prepared using the Random Priming Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). High stringency hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide. Filters were washed to 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C prior to exposure to Kodak x-ray film. Northern analysis of C. elegans mRNA was performed according to the procedure of Boedtker (22Boedtker H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 240: 448-453Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Low stringency Northern hybridizations with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled ANTI 1.1 oligonucleotide were performed at 35 °C in 6 × NET (1 × NET: 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 2% dextran sulfate, 0.02% sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS) with tRNA (40 μg/ml; Sigma) added as carrier. The filters were washed at 50 °C in 6 × SSC, 0.5% Triton X-100 with several buffer changes and exposed at −80 °C on Kodak x-ray film. Several washes at higher stringencies (up to 62 °C) were performed to improve signal to noise ratios. 10 μg of either wild type or GluClα::Tc1 mRNA was mixed with 200 ng of an antisense oligonucleotide (ANTI 1.1 5′-CCAGGTAGCCATTGCCGAAGC-3′) to GluClα in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega) (22.5 μl total volume). The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 15 min and then at ambient temperature for 30 min. After the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol (3 μl) and RNase H (4 μl, Promega 4.0 units/μl) the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were ethanol precipitated with the addition of NH4OAc (3 μl) and ethanol (81 μl). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using 200 ng of C. elegansmRNA. cDNA was synthesized with random primers using the reagents of the Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR reactions were performed using the Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) adding 20 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and the following primers: (base 565 of the GluClα cDNA) 5′-GAATACACAATGATGGTACAG-3′ and (base 680 of the GluClα cDNA) 5′-TGCAAGATCAATGGAACACTG-3′. PCR conditions were 95 °C 1 min, 55 °C 2 min, 72 °C 3 min for 35 cycles. The reactions were phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 2 μl of H2O, mixed with stop solution of the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), heated at 65 °C for 4 min, and electrophoresed in a 7% sequencing gel. The gel was fixed in 5% methanol, 5% acetic acid for 15 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using 200 ng of C. elegansmRNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized with random or oligo(dT) primers using the reagents of the Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR reactions were performed using the Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the following primers: 5′-TTCAAACGTCATTTCATCCAATG-3′ and 5′-TCTCCATTGAGGGCACCGGTATG-3′. PCR conditions were 95 °C 1 min, 62 °C 2 min, 72 °C 3 min for 45 cycles. The GluClα2 cDNA PCR product was subcloned to the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Subsequently, the SacII/PstI fragment containing the GluClα2 cDNA was transferred to Bluescript SK vector. A poly(A) tail was added by annealing and ligation of two oligonucleotides containing 25 As to the NotI/PstI sites. Xenopus oocytes from the same donor were used in every set of experiments. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 μg/μl) or cRNA and voltage-clamped at −80 mV at room temperature using a standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described (13Arena J.P. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Cully D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with mRNA were analyzed 2 days after injection while those injected with cRNA 2–4 days after injection. The water-soluble avermectin derivative, IVMPO4, was used for these studies. GluClα2 cRNA was synthesized using the T3 promoter of the Bluescript vector as described (16Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The reported current amplitudes are average responses of at least four oocytes. All data in text are mean ± S.E. Four different membrane preparations of wild-type and GluClα::Tc1 animals were tested for [3H]IVM binding as described (23Rohrer S.P. Meinke P.T. Hayes E.C. Mrozik H. Schaeffer J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4168-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Wild-type and GluClα::Tc1 animals were grown in liquid media, membranes were prepared and binding assays were done in parallel for each set (20Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Methods: Bulk Growth on Bacteria. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 602-603Google Scholar). Motility assays in solution and plates as well as egg laying assays were done as described (9Schaeffer J.M. Haines H.W. Biochem. Pharm. 1989; 38: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Broeks A. Jannsen H.W.R.M. Calafat J. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Approximately 50–100 animals of mixed developmental stages or single L4 hermaphrodites were used for each ivermectin concentration (0.1–500 nm). The GluClα and GluClβ genes were assigned to yeast artificial chromosome clones and corresponding cosmids (Fig.1). The GluClα gene was found to be within cosmid clone C25D4 of contig 313 on chromosome V, while the GluClβ gene was present within cosmid clone C04E4 of contig 465 on chromosome I. These data indicate that the GluClα gene is located between unc-76 and dpy-21 while the GluClβ gene is distal to unc-63 and next to unc-38. The unc-38 mutation has been assigned to cosmid clone ZZ#11 that overlaps with cosmid C04E4. The nucleotide sequence of unc-38 shows it to be related to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and therefore does not represent a mutation in the GluClβ gene (25Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Barnes T.M. Tornoe C. Matsuda K. Ahnn J. Fire A. Sulston J.E. Barnard E.A. Sattelle D.B. Lewis J.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5843-5857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No other mutations have been assigned to the cosmids containing the GluClα and GluClβ genes. To study the functional role of the GluCl channels in C. elegans we sought to develop null mutants in the GluClα and GluClβ genes using transposon insertional mutagenesis (19Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Van Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7432-7435Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The C. elegansstrain, MT3126, which shows a high frequency of Tc1 transposable element insertions, was used to screen for mutations in the GluClα and GluClβ genes. Tc1 insertions in the GluClα gene (strain NL704, allele pk54::Tc1) and GluClβ gene (strain NL705, allele pk55::Tc1) were identified by screening a frozen transposon mutant bank arranged in an orthogonal matrix (19Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Van Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7432-7435Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A Tc1 insertion in the GluClβ gene that was identified did not result in a null mutation (data not shown). Our subsequent attempts to obtain a null mutant in the GluClβ gene by searching for a Tc1 excision/deletion event by PCR were unsuccessful (data not shown). A GluClα gene Tc1 insertion event identified did result in gene inactivation. A homozygous GluClα::Tc1 strain with a Tc1 insertion in the GluClα gene was isolated and the majority of the irrelevant Tc1 insertions were eliminated by backcrosses. Sequencing of the Tc1 insertion region of the GluClα::Tc1 gene revealed that the Tc1 insertion (amino acid 255, Figs.2 and 7) disrupted the putative extracellular N-terminal domain of the GluClα protein. The Tc1 insertion interrupts a highly conserved, length invariant disulfide loop that is found in all ligand-gated anion channels (Fig. 2). Thus, it is unlikely that the GluClα::Tc1 gene encodes a functional channel subunit. To confirm that the Tc1 insertion resulted in a mutated GluClα gene we compared the GluClα gene products of wild-type N2 and GluClα::Tc1 animals (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, respectively) by Northern blot analysis. A GluClα cDNA probe detected 1.6- and 2.3-kilobase (kb) transcripts in the N2 lane and 0.8-, 1.6-, 2.3-, and 3.2-kb transcripts in the GluClα::Tc1 lane (Fig. 3). The 0.8-kb mRNA that is specific for GluClα::Tc1 hybridized to a probe corresponding to the region 5′ of the Tc1 insertion site but not to a probe derived from the region 3′ of the Tc1 insertion (data not shown). These results indicate that the 0.8-kb mRNA (denoted with an asterisk in Fig. 3) is an N-terminal truncated transcript of the GluClα gene. The 1.6- and 2.3-kb mRNAs that appear in the wild-type lane were reduced in intensity in the GluClα::Tc1 lane by 15–20 fold, as determined by PhosphorImager intensity quantitation. Expression of GluClβ mRNA in the GluClα::Tc1 strain was unaffected, showing that disruption of the GluClα gene does not affect GluClβ transcription levels (data not shown). The GluClα::Tc1 strain is homozygous for the Tc1 insertion and appears genetically stable. However, low frequency somatic excision of Tc1 transposable elements has been reported by several laboratories (26Emmons S.W. Yesner L. Cell. 1984; 36: 599-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Plasterk R.H.A. Groenen J.T.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the faint transcripts at 1.6- and 2.3-kb that appear in the GluClα::Tc1 strain are the result of somatic excision of Tc1. This was confirmed by analysis of the Tc1 integration/excision site by reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR amplification of the resultant cDNA. Reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions of GluClα::Tc1 strain mRNA with primers flanking the integration site revealed multiple reverse transcriptase-dependent bands that were not present in the N2 mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (data not shown). These bands were up to 50 nt larger or up to 20 nt smaller than the wild-type GluClα PCR-derived control fragment. Bands corresponding to the wild-type GluClα PCR-derived control fragment were not detected in the GluClα::Tc1 strain mRNA. These results indicate that the 1.6- and 2.3-kb GluClα transcripts arise from imperfect somatic Tc1 excision and are mutated at the site of excision. Due to small deletions or amino acid additions at this highly conserved region the majority of these (near) full-length GluClα mRNAs are likely to be defective (28Vanderberg R.J. Ranjendra S. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 198-203PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that a small percentage of these transcripts is functional. In summary, as a result of the Tc1 insertion a truncated GluClα mRNA encoding a nonfunctional protein is generated. A low level of near full-length GluClα mRNA may result in some somatic cells by Tc1 excision that could restore the reading frame in one-third of these rare mRNAs. We therefore conclude that the GluClα gene is functionally inactivated in most cells of the GluClα::Tc1 animals and the amount of functional GluClα mRNA in the GluClα::Tc1 strain is reduced at least 45–60-fold. The GluClα::Tc1 strain was inspected for phenotypic abnormalities and found to lack any visible defects. Since the GluClα channel is thought to be a target of avermectin, we tested the GluClα::Tc1 strain for sensitivity to avermectin and found it to be equal to the wild-type strain. Ivermectin sensitivity was tested in motility assays in liquid (9Schaeffer J.M. Haines H.W. Biochem. Pharm. 1989; 38: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) plates and egg laying (24Broeks A. Jannsen H.W.R.M. Calafat J. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) assays (data not shown). This result may indicate that C. elegans expresses additional ivermectin-sensitive GluCl channel(s) that can functionally compensate for the elimination of GluClα. Wild-type and GluClα::Tc1 animals were tested for the presence of ivermectin-sensitive GluCl channels by mRNA expression in Xenopus oocytes. The average response to 1 mm glutamate was 266 ± 20 nA for oocytes injected with wild-type mRNA and 84 ± 7 nA for those injected with GluClα::Tc1 strain RNA; the average IVMPO4response was 218 ± 16 and 75 ± 8 nA, respectively (Fig.4). Perfusion of Xenopusoocytes with 100 μm picrotoxin (PTX), can distinguish between glutamate elicited currents from homomeric GluClβ (PTX sensitive) and heteromeric GluClα and β (PTX insensitive) GluCl channels (13Arena J.P. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Cully D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Etter, personal communication. The glutamate responses in oocytes injected with either wild-type or GluClα::Tc1 mRNA were insensitive to 100 μm PTX, indicating that the expressed channels were heteromeric (data not shown). These data indicate an approximately 3-fold difference in amplitude of the glutamate and IVMPO4responses between GluClα::Tc1 and wild-type samples. To exclude that this difference results from an overall decreased ability of the GluClα::Tc1-injected RNAs to be expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we measured the induced amplitude of the endogenous calcium-activated chloride channel currents in the same oocytes. 3J. P. Arena, unpublished data. The amplitude of this current was comparable for oocytes injected with either wild-type or GluClα::Tc1 strain mRNA (812.5 ± 77 and 886 ± 83 nA, respectively; control oocytes showed responses of 250 ± 35 nA). If the glutamate and IVMPO4 responses of oocytes injected with wild-type mRNA were dependent on the contribution of GluClα mRNA alone, an approximately 45–60-fold reduction in the current amplitudes would have been expected in oocytes injected with GluClα::Tc1 strain RNA. In reconstitution experiments, synthetic GluClα and GluClβ cRNAs were expressed in a 1:50 (α:β) ratio, which resulted in a 97% decrease in IVMPO4 and glutamate responses as compared with a 1:1 (α:β) ratio (data not shown). The channels formed in these experiments were insensitive to 100 μm PTX, indicating that the expressed channels were heteromeric. Expression of GluClα::Tc1 mRNA results only in a 3-fold reduction in its response to IVMPO4 and glutamate. Since the reduction in the current amplitudes of oocytes injected with GluClα::Tc1 strain RNA is only 3-fold, these experiments predict the presence of additional GluClα-like subunit(s) in C. elegans. Specific elimination of GluClα transcripts by RNase H digestion was employed to confirm that other C. elegansgenes exist that can encode avermectin-sensitive GluCl channels. mRNA from wild-type and GluClα::Tc1 animals were hybridized with an antisense oligonucleotide (ANTI 1.1) to the GluClα coding sequence, spanning the translation initiation site, and then treated with RNase H. Specific digestion of the DNA-RNA hybrid of the GluClα mRNA was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig.5 A) (29Vassilatis D.K. Despommier D.D. Misek D.E. Polvere R.I. Gold A.M. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18459-18465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled ANTI 1.1 oligonucleotide detected intact GluClα transcripts only in the untreated samples (lane N2, band labeled with arrow in Fig.5 A). RNase H treatment, as expected, eliminated the hybridization to ANTI 1.1 oligonucleotide. The cross-hybridizing bands detected with this probe are unaffected and are of identical size in the RNase H-treated and untreated samples, indicating specific elimination of the GluClα transcripts. The RNase H-treated GluClα mRNA in the wild-type and the GluClα::Tc1 strain were reduced in size by 60 nt as determined by hybridization of the same membrane with a GluClα cDNA probe (Fig. 5 B). The remainder of the RNase H-treated RNA samples were expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 5 C). The oocytes expressing either wild-type or GluClα::Tc1 strain mRNA treated with RNase H responded to both glutamate (1 mm) and IVMPO4 (1 μm): 18 ± 3 nA glutamate, 24 ± 4 nA IVMPO4; 14 ± 4 nA glutamate, 21 ± 4 nA IVMPO4, respectively. The channels formed were insensitive to 100 μm PTX, indicating that they were heteromeric. The magnitude of the currents to IVMPO4 and glutamate were reduced by about 3-fold when compared with the expression of untreated GluClα::Tc1 mRNA, as were the responses of the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− channels indicating a nonspecific effect. These experiments indicate that additional chloride channel subunit genes with properties similar to GluClα are expressed in C. elegans. Membrane preparations of wild-type and GluClα::Tc1 strain animals were tested for [H3]ivermectin binding (30Cully D.F. Paress P.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 326-332PubMed Google Scholar). The B max of the wild-type membranes was 0.55 ± 0.09 pmol/mg of protein (n = 4) while for the GluClα::Tc1 membranes this level dropped ∼40% to 0.32 ± 0.02 pmol/mg of protein (n = 4) (Fig.6). These data indicate that high affinity ivermectin-binding sites exist in C. elegansmembranes in the absence of functional GluClα gene expression. Scatchard plot analysis of the wild-type membrane binding indicated a K d of 0.111 ± 0.019 nm, while for the GluClα::Tc1 membrane binding of 0.153 ± 0.018 nm (Fig. 6). The indications for the presence of additional GluClα-like channels in C. elegans prompted us to"
https://openalex.org/W2084149072,"The synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells. It has been shown to play an important role in the release mechanism of neurotransmitters and peptide hormones, including insulin. Thus, when insulin-secreting cells are permeabilized and treated with botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E), SNAP-25 is hydrolyzed, and insulin secretion is inhibited. Recently SNAP-23, a more generally expressed isoform of SNAP-25, has been described. The functional role of SNAP-23 has not been investigated to date. It is now shown that SNAP-23 is resistant to cleavage by BoNT/E. It was therefore possible to test whether transfection of HIT (transformed pancreatic B-) cells with SNAP-23 reconstitutes insulin release from BoNT/E treated cells, in which SNAP-25 is inactivated by the toxin. The results show that SNAP-23 is able to replace SNAP-25 when it is overexpressed. While these results demonstrate that SNAP-23 is a functional homologue of SNAP-25, able to function in regulated exocytosis, they indicate that SNAP-23 may be inefficient in this process. This suggests that both isoforms may have their own specific binding partners and discrete, albeit mechanistically similar, functional roles within the cell.

The above mentioned SNARE proteins involved in the final step of the regulated secretory pathway in neurons and endocrine cells are not or only weakly expressed in other cell types, but some ubiquitously expressed isoforms of the neuronal counterparts have been identified in non-neuronal cells.

Together with VAMP-1 or -2, it binds strongly to the cytosolic protein SNAP (22Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, in analogy to SNAP-25, binding to syntaxin 4 was inhibited by Munc-18 (25Araki S.

The functional role of SNAP-23 in vivo, however, remains to be elucidated. Here we show that SNAP-23 can replace SNAP-25 in the process of insulin secretion when it is overexpressed. The cDNA coding for SNAP-25a (26Bark I.C. Wilson M.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. M. C. Wilson (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California). The cDNAs for SNAP-23 (22Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol.

BoNT/E light chain was prepared as a recombinant protein. 2T. Binz, T. Hayashi, S. Yamasaki, and H. Niemann, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant streptolysin-O (with Cys530 mutated to Ala) fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein was used for cell permeabilization and is referred to below as SLO (27Weller U.

The monoclonal anti-SNAP-25 antibody was purchased from Sternberger Monoclonals Incorporated, Baltimore, MD, and the polyclonal antibody against actin is a generous gift from Dr. Gabbiani, Geneva, Switzerland. The polyclonal antibody against SNAP-23 was produced against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 12 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of SNAP-23 (28Wong P.P. Daneman N. Volchuk A. Lassam N. Wilson M.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription/translation of SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 in pcDNA3 was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (NEN DuPont, Regensdorf, Switzerland, catalogue number NEG-072) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). One μl of the in vitro translated protein was incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of low Ca2+ glutamate buffer (128 mm K+-glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 10.2 mm EGTA, pH 7; corresponding to 0.1 μm free Ca2+) with BoNT/E at a final concentration of 50 nm for various time periods at 37 °C. Samples were then boiled in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. HIT-T15 cells (29Santerre R.F. Cook R.A. Crisel R.M.D. Shar J.D. Schmidt R.J. Williams D.C. Wilson C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For transient transfections, HIT cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well. After 2 days in culture, cells were co-transfected using the lipopolyamine Transfectam (Promega) with 2.5 μg of the vector encoding human proinsulin and 2.5 μg of empty vector or vector containing cDNAs for either SNAP-23 or SNAP-25. When transfected cells were to be sorted, co-transfection was performed using 2.5 μg of vector containing cDNA for CD4 and 2.5 μg of vector with SNAP-23 cDNA. Two days after co-transfection of CD4 and SNAP-23 cells were trypsinized. The cell suspension (2 × 107 cells in 18 ml of complete medium) was incubated with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody coupled to magnetic beads (1.3 × 107 beads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Transfected cells were then separated from untransfected cells using a magnetic tube holder. Positive cells attached to the magnetic beads were washed twice with medium and plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well into 96-well plates coated with bovine corneal endothelial cell matrix (Novamed Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel). Culture was continued for 1 day before cells were used for a secretion assay and finally lysed in SDS-sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. For immunofluorescence, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips. One day after sorting, cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in acetone for 30 s at room temperature, and blocked for 15 min in DPBS, 5% bovine serum albumin before incubation with the polyclonal antibody against SNAP-23 (diluted 1:200) for 1 h in DPBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed twice in DPBS, incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1:80, Sigma), washed, and then visualized with an Axiophot fluorescence microscope. HIT cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer buffer lacking Ca2+ (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 0.4 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and then permeabilized with 9 μg/ml SLO for 7 min at 37 °C in low Ca2+ glutamate buffer. Permeabilized cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 30 nm BoNT/E in low Ca2+ glutamate buffer for 8 min at 37 °C. Buffer was then replaced with either low Ca2+ glutamate buffer or high Ca2+ glutamate buffer (128 mmK+-glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 7 mmMgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mmNa2ATP, 9.8 mm CaCl2, 10.2 mm EGTA, pH 7; corresponding to 10 μm free Ca2+) for a secretion period of 7 min at 37 °C. Secretion from unsorted transfected cells was estimated by measuring the amount of human C-peptide released into the medium using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Dako, Cambridge, UK). This ELISA does not cross-react with the endogenous hamster C-peptide of the HIT cells. Secretion of CD4-positive sorted cells was measured by radioimmunoassay using human insulin standard (which dilutes in a linear fashion versus the endogenous hamster insulin secreted by HIT cells) and anti-insulin serum from Novo-Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark (31Herbert V. Lau K.S. Gottlieb C.W. Bleicher S.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1965; 25: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli et al. (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed as described (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 5% dry milk before incubation with the first antibody in TBS, 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20 overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was then visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody combined with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection procedure from Amersham International (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). It has been shown that SNAP-23 is resistant to cleavage by BoNT/A (34Chen F. Foran P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Melling J. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5719-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but so far it is not known whether SNAP-23 is also resistant to cleavage by BoNT/E. SNAP-25 is hydrolyzed by BoNT/E between the residues Arg180-Ile181 (13Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These two residues are conserved in SNAP-23, but the adjacent residues are different (22Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, the SNARE motifs (36Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Poulain B. Deloye F. Lozzi L. Shone C.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which have been shown to be essential for binding of all botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins to their respective substrates, are not completely conserved in SNAP-23. We therefore examined whether SNAP-23 can be hydrolyzed by BoNT/E. SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and then incubated for 1 h with recombinant BoNT/E light chain at a final concentration of 50 nm. As shown in Fig. 1, SNAP-23 is not hydrolyzed under these conditions, whereas SNAP-25 is completely cleaved. Even after an incubation period of up to 24 h (the longest incubation time tested), SNAP-23 was still intact (not shown). By contrast, SNAP-25 was already completely hydrolyzed after 15 min (the shortest incubation time tested; data not shown). When insulin-secreting HIT cells were permeabilized with SLO and treated with BoNT/E, SNAP-25 was hydrolyzed, and Ca2+-induced insulin release was inhibited (Figs.2 and 4, and Ref. 1Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As SNAP-23 was not hydrolyzed by BoNT/E in vitro, we could directly test whether SNAP-23 can functionally replace SNAP-25 in the process of insulin release. HIT cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs for SNAP-23 or SNAP-25 and human proinsulin. This co-transfection approach has been established by Lang et al.(37Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and allows evaluation of insulin release only from the subpopulation of transfected cells without separating transfected from non-transfected cells. It is based on the specificity of an antibody which recognizes specifically human C-peptide (a byproduct of proinsulin conversion) and not C-peptide from the endogenous hamster proinsulin of the HIT cells. SNAP-23 or mock transfected cells (control) were permeabilized with SLO and treated with BoNT/E before insulin release was induced by raising the free Ca2+ concentration from 0.1 μm (basal) to 10 μm(stimulated). When control cells were treated with BoNT/E, Ca2+-induced insulin release was inhibited by about 50%. Insulin release was almost completely restored, however, when cells were transfected with SNAP-23 but not when they were transfected with SNAP-25 (Fig. 2).Figure 4Overexpression of SNAP-23 does not prevent cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/E. Sorted HIT cells (lanes 1–3) overexpressing SNAP-23 (as shown in Fig. 3 D) and untransfected cells (lanes 4–6) were permeabilized and treated with toxin as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Cells were then lysed in SDS-sample buffer, and total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (1 well of a 96-well plate was loaded/lane).Lanes 1 and 4, basal release condition;lanes 2 and 5, Ca2+-stimulated condition; lanes 3 and 6, Ca2+-stimulated condition after BoNT/E treatment. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 (upper panel), the monoclonal antibody against SNAP-25 (middle panel), or an antibody against actin (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While our data show that overexpressed SNAP-23 reconstitutes insulin secretion in BoNT/E-treated HIT cells, they raise the question as to whether insulin release is restored because SNAP-23 replaces SNAP-25 or because the presence of SNAP-23 competitively inhibits cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/E. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed co-transfection experiments with CD4 and SNAP-23, which allowed us to sort transfected from untransfected cells using an anti-CD4 antibody coupled to magnetic beads. As shown in Fig.3, this approach yields a population of cells of which about 80% are strongly positive for SNAP-23 by immunofluorescence. Note, however, that the level of expression of SNAP-23 is very heterogeneous. Such positive sorted cells were permeabilized with SLO, treated with BoNT/E, and incubated in a high Ca2+-containing buffer to induce insulin release. Under these conditions, approximately 65% of the secretory response (cells without toxin) was reconstituted by overexpression of SNAP-23 in the transfected cells (not shown). The less efficient reconstitution in this series of experiments compared with that seen from the cells co-transfected with SNAP-23 and human insulin (Fig. 2) is taken to reflect the different experimental approaches. Thus, the population of sorted CD4-positive cells, although greatly enriched in SNAP-23-positive cells compared with the unsorted population, was still contaminated with some cells not expressing SNAP-23. Furthermore, reconstitution may not be as efficient in those cells expressing only low levels of SNAP-23. By contrast, when measuring human C-peptide secretion from cells co-transfected with SNAP-23 and human insulin, it is expected that cells with high levels of SNAP-23 expression will also express high levels of human insulin and will, as such, dominate in this assay. After the secretion period, cells were lysed in SDS-sample buffer for gel electrophoresis. Total cellular proteins were Western blotted using a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-23 (Fig.4, upper panel), a monoclonal antibody against SNAP-25 (Fig. 4, middle panel) or a polyclonal antibody against actin (Fig. 4, lower panel). Note that HIT cells express SNAP-23 endogenously (Fig. 4, upper panel, lanes 4–6) although this could not be detected by immunofluorescence, and SNAP-23-transfected HIT cells strongly overexpress the protein (Fig. 4, upper panel, lanes 1–3). In agreement with the in vitro results, SNAP-25 was hydrolyzed by BoNT/E, whereas SNAP-23 was resistant. Most significantly, the presence of large amounts of SNAP-23 did not influence the cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/E. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SNAP-23 is resistant to cleavage by BoNT/E in vivo as well as in vitroand that, when overexpressed, it can substitute for SNAP-25 in the process of insulin secretion in BoNT/E treated HIT cells. SNAP-23 is expressed predominantly in non-neuronal, non-endocrine cells (28Wong P.P. Daneman N. Volchuk A. Lassam N. Wilson M.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Some of these cell types do possess a regulated transport pathway, with one example being those which incorporate the Glut4 glucose transporter into the plasma membrane in response to insulin (38Cheatham B. Volchuk A. Kahn C.R. Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Klip A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15169-15173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others, like fibroblasts, do not appear to have a conventional regulated exocytotic pathway but do display Ca2+-regulated fusion events (40Coorssen J.R. Schmitt H. Almers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3787-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 41Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Two questions arise from this. First, what is the true physiological role of SNAP-23? The close similarity between SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 suggests that it may also be involved in the fusion mechanism of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane. Second, how different is a regulated exocytotic event in neuronal/endocrine cells versus non-neuronal cells? Here we show that SNAP-23 can replace SNAP-25 in the process of insulin release. These results strengthen the hypothesis that SNAP-23 in non-neuronal cells may also be involved in exocytosis. They also provide further evidence that the mechanism of regulated exocytosis in neuronal and non-neuronal cells is similar. In the present study, we have obtained direct evidence that SNAP-23 can function in regulated exocytosis. This was made possible following the observation that SNAP-23, in contrast to SNAP-25, is not hydrolyzed by BoNT/E. This allows one to study the impact of overexpression of SNAP-23 on insulin release from cells in which SNAP-25 has been inactivated by BoNT/E. It was important for such a study to demonstrate in parallel that overexpression of SNAP-23 did not abolish toxin cleavage of SNAP-25. It follows that SNAP-23 reconstitution is not due to competitive inhibition of toxin cleavage of SNAP-25 but, rather, to the ability of SNAP-23 to replace the toxin-inactivated endogenous SNAP-25. SNAP-23 was strongly overexpressed in the transfected cells in which regulated secretion was reconstituted. In a separate series of experiments, it was observed that with lower levels of SNAP-23 expression (albeit still elevated relative to the endogenous level) reconstitution was less efficient (data not shown). This observation could be explained by the fact that SNAP-25 can still be engaged in a complex with syntaxin and VAMP even after cleavage by BoNT/E (42Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It could therefore compete with exogenous SNAP-23 for binding to the other SNAREs. Alternatively, our results may indicate that SNAP-23, while being able to replace SNAP-25 in the process of regulated hormone secretion, is probably less effective in this process. Each isoform may thus have its own specific (SNARE) binding partners and a discrete, albeit mechanistically similar, functional role within the cell. To ensure a high degree of specificity, with segregation of pathways in the face of similar molecular mechanisms, it is to be expected that the affinity of SNAP-23 for the natural binding partners of SNAP-25 (and presumably the contrary as well) would be low. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release by BoNT/E has been generally accepted to be due to cleavage of SNAP-25. An important role has therefore been attributed to SNAP-25 in the process of regulated exocytosis. To date, however, no direct proof had been obtained to ensure that SNAP-25 is the only target of BoNT/E important in regulated exocytosis. As a metallo-endoprotease, BoNT/E may hydrolyze additional proteins so far not detected with commonly used antibodies to known proteins. BoNT/C for instance, previously thought to hydrolyze only syntaxin, has recently been shown to cleave also SNAP-25 (16Osen-Sand A. Staple J.K. Naldi E. Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Petitpierre S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The results of the present study show, however, that secretion from toxin-treated cells can be completely reconstituted by overexpression of SNAP-23. We therefore conclude that SNAP-25 (or a close homologue) is the only BoNT/E-sensitive protein important in the process of regulated exocytosis. We thank Stéphane Dupuis and Manoëlle Baillod for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Domenico Bosco for help in preparing the figures. Macaulay et al. have also shown that SNAP-23 is not cleaved by BONT/E (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997, 237: 388–393)."
https://openalex.org/W2087005030,"d-Tubocurarine (dTC) is a potent competitive antagonist of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that binds non-equivalently to the two agonist sites (K d values of 30 nm and 8 μm). When nAChR-rich membranes equilibrated with [3H]dTC are irradiated with 254 nm UV light, [3H]dTC is covalently incorporated into the α-, γ-, and δ-subunits in a concentration-dependent and agonist-inhibitable manner, consistent with the localization of the high and low affinity dTC binding sites at the α-γ- and α-δ-subunit interfaces, respectively (Pedersen, S. E. and Cohen, J. B. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.87, 2785–2789). We report on the amino acids within α-, γ-, and δ-subunits that are the sites of specific photoincorporation of [3H]dTC. Subunits isolated from nAChR-rich membranes photolabeled with [3H]dTC were subjected to enzymatic digestion, and peptides containing 3H were isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and/or reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Isolated peptides were then subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis to identify specifically labeled residues. Within the α-subunit, 95% of specific incorporation was contained within a 20-kDa proteolytic fragment beginning at Ser-173, with αTyr-190 the primary site of [3H]dTC photoincorporation and αCys-192 and αTyr-198 labeled at lower efficiency. Within γ- and δ-subunits, specific labeling was contained within proteolytic fragments of 14 and 21 kDa, respectively, beginning at γAla-49 and δThr-51. γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 were identified as the sites of specific [3H]dTC photoincorporation. Sequence alignment studies reveal γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 to be homologous residues at whose position in receptor subunit primary structure a unique pattern of conservation exists in all nAChR (neuronal and muscle). Specifically, all subunits that associate with an α-subunit to form an agonist site contain a tryptophan homologous to γTrp-55/δTrp-57. This pattern of conservation may indicate a functional significance for tryptophan at that location in all nAChR agonist sites. d-Tubocurarine (dTC) is a potent competitive antagonist of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that binds non-equivalently to the two agonist sites (K d values of 30 nm and 8 μm).

Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 71: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although agonists bind at equilibrium to the two ACh sites with similar affinities, many competitive antagonists bind nonequivalently (10Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6692-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, at least for competitive antagonists, the binding sites themselves must differ, a difference that results from the fact that the sites are not contained entirely within the α-subunits but are actually located at interfaces between subunits, specifically at the α-γ and α-δ interfaces (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both biochemical and mutational studies have identified regions of the γ- and/or δ-subunits that may contribute to the agonist binding sites. In TorpedonAChR, δAsp-180 has been identified by chemical cross-linking as a residue within 9 Å of αCys-192–193 (13Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3160-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and charge neutralizing mutations at that position in mouse nAChR as well as the homologous γAsp-174 affect both agonist and competitive antagonist binding (14Martin M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In other studies that examined the mouse muscle nAChR, amino acids at residues 116, 117, and 161 in γ (and the equivalent residues in δ) determined the nonequivalent binding affinities for competitive antagonists (15Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas amino acids at residues 34, 111, and 172 in γ (and the equivalent residues in δ) determined the nonequivalent binding affinities for a peptide antagonist, α-conotoxin M1 (17Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies identify three regions within the non-α-subunit primary structure that contribute to the agonist binding sites (near γ residues 34, 111–117, and 161–174 and the equivalent residues in δ). The competitive antagonist d-tubocurarine (dTC) binds to the two agonist sites with markedly different affinities (K d values of 30 nm and 8 μm, (10Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)). When [3H]dTC is equilibrated with Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes at concentrations of [3H]dTC sufficient to occupy both binding sites and irradiated at 254 nm, [3H]dTC is covalently incorporated into the nAChR α-, γ-, and δ-subunits (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although the efficiency of photoincorporation was low, with less than 5% of occupied sites labeled, the dependence of subunit labeling upon dTC concentration established that the high and low affinity dTC binding sites were located at the interfaces of the α-γ and α-δ subunits, respectively. In addition, the efficiency of [3H]dTC photoincorporation within γ- and δ-subunits was similar to that seen for α-subunit. This pattern of photolabeling differed from that seen for another antagonist, [3H]-p-(dimethylamino)benzenediazonium fluoroborate (DDF), which was incorporated into β-, γ-, and δ-subunits at <10% of its α labeling (18Galzi J.L. Revah F. Bouet F. Menez A. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and for the agonist [3H]nicotine, which was photoincorporated into γ-subunit at ∼25% the level of α, with no agonist-inhibitable incorporation in δ-subunit detected (19Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the major sites of specific photoincorporation of [3H]dTC within the α-, γ-, and δ-subunits. Within the α-subunit, the sites of photoincorporation (αTyr-190, Cys-192, and Tyr-198) are the same as the amino acids identified by other antagonist affinity labels and [3H]nicotine, although no incorporation was detected (i.e. <2% αTyr-190) in the other regions of α-subunit (near αTyr-93, αTrp-149) labeled by [3H]DDF (20Dennis M. Giraudat J. Kotzyba-Hibert F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Chang J.-Y. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2346-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Galzi J.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23354-23364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major sites labeled by [3H]dTC in γ (γTrp-55) and δ (δTrp-57) define a fourth loop contributing to the agonist binding site from the non-α-subunits. A preliminary report of these data was presented previously (23Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: A106Google Scholar). nAChR-rich membranes were isolated from the electric organs of Torpedo californica (Marinus, Westchester, CA) or Torpedo nobiliana (Biofish Associates, Georgetown, MA) using the method described by Pedersen et al. (24Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition to the homogenization buffer of calpain inhibitors I and II (10 mg/liter, Boehringer Mannheim). The final membrane suspensions in 38% sucrose, 0.02% NaN3 were stored at −80 °C and contained 0.5–1.7 nmol of ACh binding sites/mg of protein as determined by an ultracentrifugation binding assay using [3H]ACh (25Dreyer E.B. Hasan F. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13727-13734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]dTC was prepared as described by Pedersen and Cohen (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As determined by analytical HPLC, radiochemical specific activities of 30 and 20 Ci/mmol were obtained in two syntheses. Carbamylcholine, oxidized glutathione, and endoglycosidase H were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant N-Glycanase® was obtained from Genzyme. Cyanogen bromide was obtained from Fluka. Analytical grade endoproteinase Lys-C was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim,Staphylococcal aureus glutamyl endopeptidase (V8 protease) was obtained from ICN Biochemicals, and trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) was obtained from Worthington. Photolabeling of membrane suspensions on an analytical scale (i.e. aliquots of 40 μg) was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates as described (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and protocols for photolabeling on a preparative scale (12 mg of protein) were designed to preserve important parameters from the analytical experiments. A 254-nm lamp (Spectroline EF-16) was positioned 7 cm above the membrane suspension contained in a polystyrene tray (4.5 cm × 14 cm × 2.5 cm deep) chosen so that a volume of 8 ml would have a depth (1.3 mm) similar to analytical labeling experiments. In this manner photolabeling conditions optimized on an analytical scale should remain appropriate for the preparative labeling. Freshly thawed nAChR-rich membrane suspensions were diluted 3-fold with Torpedophysiological saline (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0.) and pelleted at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 3 °C. A 25-gauge needle was used to resuspend the membranes to 1.25 mg of protein/ml in Torpedo physiological saline supplemented with 500 μm oxidized glutathione that was included as an aqueous photochemical scavenger (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). [3H]dTC was then added to the desired concentration, as well as 1 mm carbamylcholine for the samples used to define nonspecific photolabeling. Membrane suspensions (10 mg of protein in 8 ml) were transferred to a polystyrene tray that was placed in a cold water bath in an enclosed box containing the UV lamp. The suspension was stirred using a magnetic stirrer while the box was flushed with argon for 30 min, and the suspensions were then irradiated for 3 min also with stirring. Following irradiation, the solutions were pelleted at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. Aliquots of supernatant were collected so that the free [3H]dTC concentration could be determined by liquid scintillation counting, and the pellets were solubilized to 5 mg/ml in sample loading buffer (8% sucrose, 2% SDS, 0.06m Tris, 0.4% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) for SDS-PAGE separation of the nAChR subunits. nAChR subunits were resolved by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 8% acrylamide slab gels (1.5 mm thick) containing 0.32% bisacrylamide. Following electrophoresis, polypeptides were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain as described (27White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and bands containing the desired subunits were excised from the gel and soaked in distilled water for 30 min to remove residual precipitating reagents. nAChR subunits were then either isolated by passive elution from 1- to 2-mm gel fragments (28White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or an individual subunit gel slice was transferred to the well of a second, mapping gel (“in gel” (24Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for digestion with V8 protease. For V8 protease digestion, the subunit gel slice (from 5 mg of nAChR-rich membranes) was first incubated for 10 min in overlay buffer (5% sucrose, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, and 125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) and then placed in the well of the mapping gel that was composed of a 5-cm stacking gel (4% acrylamide) and a 10-cm separating gel (15% acrylamide, 0.4% bisacrylamide). The gel pieces were covered with 1 ml of overlay buffer containing 200 μg of V8 protease, and electrophoresis was carried out at 125 V until the tracking dye reached the separating gel, at which time the power was shut off to allow for a digestion period of 3 h. Electrophoresis was then completed at 250 V. Appropriate regions of the mapping gels were excised, and protein was isolated from these gel fragments by passive elution during 16 h into 10 ml of buffer (100 mm NH4HCO3, 0.25% SDS, 2.5 mm DTT, pH 8.4). The eluted material was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove gel pieces, and the protein was concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml by use of Amicon Centriprep-30 (for intact subunits) or Centriprep-10 (for subunit fragments) concentrators. Excess SDS was removed by acetone precipitation (75% acetone at −20 °C for 1 h), and the pellet was resuspended in 100–800 μl of storage buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS). The yields of recovered subunits or proteolytic fragments were estimated by protein assay (Pierce micro BCA protein assay kit) and by liquid scintillation counting. From 10 mg of membrane protein, subunit yields were typically 400 μg for α-subunit at 1–3 mg/ml and 300 μg for the other subunits at 0.8–2 mg/ml. For digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, intact subunits in storage buffer were diluted 4-fold with Tris buffer (final concentrations: 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm DTT, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS, pH 8.6). Trypsin digestion of δ-subunit was performed in 0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Lubrol-PX, pH 8.0 (by diluting the storage buffer with 2 × trypsin buffer). Cyanogen bromide digestion was carried out in 70% formic acid. Digestions with glycosidases were carried out in storage buffer (endoglycosidase H) or for N-Glycanase®, in storage buffer supplemented with 0.5% Lubrol-PX (Pierce). Digestions were carried out at room temperature, and the enzyme concentrations and incubation times are indicated. Solution digests of subunits or subunit fragments were separated either on 15% acrylamide gels using the Laemmli buffer system or, when indicated, on a Tricine gel system described by Schägger and von Jagow (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Digests carried out on an analytical scale (10–40 μg of protein) were fractionated on 0.75-mm thick gels. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed, stained with Coomassie Blue and destained, treated with En3HanceTM (Dupont) or AmplifyTM(Amersham Corp.), dried, and analyzed by fluorography to determined the distribution of 3H as described by Pedersen et al. (24Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that gels were rinsed in 5% acetic acid, 2.5% glycerol (En3HanceTM treated only) before drying. The dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for fluorographic analysis. Liquid scintillation counting was used to quantify the distribution of 3H within gel lanes. The lanes were cut into 1–5 mm slices extending from the top of the spacer gel to the bottom of the separating gel, and the slices were rehydrated for 1 h in 0.1 ml of water and then counted in a toluene-based scintillation fluid containing 10% (v/v) TS-1 tissue solubilizer (RPI), 2.8 g/liter 2,5-diphenyloxazole, and 0.28 g/liter 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene after 2–3 days of incubation. When peptides were to be recovered from the dried gels after fluorography, AmplifyTM, a water-based fluorographic reagent, was used. After fluorography the bands of interest were excised and rehydrated by soaking in H2O for ½ h, and the peptides were isolated from the rehydrated gel slices by passive elution as described previously. Molecular masses of labeled bands were estimated in relation to the following molecular mass markers: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase B (97.4 kDa), bovine albumin (66 kDa), and egg albumin (45 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), trypsinogen (24 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and cyanogen bromide-digested myoglobin fragments (17, 14.4, 10.6, 8.2, and 6.2 kDa). Some [3H]dTC-labeled fragments were further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 or C18 column (220 × 2.1 mm). Cyanogen bromide digestions were separated by gradient filtration on a TPK 2000 SW column. The system components have been described (28White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the elution solvents and conditions are described in the figure legends. Solvents were filtered through nylon filters (Rainin, 0.2 μm pore size) and degassed prior to use, and all glassware was prerinsed 3 × with the solvents. An Applied Biosystems model 470A protein sequencer with an in-line model 120A PTH-amino acid analyzer was used to sequence samples of interest. PTH-labeled amino acids were dissolved in 126 μl of 20% acetonitrile prior to injection onto the amino acid analyzer, and the system was calibrated so that after the 50-μl injection loop on the analyzer was filled (40%), 50 μl of the sample was collected in the fraction collector for determination of released radioactivity (40%). The actual cpm and pmol detected are reported. Samples for sequence analysis were loaded onto trifluoroacetic acid-treated glass fiber filters coated with 3 mg of Polybrene. Aliquots (up to 120 μl) of samples in storage buffer that had been isolated from gels were loaded directly onto the filters. Pooled HPLC samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in a small volume of storage buffer (50–100 μl), and applied to the filters. Cycle yields for PTH-derivatives were estimated from peak heights. Initial peptide mass (I) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by nonlinear least squares regression (Sigma Plot) of the function f(x) =I × R x where f(x) is the observed mass released in cycle x. This function is displayed as dotted lines on the figures showing sequencing masses. PTH-derivatives of Ser, Cys, Arg, His, and Trp were excluded from the fits due to known problems with measuring mass yields of these residues. Initial experiments confirmed the basic results of Pedersen and Cohen (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), namely that 254 nm irradiation resulted in agonist-inhibitable incorporation of [3H]dTC into AChR α-, γ-, and δ-subunits with incorporation into γ-subunit when the high affinity dTC site was occupied and incorporation into δ-subunit when the low affinity dTC site was occupied. Shown in Fig.1 are results for a representative experiment where membrane suspensions were labeled with three different concentrations of [3H]dTC. At high free dTC concentration (1 μm), the efficiency of incorporation into the δ-subunit was similar to that of the α- and γ-subunits, and no specific incorporation into the β-subunit was detected. Irradiation for 3 min at 254 nm resulted in incorporation into only a small fraction (<5%) of occupied dTC sites. Longer irradiation times resulted in significant cross-linking between subunits without a corresponding increase in [3H]dTC incorporation into the remaining uncross-linked subunits, while shorter times decreased incorporation (data not shown). Therefore, sample irradiation was limited to 3 min. To determine the effects of irradiation on dTC, the concentrations of free [3H]dTC were measured by analytical HPLC before and after a photolabeling of nAChR-rich membranes. The concentration of free [3H]dTC, which was initially 1.6 μm, decreased to 1.2 μm after 3 min of 254 nm UV irradiation (28% decomposition). Membrane suspensions (10 mg of protein) were photolabeled with [3H]dTC in the absence or presence of carbamylcholine (carb), and nAChR subunits were isolated by preparative slab gel electrophoresis. α-Subunit preparations contained 400–500 μg of protein, and β-, γ-, and δ-subunits contained 200–300 μg. Tritium incorporation varied with the free [3H]dTC concentration, but in a typical experiment at 600 nm free ligand, α-, γ-, and δ-subunit preparations incorporated 1340, 1200, and 700 cpm/μg, respectively, each of which was 75% specific,i.e. inhibitable by agonist. In contrast to analytical SDS-PAGE results (Fig. 1), the β-subunit preparations also incorporated 3H at a lower level (380 cpm/μg), with 50% agonist-inhibitable. However, amino-terminal sequence analyses of isolated subunit preparations revealed that the samples were not homogeneous. A representative α-subunit preparation contained an amino-terminal proteolytic fragment of β-subunit at 9% of the α-subunit level. Isolated β-subunit contained amino-terminal proteolytic fragments of γ- and δ-subunit at 10 and 27% the level of β-subunit, respectively, and γ- and δ-subunit preparations were contaminated with the Na+/K+-ATPase β-subunit at 30–60% of the mass level of the nAChR subunits. The presence of these contaminating polypeptides was not unexpected, since a proteolytic fragment of β-subunit with mobility similar to α-subunit as well as γ- and δ-subunit fragments with mobility similar to β-subunit are present in the membrane suspensions (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and ATPase β-subunit fragments have been identified in digests of nAChR γ- and δ-subunits (28White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping with S. aureus glutamyl endopeptidase (V8 protease) was employed to determine the distribution of 3H within four large nonoverlapping α-subunit fragments reproducibly produced by V8 protease (TableI). On 15% polyacrylamide gels, the fragments have molecular masses of 20 kDa (αV8-20), 18 kDa (αV8-18), 10 kDa (αV8-10), and 4 kDa (αV8-4). The αV8-20 peptide begins at Ser-162/173 and contains the principal site(s) of specific incorporation of [3H]dTC in α-subunit (24Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αV8-18 peptide contains the only N-linked carbohydrate (Asn-141) in α-subunit and extends from Val-46/Thr-52 to Glu-161/Glu-172. After deglycosylation, this fragment has an apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa (αV8-12). Fragment αV8-4 begins at Ser-1, and αV8-10 begins at Asn-339 and extends to the α-subunit carboxyl terminus (27White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As noted by Pedersen et al. (24Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to fully resolve αV8-20 from αV8-18, but this can be accomplished by the shift of mobility associated with deglycosylation of Asn-141. Based upon counting of excised gel slices, >95% of the3H incorporated in α-subunit was contained within αV8-20 in proteolytic digests of either glycosylated or deglycosylated α-subunit. More than 90% of that incorporation was specific, as evidenced by the reduced 3H incorporation seen in fragments isolated from nAChRs labeled in the presence of carbamylcholine. Levels of specific incorporation recovered in gel bands corresponding to αV8-18, αV8-10, and αV8-4 were ≤2% that of αV8-20. For the 18-kDa gel band, this low level of specific3H incorporation was most likely not associated with αV8-18, since no shift of 3H to αV8-12 was observed for deglycosylated α-subunit cleaved with V8 protease.Table I[3 H]dTC photoincorporation into the α-subunit occurs in αV8–20Molecular mass of band−Endoglycosidase H+Endoglycosidase H−Carb+Carb−Carb+CarbkDacpm207656497652242018313622271-aRegions that contained no Coomassie Blue-stained band are indicated.

The position of this substrate-analogue provides valuable information on the reaction mechanism and explains the limited substrate specificity of the Xanthobacter l-2-haloacid dehalogenase. The bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus is capable of growing on short-chain haloalkanes as its sole source of carbon and energy (2Janssen D.B. Scheper A. Dijkhuizen L. Witholt B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 49: 673-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its natural substrate 1,2-dichloroethane is degraded via 2-chloroethanol, chloroacetaldehyde, and chloroacetate to glycolate in four successive enzymatic reactions before it enters the organism's central metabolic routes. Brominated compounds can also be processed in this way. Two different dehalogenases are used to cleave off the halogen atoms in the first and fourth step. In the first step, a haloalkane dehalogenase catalyzes the conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane into 2-chloroethanol and chloride. The three-dimensional structure (3Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and catalytic mechanism (4Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) of this enzyme have been elucidated by x-ray crystallography. In the fourth degradation step, a 2-haloacid dehalogenase catalyzes the conversion of chloroacetate to glycolate and chloride. Over 20 different 2-haloacid dehalogenases (EC 3.8.1.2) have been found in various bacteria (5Fetzner S. Lingens F. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 641-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They have been grouped into four different classes according to their substrate specificity and stereospecific action on 2-monochloropropionic acid: two classes of enzymes that are active with only the l- or d-substrate, yielding products with inversion of configuration at the chiral C-2 carbon atom. The two other classes act on both stereo-isomers, one with inversion of configuration, the other with retention. High amino acid sequence identities are observed among the dehalogenases within any of the separate classes (6Barth P.T. Bolton L. Thomson J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2612-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kawasaki H. Toyama T. Maeda T. Nishino H. Tonomura K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but no homology is evident between the 2-haloacid dehalogenases from different classes. The 2-haloacid dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus belongs to the class of l-specific dehalogenases that act with inversion of configuration (l-DEXs). 1The abbreviations used are: l-DEX,l-2-haloacid dehalogenase; DhlB, l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus GJ10; l-DEX YL, l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonassp.

The dhlB gene encoding for it was cloned and sequenced, and the enzyme (DhlB) has been purified and characterized (8van der Ploeg J. van Hall G. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 253 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 27,431 Da. The amino acid sequence is over 40% identical to seven other l-2-haloacid dehalogenases from various Pseudomonas species and one haloacetate dehalogenase from Moraxella sp. strain B (9Kurihara T. Liu J.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It shows no homology to haloalkane dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus or 4-chlorobenzoyl-coenzyme A dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. CBS-3 (10Benning M.M. Taylor K.L. Liu R.-Q. Yang G. Xiang H. Wesenberg G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8103-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the two other dehalogenases structurally characterized so far. Dehalogenases act on halogenated aliphatic compounds, which are industrially applied on a large scale as solvents, as intermediates in the production of plastics, and as insecticides. They cause severe problems due to their toxicity as well as their persistence in the environment (11McConnell G. Ferguson D.M. Pearson C.R. Endeavour. 1975; 34: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Since dehalogenases can be used in a biotechnological approach to detoxify these environmentally damaging compounds, they are a fascinating target for research. In addition, the stereospecificity of l-DEXs could make them useful for the biosynthesis of chiral 2-hydroxyalkanoic acids. 18O-Labeled H2O incorporation experiments have indicated that the dehalogenation reaction catalyzed byl-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YL (l-DEX YL) proceeds via a two-step mechanism, with Asp10 acting as a nucleophile in the first step (12Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From site-directed mutagenesis, Kurihara et al. (9Kurihara T. Liu J.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) identified eight other amino acid residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding. Recently, the structure of the l-DEX YL was solved to 2.5-Å resolution (1Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which showed that the enzyme has a mixed α/β core domain in a Rossmann-type fold with a four-helix bundle subdomain insertion. The homologous DhlB has 102 out of its 253 amino acid residues in common with the l-DEX YL sequence. To gain more insight into the factors that determine the substrate specificity and stereospecific catalysis, to obtain a structure-based model for the reaction mechanism, and to complement the data already obtained on the Pseudomonas enzyme, we extended our crystallographic studies on dehalogenating enzymes to the l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus. Here we present the 1.95-Å structure of the enzyme with the substrate-analogue formate bound in the active site, from which a structure-based substrate binding model and the enzyme's reaction mechanism are inferred. The oligomerization state ofl-2-haloacid dehalogenase in solution was determined by dynamic light scattering analysis on a DynaPro 801 instrument (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA), applying 0.1-μm filters for sample injection. A solution of 3.3 mg/ml protein in 100 mmbis-Tris + Tris buffer, pH 7.0, was monitored at 22 °C, with or without the presence of 200 mm sodium formate. Apparent molecular masses of the enzyme as well as the percentage polydispersity were calculated with the instrumentation software using the monomodal assumption. In the absence of formate, the molecular mass fluctuated around 60 kDa (polydispersity of 35%) with deviations up to 20 kDa. The addition of sodium formate reduced the apparent hydrodynamic radius of the molecule, resulting in an estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa (polydispersity 27%) with deviations of about 10 kDa. Subsequent incubation with formate for 1 h lowered the apparent molecular mass to 45 kDa with a corresponding polydispersity of 23%. The fluctuations were reduced to 2–3 kDa and 1–2%, respectively. In a gel filtration experiment with the equilibrated protein solution using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column (Pharmacia, Sweden), the molecular mass was measured to be 50 kDa. l-2-Haloacid dehalogenase was purified and crystallized as described previously (8van der Ploeg J. van Hall G. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2619-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Rod-shaped crystals (typical size 0.4 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3) were obtained within a few weeks at room temperature by vapor diffusion in hanging drops using macro-seeding techniques. The drop contained 6 μl 2.5 mg/ml protein, 16% (w/v) PEG 8000, 200 mm sodium formate, and 100 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.8–7.0. The well contained 1 ml of 20–22% PEG 8000, 200 mm sodium formate, and 100 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.8–7.0. The crystals belonged to space group C2221, with cell axes a = 57.2 Å, b = 91.5 Å,c = 84.1 Å for data collected at 120 K (native 1). The crystal volume per unit mass, V M, was 2.00 Å3/Da, assuming one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The deduced solvent content was 38%. Under the same conditions also crystals belonging to space group P212121 were found, with cell axes a = 57.2 Å, b = 84.2 Å,c = 91.5 Å for data collected at 100 K (native 2). Crystals in both crystal forms were of good x-ray quality and diffracted up to 2.0-Å resolution, when synchrotron radiation was used. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in solutions of a standard mother liquor, containing 25% PEG 8000, 200 mm sodium formate, and 100 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.8–7.0. The pH, heavy atom concentration, and soaking time were varied for promising compounds. In this way, over 25 different compounds were tested under various conditions. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature to check for heavy atom binding. None of the compounds tried yielded a usable derivative, mainly due to problems with non-isomorphism. However, after switching to data collection at cryogenic temperatures, the search readily resulted in four isomorphous derivatives. These were prepared by soaking native crystals for 2 days in 3 mm K2OsO4, for 3 days in 1 mm p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (PCMBS), for 1.5 days in 3 mm ethyl mercurithiosalicylate, and for 4 days in 3 mmIrCl3, respectively. Addition of 25% glycerol to the mother liquor yielded a good cryoprotectant for cryogenic data collection. Diffraction data for two native and six derivative data sets were collected in house and at the synchrotron beamlines of the EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg, Germany (see Table I). The in-house data sets (native 1 and the ethyl mercurithiosalicylate and IrCl3) were collected from single crystals at 120 K on an Enraf Nonius FAST area detector system (Enraf Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands). The detector was equipped with a CAD4 κ-goniostat with graphite monochromatized CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from an Elliot GX21 rotating anode x-ray generator. These data were collected and processed using the MADNES package (14Messerschmidt A. Pflugrath J.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 306-315Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Profile fitting and local scaling of the data was done according to Kabsch (15Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), and afterward the data were merged with software from the BIOMOL crystallographic package (Protein Crystallography Group, University of Groningen).Table IData collection and MIRAS analysisCrystal/derivativeNative 1Native 2K2OsO4PCMBSEMTS1-aEthyl mercurithiosalicylate.IrCl3λ1λ2λ3DataX31BW7BX31X31X31X31FastFast No. of observations49,346438,84520,64230,24731,08152,94541,31220,120 Unique reflections10,19832,507560845784653773940874029 Resolution (Å)2.31.952.83.03.02.53.03.0 Completeness (%)97.099.4989698988987 R sym on I(%)1-bR sym = Σ h Σ i ‖I ( h , i )− 〈I ( h )〉‖/Σ h Σ i 〈I ( h )〉 × 100%, where I ( h , i ) is the scaled intensity of the ith observation of reflection hand 〈I ( h )〉 is the mean value.6.04.23.62.72.83.37.55.8 R der(%)1-cR der = Σ h ‖ ‖F PH ‖ − ‖F P ‖ ‖/Σ h ‖F P ‖ × 100%, where F PH and F P are the structure factors for derivative and native data.15.513.415.011.8MIRAS analysis Resolution used (Iso/ano)3.8/3.0−/3.0−/3.03.8/3.03.0/3.53.3/5.0 No. of sites133321 Phasing power (Iso/ano)1-dPhasing power = 〈F H 〉/〈E〉, where 〈F H 〉 is the root mean square calculated heavy atom structure factor amplitude and 〈E〉 is the root mean square lack of closure error; isomorphous and anomalous differences are treated separately.1.0/1.4−/1.5−/1.71.2/1.61.8/1.21.1/1.1 Overall figure of merit0.7161-a Ethyl mercurithiosalicylate.1-b R sym = Σ h Σ i ‖I ( h , i )− 〈I ( h )〉‖/Σ h Σ i 〈I ( h )〉 × 100%, where I ( h , i ) is the scaled intensity of the ith observation of reflection hand 〈I ( h )〉 is the mean value.1-c R der = Σ h ‖ ‖F PH ‖ − ‖F P ‖ ‖/Σ h ‖F P ‖ × 100%, where F PH and F P are the structure factors for derivative and native data.1-d Phasing power = 〈F H 〉/〈E〉, where 〈F H 〉 is the root mean square calculated heavy atom structure factor amplitude and 〈E〉 is the root mean square lack of closure error; isomorphous and anomalous differences are treated separately. Open table in a new tab All synchrotron data were collected at the beamlines of the EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg, at cryotemperatures (100 K) from single crystals. The osmate and PCMBS derivative data were collected at the X31 beamline, equipped with an 18-cm MAR image plate area detector (MAR Research, Hamburg, Germany), with wavelengths tuned to λOs = 0.945 Å, and λ2-PCMBS = 1.006 Å, respectively, to make optimal use of anomalous scattering. For the mercury derivative, data sets at λ1-PCMBS = 1.009 Å and λ3-PCMBS = 0.845 Å were also collected to attempt phasing by the method of multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction. A high resolution native data set (native 2) was taken at the BW7B beamline (λ = 0.883 Å), equipped with a 30-cm MAR image plate area detector. However, the crystal used belonged to space group P212121, which was different from the C2221 crystals observed before. All synchrotron data were integrated and merged with DENZO/SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S.S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Derivative data were scaled to the native 1 data set with PHASES (17Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Data processing statistics are given in TableI. The structure was initially solved in space group C2221 by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement in combination with anomalous scattering information from all derivatives (MIRAS). All calculations pertaining to the MIRAS analysis and subsequent density modification were done with the PHASES program package. Isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps (10–4 Å data) for the osmate derivative showed a clear single heavy atom site. The resulting phase information was used to calculate isomorphous and anomalous cross-difference Fourier maps for the PCMBS derivative, yielding a single major site. From this, the other two heavy atom data sets could easily be interpreted. For both mercury derivatives, minor sites were identified from difference Fourier maps in the course of the phase refinement. Concerning the three PCMBS data sets, isomorphous differences from only the λ3-PCMBS data were used. Anomalous information from all three PCMBS data sets was included. The final figure of merit was 0.72 for data up to 3.0 Å. Phasing statistics are given in Table I. The MIRAS maps were further improved by solvent flattening, assuming a solvent content of 35%, and by phase extension to 3.0-Å resolution to include calculated intensities for the missing reflections. This final 3.0-Å resolution electron density map was traced using O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and nearly all the chain could be interpreted according to the amino acid sequence (8van der Ploeg J. van Hall G. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One dubious loop connecting two strands was removed after inspection of the l-DEX YL structure that had just been published (1Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement routines from AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 43: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) were then applied to position two copies of the C2221 model in the P212121 cell. A random set of 5% of the unique reflections was set apart to calculate R free values (20Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar) as an independent validation of the refinement process. The model was subjected to simulated annealing refinement (4000 → 300 K) with X-PLOR (21Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) with non-crystallographic symmetry constraints. Subsequent cycles of REFMAC (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar) and ARP (23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used in positional and B factor refinement and to automatically place solvent molecules. In the first cycles, tight restraints on non-crystallographic symmetry were applied, but these were gradually released and in later stages the molecules were refined independently since this gave the lowest R free values. At all stages, ςA-weighted OMIT 2F o −F c electron density maps (24Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 25Bhat T.N. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 279-281Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Vellieux F.M.D. Dijkstra B.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 396-399Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were calculated and inspected with O to check the agreement of the model with the data. PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to assess the stereochemical quality. Whenever necessary, the model was manually adjusted in O. When the refinement gave no further decrease in R free nor any improvement in stereochemistry, it was considered completed. The initial R work factor was 44.1% (R free = 44.7%) for data in the range of 7–2.0-Å resolution. After refinement, the R work factor had improved to 19.0% for data ranging from 5.0 to 1.95 Å (R free = 24.8%). A final round of refinement including all data resulted in an overall crystallographic R factor of 21.3% for data ranging from 15.0 to 1.95 Å. The final model consists of 3776 protein atoms, 3 formate ions, and 334 water molecules. Refinement statistics are given in Table II. The structure was analyzed using the programs GRASP (28Nicholls A. Honig B. GRASP. Columbia University, New York1993Google Scholar), ASC (29Eisenhaber F. Argos P. J. Comput.

Open table in a new tab The three-dimensional structure ofl-2-haloacid dehalogenase from X. autotrophicuswas solved by multiple isomorphous replacement supplemented with anomalous scattering information. The refined structure consists of two copies of the molecule, comprising amino acids 1–245 for both monomers. Three formate ions and 334 water molecules are also contained in the structure. For both molecules, the C-terminal residues 246–253 are not included, because the electron density was too weak to identify their positions unambiguously. In both molecules, the amino acid residue at position 84, a glycine according to the sequence, has clear extra forked electron density extending from Cα, allowing for a Leu, Asn, or Asp. Since it is on the outside of the protein and the F o −F c electron density is flat, it can be either an asparagine or an aspartate residue. On the basis of on the DNA sequence (GGG for Gly (8van der Ploeg J. van Hall G. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GA(U/C) for Asp, and AA(A/U) for Asn), we have chosen to model in an aspartate. All other regions of both molecules fit the electron density very well (Fig.1), as is also reflected in the average real-space correlation coefficient of 0.86 for the final ςA-weighted OMIT 2F o −F c electron density map. In two short loops and the C terminus in both molecules (residues 25–27, 204–206, and 244–245), the main chain seems to be disordered and only one of the possible conformations for each loop is represented in the model. A comparison of the two independently refined dehalogenase molecules in the asymmetric unit shows r.m.s. differences of 0.30 Å on Cα atoms, which is above the coordinate error of 0.2 Å as estimated from a Luzzati plot (32Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 6: 142-152Crossref Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, an important part of these differences occurs in the C terminus and the two short loops that seem to be moderately disordered. Another major contribution stems from two short loops, residues 105–107 and 126–132, on the outside of the protein. This is due to their different environment in the two monomers, caused by different crystal contacts in these two regions. Leaving these loops out of the comparison results in an r.m.s. difference of 0.19 Å for 225 superimposed Cα atoms. Thus, the small variations between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit must be attributed to conformational flexibility and/or a different crystal environment of regions on the outside of the dimer rather than to biologically significant structural differences between the monomers. All results discussed below apply to both molecules, unless stated otherwise. The crystallographic R factor is 21.3% for data in the resolution range of 15–1.95 Å. In a Ramachandran plot (not shown) 93.9% of the residues are in the most favored regions, while the remaining 6.1% lie in the additionally allowed parts. The overall G factor from PROCHECK is +0.10, and the r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry are 0.009 Å and 2.1° for bond lengths and angles, respectively (33Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar). The average B value for all protein atoms is 20.7 Å2 and 31 Å2 for non-protein atoms. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the geometry of the model is sound. The l-2-haloacid dehalogenase molecule, with approximate dimensions of 53 × 43 × 38 Å3, consists of three domains and has an overall shape resembling a heart (Fig. 2). The main domain, comprising amino acids 1–14, 94–192, 220–245, and possibly the C terminus, is composed of a central six-stranded parallel open twisted β-sheet (β1–β6), flanked on both sides by in total five α-helices (α5–α8 and α11). The order of the strands in the β-sheet is β6-β5-β4-β1-β2-β3, with the strands connected by right-handed β-α-β motifs, except for the connection between strands β5 and β6. In the main domain, three 310-helices are found immediately before and after strand β3 and before strand β4. The folding motif of the main domain is generally known as the Rossmann fold (34Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Two subdomains stand out on the C-terminal end of the central β-sheet: the large atrium of the heart, composed of residues 15–93 and inserted between strand β1 and helix α5, has a distorted anti-parallel four-helix-bundle structure. Helices α1 and α3 are oriented in approximately the same direction, while the 20-residue long helix α2 and helix α4 are at angles of 135° and 225°, respectively. The helices are connected by short loops. Two 310-helices mark the start and end of this first subdomain. In between the main domain and the large atrium, the active site is located in a cavity with a volume of approximately 80 Å3. Amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of strands β4, β1, and β2 make up the bottom of the cavity, and residues from the four-helix-bundle domain shield the top of the cavity from the solvent. The second subdomain or small atrium of the heart is made up by residues 193–219, forming an excursion of two anti-parallel helices between strands β5 and β6. This second subdomain is absent in all other l-2-haloacid dehalogenase sequences found to date. The two helical subdomains are not packed tightly to each other, making only one direct hydrogen bond. However, both atria are intimately involved in dimerization (see below). Apart from thisl-2-haloacid dehalogenase, the family ofl-2-haloacid dehalogenases comprises eight other members, one haloacetate dehalogenase from Moraxella sp. strain B and seven other l-2-haloacid dehalogenases, all from Pseudomonas species, sharing 36–70% amino acid sequence identity. In 1996, the crystal structure of l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YL was solved (1Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to 2.5 Å. The l-DEX YL has 102 out of its 232 amino acid residues in common with the DhlB sequence, and its fold is highly similar; 218 of the 220 Cα atoms can be superimposed with an r.m.s. difference of only 1.3 Å (see Fig. 3). All residues that were identified to be of importance for the reaction mechanism are conserved (9Kurihara T. Liu J.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and can be found in similar positions in the structure of DhlB, although the orientation of the side chains sometimes deviates (see also below). Despite the similarities, two major differences exist, the first being the presence of the left atrium subdomain with the two antiparallel helices α9 and α10. Residues from both helices are part of the dimer interface, which results in a larger contact area than in the l-DEX YL enzyme without changing the overall architecture of the dimer. Second, the active site cavity of the Xanthobacter structure is shielded from the solvent, whereas in the Pseudomonas sp. YL enzyme it is open from two sides. One entrance to the active site is via a wide open cleft between the core- and subdomain, which was proposed to accommodate the long alkyl tails of substrates like l-2-bromohexadecanoic acid (1Hisano T.

https://openalex.org/W2010468499,"Measurement of [Cl−] i and the Cl− current in the rat salivary submandibular gland (SMG) acinar and duct cells was used to evaluate the role of Cl− channels in the regulation of [Cl−] i during purinergic stimulation. Under resting conditions [Cl−] i averaged 56 ± 8 and 26 ± 7 mm in acinar and duct cells, respectively. In both cells, stimulation with 1 mm ATP resulted in Cl− efflux and subsequent influx. Inhibition of NaKCl2 cotransport had no effect on [Cl−] i changes in duct cells and inhibited only about 50% of Cl− uptake in acinar cells. Accordingly, low levels of expression of NaKCl2 cotransporter protein were found in duct cells. Acinar cells expressed high levels of the cotransporter. Measurement of Cl− current under selective conditions revealed that acinar and duct cells express at least five distinct Cl− channels; a ClCO-like, volume-sensitive, inward rectifying, Ca2+-activated and CFTR-like Cl− currents. ATP acting on both cell types activated at least two channels, the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel and a Ca2+-independent glibenclamide-sensitive Cl−-current, possibly cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Of the many nucleotides tested only 2′-3′-benzoylbenzoyl (Bz)-ATP and UTP activated Cl− channels in SMG cells. Despite their relative potency in increasing [Ca2+] i, BzATP in both SMG cell types largely activated the Ca2+-independent, glibenclamide-sensitive Cl− current, whereas UTP activated only the Ca2+-dependent Cl− current. We interpret this to suggest that BzATP and UTP largely activate Cl− channels residing in the membrane expressing the receptor for the active nucleotide. The present studies reveal a potentially new mechanism for transcellular Cl− transport in a CFTR-expressing tissue, the SMG. Coordinated action of the P2z (luminal) and P2u (basolateral) receptors can mediate part of the transcellular Cl− transport by acinar and duct cells to determine the final electrolyte composition of salivary fluid.

Salivary secretion occurs in two steps. Acinar cells secrete the primary isotonic, NaCl-rich fluid. The duct changes electrolyte composition and to some extent the osmolarity of the primary fluid by absorbing the NaCl and secreting KHCO3− (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-127Google Scholar). The central feature of the accepted model of fluid and electrolyte secretion by salivary acinar cells is transepithelial Cl− movement as the driving force for fluid and electrolyte secretion (1Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,3Turner R.J. Dobrosielski-Vergona K. Biology of the Salivary Gland. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-127Google Scholar). Functional (4Martinez J.R. Cassity N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: G711-G716PubMed Google Scholar) and immunofluorescence localization (5Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J.

Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) point to NaKCl2 cotransport as the Cl− entry mechanism in the basolateral membrane (BLM). A Ca2+-activated, outward rectifying Cl− channel, found in many salivary acinar cells (1Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar), is believed to be the Cl− exit pathway in the luminal membrane. This model, however, cannot account for a large fraction (∼40%) of Cl− transport by SMG acinar cells. A search for alternative Cl− pathways revealed the presence of at least three Cl− channels in parotid acinar cells; Ca2+-activated, volume-sensitive and hyperpolarization-activated Cl− channels (7Arreola J. Park K. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated the expression of CFTR in the luminal membrane (LM) of SMG acinar cells (9Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton K. Muallem S. Thomas P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for CFTR, the membrane localization, possible role in Cl− secretion, and regulation by agonists of the various Cl− channels are not known. Electrolyte transport by salivary ducts, including Cl− reabsorption, is not well understood on the molecular level. The bulk of Cl− entry in the LM and Cl− efflux across the BLM are assumed to be mediated by Cl−/HCO3− exchange and Cl− channels, respectively (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). Indeed, Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity was found in the LM of SMG duct cells (10Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additional electrogenic Cl− transport, which is needed to balance the electrogenic Na+ reabsorption, may occur through luminal and basolateral Cl− channels (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). This prediction is based on the finding that changing LM and BLM Cl− concentration affects the transepithelial potential and resistance of the excretory SMG duct (11Augustus J. Bigman J. Van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 43: 203-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Luminal Cl− permeability is likely to be in part mediated by CFTR. Duct cells of all salivary glands express CFTR (12Trezise A. Buchwald M. Nature. 1991; 353: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) in the LM (13Webster P. Vanacore L. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C340-C348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another Cl− channel found in SMG duct cells is a ClC2-like channel (14Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The membrane localization and physiological function of this channel are not known, although it may participate in cell volume regulation, as in other cell types (15Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Sepulveda F.V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). How agonists regulate Cl− channels and Cl− transport in SMG and other salivary glands is only partially understood. In acinar cells Ca2+ mobilizing agonists activate the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channel (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar, 3Turner R.J. Dobrosielski-Vergona K. Biology of the Salivary Gland. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-127Google Scholar). Agonists acting through cAMP elevation can activate CFTR in acinar and duct cells (9Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton K. Muallem S. Thomas P. Am.

Salivary acinar and duct cells also respond to purinergic stimulation by a change in [Ca2+] i (17Gallacher D.V. Nature. 1982; 296: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Soltoff S.P.

Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the identities of the receptors and whether they regulate Cl− channels in salivary gland cells are not known. In other epithelia, in particular airway and nasal epithelia, regulation of Cl− channels by purinergic receptors emerged as an important physiological activity with possible therapeutical implications (23Stutts M.J. Chinet T.C. Mason S.J. Fullton J.M. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Stutts M.J. Fritz G.J. Paradiso A.M.

Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1611-C1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different P2 receptors are expressed in the LM and BLM of these cells and appear to regulate multiple and different Cl− channels. Thus, apical ATP acting through P2Y2receptors activates the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels, CFTR, and probably indirectly the outward rectifying Cl− channels (ORCC). Basolateral ATP acting through P2Y3 activates only CFTR in a Ca2+- and cAMP-independent manner (27Hwang T.-H. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1611-C1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was reported that the LM of nasal epithelial cells express UDP-sensitive receptors different from P2Y2, which are coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling and activate Cl− secretion in these cells (28Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Due to our recent discovery of the expression of CFTR in SMG acinar cells, the localization of P2 receptors in the LM and BLM of SMG cells (29Lee M.G. Zeng W.Z. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the importance of purinergic regulation of Cl− secretion in epithelia, in the present study we used [Cl−] i measurements, immunoanalysis, and recording of Cl− currents to characterize and evaluate the contribution of Cl− channels and the NaKCl2cotransporter to Cl− transport during purinergic stimulation of SMG acinar and duct cells. The combined results point to the central role of CFTR and the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel in regulating Cl− transport in SMG duct cells and their contribution to Cl− transport relative to that by the NaKCl2 cotransporter in acinar cells. The general methods are identical to those in our companion study (29Lee M.G. Zeng W.Z. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except for the following. SPQ-loaded acini and duct fragments were plated on coverslips and perfused in a manner similar to that described for Fura 2-loaded cells (29Lee M.G. Zeng W.Z. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SPQ fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and was calibrated by incubating the cells with high K+ solutions containing different concentrations of Cl− (0–100 mm), 10 μmtributyltin, and 2.5 μm nigericin. A maximal fluorescence quench was obtained by exposing the cells to a solution containing 150 mm SCN− (for details, see Zhao and Muallem (30Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1225-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). The calibration curves were used to yield a Stern-Volmer constant of 15.7 ± 1.7 m−1(n = 4). The average is from four experiments with ducts and acini in the same recording field. The dye showed similar behavior in both cell types. As reported before for pancreatic acini (30Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1225-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), SPQ fluorescence in SMG cells was minimally affected by changes in intracellular pH. 86Rb uptake was measured essentially as described previously (30Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1225-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SMG ducts and acini isolated by the Accudenz gradient were incubated in PSA buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. 86Rb uptake was initiated by diluting the cells (1:1) into warm PSA containing 86Rb (∼4.105 cpm/ml) and 0.2 mm bumetanide, 2 mm ouabain, or bumetanide and ouabain. At the indicated times triplicate samples of 0.5 ml were transferred to 8 ml of a cold stop solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmLaCl3, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed three times with the same solution by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.2m NaOH, and 86Rb was determined by scintillation counting. 10–20-μl samples from at least six tubes were taken for measurement of protein, and the results were calculated in terms of nanomoles of K+/mg of protein. Western blot analysis of SMG proteins and immunolocalization were essentially as described in Lee et al. (31Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). SMG ducts and acini were separated twice on an Accudenz gradient (32Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pancreatic and parotid acini were isolated by a standard collagenase digestion protocol (30Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1225-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted and solubilized in an SDS-containing buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and the NaKCl2 cotransporter was detected with mAb T4(kindly provided by Dr. C. Lytle, Riverside, CA). The antibodies were detected by the ECL procedure. For immunolocalization, SMG embedded in OCT were used to cut 4-μm sections. The sections were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips, dried, and permeabilized with cold methanol. After blocking nonspecific sites by incubation with a buffer containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin, the slices were incubated in the same buffer containing a 1:2000 dilution of the mAb for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing, the antibodies were detected with 1:100 dilution of a secondary IgG tagged with fluorescein. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope. To evaluate the role of different Cl− transporters in [Cl−] i regulation we first measured [Cl−] i with SPQ. Fig.1 shows that [Cl−] i was differently regulated in the SMG duct and acinar cells. In resting duct cells [Cl−] i averaged 26 ± 7 (n = 34) and in acinar cells 56 ± 8 mm (n = 29). Stimulation of duct cells with 1 mm ATP caused a rapid reduction in [Cl−] i to about 13.5 ± 4.5 mm. Subsequently [Cl−] i increased over 1.5–2 min and stabilized at 36 ± 6 mm (n = 11) (Fig. 1 a). Stimulation of acini in the same recording field with 1 mm ATP caused a reduction in [Cl−] i to 17 ± 5 mm, which was then increased to about 52 ± 5 mm (n= 11) (Fig. 1 d). The absence of HCO3− in the perfusion medium ensured that these [Cl−] i changes are not affected by Cl−/HCO3− exchange (10Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another potential transporter mediating some of the agonist-dependent [Cl−] i changes is the NaKCl2 cotransporter (33Zhang B.-X. Cragoe Jr., G.H. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C54-C62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Evans R. Turner J.R. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 e shows that in SMG acinar cells 0.1 mm bumetanide reduced the rate of Cl− uptake by about 46 ± 9% and [Cl−] i stabilized at 38 ± 8 mm(n = 9). In duct cells bumetanide failed to affect the [Cl−] i changes evoked by ATP stimulation (n = 9) (Fig. 1 b). On the other hand, Fig.1, c and f, shows that 100 μm of the general Cl− channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid largely inhibited Cl− efflux, and thus all [Cl−] i changes evoked by ATP (n= 4 for each cell type). In view of a recent report of the expression of the secretory NaKCl2 cotransporter in SMG duct cells (6He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.J. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the results in Fig. 1, we proceeded to examine more directly the expression and activity of NaKCl2 cotransport in the two cell types. Western blot analysis with the mAb T4, which recognizes multiple isoforms of the NaKCl2 cotransporter (5Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showed that acinar cells of various exocrine glands express different forms and levels of cotransporter protein (Fig.2 a). Parotid acinar cells express a 185–190-kDa protein. Interestingly, SMG acinar cells expressed at least 10- and 150-fold more NaKCl2cotransporter protein than did parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, respectively. The T4 mAb detected only low levels of cotransporter protein in the SMG ductal preparation. Densitometric analysis showed that intensity in the duct lane was about 6.8 ± 5% (n = 3) of that in SMG acinar lane. After correction for the amount of protein loaded in each lane, this value is within the contamination of the SMG duct preparation with acini (32Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results of the Western blot analysis were confirmed by immunolocalization studies. Fig. 2 b shows that the T4 mAb detected high levels of NaKCl2cotransport in the BLM of acinar cells. The LM of acinar cells and both membranes of duct cells did not stain with this antibody. Further evidence for low NaKCl2 cotransport activity in SMG duct cells was obtained by measuring 86Rb uptake. In SMG acinar cells bumetanide alone inhibited 86Rb uptake by about 60% and nearly all the 86Rb uptake in the presence of ouabain (Fig. 2 c). In duct cells bumetanide alone had no measurable effect on 86Rb uptake, ouabain alone inhibited the uptake by about 60%, and bumetanide further reduced this uptake by about 8% (Fig. 2 d). Although the latter fraction was consistently observed (n = 6), it never exceeded 10%. Excluding Cl−/HCO3− exchange and NaKCl2 cotransport in duct cells and finding a component of Cl− transport not mediated by these transporters in acinar cells stimulated with ATP suggested a role of Cl− channels in both cell types. To identify the Cl− channels participating in the [Cl−] i changes induced by ATP we attempted to characterize the various Cl− channels expressed in freshly isolated SMG duct and acinar cells. Following the voltage protocol of Ludewig et al. (35Ludewig U. Jentsch T. Pusch M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 a) revealed the presence of a voltage gated Cl− current with properties similar to those reported for ClCO (36Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch J.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, traces 1 and 5). For the present studies the most characteristic feature of this current was the fast gating observed after maximal channel opening by hyperpolarizing prepulses. Typically, channel inactivation was faster at −140 than at −80 mV. Another channel found in both cell types is the volume-sensitive Cl− channel. Thus, swelling the cells revealed the presence of an outward rectifying Cl− current with time dependent inactivation in positive potentials (Fig. 3,traces 2 and 6), similar to that described in several other cell types (15Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Sepulveda F.V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As reported before in SMG duct cells (14Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), SMG acinar cells also showed the presence of an inwardly rectifying Cl− current with voltage- and time-dependent activation (not shown). Elevating [Ca2+] i with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 activated an outwardly rectifying Cl− current with a typical time-dependent activation and tail currents (Fig.3, traces 3 and 7). Finally, elevation of cellular cAMP activated a CFTR-like Cl− current in SMG duct and acinar cells (Fig. 3, traces 4 and 8) (see also Zeng et al. (9Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton K. Muallem S. Thomas P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For the purpose of the present work the channels were not characterized further. However, as can be seen in Fig. 3 the Cl− channels expressed in both cell types are similar and have sufficiently distinct kinetic characteristics to aid in their identification during agonist stimulation. Stimulation with 1 mm ATP rapidly activated a Cl− current in single duct and acinar cells. Fig. 4shows the two patterns of Cl− current activation. In about 20% of experiments, after rapid activation by ATP the current returned to near resting level. Subsequent removal of ATP resulted in transient reactivation of the current (Fig. 4, a and e). In most experiments the current remained activated, and removal of ATP resulted in a small current rebounding before its complete inactivation. Determination of the current-voltage relationship at various times during and after ATP stimulation did not result in distinctive patterns (Fig. 4, c and g;lanes 2–4 in each panel). However, subtracting the current at period 3 from that measured at periods 2 and 4 suggests that in both cell types ATP activated at least two distinct Cl− channels (Fig. 4, d and h). Previous studies reported that ATP increases [Ca2+] i in SMG acinar (22Hurley T.W. Ryan M.P. Shoemaker D.D. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and duct cells (32Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels to the current activated by ATP we tested the effect of extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular EGTA on the current. An example of such experiments is shown in Fig.5 and the results of several experiments are summarized in Table I. In both cell types ATP activated Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent Cl− currents. The Ca2+-dependent current was about 60 and 50% of the total current in acinar and duct cells, respectively. This was the case whether the current was calculated as the portion sensitive to external Ca2+ ((a) in Table I) or blocked by high intracellular [EGTA] ((b) in Table I). The kinetic properties of this current are similar to those induced by A23187 (Fig. 3). That is, the current showed outward rectification, time-dependent activation, and substantial tail currents (Fig. 5, b and f).Table ISummary of Cl− currents activated by purinergic stimulationConditionATP, 1 mmBzATP, 100 μmUTP, 100 μmAciniDuctAciniDuctAciniDuctcurrent in pA/pF*Resting/0.5 EGTA1.2 ± 0.34.3 ± 1.10.92 ± 0.342.5 ± 1.50.75 ± 0.271.7 ± 0.48Control26.9 ± 4.662.7 ± 7.718.8 ± 1.555.2 ± 6.711.4 ± 1.327.0 ± 4.9Ca2+-free11.7 ± 2.126.7 ± 5.313.6 ± 1.438.8 ± 2.60.84 ± 0.322.6 ± 1.2Ca2+-dependent (a)15.2 ± 5.036.0 ± 9.35.21 ± 2.116.4 ± 7.210.56 ± 1.224.4 ± 5.0n11105544Resting/5EGTA0.8 ± 0.33.2 ± 1.00.6 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.40.82 ± 0.251.31 ± 0.4Control10.6 ± 1.832.6 ± 4.412.8 ± 1.538.9 ± 4.10.93 ± 0.351.38 ± 0.5Ca2+-dependent (b)16.3 ± 4.930.1 ± 8.86.0 ± 1.715.3 ± 7.8Glibenclamide 100 μm1.1 ± 0.263.4 ± 1.40.8 ± 0.34.3 ± 2.6Glibenclamide-sensitive (a)9.48 ± 1.829.2 ± 4.612.0 ± 1.834.6 ± 4.8n 6 644Resting/0.5 EGTA1.1 ± 0.42.9 ± 1.30.7 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.6Control24.5 ± 3.672.2 ± 9.021.1 ± 2.766.7 ± 3.910.6 ± 1.428.51 ± 1.5Glibenclamide 100 μm11 ± 1.834.0 ± 4.45.4 ± 0.514.4 ± 1.910.4 ± 0.928.2 ± 1.65Glibenclamide-sensitive (b)13.5 ± 1.838.2 ± 10.015.7 ± 2.752.3 ± 4.10.2 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.2n10 95544* pF = picofarad.

The residual, Ca2+-independent current measured in the absence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 5, a and e) and in the presence of 5 mm internal EGTA (Fig. 5, c and g) or 2 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (not shown) has kinetic properties resembling those of CFTR. Since we previously showed that glibenclamide (GLM) inhibits the CFTR-like current in SMG duct and acinar cells (9Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton K. Muallem S. Thomas P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we next tested the effect of GLM on the current stimulated by ATP. Fig.6 and Table I show that GLM completely inhibited the Ca2+-independent Cl− current. Furthermore, the Cl− current inhibited by GLM in the presence of low (Fig. 6, a and e) or high (Fig.6, c and g) EGTA concentration in the pipette solution has a CFTR-like kinetic characteristic (current/voltage curves 2-3 in b and f and curves 1-2 in d and h). The remaining current (current/voltage curves 3-1 in b and f) showed strong outward rectification, as expected from the current carried by the Ca2+-independent Cl− channel. Taking advantage of the membrane-specific action of BzATP and UTP (29Lee M.G. Zeng W.Z. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) we studied regulation of Cl− channels by P2 receptors localized in the LM and BLM, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the effect of 25 μm BzATP on Cl− currents in SMG duct and acinar cells and Table I summarizes between four and six such experiments. Despite the finding that BzATP in both cell types was the most active nucleotide in increasing [Ca2+] i, it activated largely the Ca2+-independent Cl− current. Thus, removal of ext"

The synthesis and post-translational modification of RhoA and Cdc42 were examined in the RAW264 macrophage cell line, and the effect of carboxyl methylation on protein turnover was determined. Cells were labeled with [35S]cysteine, and RhoA or Cdc42 was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Both RhoA and Cdc42 were methylated rapidly in control cells, with little accumulation of unmethylated protein. Carboxyl methylation of RhoA was inhibited by incubation of cells with a carbocyclic adenosine analog, 3-deazaaristeromycin, resulting in the accumulation of unmethylated RhoA. Under these conditions, Cdc42 methylation was inhibited only partially. When methylation was inhibited, the RhoA half-life decreased from 31 to 12 h, and the Cdc42 half-life decreased from 15 to 11 h. The increased degradation of unmethylated RhoA demonstrates a novel function for carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation in protecting RhoA and related proteins from degradation.

The increased degradation of unmethylated RhoA demonstrates a novel function for carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation in protecting RhoA and related proteins from degradation. The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins is a family of important signal-transducing proteins which includes the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins (1Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These proteins are integral components in the signaling pathways for many cellular functions, including the organization of cytoskeletal proteins required for cell motility, adhesion, and proliferation (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Rho proteins are also involved in signaling pathways for the activation of specific transcription factors (4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Different members of the Rho family appear to activate distinct signaling pathways. In fibroblasts, activation of Cdc42 is required for cytoskeletal changes involved in filipodia formation (5Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of Rac is involved in lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling (6Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rho activation results in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (7Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). These cytoskeletal changes are believed to be mediated through specific protein kinases that are activated by the GTP-bound form of the Rho family proteins (8Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All members of the Rho protein family are modified post-translationally at their carboxyl terminus. These proteins are synthesized initially with a carboxyl-terminal Cys-Axx-Axx-Xxx sequence (where Axx is usually an aliphatic amino acid, and Xxx is any amino acid), which is a signal for post-translational processing by the three sequential reactions of prenylation, truncation, and methylation (9Clarke S. Richardson C.C. Abelson J.N. Meister A. Walsh C.T. Annual Review of Biochemistry. Annual Reviews Inc., Palo Alto, CA1992: 355-386Google Scholar). For RhoA and Cdc42, the carboxyl terminus is modified to form a geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester (10Katayama M. Kawata M. Yoshida M. Horiuchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamane H.K. Farnsworth C.C. Xie H. Evans T. Howald W.N. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Clarke S. Fung B.K.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lipid modification of the carboxyl terminus is believed to be important for the interaction of Rho with both guanine nucleotide exchange proteins and with downstream effector targets (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Carboxyl methylation of proteins containing a carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine is catalyzed by a membrane-bound prenylcysteine methyltransferase (12Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16248-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the STE14 gene has been shown to encode a membrane-bound prenylcysteine methyltransferase that methylates both yeast RAS and the mating a-factor (13Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both the STE14 methyltransferase and the mammalian prenylcysteine methyltransferase activity can methylate peptide substrates that contain either a carboxyl-terminal farnesyl- or geranylgeranylcysteine (14Perez-Sala D. Gilbert B.A. Tan E.W. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Volker C. Lane P. Kwee C. Johnson M. Stock J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, much of the methyltransferase activity is localized to microsomal membranes (16Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13314-13319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but some activity has been reported in neutrophils to be associated with the plasma membrane (17Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the mammalian methyltransferase has not been purified, it is not certain if multiple forms of the enzyme are present in the membranes. Carboxyl methylation of some Rho family proteins can be stimulated in vitro by activation of the protein with GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); RhoGDI, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor protein; (His)6-Cdc42, hexahistidine-tagged Cdc42; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline, calcium- and magnesium-free; MEM, modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DZAri, 3-deazaaristeromycin; AdoHcy,S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18432-18439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by activation of Rho-dependent signaling pathways in intact cells by the addition of chemoattractants (20Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In their inactive form, the Rho proteins can form heterodimers with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor protein (RhoGDI) (21Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Unmethylated Cdc42 from brain (the brain form of Cdc42 is also known as G25K) purifies as a soluble complex with RhoGDI, and RhoGDI blocks methylation until Cdc42 is in the active GTPγS-bound conformation (22Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the conformational change brought about by guanine nucleotide binding and the subsequent change in interaction between the GTPase and RhoGDI result in translocation of the protein to the membrane, where methylation by the membrane-bound methyltransferase can occur (22Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The role of carboxyl methylation in Rho protein function has not been defined clearly. It has been reported that methylation may increase membrane attachment (23Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and interactions with specific effector proteins (25Parish C.A. Smrcka A.V. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7722-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whereas the prenylation and truncation steps are irreversible, carboxyl methylation can be reversed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester to form methanol. A number of esterase (26Tan E.W. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Dunten R.L. Wait S.J. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and protease activities (27Dunten R.L. Wait S.J. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in cell extracts have been reported to hydrolyze prenylcysteine methyl esters in vitro, but it has not been demonstrated which of these activities can act in vivo to hydrolyze methyl esters from protein of the Rho family. Several prenylcysteine analogs that inhibit carboxyl methylation also inhibit chemoattractant-stimulated signal transduction, suggesting that methylation may have a direct role in these signal tranduction pathways (28Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these compounds may disrupt chemoattractant signaling pathways by a mechanism that is independent of their inhibition of the methyltransferase (29Ding J. Lu D.J. Perez-Sala D. Ma Y.T.

To investigate carboxyl methylation of the Rho protein family in vivo, the carboxyl-terminal processing of RhoA and Cdc42 was examined in the RAW264 macrophage cell line. The data reported here show that at least 90% of RhoA and Cdc42 becomes methylated in exponentially growing RAW264 cells. Inhibiting RhoA methylation decreases half-life of the protein significantly, indicating a novel role for carboxyl methylation in protecting RhoA from degradation. A mouse monoclonal antibody, RhoA (26C4), directed against amino acid residues 120–150 of human RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used for immunoprecipitation of RhoA. An anti-Cdc42 antibody was prepared from the serum of rabbits immunized with hexahistidine-tagged Cdc42 ((His)6-Cdc42). The cDNA for the human brain form of Cdc42Hs (also known as G25K) was obtained from Susan Munemitsu. The Cdc42Hs cDNA was subcloned into the pQE plasmid, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified using the QIAexpress system (Qiagen). The (His)6-Cdc42 was purified further by chromatography using a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech). The (His)6-Cdc42 was dialyzed and applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 25 min, and the peak of (His)6-Cdc42 was pooled. An affinity column was prepared by coupling (His)6-Cdc42 to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The anti-Cdc42 antibody was affinity purified by diluting the immune serum with 3 volumes of PBS and applying the diluted sample to the affinity column. The column was washed with PBS, and bound antibody was eluted with 0.05 mglycine, pH 2.3, and 0.15 m NaCl, into 0.25 volume of 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.7. For immunoprecipitation, protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for binding the mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody, and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was used to bind the rabbit anti-Cdc42 antibody. [35S]Cysteine (stabilized, >1,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham. RAW264 cells were grown and subcultured as described previously (32Aksamit R.R. Falk W. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 2194-2199PubMed Google Scholar). For labeling cells with [35S]cysteine, confluent RAW264 cells were scraped into fresh MEM and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and plated in 75-cm2 flasks at T/10 with MEM and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and grown for 48 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with serum-free MEM containing 20 μml-cysteine. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, the medium was then replaced with 3 ml of MEM containing 20 μm [35S]cysteine (0.25 mCi), and the cells were incubated for the indicated times. The medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with 20 ml of warmed PBS. For chase experiments, the PBS rinse was removed from the flask and replaced with MEM and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (containing 0.2 mml-cystine), and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were harvested by scraping into 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and were collected by centrifugation at 250 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellets were frozen on a dry ice/methanol bath and stored at −70 °C. Frozen cell pellets were suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) containing the following protease and esterase inhibitors: 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E-64, and 20 μg/ml ebelactone B (Calbiochem). Each cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer with inhibitors and placed on ice for 10 min. The cells were then disrupted by 10 passages through a 21-gauge syringe needle, and the suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant fluid was collected, and 50 μl of 5% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol was added. The sample was heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and the solution was diluted into 2 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% deoxycholate. The solution was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fluid was collected. The antibodies (2–5 μg) were added to 0.5-ml aliquots of the supernatant fluid, and the samples were rocked at 4 °C overnight. A suspension of protein A-Sepharose (for the rabbit IgG anti-Cdc42 antibody) or protein G-agarose (for mouse IgG1 anti-RhoA antibody) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 4–5 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed four times in 1 ml of PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. For each wash, the pellet was collected by centrifugation. The bound proteins were solubilized from the beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the pellet and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 3 min at 18,000 × g, and the supernatant fluid was collected for SDS-PAGE. For two-dimensional PAGE, the bound protein was solubilized at room temperature in 30 μl of sample lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS (33O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid was applied to the isoelectric focusing tube gel and focused overnight at 500 V. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Novex) or by two-dimensional PAGE using a modification of the method of O'Farrell (33O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using preblended pH 5.0–8.0 carrier ampholytes (Ampholine, Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and treated with Enlightening (NEN Life Science Products). The gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak) at −70 °C for 4–9 days, and the developed films were scanned with a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate the protein band or spot density. For immunoblots, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. RhoA and Cdc42 were detected using anti-RhoA and anti-Cdc42 antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking buffer, and the bound antibody was localized by alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody of either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. The synthesis and post-translational processing of RhoA and Cdc42 were examined by labeling RAW264 cells with [35S]cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation of RhoA and Cdc42 from35S-labeled proteins in the cell extracts. Methylation of RhoA and Cdc42 occurs only after the carboxyl terminus is first modified by prenylation and cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide. Because carboxyl methylation neutralizes the negative charge of the carboxyl-terminal α-carboxyl group, the methylated protein has a more basic isoelectric point (pI) than the unmethylated protein, and the two forms may be resolved by isoelectric focusing. When immunoprecipitates of RhoA from [35S]cysteine-labeled cell extracts were separated by two-dimensional PAGE, two labeled proteins with pI values of approximately 5.9 and 6.35 were observed migrating with the 23 kDa of RhoA (Fig. 1). Two pI forms of Cdc42 (pI values of approximately 6.4 and 6.9) were also observed in immunoprecipitates of Cdc42, after separation by two-dimensional PAGE. These two forms of RhoA and Cdc42 were also observed with immunoblots of cell extracts (Fig. 2). As shown below, when methylation was inhibited both RhoA and Cdc42 migrated with the more acidic pI form of the protein. Identification of the methylated proteins on the two-dimensional gel was confirmed by the presence of radiolabeled methyl esters in the proteins when cells were grown with [methyl-3H]methionine. 2R. Dunten, manuscript in preparation. These results indicated that for both RhoA and Cdc42, the more basic pI protein was carboxyl methylated, and the more acidic form was unmethylated.Figure 2Immunoblots of RhoA and Cdc42 separated by two-dimensional PAGE. Extracts of RAW264 cells were solubilized and separated by two-dimensional PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and RhoA and Cdc42 were detected using either anti-Cdc42- or anti-RhoA-specific antibodies.

After 1 h of labeling, 76% of the newly synthesized RhoA was already methylated; with increasing labeling times, the radioactivity in unmethylated RhoA reached a plateau, while radioactivity in the methylated RhoA continued to increase (Fig. 1). The kinetics indicate that most of RhoA becomes methylated a short time after the protein is synthesized. When further incorporation of radioactivity was blocked by a chase with unlabeled cysteine for 18 h, the unmethylated RhoA decreased significantly, but a detectable amount still remained (Fig. 1). In contrast, the methylated RhoA decreased only slightly during this time. As a result, after a chase of 18 h with unlabeled amino acid, unmethylated RhoA decreased from 16 to 6% of the total labeled RhoA. In addition to the two spots identified as methylated and unmethylated RhoA, two minor protein spots were also observed in the RhoA immunoprecipitates. The first spot migrated directly above the methylated RhoA, and the second spot migrated between the methylated and unmethylated RhoA spots (Figs. 1 B and3). The identities of these proteins were not determined, and they may represent either further modifications of RhoA or related members of the Rho protein family which were recognized by the anti-RhoA antibody. The protein directly above the methylated RhoA also appears to be methylated because its migration shifts to the unmethylated pI when methylation was inhibited with 3-deazaaristeromycin (Fig. 3). The unprenylated RhoA precursor was not identified in these samples, but it would be expected to migrate just above the prenylated, unmethylated form of RhoA. Similar kinetics for synthesis and methylation were observed with Cdc42 (data not shown). After 1 h of labeling, only 11% of the radioactivity was in the unmethylated Cdc42; at longer times the label in unmethylated Cdc42 reached a plateau, whereas the radioactivity in methylated Cdc42 continued to increase. After an 18-h chase, the radioactivity in both unmethylated and methylated Cdc42 decreased, such that 9% of the remaining Cdc42 was unmethylated. The total decrease in labeled Cdc42 after the chase indicates that the turnover of Cdc42 was more rapid than RhoA turnover. These results indicate that RhoA and Cdc42 methylation occurs rapidly after protein synthesis, resulting in less than 10% of either protein remaining unmethylated after 18 h. The steady-state levels of methylated and unmethylated RhoA and Cdc42 were determined from immunoblots of RAW264 cell extracts after separation by two-dimensional PAGE. After transfer to the membranes, Cdc42 or RhoA was detected with either anti-Cdc42- or anti-RhoA-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). Similar to the results obtained with immunoprecipitates, each antibody detected two immunoreactive proteins that comigrated with the radiolabeled forms of Cdc42 and RhoA in the immunoprecipitates. Again, the major Cdc42 immunoreactive spot detected on the blots corresponded to the more basic, methylated, form of Cdc42, and the more acidic unmethylated form was estimated to be less than 10% of the total Cdc42 (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained using the anti-RhoA antibody, where the unmethylated RhoA comprised approximately 10% of the total immunoreactive RhoA (Fig.2 B). The immunoblots and the immunoprecipitates both gave results consistent with Cdc42 and RhoA being mostly methylated in RAW264 cells under normal growth conditions. To examine the properties of unmethylated RhoA and Cdc42, methylation was inhibited by incubating RAW264 cells with the carbocyclic adenosine analog, 3-deazaaristeromycin (DZAri), a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolyase (34Montgomery J.A. Clayton S.J. Thomas H.J. Shannon W.M. Arnett G. Bodner A.J. Kim I.-K. Cantoni G.L. Chiang P.K. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This compound has been shown previously to inhibit S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in RAW264 cells, resulting in the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) (35Aksamit R.R. Falk W. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 621-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn inhibits of a variety of methyltransferases. Although AdoHcy hydrolase is inhibited by DZAri, the concentration used here is not toxic to RAW264 cells (36Kim I.-K. Aksamit R.R. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14726-14729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein synthesis continues at a normal rate (37Aksamit R.R. Backlund Jr., P.S. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting increase in cellular AdoHcy inhibits the prenylcysteine methyltransferase, and methylated proteins are identified by a shift in migration to a more acidic pI when methylation is blocked. RAW264 cells were pretreated for 1.5 h with 100 μmDZAri to allow time for an inhibitory concentration of AdoHcy to accumulate followed by labeling with [35S]cysteine for 3 h in the presence of the inhibitor. Under these conditions, the label accumulating in unmethylated RhoA increased, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in methylated RhoA (Fig. 3 and TableI). The data are consistent with the more basic pI form of the protein being carboxyl methylated RhoA and the more acidic protein being the unmethylated form of RhoA. A similar shift in labeling of Cdc42 was also observed after treatment with DZAri (Fig. 4 and Table I). After 3 h of labeling in the presence of DZAri, 69% of the newly synthesized RhoA was unmethylated compared with only 10% unmethylated RhoA in control cells (Table I). After a chase for 18 h with unlabeled cysteine in the presence of DZAri, the radioactivity in unmethylated RhoA decreased, but the label in methylated RhoA remained fairly constant, resulting in a decrease in total RhoA radioactivity (Table I).Table IInhibition of RhoA and Cdc42 carboxyl methylation by 3-deazaaristeromycinRadioactivity (total spot density)1-aRadioactivity was determined from autofluorograms of immunoprecipitates separated on two-dimensional gels, shown in Figs. 3(RhoA) and 4 (Cdc42).Control (3-h label)+DZAri (3-h label)Control (18-h chase)+DZAri (18-h chase)RhoA Unmethylated1949301730 Methylated1,710425695408 Total1,9041,355712438 % Unmethylated106927CDC42 Unmethylated503341626 Methylated763673329265 Total8131,007345291 % Unmethylated633591-a Radioactivity was determined from autofluorograms of immunoprecipitates separated on two-dimensional gels, shown in Figs. 3(RhoA) and 4 (Cdc42). Open table in a new tab Cdc42 methylation was only partially inhibited in the presence of DZAri, resulting in 33% of the labeled Cdc42 being unmethylated after 3 h of labeling (Fig. 4 and Table I) compared with 6% unmethylated Cdc42 in control cells. After a chase period in the presence of DZAri, unmethylated Cdc42 decreased to 9% of the total labeled Cdc42. Therefore, the increase in cellular AdoHcy inhibited RhoA methylation to a greater extent than the inhibition of Cdc42 methylation. The effect of carboxyl methylation on protein turnover was examined for RhoA and Cdc42 by measuring their degradation under conditions where the proteins were either methylated or unmethylated. RAW264 cells were labeled with [35S]cysteine followed by a chase period with unlabeled cysteine to block further labeling of newly synthesized protein, and the radioactivity in RhoA or Cdc42 was determined over time (Fig. 5). Under control conditions, approximately 90% of the labeled RhoA and Cdc42 was methylated at the start of the chase period (Table I). Because these proteins were more than 90% methylated, the observed protein turnover in control cells is approximately equal to the turnover for the methylated forms of RhoA and Cdc42. The apparent half-life of RhoA in control cells was approximately 31 h (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of cells with DZAri inhibited methylation such that 69% of radiolabeled RhoA was unmethylated after 3 h of labeling (Table I). Inhibiting methylation increased RhoA turnover significantly, causing the apparent half-life to decrease from 31 to 12 h (Fig. 5 A). The turnover of total cell protein was determined from precipitation of total proteins with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid from cell extracts of control and DZAri-treated cells, and no significant change in total protein turnover was observed with DZAri treatment (data not shown). Like RhoA, Cdc42 was methylated rapidly under control conditions (TableI), and the half-life of methylated Cdc42 was approximately 15 h under these conditions (Fig. 5 B). The half-life of methylated Cdc42 was significantly shorter than the 31-h half-life of methylated RhoA. Treatment of cells with DZAri resulted in only 33% of the radiolabeled Cdc42 remaining unmethylated after 3 h (Table I), and only a small increase in Cdc42 turnover was observed, decreasing the apparent half-life from approximately 15 to 11 h (Fig.5 B). However, 67% of the labeled Cdc42 was still methylated under these conditions, so the observed Cdc42 turnover was equal to the sum of the rates for both methylated and unmethylated Cdc42. The results indicated that incubation of cells with DZAri increased the turnover of RhoA and Cdc42, and the increased turnover was correlated with the inhibition of methylation. This study examined the synthesis and methylation of RhoA and Cdc42 in RAW264 cells, and the results demonstrated an increased turnover of RhoA when methylation of the carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine was blocked. Under the normal growth conditions, both RhoA and Cdc42 were approximately 90–95% methylated (Fig. 2), and the kinetics of methylation indicated that both proteins are methylated a short time after their synthesis (Fig. 1). The lag between synthesis and methylation appeared to be a slightly longer for RhoA than for Cdc42, since at early labeling times unmethylated RhoA accumulated to a greater extent than the unmethylated Cdc42 (24% unmethylated RhoAversus 11% unmethylated Cdc42 after 1 h). However, after an 18-h chase period, approximately equal proportions of RhoA and Cdc42 were methylated. Raising the cellular AdoHcy concentration inhibited methylation of RhoA and Cdc42, but the inhibition was greater for RhoA than for Cdc42 (Figs. 3 and 4). The reason for the difference in inhibition is not clear. A previous report on the mechanism of prenylcysteine methyltransferase in mammalian membranes reported that the enzyme has an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, where AdoHcy is a mixed type inhibitor with respect to the methylation peptide substrate (38Shi Y.-Q. Rando R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so AdoHcy may be a better inhibitor with RhoA as the methylation substrate. The preferential inhibition of RhoA methylation could also indicate the presence of two distinct methyltransferases in the membranes, with each one having a different susceptibility to inhibition by AdoHcy. Regardless of the detailed mechanism, the results indicate that raising AdoHcy levels in vivo can preferentially inhibit the methylation of specific protein substrates. Although methylation of RhoA and Cdc42 occurred rapidly after synthesis, a small fraction of labeled RhoA and Cdc42 remained unmethylated even after an 18-h chase. The persistence of radioactivity in the unmethylated protein suggests the presence of a small pool of unmethylated RhoA and Cdc42 which is either methylated very slowly or is never methylated. This pool of unmethylated protein could be caused by localization of the protein to a separate compartment that is inaccessible to the methyltransferase. Alternatively, unmethylated protein may be generated by the slow removal of methyl esters from a previously methylated protein. The turnover of Cdc42 was significantly faster than RhoA turnover. In control cells, the half-life of Cdc42 was approximately 15 h, whereas the half-life of RhoA was approximately 31 h. The half-life for mammalian proteins can range from minutes to hundreds of hours (39Jennissen H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), so the half-lives of both RhoA and Cdc42 are within an intermediate range for mammalian proteins. Protein degradation is a complex process, and many structural features can influence protein turnover. Protein turnover can be regulated by covalent modifications, and several covalent modifications have been shown to increase degradation of specific proteins (40Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6323-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For RhoA, ADP-ribosylation of the protein by the Clostridium difficile toxin A has been shown to lower the level of RhoA dramatically after an overnight incubation (41Dillon S.T. Rubin E.J. Yakubovich M. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Feig L.A. Gilbert R.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), causing the loss of polymerized actin fibers and rounding up of the cells. The data presented here demonstrate significantly faster degradation of RhoA when the protein is unmethylated, indicating a role for carboxyl methylation in protecting the protein from degradation. For Cdc42, protein turnover was increased only slightly by raising the level of AdoHcy; however, a large fraction of labeled Cdc42 was still methylated under these conditions (Fig. 4 and Table I). The decrease in half-life was specific for proteins that were carboxyl methylated because total protein degradation did not change. In addition to the Rho proteins, a number of other signal-transducing GTP-binding proteins contain a carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine methyl ester, including members of the Ras family and the G-protein and transducin γ-subunits. Therefore, prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation may be an important mechanism to regulate the turnover of these proteins as well. Methylation could decrease RhoA degradation by several mechanisms. Methylation could decrease protein degradation by inhibiting the activity of carboxypeptidases. Hrycyna and Clarke (42Hrycyna C.A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10457-10464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported a soluble yeast carboxypeptidase that can slowly degrade peptides ending in a carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine, and they proposed that carboxyl methylation may “cap” the carboxyl terminus of yeast RAS, making the protein less susceptible to degradation by these enzymes. Methylation may also cause the protein to bind more tightly to specific proteins or to membrane components, resulting in a conformation that is more resistant to proteolysis. Alternatively, the unmethylated carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine residues may be a signal for degradation which is recognized by specific proteases, or it may direct transport of the protein to a site for degradation, such as the lysosomes or proteosomes. Because much of the prenylcysteine methyltransferase activity is localized to the microsomal fraction (16Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13314-13319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), methylation may be required for normal transport and localization of the newly synthesized Rho proteins. A precedent for methylation altering peptide transport is the yeast a-factor, where methylation of the a-factor by the STE14 methyltransferase is required for efficient transport of the peptide out of the cell by the STE6 transporter protein (43Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The effect of methylation on RhoA turnover suggests that RhoA levels in vivo may be influenced by competition between methyltransferase and the methylesterase activities. Methionine depletion would decrease the level of AdoMet and result in decreased protein methylation, which would increase degradation of the Rho proteins. In this manner, the level of RhoA and related proteins could be regulated by the cellular methionine pool. Unmethylated RhoA could also be generated by removal of the methyl ester by an esterase from a previously methylated protein. Therefore, activation of a methylesterase could also increase the amount of unmethylated protein, leading to increased protein degradation. Previous studies have proposed that carboxyl methylation of Rho family of GTP-binding proteins is important for their function in signal transduction. The results presented here provide evidence that carboxyl methylation has a novel role in increasing the half-life RhoA and related proteins. In this role, methylation may not be directly involved in the signal transduction pathway, but methylation may influence signaling by changing the level of RhoA. Studies of additional proteins will be required to determine if the carboxyl methylation of carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine is a general mechanism for altering the degradation of these signal-transducing proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2007227478,"Drosophila heat shock factor (HSF) binds to specific sequence elements of heat shock genes and can activate their transcription 200-fold. Though HSF has an acidic activation domain, the mechanistic details of heat shock gene activation remain undefined. Here we report that HSF interacts directly with the general transcription factor TBP (TATA-box binding protein), and these two factors bind cooperatively to heat shock promoters. A third factor that binds heat shock promoters, GAGA factor, also interacts with HSF and further stabilizes HSF binding to heat shock elements (HSEs). The interaction of HSF and TBP is explored in some detail here and is shown to be mediated by residues in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of HSF. This HSF/TBP interaction can be specifically disrupted by competition with the potent acidic transcriptional activator VP16. We further show that the acidic domain of the largest subunit of Drosophila RNA polymerase II (Pol II) associates with TBP in vitro and is specifically displaced from TBP upon addition of HSF. The region of TBP that mediates both HSF and Pol II acidic domain binding maps to the conserved carboxyl-terminal repeats and depends on at least one of the TBP residues known to be contacted by VP16 and to be critical for transcription activation. We discuss these findings in the context of a model in which HSF triggers hsp70 transcription by freeing the hsp70 promoter-paused Pol II from the constraints on elongation caused by the affinity of Pol II for general transcription factors.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that bind tightly to heat shock elements upstream of the hsp70 promoter. HSF binding is concomitant with a rapid and vigorous (200-fold) increase in the rate of transcription. The uninduced heat shock promoter is primed for rapid activation. This promoter is contained in a chromatin structure that is open and easily accessible and contains one paused Pol II per promoter (3Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A rate-limiting step in transcription appears to be the escape of this promoter-paused Pol II into productive elongation. Even after heat shock, when Pol II fires from the hsp70 promoter every 6 s, transient Pol II pausing can still be detected on hsp70 (4Giardina C. Perez R.M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5O'Brien T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5285-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) such that Pol II progression through this specific region at the 5′ end of the transcription unit remains rate-limiting.The relative generality of transcriptional control at the level of paused polymerase (6Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that many upstream activators can act to stimulate escape of the paused polymerase into a productive elongation mode. How might this happen? We favor a model in which the paused polymerase is restrained via its strong association with the promoter and general transcription factors. In this scenario, polymerase recruitment is vigorous while escape (beyond the pause) is limiting. The activator could act to increase the rate of Pol II escape by modifying the polymerase complex to produce an elongationally competent form or perhaps more simply by competing with Pol II for one or more binding sites on the general transcription apparatus. We have demonstrated previously that Pol II can bind TBP in vitroand can be displaced from TBP by competition with specific transcriptional activator proteins (VP16 and CTF1) (7Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).TBP is a good candidate for a heat shock factor target given its constitutive presence on hsp70 (4Giardina C. Perez R.M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and given the close proximity of the TATA element to the proximal HSF binding sites. Also, the potent acidic activator VP16 has been shown to associate with TBP (9Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1991; 351: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and it is known that acidic activators like GAL4 can activate an hsp70 promoter in transgenic fly lines (10Fischer J.A. Giniger E. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 332: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Finally, the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) heptad repeats and the acidic domain (the so-called “H” domain) of RNA polymerase have been shown to interact genetically with each other (8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Nonet M. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both have been shown to bind to TBP in vitro (8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Usheva A. Moldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Horbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In our hands, the H-domain/TBP interaction is stronger than the CTD/TBP interaction.TBP-binding is only one of a variety of activities displayed by transcriptional activators. VP16 has been implicated in the recruitment of TFIIH (13Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Since TFIIH has both DNA helicase activity and CTD-specific kinase activity, this suggests a role for activators in promoter melting and/or CTD phosphorylation. Such a modification of the polymerase complex might also play a role in the progression of the paused polymerase into productive elongation. VP16 has also been shown to associate with TFIIB in vitro (14Lin Y.S. Ha I. Moldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The multiple interactions of activators with basal factors are consistent with multiple layers of activator-mediated regulation and the synergistic effect of activators (15Kakidani H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 52: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A fraction of TBP is complexed in vivo, as TFIID, with at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which also have been implicated as promoter-specific activator targets (reviewed in Ref. 16Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The TBP core of TFIID also serves as the foundation for assembly of the basal transcription apparatus (17Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TBP is, therefore, capable of many interactions, some of which must occur simultaneously. This may be possible if these interactions are specific for small portions of the TBP surface (as has been shown for several basal factor-TBP interactions, see Ref. 17Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), allowing TBP to support additional activator contacts. Additionally, any of these protein-protein interactions may be quite dynamic, such that multiple factors could bind to the same site on the TBP surface.Here we present first tests of a simple “competition” hypothesis for heat shock gene regulation. Affinity chromatography assays demonstrate that HSF can bind to TBP in vitro and that this binding is competitive with the acidic H-domain of RNA polymerase. Portions of HSF and TBP that are required for this association are mapped. Competitive binding assays also suggest that HSF associates with TBP in a fashion similar to the potent acidic activator VP16. Additionally, it is shown that HSF and TBP bind cooperatively to heat shock promoters and that GAGA factor further stabilizes the HSF-HSE complex.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that the heat shock gene-specific activator, HSF, binds efficiently to the general transcription factor TBP in vitro. In these experiments, comparable fractions of input TBP were recovered by HSF affinity chromatography using either Drosophila nuclear extracts or purified recombinant TBP. A second general factor TFIIB, which also has been reported to bind acidic activators (20Roberts G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), shows only weak affinity for HSF. The HSF/TBP interaction appears to influence the association of these factors with their DNA targets, in that we observe that purified HSF and TBP bind cooperatively to heat shock promoters in vitro. Likewise, GAGA factor, another component of the hsp70 and hsp26 promoters, also aids the binding of HSF to the hsp70 promoter in vitro. Both TBP and GAGA factor occupy these heat shock promoters prior to induction by heat shock and are thus positioned to facilitate HSF recruitment. These interactions, coupled with the open chromatin configuration of heat shock promoters (33Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), may help to explain the fact that HSF binding to HSEs in vivo is dependent on the presence of intact TFIID and GAGA binding sites (34Shopland L.S. Hirayoshi K. Fernandes M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, these interactions of HSF with TBP and GAGA factor may stabilize promoter associations of these factors during multiple rounds of activated transcription when proposed contacts of these factors with RNA polymerase II and other components of the basal machinery are likely to be disrupted during each cycle of transcription.The binding of HSF to TBP is mediated by residues in both the DNA-binding/trimerization domain and in the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of HSF. This binding is targeted to the conserved carboxyl-terminal repeats of TBP. The binding of HSF to TBP is similar in both avidity and character to the binding of the acidic transcription activator VP16 to TBP. Both interactions are affected by a specific mutation in TBP (L114K). Moreover, VP16 and HSF compete for binding to TBP.We have also shown that an acidic domain (H) of DrosophilaRNA polymerase II binds to TBP in vitro in a manner similar to the polymerase/TBP interaction previously reported in yeast (8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This interaction is disrupted upon addition of HSF, suggesting that polymerase and HSF can compete for the same site on TBP. This site on TBP also maps to the conserved TBP carboxyl-terminal repeats and is specifically reduced by the L114K mutation. We suggest that some of the same polymerase-general factor affinities that facilitate recruitment of Pol II to the promoter, like the TBP interaction seen here, also act as a “tether” that hinders polymerase escape into functional elongation and thus contribute to the formation of paused polymerase. These results provide the basis for a simple competition model for hsp70 transcriptional activation in which HSF frees the hsp70 paused polymerase from one component of the constraint on elongation caused by affinity of polymerase for general transcription factors at the core promoter.A model for activated transcription must, of course, account for multiple rounds of transcription. If HSF displaces a critical Pol II contact by binding to the core promoter complex, HSF may then occupy a site that is important for the next round of polymerase recruitment. How does the next Pol II molecule enter? Pol II recruitment appears to be accomplished via multiple known general factor contacts, including interactions involving TFIIF (35Flores O. Moldonado E. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CTD with TBP (11Nonet M. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and polymerase with the promoter DNA itself. This recruitment rate would have to be much faster than Pol II escape to account for the observed full occupancy of the uninduced promoter by paused Pol II (4Giardina C. Perez R.M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We propose that the TBP-binding activity of HSF increases the efficiency of the rate-limiting step (polymerase escape) while having a negligible inhibitory effect on the inherently fast polymerase recruitment provided by the multiple polymerase contacts of this strong promoter.While this competition model is attractive in its simplicity, it does not exclude other mechanisms that might act alternatively or additionally to increase the rate of escape of Pol II from the pause site into productive elongation. For example, HSF may facilitate recruitment of other general factors, which could modify the promoter-paused Pol II and thereby affect its escape to productive elongation. Furthermore, we have examined here only one of what may be several common contacts of HSF and Pol II with general factors.Eukaryotic transcription has many steps that can be fine tuned to the needs of the thousands of differentially regulated promoters. Many distinct regulatory steps have been documented, including TFIID-recruitment (36Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), promoter melting (40Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and elongational control after promoter escape (41Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, the slow step in transcription must be the target of regulatory factors that either enhance or inhibit one of many specific molecular interactions required for establishing a productive transcription complex. The fact that regulatory factors and RNA polymerase interact with multiple general transcription factors provides the potential for modulation at any of multiple distinct steps.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that bind tightly to heat shock elements upstream of the hsp70 promoter. HSF binding is concomitant with a rapid and vigorous (200-fold) increase in the rate of transcription. The uninduced heat shock promoter is primed for rapid activation. This promoter is contained in a chromatin structure that is open and easily accessible and contains one paused Pol II per promoter (3Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A rate-limiting step in transcription appears to be the escape of this promoter-paused Pol II into productive elongation. Even after heat shock, when Pol II fires from the hsp70 promoter every 6 s, transient Pol II pausing can still be detected on hsp70 (4Giardina C. Perez R.M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5O'Brien T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5285-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) such that Pol II progression through this specific region at the 5′ end of the transcription unit remains rate-limiting. The relative generality of transcriptional control at the level of paused polymerase (6Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that many upstream activators can act to stimulate escape of the paused polymerase into a productive elongation mode. How might this happen? We favor a model in which the paused polymerase is restrained via its strong association with the promoter and general transcription factors. In this scenario, polymerase recruitment is vigorous while escape (beyond the pause) is limiting. The activator could act to increase the rate of Pol II escape by modifying the polymerase complex to produce an elongationally competent form or perhaps more simply by competing with Pol II for one or more binding sites on the general transcription apparatus. We have demonstrated previously that Pol II can bind TBP in vitroand can be displaced from TBP by competition with specific transcriptional activator proteins (VP16 and CTF1) (7Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TBP is a good candidate for a heat shock factor target given its constitutive presence on hsp70 (4Giardina C. Perez R.M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and given the close proximity of the TATA element to the proximal HSF binding sites. Also, the potent acidic activator VP16 has been shown to associate with TBP (9Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1991; 351: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and it is known that acidic activators like GAL4 can activate an hsp70 promoter in transgenic fly lines (10Fischer J.A. Giniger E. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 332: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Finally, the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) heptad repeats and the acidic domain (the so-called “H” domain) of RNA polymerase have been shown to interact genetically with each other (8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Nonet M. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both have been shown to bind to TBP in vitro (8Xiao H. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Usheva A. Moldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Horbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In our hands, the H-domain/TBP interaction is stronger than the CTD/TBP interaction. TBP-binding is only one of a variety of activities displayed by transcriptional activators. VP16 has been implicated in the recruitment of TFIIH (13Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Since TFIIH has both DNA helicase activity and CTD-specific kinase activity, this suggests a role for activators in promoter melting and/or CTD phosphorylation. Such a modification of the polymerase complex might also play a role in the progression of the paused polymerase into productive elongation. VP16 has also been shown to associate with TFIIB in vitro (14Lin Y.S. Ha I. Moldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The multiple interactions of activators with basal factors are consistent with multiple layers of activator-mediated regulation and the synergistic effect of activators (15Kakidani H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 52: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A fraction of TBP is complexed in vivo, as TFIID, with at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which also have been implicated as promoter-specific activator targets (reviewed in Ref. 16Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The TBP core of TFIID also serves as the foundation for assembly of the basal transcription apparatus (17Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TBP is, therefore, capable of many interactions, some of which must occur simultaneously. This may be possible if these interactions are specific for small portions of the TBP surface (as has been shown for several basal factor-TBP interactions, see Ref. 17Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), allowing TBP to support additional activator contacts. Additionally, any of these protein-protein interactions may be quite dynamic, such that multiple factors could bind to the same site on the TBP surface. Here we present first tests of a simple “competition” hypothesis for heat shock gene regulation. Affinity chromatography assays demonstrate that HSF can bind to TBP in vitro and that this binding is competitive with the acidic H-domain of RNA polymerase. Portions of HSF and TBP that are required for this association are mapped. Competitive binding assays also suggest that HSF associates with TBP in a fashion similar to the potent acidic activator VP16. Additionally, it is shown that HSF and TBP bind cooperatively to heat shock promoters and that GAGA factor further stabilizes the HSF-HSE complex. DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that the heat shock gene-specific activator, HSF, binds efficiently to the general transcription factor TBP in vitro. In these experiments, comparable fractions of input TBP were recovered by HSF affinity chromatography using either Drosophila nuclear extracts or purified recombinant TBP. A second general factor TFIIB, which also has been reported to bind acidic activators (20Roberts G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), shows only weak affinity for HSF. The HSF/TBP interaction appears to influence the association of these factors with their DNA targets, in that we observe that purified HSF and TBP bind cooperatively to heat shock promoters in vitro. Likewise, GAGA factor, another component of the hsp70 and hsp26 promoters, also aids the binding of HSF to the hsp70 promoter in vitro. Both TBP and GAGA factor occupy these heat shock promoters prior to induction by heat shock and are thus positioned to facilitate HSF recruitment. These interactions, coupled with the open chromatin configuration of heat shock promoters (33Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), may help to explain the fact that HSF binding to HSEs in vivo is dependent on the presence of intact TFIID and GAGA binding sites (34Shopland L.S. Hirayoshi K. Fernandes M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, these interactions of HSF with TBP and GAGA factor may stabilize promoter associations of these factors during multiple rounds of activated transcription when proposed contacts of these factors with RNA polymerase II and other components of the basal machinery are likely to be disrupted during each cycle of transcription.The binding of HSF to TBP is mediated by residues in both the DNA-binding/trimerization domain and in the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of HSF. This binding is targeted to the conserved carboxyl-terminal repeats of TBP. The binding of HSF to TBP is similar in both avidity and character to the binding of the acidic transcription activator VP16 to TBP. Both interactions are affected by a specific mutation in TBP (L114K). Moreover, VP16 and HSF compete for binding to TBP.We have also shown that an acidic domain (H) of DrosophilaRNA polymerase II binds to TBP in vitro in a manner similar to the polymerase/TBP interaction previously reported in yeast (8Xiao H.

BCL3 is a nuclear IκB that can inhibit or enhance the binding of NF-κB p50 or p52 homodimers to consensus DNA-binding (κB) sequences or form a κB-binding complex with homodimers. To study BCL3 function, we have used gel shift analysis and tagged protein and tagged DNA coprecipitation analyses. Our results show that at intermediate ratios of BCL3 to p52 all observed phosphoforms of BCL3 are able to form a κB-binding complex with p52 homodimers. At low BCL3/p52 ratios, BCL3 increases the rate of p52 homodimer binding to κB sites in the presence of nonconsensus DNA and dissociates from the complex. At high BCL3/p52 ratios, BCL3 forms a higher order inhibitory complex with p52 homodimers. All of these effects depend on BCL3 phosphorylation and relative concentration.

These homodimers may function to competitively inhibit κB binding by transactivating NF-κB dimers. BCL3 can 1) remove homodimers from κB sites so that transactivating NF-κB dimers can bind and act as an antirepressor (28Franzoso G. Bours V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U.

Thus, BCL3 may repress transcription indirectly by increasing κB-site occupancy by p50 or p52 homodimers or it can directly or indirectly activate transcription. Whether or not BCL3 activity is regulated in the cell is not known. In this work, we have studied the mechanisms by which BCL3 modulates DNA binding by p52 homodimers. We have asked the following questions: 1) which regions of BCL3 are phosphorylated; 2) how does BCL3 phosphorylation affect its ability to form a BCL3-(p52)2-κB complex; 3) which region(s) of BCL3 are necessary to inhibit p52 homodimer binding to DNA; 4) what is the mechanism of BCL3 inhibition of homodimer binding to DNA; and 5) what is the mechanism of BCL3 enhancement of the formation of (p52)2-κB complexes? Our results show that BCL3 can have a variety of effects on p52 homodimer binding to DNA, depending on BCL3 concentration and phosphorylation. The results are consistent with a model in which BCL3 has a versatile role in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. H6BCL3 and H6BCL3ΔN plasmids have been described previously (5Zhang Q. Didonato J.A. Karin M. McKeithan T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3915-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the plasmids pMT2Tp52, pMT2TBCL3 (wtBCL3), and pMT2TBCL3ΔC were a gift from U. Siebenlist (7Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Seibenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Antibodies to p52 (I-18) or to the C terminus of BCL3 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Antiserum to the N terminus of BCL3 has been described previously (5Zhang Q. Didonato J.A. Karin M. McKeithan T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3915-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal BCL3 ARD antiserum was made by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase-ARD fusion protein (Josman Laboratories, Napa, CA). The κB probe used for all studies was prepared by annealing a 27-mer κB oligonucleotide (5′-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3′) to a 5′-biotinylated 21-mer primer oligonucleotide (5′-biotin-AAGGAGAGGGGAATTCCCCTG-3′) and filling with dNTPs and Klenow enzyme. For labeled probe, [α-32P]dCTP was substituted for dCTP. COS7 cells (ATCC) were maintained as described (5Zhang Q. Didonato J.A. Karin M. McKeithan T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3915-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and transfected using a Eurogentec Cellject electroporator with pulse values set at 300 V, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance. The transfection buffer consisted of protein-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 5–10 μg of plasmid, and 4 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (34Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6739-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Typically, 5 × 106 cells were electroporated in 800 μl of media. For32P labeling of H6BCL3, transfected cells were lifted 2 days after transfection, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, washed once in serum-free, phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), and then incubated in 1 ml of this medium for 10 min prior to the addition of 0.3–0.6 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products). Cells were incubated in this medium for 2–3 h, washed twice in medium, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described below.32P-H6BCL3 was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose beads as described below. All centrifugations were performed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (5415 C) unless otherwise indicated. Cells were washed 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis. BCL3 was prepared in whole cell extracts; cells were lysed in modified Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (buffer L) (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors (0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm aprotinin)); debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, and extracts were stored under liquid nitrogen. For initial phosphorylation studies, BCL3 lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm NaF, 2 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA). p52 was prepared as a nuclear extract; cytosol was solubilized in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors); nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, resuspended in hypertonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 40 min; and nuclear debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Typical whole cell and nuclear extracts contained 5 μg/μl total protein. SDS-PAGE gels were electrotransfered to PVDF membranes (Promega). Western blotting and chemiluminescent detection were performed per manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Tropix). Typically, 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Sigma) per mg of total protein in control or BCL3-transfected cellular extract was incubated in CIP reaction buffer (60 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, protease inhibitors, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF) for 1 h at room temperature. EDTA and NaF were added at different time points to inhibit CIP activity. For mock-treated BCL3 samples, CIP was boiled or incubated in EDTA for 20 min prior to use. Nickel-NTA beads (Qiagen) were preequilibrated in buffer L plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mm imidazole. Typically, 1 ml of H6BCL3 in whole cell extracts and 12 ml of buffer L were incubated with 100 μl of nickel-NTA beads on ice for 2 h with gentle rocking. Beads were pelleted and then washed 6 times (8 min each) with 5 ml of buffer L supplemented with 4 mm imidazole before H6BCL3 was eluted in 400 μl of buffer L with 90 mm imidazole. For exhaustive protease digestions, total protein in BCL3-transfected cell extracts was diluted to 1 μg/μl in buffer L and then boiled in 1% SDS and 5 mmDTT (purified BCL3 was not diluted). After cooling to room temperature, 5 μg of LysC (Sigma) or GluC (Sigma) per μg of substrate protein was added. Digestion reactions were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2 h before the addition of 0.1 × volume of 4 × sample loading buffer, boiling, separation by SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer to a PVDF membrane, autoradiography of 32P-labeled peptides, and Western blotting. For protease digestion of native BCL3, purified BCL3 was incubated in digestion buffer (70 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) and titrated with LysC protease (0.5–5 μg of LysC per μg of purified BCL3). Digestion reactions were stopped after 1 h by boiling in sample loading buffer, and peptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. These were performed as described previously (5Zhang Q. Didonato J.A. Karin M. McKeithan T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3915-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that sonicated placental DNA or salmon testes DNA was used as nontarget competitor DNA to reduce probe binding by nonspecific DNA-binding proteins, the final concentration of NaCl was 60 mm, and EDTA was added to the binding buffer to 4 mm when CIP-treated or mock-treated BCL3 was added to the binding reaction. For a standard gel shift assay, proteins were preincubated with competitor DNA in binding buffer (60 mmNaCl, 1–4 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 30 min before the addition of an excess (1 pmol/sample) of 32P-labeled κB probe and then allowed to equilibrate for 40 min before electrophoresis was performed in a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA. All reactions were performed at room temperature. 0.8 pmol of 5′-biotinylated κB probe per sample was incubated and rocked in 100 μl of binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01 mg/ml sonicated placental DNA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 30 min with 2 μl of avidin-coated Dynal beads. Beads were pelleted and washed once in 100 μl of binding buffer and then incubated with p52-transfected or untransfected nuclear extracts in binding buffer for 30 min. Beads were pelleted, resuspended in binding buffer, and aliquoted into sample tubes before the addition of BCL3-transfected or untransfected whole cell extracts. The BCL3 binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min; proteins were eluted from pelleted beads by boiling in sample loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. These were performed at room temperature. Typically, 300 μl of H6BCL3 in whole cell extracts was immobilized on an equal volume of nickel-NTA beads, washed once with CIP buffer (in the absence of NaF and EDTA), and incubated in CIP buffer with CIP for 45 min. Beads were pelleted and washed extensively in buffer L supplemented with 10 mm NaF, and then washed twice in binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT) before the addition of p52-transfected or untransfected nuclear extracts in binding buffer. After 40–60 min, the solution was aliquoted into separate sample tubes; beads were pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 2 min. Then wtBCL3-transfected and untransfected whole cell extract, diluted to 60 mm NaCl in binding buffer, was added to a final volume of 200 μl and allowed to incubate and rock gently for 3 h. Finally, beads were pelleted; precipitated proteins were eluted with elution buffer (200 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT); and samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by boiling in sample buffer. BCL3, with a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa, migrates in SDS-PAGE as a major band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa and two minor bands of approximately 55 and 65 kDa, when derived from transiently transfected COS7 cells (Fig.1 A). COS7 cell-derived BCL3 comigrates with BCL3 derived from a variety of cell lines (not shown). Graded dephosphorylation of BCL3 with CIP, as described under “Materials and Methods,” results in a shift of the 65- and 60-kDa forms to more rapidly migrating forms, indicating that BCL3 is constitutively phosphorylated, consistent with previous results (8Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Caamano J.H. Perez P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,32Nolan G.P. Fujita T. Bhatia K. Huppi C. Liou H. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the 60-kDa phosphoform of BCL3 is detectable in most preparations, as shown in lane 4, and only preparations with low levels of 55- and 65-kDa forms were used for functional studies, unless otherwise indicated. BCL3 subjected to graded dephosphorylation has several intermediate phosphoforms, which indicates that BCL3 is extensively phosphorylated. We will refer to the phosphorylated 60-kDa form of BCL3 as “BCL3P” and to the CIP-dephosphorylated 55-kDa form of BCL3 as “BCL3D.” The BCL3 protein is composed of 16% (72 of 446 amino acids) serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues; 11 are in the N-terminal domain, 33 in the ARD, and 22 in the C-terminal domain (12Ohno H. Takimoto G. McKeithan T.W. Cell. 1990; 60: 991-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Serine alone represents 26% of C-terminal domain amino acids. To determine which regions of BCL3 are phosphorylated, we used one-dimensional peptide mapping of proteolytically cleaved proteins. The BCL3 C-terminal peptide product of LysC protease digestion, Lys353-Ser446, is predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa (for the unphosphorylated peptide); this peptide spans the C-terminal domain and includes 6 amino acids of the 7th ankyrin repeat. The C-terminal peptide product of GluC digestion, Glu277-Ser446, which includes the C-terminal domain and ankyrin repeats 5, 6, and 7, is predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 18 kDa. Glutamic acid residue Glu336 was not vulnerable to GluC digestion in any of our studies. BCL3P in whole cell extracts was subjected to graded CIP dephosphorylation and exhaustive digestion with proteases. Fig.1 B shows a Western blot of C-terminal peptides of these samples. Dephosphorylated C-terminal peptides are not easily detected; they may be poorly retained by PVDF membranes. The results show that the intermediate phosphoforms of BCL3 C-terminal peptides have distinctive mobilities, and the effect of dephosphorylation on peptide migration is similar to that seen with full-length BCL3 (compare Fig.1, A and B). We conclude that the C-terminal domain of BCL3, like the C-terminal domains of IκBα (10Sachdev S. Rottjakob E.M. Diehl J.A. Hannink M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 811-823PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IκBβ (35Chu Z. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is extensively and constitutively phosphorylated. To determine whether or not all of BCL3 phosphorylation is at the C-terminal domain, 32P-labeled, nickel-NTA bead-purified BCL3 was subjected to graded LysC digestion. In native form, BCL3P is highly resistant to LysC and GluC proteases, and complete digestion was not observed. The major labeled peptides detected by autoradiography (Fig. 1 C, center panel) comigrate with BCL3 C-terminal peptides detected by Western blotting (left panel). No labeled bands are detectable which comigrate with ARD peptides (right panel). To ensure complete proteolysis of BCL3, 32P-labeled purified BCL3 samples were boiled in 1% SDS prior to being subjected to exhaustive protease digestion. In Fig. 1 D, the left panel shows a Western blot with undigested (lanes 1 and 4), LysC-digested (lanes 2 and 5), or GluC-digested (lane 3) BCL3 proteins, blotted with antibody to the BCL3 C terminus. 32P-Labeled peptides were detected by autoradiography of the same membrane, shown in the right panel. A sample containing predominantly BCL3P is shown in lane 1; there is a low but detectable amount of BCL3D. A histidine-tagged BCL3 construct lacking the N-terminal domain (H6BCL3ΔN) is shown in lane 4. The C-terminal peptide seen in lane 5 is the unphosphorylated H6BCL3ΔN C-terminal peptide; H6BCL3ΔN is poorly phosphorylated, and phosphorylated peptides are not detectable in reproductions of this Western blot, although they are detectable by autoradiography of32P-labeled peptides. The results show that the major 32P-labeled peptides visualized by autoradiography comigrate with C-terminal peptides detected by Western blotting, for both full-length and N-terminally truncated BCL3. In some experiments but not others, faint32P-labeled peptides are detectable that do not comigrate with C-terminal peptides. Their source is unknown. We conclude that most of BCL3 phosphorylation is at the C-terminal domain. Previous results have indicated that BCL3 inhibition of p50 or p52 homodimer binding to κB sites may be phosphorylation- and concentration-dependent. In gel shift assays, mammalian cell-derived BCL3 can form a BCL3-homodimer-κB complex (7Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Seibenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), but bacterially derived BCL3 inhibits p50 homodimer binding to κB sites (4Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

To study the concentration and phosphorylation dependence of the formation of a BCL3-(p52)2-κB complex, we performed gel shift assays in which p52 was titrated with different phosphoforms of BCL3. Antiserum to the N terminus of BCL3 was added to decrease the mobility of BCL3-(p52)2-κB complexes. A typical result is shown in Fig.2 A. BCL3P apparently has no ability to inhibit p52 homodimer binding to probe, even at high ratios of BCL3P/p52 (lane 11), whereas BCL3D is an efficient inhibitor (lane 13). At low BCL3/p52 ratios, p52 homodimer binding to probe is enhanced in the presence of BCL3P (lanes 2 and 5) but not in the presence of BCL3D (lanes 4 and 7). Similar results were obtained without BCL3 N-terminal antiserum and with nickel-NTA bead-purified H6BCL3 (not shown). This complex pattern of BCL3 activity indicates that phosphorylation may have several effects. The data shown below support a comprehensive model of BCL3 action which is presented under “Discussion.” Recent work indicates that the IκB C-terminal domain is necessary to inhibit NF-κB binding to DNA under some circumstances. The C-terminal domain of mammalian IκBα (18Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of the avian IκBα homolog p40 (10Sachdev S. Rottjakob E.M. Diehl J.A. Hannink M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 811-823PubMed Google Scholar) is required for these proteins to inhibit κB binding by NF-κB. In contrast, the ARD of the Drosophila IκB cactus is sufficient for inhibition of the Drosophila NF-κB Dorsal (36Lehming N. McGuire S. Brickman J.M. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10242-10246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the ARD of bacterially derived BCL3 is sufficient for inhibition of p50 homodimer binding to DNA (4Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3915-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This suggests that different IκB proteins may inhibit by distinct mechanisms. To determine whether or not the C-terminal domain of mammalian cell-derived BCL3 affects its ability to inhibit κB binding by (p52)2, we performed a gel shift assay in which p52 was titrated with a BCL3 protein truncated at the C-terminal domain (BCL3ΔC) (Fig. 2 B). The BCL3ΔC protein contains the entire 7th ankyrin repeat domain and no C-terminal domain residues (7Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Seibenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Full-length BCL3 was incubated with CIP in parallel reactions, and Western blotting was performed to ensure that CIP was active, because CIP treatment does not affect the mobility of BCL3ΔC in SDS-PAGE (not shown). The results show that BCL3ΔC activity is not affected by CIP treatment and that, at hig"

This <i>cis</i>-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase (CRAD) shares closest amino acid similarity with mouse retinol dehydrogenase isozymes types 1 and 2 (86 and 91%, respectively). Recombinant CRAD uses NAD<sup>+</sup> as its preferred cofactor and exhibits cooperative kinetics for <i>cis</i>-retinoids, but Michaelis-Menten kinetics for 3α-hydroxysterols. Unlike recombinant retinol dehydrogenase isozymes, recombinant CRAD was inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole, was not stimulated by ethanol, and did not require phosphatidylcholine for optimal activity. CRAD mRNA was expressed intensely in kidney and liver, in contrast to retinol dehydrogenase isozymes, which show strong mRNA expression only in liver. CRAD mRNA expression was widespread (relative abundance): kidney (100) > liver (92) > small intestine (9) = heart (9) > retinal pigment epithelium and sclera (4.5) > brain (2) > retina and vitreous (1.6) > spleen (0.7) > testis (0.6) > lung (0.4). CRAD may catalyze the first step in an enzymatic pathway from 9-<i>cis</i>-retinol to generate the retinoid X receptor ligand 9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid and/or may regenerate dihydrotestosterone from its catabolite 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol.

https://openalex.org/W2012006697,"The Rho family of GTPases plays an important role in the control of cell shape, adhesion, movement, and growth. Several guanine nucleotide exchange factors have been identified that activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the binding of GTP to these proteins. However, little is known concerning the regulation of these GDP/GTP exchange factors. In this study, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces a rapid, sustainable phosphorylation of the Rac1-specific nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. LPA stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, and the protein was phosphorylated on threonine, but not tyrosine or serine. Tiam1 phosphorylation was also induced by platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, bombesin, and bradykinin but not by epidermal growth factor. Significantly, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with 1 μmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h, or with the selective protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31–8220, reduced LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 by approximately 75%. Moreover, acute stimulation with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was sufficient to induce Tiam1 phosphorylation in vivo, and protein kinase C could phosphorylate purified Tiam1 on threonine residues in vitro. These data indicate that agonist-induced phosphorylation of Tiam1 is a general mechanism and suggest that it is likely to be important in its regulation.

The proteins of the Rho family cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states, aided by a number of regulatory proteins. A number of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote binding of GTP to Rho family members by facilitating the release of GDP, have been identified (16Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange factors that act on Rho proteins contain two conserved domains: a Dbl homology domain which is believed to be responsible for catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange, and a pleckstrin homology domain that seems to be important for cellular localization through interaction with lipids and/or proteins (16Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).

Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well established that nucleotide exchange on Ras is stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors and recruitment of the Sos exchange factor to the plasma membrane with the aid of the Grb2 adapter protein (21Egan S.E.

On the other hand, Michiels et al. (25Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have shown that the Rac1-specific exchange factor Tiam1 becomes associated with the membrane fraction upon addition of serum to NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with N-terminally truncated Tiam1. However, it is not yet clear whether phosphorylation or relocalization of Rho family exchange factors plays an important role in their regulation in nontransfected cells. Therefore, to further elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of the Rho family nucleotide exchange factors, we investigated the effect of agonist treatment on the subcellular distribution and phosphorylation state of Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), pennicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. LPA (1-oleoyl) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-ββ) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Bradykinin was from Novabiochem USA. Bombesin, endothelin-1, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), sodium orthovanadate, leupeptin, antipain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, Tween 20, Triton X-100, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Ro-31–8220, bisindolylmaleimide I, and staurosporine were from Calbiochem. Tiam1 and PY20 antibodies and A-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphothreonine and phosphoserine-specific antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories, Inc.[γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in HEPES-buffered DMEM with 4 mml-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For all experiments, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes for 1–2 days to subconfluency (60–70%). The medium was then replaced with a low serum medium (DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 24 h to allow the cells to become quiescent. The cells were then treated with serum-free medium (DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics) for 1 h prior to agonist stimulation. Serum-starved cultures on 100-mm dishes were treated with various concentrations of LPA at 37 °C for different times as noted in the experiments. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 500 μm sodium orthovanadate and scraped in 400 μl/dish lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml antipain and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by five passes through a 27-gauge needle (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 ×g for 45 min to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. The membrane pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer to remove cytosolic proteins. Protein determination was done by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (219288) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cultures on 100-mm dishes were treated with various concentrations of LPA, PDGF, endothelin-1, bombesin, or bradykinin at 37 °C for different times as noted in the experiments. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 500 μmsodium orthovanadate and scraped in 0.5 ml/dish RIPA buffer (PBS containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml antipain and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by five passes through a 27-gauge needle (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and precleared by incubation with 1 μg of rabbit IgG and 20 μl of A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of A-agarose beads by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for immunoprecipitation. Supernatants were incubated with 3 μl of Tiam1 antibody for 1 h, 20 μl of A-agarose beads were then added, and the samples were rocked at 4 °C overnight. Beads were collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 10 min), washed four times in RIPA buffer, and further analyzed by Western blotting. The phosphothreonine immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above, except 3 μl of phosphothreonine antibody was used instead of the Tiam1 antibody. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 6% acrylamide gels (Novel Experimental Corp.), and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 1.5 h at 20 V using a Novex wet transfer unit. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk. Blots were incubated for 1 h with Tiam1 antibody (diluted 1:2000) in 1% bovine serum albumin and then 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector laboratories), prior to development using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). The other Western blots were carried out essentially as described above using the appropriate antibodies: PY20 (diluted 1:1000), phosphothreonine (diluted 1:500), and phosphoserine (diluted 1:500). An N-terminally truncated form of Tiam1, GST-C1199-Tiam1 (25Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), was transfected into COS-7 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads essentially as described (28Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Silver staining analysis indicated that the purified GST-Tiam1 was almost homogeneous. Purified GST-Tiam1 (5 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence and absence of 0.3 units of purified rat brain protein kinase C (Sigma) in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm glycerol-3-phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Assays were carried out either using non-radiolabeled ATP and phosphorylation analysis by Western blotting or with [γ-32P]-ATP (specific activity 5 × 106 dpm/nmol) and phosphorylation analysis by autoradiography. As a first step toward studying the regulation of Tiam1, cytosol and membranes from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were analyzed for the presence of Tiam1 by Western blotting (Fig. 1). A protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 190 kDa was identified in membranes from rat brain, a tissue with high Tiam1 expression (29Habets G.G.M. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar), and Swiss 3T3 cells using the Santa Cruz Tiam1 antibody (Fig. 1). Antibody recognition of this protein band was specifically blocked by preincubation of the antibody with the peptide against which it was raised (Fig. 1). The same protein band was also strongly recognized by a different polyclonal antibody (not shown), raised against the C-terminal part of Tiam1 (30Habets G.G.M. Scholtes E.H.M. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), confirming that it represents Tiam1. Interestingly, in growing Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, Tiam1 was detected in both cytosol and membrane fractions (Fig. 1). Moreover, Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was predominantly localized in the membrane fraction (78 ± 4%), providing further evidence that Tiam1 is present in the membrane fraction of growing cells (25Michiels F.

In NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with N-terminally truncated Tiam1, addition of serum induces membrane localization of Tiam1 and subsequent membrane ruffling (25Michiels F. Stam J.C.

Since LPA is an important constituent of serum (31Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), activates several signaling pathways in fibroblasts which involve Rho family GTPases (2Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we decided to study the effect of this mitogen on the regulation of Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, LPA treatment did not cause a significant change in the subcellular distribution of Tiam1 (data not shown). However, it is possible that LPA may induce redistribution of Tiam1 to a specific membrane fraction, which we could not detect by our procedures. Alternatively, agonist-stimulated Tiam1 redistribution may be lost during cell lysis. On the other hand, stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with LPA caused an electrophoretic retardation of the membrane-associated Tiam1 (Fig. 2,A and B). Preincubation of the Tiam1 antibody with its immunopeptide specifically blocked antibody recognition of the two Tiam1 bands, confirming that they both represent Tiam1 (not shown). LPA induced the Tiam1 bandshift in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). The more slowly migrating form of Tiam1 became evident after 2.5 min of LPA stimulation, reached a maximum after 5 min, and was sustained for at least 60 min of LPA treatment. Tiam1 gel retardation was half-maximal at 100 nm LPA and maximal at concentrations of 1 μm and higher (not shown). LPA also caused some retardation of the cytosolic Tiam1 although this was not as evident as for the membrane-associated Tiam1 (Fig. 2 A). Agonist-stimulated gel retardation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been well documented for several proteins, including MAP kinase (34Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) and paxillin (35Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is a characteristic of these proteins when they become phosphorylated and activated. Indeed, support for the idea that a protein kinase is responsible for the electrophoretic retardation of Tiam1 comes from the fact that pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (200 nm) decreased the magnitude of the Tiam1 bandshift by approximately 50% (not shown). To obtain further evidence that Tiam1 is phosphorylated by agonist treatment, Tiam1 was immunoprecipitated from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts treated with and without 100 μm LPA for 15 min, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with phosphotyrosine-, phosphothreonine-, and phosphoserine-specific antibodies. As expected, the 190-kDa protein designated as Tiam1 was immunoprecipitated by the antibody raised against the C-terminal part of Tiam1 and by the Santa Cruz Tiam1 antibody but could not be detected in those immunoprecipitates generated in the presence of the immunizing peptide or with a nonspecific rabbit IgG antibody (results not shown). Tiam1 was immunoprecipitated equally well from control and LPA-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). Significantly, after LPA treatment, Tiam1 immunoprecipitates contained a 190-kDa protein band that strongly reacted with the phosphothreonine-specific antibody. However, the PY20 antibody did not recognize the Tiam1 band, either before or after LPA treatment, but specifically recognized a highly phosphorylated 190-kDa protein in PDGFβ receptor immunoprecipitates from PDGF-treated Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig.3 A), suggesting that LPA does not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Tiam1 to any significant extent. Similarly, the phosphoserine antibody did not recognize the Tiam1 band in control or LPA-treated immunoprecipitates but did recognize several protein bands in phosphoserine immunoprecipitates from PMA-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 A), indicating that LPA does not significantly stimulate serine phosphorylation of Tiam1. Therefore, these data indicate that the phosphothreonine antibody interacts specifically with Tiam1 after LPA treatment, providing strong evidence that the agonist selectively stimulates phosphorylation of Tiam1 threonine residues. Importantly, the phosphothreonine antibody could immunoprecipitate a 190-kDa protein that was recognized by the Tiam1 antibody, and the amount of the 190-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by this antibody was significantly increased by LPA treatment (Fig. 3 B). These data confirm that the 190-kDa protein that is phosphorylated on threonine residues by LPA treatment is indeed Tiam1. Several other agonists were also tested for their ability to phosphorylate Tiam1 on threonine to ascertain whether Tiam1 phosphorylation is an LPA-specific event. The heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated agonists endothelin-1, bombesin, and bradykinin (Fig. 4) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (not shown) all induced phosphorylation of Tiam1, showing that LPA is not the only agonist which stimulates Tiam1 phosphorylation. In addition, incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with PDGF (50 ng/ml) also caused Tiam1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), whereas epidermal growth factor treatment (50 nm) had no effect on phosphorylation of this protein (not shown), indicating that some growth factors can stimulate phosphorylation of Tiam1. Importantly, the different agonists tested were able to phosphorylate Tiam1 to different extents; LPA, PDGF, and endothelin-1 induced strong phosphorylation of Tiam1, whereas bradykinin and bombesin only caused a weak phosphorylation of this protein. Analysis of Tiam1 immunoprecipitates indicated that the LPA-induced phosphorylation of Tiam1 is very rapid. Phosphorylation became evident after 15 s of LPA stimulation, was maximal at 2.5 min LPA stimulation, and began to decrease after 10 min of LPA treatment (Fig.5 A). However, Tiam1 phosphorylation was still readily detectable after 60 min of LPA treatment (Fig. 5 A). LPA stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 in a dose-dependent manner; phosphorylation was half-maximal at approximately 100 nm LPA and maximal at concentrations of 1 μm and higher (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, several LPAs containing different fatty acid chains could induce phosphorylation of Tiam1 (not shown). 1-Oleoyl-LPA was approximately 6-fold more potent than 1-palmitoyl-LPA and 40-fold more effective than 1-myristoyl-LPA at inducing phosphorylation of Tiam1. Indeed, the rank order of potency of the various LPAs correlates with their ability to bind to the LPA binding site in Swiss 3T3 membranes (36Thomson F.J. Perkins L. Ahern D. Clark M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the effects are transduced by a specific receptor. LPA-induced Tiam1 phosphorylation was not affected by pretreating Swiss 3T3 cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h (not shown), indicating that the effect does not involve stimulation of a heterotrimeric G-protein of the Gi/Go family. Therefore, since LPA activates protein kinase C (PKC) via a pertussis toxin-insensitive heterotrimeric G-protein, at concentrations of 100 nm and higher (37Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and all of the agonists tested that stimulate phosphorylation of Tiam1 also activate PKC, we investigated the possibility that PKC is involved in Tiam1 phosphorylation. Indeed, preincubation of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with 5 μmRo-31–8220, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibited the LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 by approximately 70% (Fig.6 A), indicating that this protein kinase plays a major role in this effect. The specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (5 μm) and the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (200 nm) also acted as potent inhibitors of LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation (not shown). Genistein treatment, on the other hand, had no effect on LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation (not shown), providing further evidence that LPA does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Tiam1 and that a tyrosine kinase is not involved in the pathway studied here. PKC involvement in Tiam1 phosphorylation is supported by the fact that long-term (24 h) pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with 1 μm PMA, to down-regulate the cellular level of PKC, reduced the magnitude of the LPA-induced phosphorylation by approximately 75% (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, acute stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with 100 nm PMA is sufficient to stimulate phosphorylation of Tiam1 (Fig. 6 C) confirming that protein kinase C plays a key role in Tiam1 phosphorylation. Purified PKC was incubated with purified GST-C1199-Tiam1 to ascertain whether the kinase phosphorylates Tiam1. Although some phosphorylation of Tiam1 was observed in the absence of PKC (Fig.7), perhaps due to a protein kinase which co-purifies with the GST-Tiam1, addition of PKC significantly enhanced [32P]-labeled phosphorylation of the exchange factor (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that this kinase phosphorylates Tiam1. Indeed, inclusion of PKC stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 on threonine (Fig. 7 B), providing strong evidence that this kinase directly phosphorylates the exchange factor. The results presented here provide strong evidence that the Rac1-specific nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 is phosphorylated by a cellular threonine protein kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with LPA. This is the first study providing evidence that nucleotide exchange factors which act on Rho family GTPases are phosphorylated in vivo by agonist treatment. Moreover, the rapid threonine-specific phosphorylation of Tiam1 after addition of LPA (Fig.5 A) suggests that this event is likely to be functionally important in the action of this mitogen. Indeed, PDGF, endothelin-1, and to a lesser extent bombesin and bradykinin (Fig. 4), also induce phosphorylation of Tiam1, indicating that agonist-induced phosphorylation of this protein is a general mechanism and is likely to play an important role in Tiam1 regulation. LPA activates a number of well characterized signaling pathways and processes, via the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gi and Gq; namely, inhibition of adenylate cyclase, activation of Ras and the Raf/MAP kinase pathway, stimulation of PLC and PLD, and stress fiber formation (37Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Significantly, LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 was not inhibited by pretreating cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that it does not involve inhibition of adenylate cyclase or activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway, which are regulated via Gi. On the other hand, nanomolar concentrations of LPA activate Tiam1 phosphorylation (Fig.5 B) and a phosphoinositide-specific PLC (37Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein. PLC stimulation results in the generation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which activate PKC and mobilize Ca2+, respectively. Therefore, since Tiam1 phosphorylation is also stimulated by treatment with PDGF, endothelin-1, bombesin, and bradykinin (Fig.4), agonists which activate PLC and PKC (38Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Yanagisawa M. Yamashita K. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7856-7861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Issandou M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11890-11896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not by epidermal growth factor, which produces barely detectable phosphoinositide hydrolysis in Swiss 3T3 cells (38Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that PKC is involved in the phosphorylation studied here. Several lines of evidence indicate that PKC plays an important role in LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation. First of all, preincubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with the specific PKC inhibitors Ro-31–8220 and bisindolylmaleimide I reduced LPA-induced Tiam1 phosphorylation by nearly 70% (Fig. 6 A). Second, 24-h pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PMA, to down-regulate the cellular level of non-atypical PKC isozymes, reduced LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation by approximately 75% (Fig. 6 B). In addition, acute treatment with PMA was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Tiam1 (Fig.6 C). Finally, purified rat brain PKC could phosphorylate purified GST-Tiam1 in vitro on threonine residues (Fig. 7). These data provide strong evidence that PKC plays a role in the phosphorylation of Tiam1 and that PKC directly phosphorylates this exchange factor, although it remains possible that PKC may also activate another protein kinase (or inactivate a phosphatase) that controls the phosphorylation state of Tiam1. Further support that PKC can phosphorylate Tiam1 comes from the fact that most serine/threonine protein kinases predominantly phosphorylate serine residues, whereas PKC can also phosphorylate threonine. In addition, Tiam1 is particularly rich in serine and threonine residues (29Habets G.G.M. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar) and contains several potential PKC phosphorylation consensus sequences. It seems likely that PKC isozymes of the classical or novel family catalyzes the phosphorylation described here since long-term pretreatment of cells with PMA reduces the phosphorylation by approximately 75%. Moreover, a PKC isozyme of the classical PKC family would be a good candidate for stimulating this phosphorylation since LPA activates a phosphoinositide-specific PLC (37Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and Tiam1 phosphorylation via similar signaling pathways. Interestingly, although PKC inhibitors and long-term PMA treatment reduced the LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation to a similar extent, neither manipulation completely abrogated the LPA effect. This suggests that a second protein kinase may be involved in LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that PMA does not stimulate Tiam1 phosphorylation to the same extent as LPA. Thus PKC may synergize with another protein kinase to phosphorylate Tiam1 in response to LPA stimulation. The second putative protein kinase could be an atypical PKC or an enzyme from a different kinase family that is capable of phosphorylating threonine residues. The relationship between the electrophoretic retardation of Tiam1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorylation of that protein is not yet clear. Protein phosphorylation probably plays a part in LPA-induced gel retardation of Tiam1 since the magnitude of this bandshift is reduced by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Moreover, LPA-induced Tiam1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B) and the Tiam1 bandshift are both induced by LPA concentrations of 100 nm and higher, suggesting that both effects may be activated via a common pathway. However, the time-courses of the two effects are considerably different. Tiam1 phosphorylation becomes detectable after 15 s of LPA treatment and is maximal after 2.5 min (Fig. 5 A), whereas electrophoretic retardation of this protein becomes detectable after 2.5 min of LPA stimulation and is maximal after 5 min (Fig. 2 B). One possibility is that LPA induces phosphorylation of Tiam1 on several amino acids and that this hyperphosphorylation causes the Tiam1 bandshift. Alternatively, the Tiam1 bandshift may be caused by the second protein kinase suggested above. It has been proposed that regulated membrane localization of Tiam1 may be important in its activation and that an intact pleckstrin homology domain is critical for the membrane association of this protein (25Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein phosphorylation plays an important role in activation of the Ras exchange factor Sos by facilitating recruitment of the Sos/Grb2 complex to the plasma membrane (21Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 22Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), suggesting that a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism could also be involved in Tiam1 translocation. However, it seems unlikely that this is the case in Swiss 3T3 cells since LPA treatment induced a strong phosphorylation of Tiam1 (Fig. 3) but did not cause a significant change in its subcellular distribution. Phosphorylation of the nucleotide exchange factors Ras-GRF (41Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and Vav (24Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) has been reported recently. However, Tiam1, Ras-GRF, and Vav appear to be phosphorylated by completely different signaling pathways. Tiam1 is phosphorylated on threonine residues by a PKC-dependent pathway (Fig. 6), Ras-GRF is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues by a PKC-independent mechanism (41Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and Vav is phosphorylated on tyrosine by a src family tyrosine kinase (24Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Significantly, phosphorylation of both Ras-GRF and Vav increased the GDP/GTP exchange activity exerted on their target GTPases, Ras and Rac1, respectively (24Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 41Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to determine whether phosphorylation of Tiam1 alters its nucleotide exchange activity. Tiam1 is believed to act as a Rac1-specific exchange factor in vivo (28Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Indeed, in NIH3T3 cells, serum induces membrane localization of Tiam1, membrane ruffling and Jun kinase activation (25Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, neither PDGF or insulin could substitute for serum in the induction of membrane ruffling (25Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore since LPA is a major constituent of serum (31Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and stimulates phosphorylation of Tiam1 (Fig.3), it is tempting to speculate that it is the factor that regulates Tiam1 activity. LPA regulates several signaling pathways which involve Rho family GTPases, including stress fiber formation (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar), phospholipase D (32Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Rac1 can activate serum response factor-mediated gene transcription (9Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar), Jun kinase (10Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that LPA-induced phosphorylation of Tiam1 may play an important regulatory role in some of these signaling cascades. We are currently investigating which protein kinases, besides PKC, phosphorylate purified Tiam1 in vitro and the effect of protein phosphorylation on the rate of Tiam1-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange on Rac1.

This is mediated through interaction of cyclin D1 with its catalytic partners, the cyclin-dependent kinases, and the subsequent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Cyclin D1, in turn, is regulated by mitogenic stimuli. We demonstrate that transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) induces cyclin D1 mRNA in esophageal squamous epithelial cells, and this appears to correlate with increased cyclin D1 protein expression and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 activity. The induction of cyclin D1 transcription by TGFα is mediated in part through the induction of the early growth response protein (Egr-1) and its subsequent binding of Egr-1 to a cis-regulatory region spanning nucleotides −144 to −104 of the cyclin D1 promoter. The Egr-1 binding activity to the cyclin D1 promoter appears to require de novo protein synthesis and is not influenced by Sp1 binding to overlapping Sp1 motifs. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TGFα enhances cyclin D1 transcription through the induction of Egr-1 binding to a cis-regulatory region in the cyclin D1 promoter. This has important mechanistic implications into the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 by an essential proproliferative growth factor and cell cycle progression.

This has important mechanistic implications into the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 by an essential proproliferative growth factor and cell cycle progression. Cyclin D1 is critical in the progression of the cell through G1 phase. The overexpression of cyclin D1 in cultured cells shortens G1 phase and causes a more rapid entry into S phase (1Quelle D.E.

Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2980-2983PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, microinjection of antisense cyclin D1 oligonucleotide or cyclin D1 antibody in SaoS2 osteosarcoma cells will arrest cells in G1 phase (3Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). Antisense cyclin D1 has been shown to inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cells (4Arber N. Doki R.

Cell cycle progression through G1 phase is regulated by the association of cyclin D1 with its catalytic protein partners, the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRB, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product; TGFα, transforming growth factor-α; EGR, early growth response; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRB, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product; TGFα, transforming growth factor-α; EGR, early growth response; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. In particular, cyclin D1 preferentially associates with either cdk4 or cdk6, an association that is prevented by the interaction of cdks with their inhibitors (5Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar, 6Peter M. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1994; 79: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The cdk inhibitors can disrupt cyclin D1-cdk kinase activity. G1 arrest is associated with the overexpression of the cdk inhibitors. A key cellular target for the cyclin D1·cdk4 or cyclin D1·ckd6 complex is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (pRB) (7Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louie K. Reed S.I. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A.

Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), and in this context, pRB is progressively phosphorylated, resulting in the release of important transcriptional factors, such as E2F (9Flemington E.K.

Aside from the role of cyclin D1 in the normal eukaryotic cell cycle, there is compelling evidence for the contribution of cyclin D1 to cancer development and progression. For example, it is frequently overexpressed in cancers through gene amplification in squamous epithelial cancers (11Bartkova J. Lukas J. Muller H. Strauss M. Gusterson B. Bartek J.

The oncogenecity of cyclin D1 has been appreciated through its ability to complement a defective adenovirus E1a oncogene in the transformation of cultured cells (18Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. NgEaton E. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and also to cooperate with ras in transforming such cells (19Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it induces mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma in lactating transgenic mice (19Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar) and oral-esophageal dysplasia in transgenic mice (20Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). An appreciation of the role of cyclin D1 in the cell cycle is possible through an understanding of the regulation of cyclin D1 by growth factors. This regulation is complex, with the involvement not only of predominantly transcriptional mechanisms but also posttranscriptional mechanisms. An initial study examined the effects of serum and growth factors on cyclin D1 (and cyclin D3) expression in normal human diploid fibroblasts (21Nakagawa H. Wang T.C. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K.

Serum supplementation increased the cyclin D1 mRNA level, with a peak at about 12 h prior to onset of S phase. In addition, a number of different growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor increased cyclin D1 mRNA and, correspondingly, DNA synthesis (22Won K.A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, cyclin D1 mRNA decreased upon serum depletion, high cell density, and senescence (22Won K.A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To study the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter, different groups have cloned the promoter and 5′ and 3′ untranslated regulatory regions of cyclin D1, corresponding to approximately 3 kilobases by one group (23Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar) and approximately 1.8 kilobases by another group (24Motokura T. Arnold A. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993; 11: 89-95Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A serum inducible region between −944 and −848 has been noted with DNase footprinting showing the critical element between −928 and −921 (23Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cotransfection of the cyclin D1 promoter and c-jun activates a potential cAMP response element site at −52 (23Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that c-mycdecreases cyclin D1 mRNA in Balb/3T3 fibroblasts, perhaps through the down-regulation of the initiator element in the cyclin D1 promoter similar to the one found in the adenovirus major late promoter, which is bound by USF in vitro (25Philipp A. Schneider A. Vasrik I. Finke K. Xiong Y. Beach D. Alitalo K. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4032-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the finding that c-myc induces cyclin D1 expression in Rat-1 cells, although potential cis-regulatory elements within the cyclin D1 promoter were not investigated (26Dasksis J.I. Lu R.Y. Facchini L.M. Marhin W.M. Penn L.J.Z. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3635-3645PubMed Google Scholar). Given that cyclin D1 and ras cooperate to transform cultured cells and that ras results in elevated cyclin D1 levels in NIH 3T3 cells (27Liu J. Chao J. Jiang M. Ng S. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), it has been also demonstrated that transforming ras mutants induce the cyclin D1 promoter in human trophoblasts (JEG-3), in the mink lung epithelial cell line (Mvl.Lu), and in the Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cell line (28Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of AP1 like sequences at −954 abolished the p21-ras-dependent activation of cyclin D1 expression. AP1 sequences were also required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by c-jun (28Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is critical in the proliferation and transformation of squamous epithelial cells, especially in the head/neck and esophagus; however, the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 by growth factors in this cell type remains to be elucidated. It is also clear that transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), a peptide that binds the epidermal growth factor receptor, is important in these processes, but the ultimate targets for the proproliferative effects of TGFα remain to be elucidated in squamous epithelial tissues (29Yoshida K. Kyo E. Tsuda T. Tsujino T. Ito M. Niimoto M. Tahara E. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Barnard J.A. Beauchamp R.D. Russell W.M. Dubois R.N. Coffey R.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 564-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Linking the effects of TGFα to cyclin D1 transcription would enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying proliferation in squamous epithelial cells. Therefore, we have examined the effects of TGFα on cyclin D1 mRNA and have linked the increase of cyclin D1 transcription by TGFα in part through the induction of the early growth response (EGR) transcriptional factor binding activity with a cis-regulatory element in the cyclin D1 promoter. The physiological effect of this induction appears to be increased cdk6 kinase activity and a shorter G1 phase. A 1884-base pair PvuII fragment (−1749 to +135, designated as Dlpro-1749) contains the promoter and the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regulatory regions of the PRAD1/cyclin D1 gene (24Motokura T. Arnold A. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993; 11: 89-95Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This was subjected to restriction enzyme digestions to make a series of deletion constructs in the promoterless vector, pA3LUC (31Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar), which also contains the firefly luciferase gene. These deletions were generated from the Dlpro-1749 fragment by removing different fragments from the 5′ end using specific restriction enzyme sites followed by blunt end ligation: Dlpro-1095, −1095 to +135 (EcoRI/PvuII); Dlpro770, −770 to +135 (MscI/PvuII); Dlpro-558, −558 to +135 (PmlI/PvuII); Dlpro-327, −327 to +135 (SmaI/PvuII); Dlpro-144, −144 to +135 (NarI/PvuII); and Dlpro-78, −78 to +135 (Sau3A1/PvuII). The deletion Dlpro-104 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using custom-designed primers with additional restriction sites for insertion into the pA3LUC vector: sense primer, 5′-CTAGCCCGGGTCCCGCTCCCATTCT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTGTGGGTCCTGGCT-3′. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sequenase, version 2.0, United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). In addition, four pairs of oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized for sense and antisense strands of the cyclin D1 promoter spanning nucleotides −144 to −104: wild type, 5′-CGCCCGCGCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCC-3′; mutant 1, 5′-CGCCCGCGCCCTATCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCTAGCCCCCC-3′; mutant 2, 5′-CGCCCGCGCCCTATCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCC-3′; and mutant 3, 5′-CGCCCGCGCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCTAGCCCCCC-3′. After annealing, each double-stranded fragment was subcloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the pT81 plasmid, which contains a minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (32Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). The esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines TE-1 (a gift from T. Nishihira) and T.T (obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resource Bank) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma). For preparation of total RNA and nuclear proteins, the cells were serum starved (0.1% serum) for 24 h and treated with or without 50 ng/ml TGFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for different time periods prior to harvesting of cells. As a protein translation inhibitor, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was used. Transient transfections by the calcium phosphate method (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) were performed in triplicate in 6-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Co., Lincoln Park, NJ). Equal numbers of cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded in each well 24 h prior to transfection. After the medium was replaced with fresh medium, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid containing the different cyclin D1 promoter deletions in 250 μl of transfection buffer. After 12–18 h incubation with the transfection solution, cells were shocked with 15% glycerol buffer (3 volumes of glycerol, 7 volumes of sterile distilled H2O, and 10 volumes of 2 × DNA precipitation buffer per manufacturer's instructions) for 90 s. The cells were then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum for 48 h at 37 °C. For TGFα stimulation experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS after glycerol shock, incubated in 0.1% fetal calf serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, and stimulated with different doses of TGFα, ranging from 50 to 150 ng/ml final concentration. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS buffer, harvested in 200 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), and incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min. The cell lysate was vortexed briefly and centrifuged for 1 min. Then, 40 μl of lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm MgCO3, 2.67 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mmdithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μmATP, and 470 μm luciferin). Assays were carried out in a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Luciferase activity was expressed in rate of light units. Corrections for transfection efficiency were done by cotransfecting pXGH5 (the mouse metallothionein I promoter fused to the human growth hormone structural gene sequence). This plasmid is included in the human growth hormone transient gene expression assay system (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA), and human growth hormone activity was quantitated according to the manufacturer's instructions. After standardization with human growth hormone activity, a mean luciferase activity (generated from transfections done in triplicate) was obtained, and S.D. was calculated. Transfections were repeated and reproduced in at least three independent experiments. Variation between experiments was not greater than 10%. Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (14Nakagawa H. Zukerberg L. Togawa K. Meltzer S.J. Nishihara T. Rustgi A.K. Cancer. 1995; 76: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was purified by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction method. RNA samples (10 μg) were fractionated in a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.). The UV-cross-linked membrane was hybridized in a rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp.) with a 1.4-kilobase cyclin D1 cDNA random prime labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) and washed under high stringency conditions: once with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, once with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. The membrane was exposed to X-OMAT-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Autoradiographic signals were quantitated by scanning (Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIP) and analyzed with the NIH Image software. RNA stability was assessed with a transcription inhibitor, dichloro-β-diribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), and Northern blot analysis was performed under identical conditions. Cells were grown in serum-free medium as described above in the presence or absence of TGFα (50 ng/ml). Cells were collected at various time points (0–24 h) with or without TGFα treatment. Then, cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, fixed in 5 ml of 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C overnight. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 3.8 mm sodium citrate and 10 mg/ml propidium iodide. After 10 mg/ml RNase treatment at 37 °C for 20 min, the samples were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan, Beckton Dickinson). Lysates from exponentially growing TE-1 cells with and without TGFα (50 ng/ml) treatment were harvested at various time points (0–24 h) and prepared in a buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm NaCl) with 1 mm protease inhibitors (aprotinin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and chymostatin) (all from Boehringer Mannheim) and 10 mm phosphatase inhibitors (sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride) (14Nakagawa H. Zukerberg L. Togawa K. Meltzer S.J. Nishihara T. Rustgi A.K. Cancer. 1995; 76: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 150 mg of total protein of each sample was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore) at 10 V for 12 h at 4 °C. Blocking was performed in 5% milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20 for 1 h. The primary antibody (cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody HD11, a gift of Ed Harlow) was used at a 1:4 dilution. The secondary antibody was peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Cappel; 1:5000 dilution). The detection system was by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.). Autoradiographic signals were quantitated by scanning (Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIP) and analyzed with the NIH Image software. Conditions were identical to harvesting TE-1 cells with and without TGFα (50 ng/ml), as for Northern and Western blot analyses. For kinase assays, cells were washed with PBS, scraped in 1 ml of kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin), and kept on ice for 20 min with occasional vortexing. The cell lysates in the Eppendorf tubes were sonicated on full power two times for 1 min each time and then spun at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. In a total volume of 500 μl of buffer, 150 mg of cell lysate was incubated with 200 ng of either cdk4 or cdk6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were washed with the buffer (without inhibitors) three times and then resuspended in an equal volume of buffer. Then, 30 μl of mixed slurry beads were added to each tube and rocked at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The beads were rinsed three times with buffer and then twice with 1 × kinase reaction buffer (5 × kinase reaction buffer: 250 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction (total volume 30 μl) contained beads, 1 × kinase reaction buffer, 1 mm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and double distilled H2O, along with a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) fused to glutathione S-transferase (a gift of E. Harlow and P. Hinds) as a substrate. Kinase assays were performed for 45 min at 37 °C with mild vortexing at 10 and 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 30 μl of protein sample buffer and placed on ice. The samples were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine phosphorylation efficiency. The gel was Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to X-OMAT-AR film at −70 °C. Autoradiographic signals were quantitated by scanning (Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIP) and analyzed with the NIH Image software. Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared essentially as described by Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Mathias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) except that the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 1 mm protease inhibitors (aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) (all from Boehringer Mannheim). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and purified by gel electrophoresis. To make the DNA oligonucleotide probes, 5 pmol of a double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled by the Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μmdTTP, 0.33 μm [α-32P] dCTP, 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Corp.) and then purified with a NAP5 column (Pharmacia). Gel EMSAs were carried out by incubating 5 μg of crude nuclear extract with 5 fmol of 32P radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probe (20,000 cpm) in 20 μl of binding reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT)/poly(dA-dT) (Pharmacia). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, samples were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide, 0.25 × Tris borate gels and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to X-OMAT-AR film at −70 °C. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides prior to the addition of the32P radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probe. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: cyclin D1 promoter, −140, 5′-CGGCGTTGGCGCCCGCGCCCCC-3′; cyclin D1 promoter, −130, 5′-CGCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCC-3′; cyclin D1 promoter, −110, 5′-GCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCTCC-3′; Egr wild type, 5′-CGCCCTCGCCCCCGCGCCGG-3′; Egr mutant, 5′-GGATCCAGCTAGGGCGAGCTAGGGCGA-3′; Sp1, 5′-GATCGATCGGGCGGGGCGATC-3′; glucocorticoid response element, 5′-GATCAGAACACAGTGTTCTCTA-3′. Immune-supershift assays were performed using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Egr-1 (a gift of Dr. V. Sukhatme) (35Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A. Mokiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 10: 1931-1939Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar), or anti-AP2 (a gift of Dr. T. Williams) and preincubated with the crude nuclear extract at room temperature for 10 min prior to the addition of the 32P radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probe. Exponentially growing TE-1 cells were serum starved for 48 h and treated with TGFα (50 ng/ml), and RNA was harvested at different time points after treatment. Northern blot analysis showed that cyclin D1 mRNA (4.7-kilobase transcript) was induced 3-fold above basal level (quantitated by laser densitometry), and this induction was evident by 4 h after treatment (Fig.1 A). The response was sustained until about 8 h after treatment, and then the cyclin D1 mRNA level returned to its basal level. A similar effect on cyclin D1 mRNA was seen after treatment of TE-1 cells with epidermal growth factor (data not shown). However, no effect on cyclin D1 was evident when cells were maintained in serum-free medium (data not shown). It should be emphasized that the effect of TGFα on cyclin D1 mRNA is consistent with the level of cyclin D1 mRNA induction observed with other growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin growth factor 1 (22Won K.A.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4093-4100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine the relationship of cyclin D1 protein expression to cyclin D1 mRNA expression after TGFα stimulation, Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 1 B). This demonstrated that cyclin D1 protein was induced 3-fold (based upon laser densitometry) with TGFα stimulation, peaking at 4 h after treatment and consistent with the time period of mRNA induction. The cyclin D1 protein is not induced under serum-free conditions (data not shown). It should be noted, however, that the protein was not detectable at time point 24 h, a time point well beyond the induction of the mRNA. It is possible, given the known short t½ of cyclin D1 protein, that it is degraded through proteolysis and TGFα depletion (Ref. 39Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). We next tested whether the increase in cyclin D1 RNA and protein correlated with an effect on cdk4 and/or cdk6 kinase activity and ultimately on progression through the G1 phase. Fig.1 C reveals that there was a 2-fold induction (based upon laser densitometry) in cdk6 activity by 8 h after treatment as measured by phosphorylation of the pRB substrate (GST-retinoblastoma carboxyl terminus substrate), although the overall magnitude of the cdk6 kinase activity was low. There was no increase in cdk4 kinase activity (based upon laser densitometry; data not shown). We would emphasize that these results are consistent with a report of preferential cdk6 kinase activation in oral squamous carcinoma cell lines but not cdk4 kinase activity (Ref. 40Timmermann S. Hinds P.W. Münger K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 361-370PubMed Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Moreover, the magnitude of cdk6 kinase activity is similar, pe"

Genes encoding the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) and cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were induced upon irradiation of prostate cancer cells, and inhibition of EGR-1 function resulted in abrogation of both TNF-α induction and apoptosis. Induction of the TNF-α gene by ionizing radiation and EGR-1 was mediated via a GC-rich EGR-1-binding motif in the TNF-α promoter.

Cancer. 1993; 71: 3783-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Radiation therapy that causes growth inhibition and programmed cell death (apoptosis) of tumors is a well established mode of treatment for both primary and metastatic prostate cancer (2Lee W.R. Hanks G.E. Cancer. 1995; 75: 1909-1913Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, despite using high doses of radiation, about 50–60% of prostate cancer patients show persistent local disease (3Mollenkamp J.S. Cooper J.F. Kagan A.R. J.

A major reason for failure to eradicate local disease is the intrinsic radioresistance of the tumors. One of the molecular determinants regulating the response to ionizing radiation is the tumor suppressor protein p53 that serves as a pivotal component of the apoptosis pathways in diverse cell types (6Kastan M.B.

EGR-1 is a member of the Egr (early growth response) family of transcription factors that includes EGR-2, EGR-3, NGFI-C, the tumor suppressor Wilms' tumor gene product WT1, and EGR-α (18Milbrandt J.

The Egr family members show a high degree of homology in the amino acids constituting the zinc finger domain and bind to the same GC-rich consensus DNA sequence (21Christy B.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl.

Functional studies have suggested that EGR-1 is an anti-proliferative signal for tumor cells (24Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okamura D. Mercola D. Adamson E.D.

In human melanoma cells that contain wild-type p53, abrogation of EGR-1 function confers radioresistance despite induction of p53 (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S.

A p53-independent mechanism for apoptotic death of prostate cells in p53-null mice after testosterone ablation effected by orchiectomy also has been suggested (28Berges R.R. Furuya Y. Remington L.

Incidentally, EGR-1 is induced early in the rat prostate after orchiectomy (29Day M.L. Wu S. Basler J.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5597-5599PubMed Google Scholar), but its function or mechanism of action in prostatic cells is not known. Another gene that is induced by radiation in a wide range of cell types is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) that encodes a cytokine with pleiotropic effects (30Hallahan D.E. Spriggs D.R.

The induction of TNF-α gene expression represents an important aspect of cellular response to ionizing radiation that causes both autocrine and paracrine tumor cell killing (30Hallahan D.E.

TNF-α protein is a well characterized cytokine that induces apoptosis in different cell types by binding to the TNF-R1 receptor (33Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr.

Binding to the TNF-R1 receptor triggers the sequential recruitment and activation of a cascade of death domain-containing proteins, which further activate cysteinyl-aspartate-specific proteinases (caspases) such as interleukin-converting enzyme and those of the interleukin-converting enzyme-related family (33Chinnaiyan A.M.

The caspases then cleave substrates, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, nuclear lamins, actin, protein kinase C-δ, and fodrin, that are essential for cell survival, subsequently leading to apoptotic cell death (33Chinnaiyan A.M.

The present study used a prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, that lacks functional p53 protein (9Isaacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kaignh M.E.

We demonstrate here that ionizing radiation-inducible apoptotic death is caused by EGR-1 despite the absence of p53 protein and that EGR-1 action involves the up-regulation of the TNF-α gene. Plasmid pCMV-WT1-EGR1, which encodes a dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1, contains a WT1-EGR-1 chimera downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in vector pCB6+ (41Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The plasmid CMV-EGR-1, which encodes full-length EGR-1 protein, contains EGR-1 cDNA downstream of the CMV promoter in the vector pCB6+ (41Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P.

Rauscher III, F.J.

The TNF-α promoter region from −470 to +102 was generated from normal human genomic DNA template by PCR (42Takashiba S. Shapira L. Amar S. Van Dyke T.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sense primer TNFp-470U, [5′-TTTTTCTAGATTTCCCTCCAACCCGTTTTCT-3′], and antisense primer TNFp+102L, [5′-TAAGCTTCAGGGGATGTGGCGTCTGAGG-3′], contained built-in sites (underlined) for XbaI and HindIII, respectively, and they generated a 589-base pair fragment that contained the EGR-1-binding site 5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′. The EGR-1 binding site in the 589-base pair fragment was mutated to 5′-GTTAACCGC-3′ by using PCR-directed mutagenesis. The 589-base pair fragments representing wild or mutant EGR-1 binding sites were cloned in pG-CAT, a vector for CAT reporter, and the fidelity of PCR reactions and subcloning was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Human prostate cancer cells PC-3 that lack functional p53 protein (9Isaacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Pools of transfected PC-3 clones, PC-3/vector (P1 or P2) containing the pCB6+ vector, PC-3/WT1-EGR1 (P1 or P2) expressing the chimera, or PC-3/EGR-1 (P1 or P2) expressing the cDNA of Egr-1, were grown in medium supplemented with G418 sulfate (300 μg/ml). Transfections were performed as described previously (27Nair P. Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Han S.-S. Sukhatme V.P. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20131-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) by using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP) (Boehringer Mannheim). CAT assays were performed by thin-layer chromatography as described previously (27Nair P. Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Han S.-S. Sukhatme V.P. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20131-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A 100 kV industrial x-ray machine (Phillips, Netherlands) was used to irradiate the cultures at room temperature. The dose rate with a 2-mm Al plus 1-mm Be filter was ∼1.85 Gy/min at a focus-surface distance of 30 cm. The [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments were performed as described previously (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M.

For clonogenic cell survival studies, two different cell concentrations in quadruplet sets were used for each radiation dose. Parental PC-3 cells and PC-3 transfectants were left untreated or exposed to 1–6 Gy dose of radiation. After incubation for 10 or more days, each flask was stained with crystal violet, and the colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. The surviving fraction (SF) was calculated as a ratio of the number of colonies formed and the product of the number of cells plated and the plating efficiency. The curve was plotted using X-Y log scatter (Delta Graph®4.0) and fitted by single hit multi-target model (43Lea D.E. Actions of Radiations on Living Cells. Cambridge University Press, London1962: 74-75Google Scholar) to obtain D 0,n, SF 2 values (44Albright N. Radiat. Res. 1987; 112: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).D 0 is the dose required to reduce the fraction of cells to 37%, indicative of single-event killing; the nvalue of the curve is a measure of the width of the shoulder, indicative of multiple-event killing; and SF 2 is the survival fraction of exponentially growing cells that were irradiated at the clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy. EGR-1 expression was determined in untreated and irradiated PC-3 cells by immunocytochemical analysis, as described by us previously (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

Total protein extracts from untreated and irradiated PC-3 cells with various time intervals were subjected to Western blot analysis by using sc-110 or the β-actin antibody (Sigma) for a loading control as described (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29231-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For the DNA laddering test, total genomic DNA was prepared from the PC-3 cells exposed to vehicle or recombinant TNF-α for 48 h and was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (26Muthukkumar S.

For quantitation of apoptosis, cells were lifted by using non-enzymatic cell dissociation medium (Sigma) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with Hoechst (Ho342) and merocyanine (MC540) and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACStar Plus cell sorter as described (45Reid S. Cross R. Snow C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 192: 43-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the copy number or amplification of the Egr-1 gene, FISH was performed using a spectrum orange-labeled Egr-1 probe (locus: Egr-1 band assignment: 5q23–31.1) obtained from Vysis Inc. (Downers Grove, IL) as described previously (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

Total RNA was extracted from PC-3 and their transfectants using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction mix (Perkin-Elmer) as described by us previously (17Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

The TNF-α cDNA sense primer sequences are from nucleotides 839–860, 5′-AGG CGC TCC CCA AGA AGA CAG-3′, and antisense primer sequences are from nucleotides 1039–1060, 5′-AGG CTT GTC ACT CGG GGT TCG-3′ (46Nedwin G.E. Naylor S.L. Sakaguchi A.Y. Smith D. Jarrett-Nedwin J. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Gray P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6361-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition, β-actin gene (the sense primer starts at nucleotide 1628 and the antisense primer begins at nucleotide 2379 and generates a 331-base pair PCR product) was used as an internal control (47Wood Jr., D.P. Banks E.R. Humphreys S. McRoberts J.W. Rangnekar V.M. Cancer. 1994; 74: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ionizing radiation caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition of PC-3 cells, as demonstrated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays (Fig.1 A). Moreover, colony-forming assays indicated that the survival fraction (SF 2) of exponentially growing PC-3 cells that were irradiated at the clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy was 0.25 (Fig.1 B). The dose required to reduce the fraction of PC-3 cells to 37% (D 0 value, i.e. single-event killing) was 140 cGy. The n value of the curve, which is a measure of the width of the shoulder (indicative of multiple event killing), was 1.03 (Fig. 1 B). When compared with previously reported SHMT values for different tumor cell lines (48Weichselbaum R.R. Beckett M.A. Hallahan D.E. Kufe D.W. Vokes E.E. Semin. Oncol. 1992; 19: 14-20PubMed Google Scholar), those for PC-3 cells in Fig. 1 B suggest moderate resistance to ionizing radiation. Clonogenicity inhibition by ionizing radiation was caused because of apoptotic death of the cells as evident from flow analysis, where cultures exposed to ionizing radiation showed a 20–23% increase in apoptotic cells compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 1 C). These observations suggested that despite the absence of p53 protein, PC-3 cells are susceptible to ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis. We examined whether EGR-1 induction was associated with apoptosis inducible by ionizing radiation. Because Egr-1 maps to chromosome 5 and because PC-3 cells lack the chromosome 5 pair (40Ewing C.M. Ru N. Morton R.A. Robinson J.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Barret J.C. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4813-4817PubMed Google Scholar), we performed FISH to ascertain that Egr-1 alleles were intact in these cells. FISH analysis confirmed that PC-3 cells have two intact alleles for Egr-1 at 5q23–31.1 (Fig.2 A). Consistent with this observation suggesting that some areas of 5q are intact perhaps in the form of a marker chromosome, another gene, APC, normally located on 5q21, is also expressed as a full-length protein in these cells (49Smith K.J. Johnson K.A. Bryan T.M. Hill D.E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Paraskeva C. Petersen G.M. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis further confirmed that PC-3 cells constitutively express modest levels of EGR-1 protein (Fig.2 B). Moreover, after exposure to a 5-Gy dose of radiation, PC-3 cells showed induction of EGR-1 expression with peak levels (3–4 fold) at 45 min (Fig. 2 B). These results were corroborated by immunocytochemical analysis that demonstrated a significant increase in nuclear EGR-1 expression levels after 45 min of exposure to radiation (Fig. 2 C). The nuclear localization of EGR-1 was particularly important in view of the potential transcriptional activation function of EGR-1 protein. To ascertain that the WT1-EGR-1 chimera, which has been demonstrated in other cell types to act as a dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1, abrogates EGR-1 function in PC-3 cells, we performed transient cotransfections with a reporter construct EBS-CAT that contains three tandem EGR-1-binding sites, an EGR-1 expression construct CMV-EGR-1, and the chimera. As seen in Fig.3 A, transactivation of the reporter construct by CMV-EGR-1 was inhibited by transient cotransfection of PC-3 cells with CMV-WT1-EGR-1. These results confirmed that the chimera functioned as a dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1 in the PC-3 cell background. We next tested PC-3 cells stably transfected either with the chimera or with an empty vector as a control for abrogation of EGR-1 function. In these experiments, we noted a strong increase in CAT reporter activity when cells stably expressing the vector were cotransfected with CMV-EGR-1 and EBS-CAT (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, cells stably expressing the chimera showed relatively very weak CAT activity upon cotransfection with CMV-EGR-1 and EBS-CAT (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggested that the transfected cells expressing the chimera effectively impede EGR-1 transactivation function. To determine the functional role of EGR-1 in radiation-inducible apoptosis of PC-3 cells, we transfected PC-3 cells with plasmid CMV-EGR-1, CMV-WT1-EGR-1 chimera, or an empty vector (pCB6+) and obtained stable transfectant clones by selection with G418 sulfate (27Nair P. Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Han S.-S. Sukhatme V.P. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20131-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 41Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Pools of about 200 transfected clones were designated P1 or P2, and at least two different pools of clones from each transfections were used in this study. Initially, we determined the effect of abrogation of EGR-1 function in PC-3 cells expressing the chimera in response to ionizing radiation. In colony-forming assays, the SF 2 value of exponentially growing irradiated PC-3/vector.P1 cells was 0.2 with a D 0 value of 124 cGy, and n value was 1.01 (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand, the SF 2 for PC-3/WT1-EGR1.P1 was 0.45 with the D 0 value of 227 cGy, and n value was 1.1, suggesting that compared with vector-transfected cells, the cells transfected with the chimera were significantly resistant (p < 0.0001) to ionizing radiation. Then, we tested the effect of EGR-1 overexpression in PC-3 cells stably transfected with CMV-EGR-1 on the response to ionizing radiation. As seen in Fig.3 C, the SF 2 for PC-3/EGR-1.P1 was 0.095 with the D 0 value of 86 cGy, and n value was 1, suggesting enhanced sensitivity (p < 0.0001) than the vector transfected cells to ionizing radiation. Consistent with this observation, flow analysis indicated that PC-3/WT1-EGR-1.P1 cells were significantly resistant (p < 0.0001) and PC-3/EGR-1.P1 cells were significantly more sensitive (p < 0.0001) to ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis than vector transfected PC-3 control cells (Fig. 3 D). Together these findings suggest that EGR-1 is required for ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis and that when overexpressed EGR-1 potentiates the effects of ionizing radiation. To identify potential downstream targets that might mediate the proapoptotic action of EGR-1, we conducted a GenBankTM/EBI search for genes that contain the EGR-1 consensus binding sites in their promoter regions, focusing on genes that satisfied the following stringent criteria: (i) they should be inducible by ionizing radiation; (ii) they should be functionally involved in apoptosis; and (iii) they should induce apoptosis via a p53-independent pathway. One of the genes that met these criteria was TNF-α. We first ascertained that TNF-α protein could cause apoptosis in the PC-3 cells. Cells were left untreated or treated with 100 units/ml of exogenous recombinant TNF-α, and total DNA was examined for DNA laddering that is characteristic of apoptosis. TNF-α caused nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in PC-3 cells (Fig.4 A), suggesting that the cell killing by TNF-α is mediated through apoptosis. Next, we determined whether TNF-α was inducible by ionizing radiation in PC-3 cells. TNF-α mRNA levels increased about 2–3-fold over basal levels in cells after 30 min of exposure to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation (Fig. 4 B). Next, we tested whether EGR-1 regulated the radiation-inducible expression of TNF-α by using32P-RT-PCR analysis in transfected PC-3 cells. A dose of 5 Gy radiation elevated TNF-α mRNA about 2–3-fold in 30 min in PC-3/vector.P1 cells (which was similar to parental PC-3 cells) but caused down-regulation of TNF-α mRNA levels (to 0.08% of those in untreated cells) in PC-3/WT1-EGR-1.P1 cells (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1 abrogates ionizing radiation-inducible TNF-α expression. Because the dominant-negative mutant acts by inhibiting the function of EGR-1, these findings indicate that EGR-1 is essential for ionizing radiation-inducible TNF-α expression. To determine the mechanism by which EGR-1 may up-regulate TNF-α, we examined the TNF-α gene promoter for consensus EGR-1-binding sites. Interestingly, a sequence 5′-GCGGGGGCG-3′ that conforms exactly with that first shown (21Christy B.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) to bind EGR-1 protein was detected between nucleotides 194 and 186 upstream of the cap site of TNF-α (42Takashiba S. Shapira L.

To determine the mechanism by which the dominant-negative mutant protein of EGR-1 blocked radiation-inducible TNF-α expression, we performed CAT assays by using a reporter construct, TNFp-CAT that contains the TNF-α promoter region from −470 to +120. PC-3 cells were transiently cotransfected with TNFp-CAT, CMV-EGR-1, and either the dominant-negative mutant CMV-WT1-EGR-1 or the empty vector pCB6+. Cells cotransfected with TNFp-CAT and vector showed a modest background level of CAT activity (Fig.4 D). The CAT activity was increased significantly when the cells were cotransfected with TNFp-CAT, CMV-EGR-1, and vector. On the other hand, when cotransfection was performed with TNFp-CAT, CMV-EGR-1, and CMV-WT1-EGR-1, CAT activity was severely reduced (Fig.4 D). These findings indicated that CMV-EGR-1 can transactivate, and the dominant-negative mutant WT1-EGR-1 can transrepress, the TNF-α promoter. We also studied the reporter activity of TNFp-CAT construct in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation induced CAT activity from TNFp-CAT within 1 h of the exposure (Fig. 4 E). Induction of TNFp-CAT expression by ionizing radiation was significantly reduced when cells were cotransfected with the dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1 (Fig. 4 E). These findings suggested that inducible expression of the TNF-α promoter by ionizing radiation required functional EGR-1. When a mutation, which abolished the ability of EGR-1 protein to bind to the TNF-α promoter (42Takashiba S. Shapira L. Amar S. Van Dyke T.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was introduced into the TNFp-CAT construct, basal expression driven by the promoter was attenuated, and radiation-inducible CAT activity was abolished (Fig. 4 E). As expected, ectopically expressed EGR-1 caused induction of CAT activity from the promoter construct that contained wild-type EGR-1-binding site but not from the construct that contained the mutant EGR-1-binding site (Fig. 4 E). Together, these findings suggest that EGR-1 transactivates the TNF-α promoter via the EGR-1-binding site and that this site is required for radiation-inducible TNF-α expression. Wild-type p53 has been shown to be functionally necessary for growth inhibition and apoptosis following exposure to ionizing radiation (6Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 mutations have been reported to increase resistance to apoptosis (8Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, the present study has shown that the absence of wild-type p53 protein in prostate cancer cells renders them moderately resistant to ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis. The expression of genes encoding EGR-1 and TNF-α that induced apoptosis was up-regulated by ionizing radiation in the PC-3 cells, and inhibition of EGR-1 transactivation function by the dominant-negative WT1-EGR-1 chimera abrogated ionizing radiation-inducible TNF-α induction and apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, ectopically expressed EGR-1 enhanced ionizing radiation-inducible TNF-α expression and apoptosis. These findings suggest that EGR-1 is an upstream modulator of TNF-α induction and apoptosis in the pathway evoked by ionizing radiation. Moreover, EGR-1 causes transcriptional activation of the TNF-α promoter via a consensus EGR-1-binding site providing a mechanism for EGR-1-inducible expression of the TNF-α gene. Thus, EGR-1 is an important mediator of radiation responsiveness in prostate cancer cells that lack functional p53 protein. Because p53 protein is mutated in prostate tumors (14Van Veldhuizen P.J. Sadasivan R. Garcia F. Anstenfeld M.S. Stephen R.L. Prostate. 1993; 22: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,15de Vere White R.W. Gumerlock P.H. Chi S.G. Meyers F.J. J. Urol. 1993; 149 (Abstr. 654): 376AGoogle Scholar), EGR-1, which functions by a p53-independent pathway, is of critical importance in the apoptotic death of the tumors. Both EGR-1 and TNF-α are induced by ionizing radiation in diverse tumor types, and future studies may design approaches to further exploit this novel pathway for the containment of radio-resistant tumors."

Evidence verifying the post-translational processing of the initiating methionine residue and acetylation of the free amino group, similar to those reported for other higher plant species, are presented for the two subunits from pea plants (Pisum sativum L.).

However, in situations where molecular weight discrepancies are detected or more detailed structural characterization is required, an MS peptide mass mapping strategy is usually applied (1Morris H.R. Panico M. Taylor G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 30: 299-305Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This procedure uses suitable MS techniques to analyze the peptides generated by enzymatic and/or chemical digestion of the protein under investigation. The molecular weights for the products must match within experimental error those predicted from the protein sequence; those that do not are then presumed to correspond to peptides containing sequence errors or post-translational modifications, or they may provide evidence for contaminating proteins. Detailed structural information of proteins is of fundamental importance in developing an understanding of their biological activities. It therefore follows that analysis of the primary structural features that govern the higher orders of structures of proteins are of considerable interest. The application of a wide range of biochemical and molecular biological studies has identified several post-translational modifications on the D1 and D2 proteins of photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers, for example NH2- and COOH-terminal proteolytic processing (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K.

Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most of these covalent processes have been associated with the biosynthesis and assembly of active photosynthetic complexes. By contrast, details of the structural modifications that influence other aspects of PSII function, in particular the triggering and subsequent degradation of damaged PSII reaction center proteins that are observed during illumination conditions, remain to be resolved (7Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The majority of experimental evidence obtained to date favors the possibility of oxidative damage resulting in conformational changes and eventually the degradation of the D1 subunit and to a lesser extent the D2 subunit (8Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). In the accompanying paper (34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we described how we utilized the powerful ESI-MS technique to examine the D1 and D2 proteins that had been isolated from dark treated PSII reaction center preparations. The data obtained indicated the presence of molecular heterogeneity within the populations of both subunits. In the studies reported in this paper we have employed a protein mapping strategy to characterize the nature and sites of the structural modifications that result in the observed diversity. These procedures are detailed in the accompanying paper (34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Separation of the D1 and D2 protein bands to enable isolation of these subunits was performed by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the LKB 2001 vertical electrophoresis apparatus. Linear 2-mm-thick 15% non–SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea were used for this procedure. The buffer system was 0.2 m glycine, 25 mmTris-HCl, and 0.1% SDS. The reaction center samples were solubilized in an equal volume of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.9) before application to the gel (a maximum of 200 μg of chlorophyll was loaded on each gel). After the resolution of the D1 and D2 proteins by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were identified by negative staining using a 5% (w/v) solution of copper chloride in 0.2 mglycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl. The relevant bands were cut out and washed in a solution of 0.2 m glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl (elution buffer) to remove any excess copper solution. The gel slices were then reduced by incubation in a solution of 10% β-mercaptoethanol in elution buffer. Finally, the proteins were eluted from the gel slices into elution buffer using a Hoefer Scientific Instruments GT114 tube gel unit, running at 4 °C, 10 mA/tube for 4 h. The D1 and D2 proteins purified by the gel elution technique were dialyzed against 2 × 2000 ml of 20% aqueous formic acid at 4 °C for 6 h. These samples were then made up to a concentration of 70% aqueous formic acid before the digestion. A few crystals of CNBr were added to the sample solutions, and the reaction mixture was incubated in the dark for 5 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with 5 volumes of water and dialyzed against 2 × 2000 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) at 4 °C for 6 h. The appropriate amount of trypsin (1:50 w/w, enzyme:substrate) was added and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by freezing followed by lyophilization. Partial separation of the polypeptides produced by enzymatic digestion was accomplished using an Aquapore OD-300 (220 × 4.6 mm) column fitted onto a Kontron HPLC system (Datasystem 450, HPLC pump 420, detector 430, and mixer M800). The samples were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) for injection on the column. The column was held for 5 min at 0% B followed by a linear increase to 100% B (90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1. Elution was monitored at 214 and 280 nm, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The samples for manual sequencing were dried down in a glass tube and redissolved in 100 μl of Milli-Q water (purified by the Millipore system). 100 μl of a 5% solution of phenylisothiocynate in pyridine was added to each sample, and the coupling reaction was flushed with nitrogen before its incubation at 45 °C. After 1 h this reaction was terminated by removing excess reagents under a stream of nitrogen. To each of the dried samples 100 μl of trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the mixtures were incubated for a further 10 min at 45 °C, causing the cleavage of the phenylthiocarbamyl-labeled terminal amino acids to form the thiohydantoin derivative. The products of the remaining truncated peptides were subsequently dried under nitrogen and analyzed by MS without the removal of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. FAB mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons VG ZAB2 SEFPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operating at 30 kV. The instrument was calibrated using cesium iodide clusters. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. The samples were dissolved either in aqueous 5% acetic acid or in 40% propan-1-ol in aqueous 5% acetic acid (for the more hydrophobic peptides), and 1-μl aliquots were loaded onto the probe that had been treated previously with a 1:1 mixture of glycerol:monothioglycerol. These procedures are detailed in the accompanying paper (34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons VG ZAB2 SEFPD mass spectrometer fitted with a UV laser (337 nm). The instrument was calibrated using cesium iodide clusters. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. The samples were dissolved in 60% propan-1-ol in 5% aqueous, and 1-μl aliquots were loaded onto the probe that had been treated with a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid made up in a 70:30 v:v solution of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively, followed by air-drying. The MS mapping strategy used in these studies to analyze the primary structure of the D1 and D2 proteins is facilitated greatly by the availability of pure protein. Thus an alternative purification protocol enabling better separation of these PSII subunits than that reported by our HPLC purification system (described in Ref.34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was required. The D1 and D2 proteins share sequence homology and are of approximately the same mass, consequently distinct separation of these subunits is an extremely difficult task to achieve. One technique by which it has been possible to segregate these proteins is SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 15% acrylamide gels containing 6 m urea have been found to give a good separation of the two subunits. We have developed an isolation procedure based on this electrophoretic system followed by electroelution of proteins from the gel. This purification protocol was found to be far more efficient than the electroblotting procedure that we had originally developed for use in these mapping studies. The main problem encountered during the development of our purification technique was that the use of SDS had to be minimized to enable MS analysis. Fortunately, the resolution of the D1 and D2 proteins on polyacrylamide gels that did not contain SDS (in the gel matrix) was found to be similar to those with SDS (Fig.1), with the only obvious difference being that the former had a larger proportion of aggregated products. By contrast, analysis of the products after the gel elution procedure indicated that the presence of SDS had a marked effect on this step; in fact it was found that protein elution from gels that did not utilize SDS in the gel matrix was less efficient than that of the standard SDS-containing system. However, by incubating the non–SDS-containing gel slices in a buffer containing mercaptoethanol before electroelution we were able to increase the purification yields significantly. The pure forms of the D1 and D2 proteins, isolated using the gel elution technique, were extremely hydrophobic, and even slight changes in the procedure led to their precipitation. Moreover, even the propan-1-ol and 5% acetic acid solvent system, which had enabled partial purification of the D1 and D2 for ESI-MS analysis (reported in Ref. 34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), failed to elute these gel-purified proteins from the reverse phase HPLC column. Thus, special care has to be taken in handling these proteins after their isolation. We found that an effective method for mapping the D1 and D2 proteins avoided any drying or concentrating steps and instead utilized a dialysis strategy to transfer buffers. Application of two consecutive digestions, CNBr followed by trypsin digestion leading to the cleavage of all accessible methionine, arginine, and lysine residues, was found to give the greatest peptide yields. The spectrum presented in Fig. 2 was obtained by direct FAB-MS analysis of an aliquot taken from the successive CNBr and tryptic digestion mixture of the D1 protein purified by the gel elution technique. Most of the observed quaismolecular ions can be assigned to expected D1 peptides (calculated from the protein sequence derived from pea psbA gene; see Ref. 9Shapiro D.R. Tewari K.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and some important information on the primary structure can also be obtained from this spectrum. For example, as can be seen, the quasimolecular ions detected at m/z 744.4, 824.4, 900.4, and 980.4 have all been assigned to NH2-terminal tryptic peptides. The quasimolecular ions m/z 744.4 and 900.4 differ by a mass equivalent to an arginine residue (156 atomic mass units), and their molecular weights correspond to that expected for the NH2-terminal processed (des-Met) and acetylated peptides (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acetyl-Thr2-Arg7 and acetyl-Thr2-Arg8, respectively. By analogy, the quasimolecular ions m/z 824.4 and 980.4 also differ by 156 atomic mass units; these signals are both 80 atomic mass units larger than the 744 and 900 components, respectively. The 80-atomic mass unit increment can be ascribed to a phosphoryl group (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these components are likely to represent the NH2-terminal phosphorylated peptides, acetyl/phosphoryl-Thr2-Arg7 and acetyl/phosphoryl-Thr2-Arg8, respectively. Furthermore, although the spectrum is only semiquantitative, it is clear that in these samples the nonphosphorylated form predominates. Verification of these assignments was obtained after purification of the individual components. Direct FAB-MS analysis of complicated mixtures, such as the one under investigation here, often leads to suppression effects (10Morris H.R. Panico M. Barber M. Sedwick R.D. Tyler A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is usually overcome by partial separation of the digestion products; in this study we used reverse phase HPLC. All fractions correlating with regions of UV absorbance were screened by FAB-MS and ESI-MS. A large majority of the molecular ions detected during this process could be assigned to expected peptides (TableI; note that the methionine cleavage by CNBr results in the formation of homoserine, which is detected as the lactone in these experiments). These assignments have been verified by manual Edman reaction followed by MS analysis of the truncated peptides. The mass shift observed on all of these assigned components corresponds to the molecular weight of the expected NH2-terminal residue (from the nucleotide-derived protein sequence) except on the NH2-terminal tryptic peptides (Thr2-Arg7 and Thr2-Arg8) where no mass shift was detected because the D1 protein is blocked at its NH2 terminus.Table IMS mapping of the CNBr/tryptic peptides from D1 proteinPeptideFractionExpected [M+H]+Measured [M+H]+Total + 16 atomic mass units observedAcThr2-Arg728744.4744.4AcThr2-Arg828–29900.5900.4Ac/PThr2-Arg727824.4824.4Ac/PThr2-Arg827–28980.4980.4Asp9-Arg1626976.4976.5Ile38-Arg64ppt2826.92827.3Gly128-Arg136291179.61179.61Glu130-Arg13625966.4966.51Arg140-Hse172413380.93380.7Pro173-Hse18332–341135.41135.4Ile184-Hse194301266.61266.6Ile184-Hse199311916.91916.93Leu200-Hse21436–401364.71364.6His215-Arg22528–291169.61169.6Glu226-Arg23822–231499.61499.6Phe239-Arg257312188.52188.4Leu258-Arg269311459.71459.6Ala294-Arg312322114.22114.2Val313-Arg323321314.81314.92Ala324-Arg334241286.61286.62His332-Ala344301533.61533.42Asn335-Ala34431–321111.61111.6 Open table in a new tab In fractions 27–29 the four molecular ions attributed to the processed NH2-terminal peptides, which had been detected during examination of the digestion mixture, were identified. By contrast, the molecular ions representing the unprocessed NH2-terminal peptide of the D1 protein were not observed in any of the UV-absorbing fractions. The NH2-terminal processing event characterized for the pea D1 protein entails removal of the initiating formylmethionine residue followed by N-acetylation of the second residue, Thr2. This process is therefore similar to that reported for the D1 protein of spinach (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our studies have also provided direct evidence for the presence of an NH2-terminal phosphorylation site on the D1 subunits of pea plants, which is also analogous to that observed in its spinach counterpart (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though it is difficult to quantitate exactly, careful analysis of these samples indicates that the phosphorylated form occurs in approximately one-third of the D1 population. This modification would thus contribute to the heterogeneity observed by the ESI-MS analysis of the intact protein (34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of the D1 protein in most photosynthetic organisms (except Euglena) is thought to be processed to the mature form (11Keller M. Stutz E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 175: 173-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In spinach plants this event was found to result in the removal of nine amino acid residues 335–344 (3Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 420: 6-8Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, as yet there has been no direct evidence confirming the occurrence of this modification in pea plants (the organism under investigation in these studies). During our analyses of the D1 protein we did not detect the quasimolecular ion corresponding to the unprocessed COOH-terminal peptide, m/z 1679.8, Asp335-Gly353, although the quasimolecular ion at m/z 1111.6 which corresponds to the processed COOH-terminal component, Asn335-Ala344, was observed readily (Fig. 2). These findings not only provide direct evidence verifying that the D1 protein in pea plants is processed proteolytically in a way similar to that reported for spinach and other plants, but it also indicates that at least in the granal regions of thylakoid membranes (the regions from which these PSII reaction centers were isolated) there is no heterogeneity at this modification site. During the screening of the isolated products we observed that several molecular ions that corresponded to peptides of the D1 protein had additional satellite components at multiples of 16-atomic mass unit increments associated with them. The 16-atomic mass unit increment can be ascribed to an oxygen atom; thus it seems that the molecular ions with these mass increments are oxidized products. The D1 peptides found to carry this modification are presented in Table I. In some cases, for example, Glu130-Arg136 (966.4), Gly128-Arg136 (1179.6), Ala324-Arg334 (1286.6), and Ile184-Hse199 (1916.9), the quasimolecular ions corresponding to the oxidized peptides were quite prominent. On peptides Glu130-Arg136 and Gly128-Arg136, the quasimolecular ions m/z 982.4 and 1195.6, which are both 16 atomic mass units larger than the signals expected for these molecules, are the principal components detected. Similarly, for the peptide Ala324-Arg334 the main quasimolecular ion observed, at m/z 1318.6, is 32 atomic mass units heavier (addition of two oxygen atoms) than that of its calculated mass, whereas on the peptide Ile184-Hse199 quasimolecular ions at m/z 1933.1, 1949.1, and 1965.2 corresponding to additions of 16, 32, and 48 atomic mass units (one, two, and three oxygen atoms, respectively) were detected. Collectively, these results, which show the absence of oxidations on some peptides while others have up to three oxygen additions, indicate that there is a degree of specificity of this modification. According to the folding model of the D1 protein (Fig.3), which has been developed by analogy to the l-subunit of the corresponding bacterial photosynthetic unit (28Michel H. Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1-7Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar), the observed oxidation sites appear to be located primarily in two lumenal regions, the COOH-terminal region and the beginning of the fourth transmembrane segment, and one stromal region, the end of the II transmembrane segment. This group of modifications exemplifies a further source of heterogeneity which may also explain the ESI-MS data obtained for the intact D1 protein presented in the accompanying paper (34Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At the time of transferring the CNBr digestion products into the buffer required for tryptic digestion we noted a slight precipitate. This product, which could probably be attributed to the poor solubility of some extremely hydrophobic peptides, remained insoluble in the solvent conditions used to initiate the HPLC separation. To complete the analysis of the D1 protein we analyzed this precipitate by MALDI-MS, a technique that is anticipated to be more amenable to hydrophobic molecules. The D1 protein digestion mixture was centrifuged and subsequently separated into soluble and precipitated phases. Direct MALDI-MS analysis of the precipitate identified (among other signals) the quasimolecular ion, m/z 2827.3 (Fig.4). This component can be assigned to peptide Ile38-Arg64, which had not been observed previously. The quasimolecular ion at m/z 2615.3, also present in this spectrum, is yet to be assigned. It is quite clear from the above observations that the extreme hydrophobic properties coupled with the structural complexity of the D1 protein have made it a particularly difficult molecule to study; nevertheless the application of several complementary techniques has enabled a significant portion of this subunit to be mapped successfully and has also allowed characterization of several post-translational modifications. The overall map of proven MS assignments is shown in Fig. 3. Direct FAB-MS analysis of an aliquot from the successive CNBr and tryptic digestion experiment on the gel-purified D2 (Fig. 5) depicts a host of quasimolecular ions, most of which can be attributed to expected D2 peptides (derived from the pea psbD sequence; see Ref. 12Rasmussen O.F. Bookjans G. Stutmann B.M. Henningsen K.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1984; 3: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Verification of these assignments has been carried out after purification of the individual components. One of the regions mapped by this process is the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide, acetyl-Thr2-Lys7 (m/z644.4); however, unlike the D1 protein, the quasimolecular ion with an 80-atomic mass unit increment (m/z 724.4), corresponding to the phosphorylated form of this peptide, was not immediately apparent in the FAB map spectrum. Subsequently, a more rigorous analysis of the D2 protein was carried out on the partially purified digestion products obtained by reverse phase HPLC. All fractions correlating with regions of UV absorbance on the HPLC chromatogram were screened by FAB-MS and ESI-MS. A significant number of the molecular ions observed during this process could be assigned to expected D2 peptides (Table II). These assignments have been confirmed by manual Edman degradation followed by MS analysis. Collectively, the data obtained in this study have enabled a large proportion of the D2 protein to be mapped and have also revealed interesting structural information.Table IIMS mapping of the CNBr/tryptic peptides from D2 proteinPeptideFractionExpected [M+H]+Measured [M+H]+Total +16 atomic mass units observedAcThr2-Lys722644.4644.4AcThr2-Lys10261020.61020.5Asp11-Arg24341818.51818.6Trp105-Arg135403540.43539.8Leu128-Arg135241032.61032.6Gln130-Arg13523763.4763.4Ser136-Hse199ppt7241.67242.02Phe182-Hse200352380.72380.72Gly201-Arg23437–393361.43361.4Ala235-Hse247231440.61440.6Phe253-Lys265321530.71530.7Arg266-Hse28234–352133.32133.21Leu273-Arg295382428.02428.4Ser283-Arg295331282.71282.7Ser283-Arg30538–392492.52492.8Ala296-Arg305251227.61227.5Ala306-Lys31826–271547.51547.6Asn319-Arg327251041.61041.6Ala328-Arg349292622.92623.13Ala331-Arg349282234.12234.1Ala331-Leu353ppt2589.72589.4 Open table in a new tab The D2 proteins of spinach plants have been shown previously to be NH2-terminally processed (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification is similar to that reported for the D1 protein and entails the removal of the initiating methionine residue followed by N-acetylation. Michel et al. (2Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found that the NH2-terminal regions of both the D1 and D2 were phosphorylated. In this study on the D2 protein isolated from pea plants, we did not detect the quasimolecular ion corresponding to the unprocessed NH2-terminal peptide, m/z733.4 (Met1-Lys7), although the quasimolecular ion at m/z 644.4, which corresponds to the NH2-terminal processed tryptic peptide acetyl-Thr2-Lys7, was observed in fraction 22. Careful analysis of the spectra obtained from the other fractions in this region did not reveal the presence of an NH2-terminal quasimolecular ion with an 80-atomic mass unit increment which would correspond to the phosphorylated form. The anticipated quasimolecular ion of the NH2-terminal phosphorylated peptide was also not present in the direct FAB analysis of the digestion mixture. There is no reason to suppose that the quasimolecular ion from the phosphorylated peptide would not have been detected, if present, since it was clearly seen in the D1 protein. Thus, it seems that the D2 protein that we purified from pea PSII reaction center preparations is NH2-terminally processed but not phosphorylated. Several of the molecular ions that have been assigned to particular D2 peptides appear to have associated satellite signals at 16-atomic mass unit mass increments. The quasimolecular ion at m/z 2133.2 attributed to the peptide Arg266-Hse282 has only a single 16-atomic mass unit (one oxygen)"

The 5-HT1A receptor exists at particularly high densities in the hippocampus and components of the limbic system and can be divided functionally into two populations – somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus, which mediate the stimulation of K+ channels, and postsynaptic receptors elsewhere, which mediate both the stimulation of K+ channels and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (reviewed by Hoyer et al. (1Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar)). Other activities ascribed to the 5-HT1A receptor include the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (2Cowen D.S. Sowers R.S. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22297-22300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), activation of nuclear factor-κB (3Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol.

All of these actions appear to be exerted through one or more members of the Gifamily of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), which comprises Gi, Go, and Gz (5Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The 5-HT1A receptor can also interact to some extent with members of the Gq family to achieve activation of a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C depending on the cell and/or concentration of agonist (6Fargin A.

The deduced structure of the 5-HT1A receptor resembles that of the many other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) now identified (8Kobilka B.K. Frielle T. Collins S. Yang-Feng T. Kobilka T.S.

The 5-HT1A receptor is a prime target in the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of affective disorders such as anxiety and depression (10Fletcher A. Cliffe I.A. Dourish C.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Not suprisingly, a vast array of ligands—agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists—have been generated (1Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R.

Among agonists with a particularly high degree of selectivity are 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin and R-(+)-trans-8-hydroxy-2-[N-n-propyl-N-(3′-iodo-2′-propenyl)amino]tetralin (8-OH-PIPAT) (11Gozlan H.

Antagonists of a similar selectivity include 4-(2′-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2′-(n-2“-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl-piperazine (p-MPPI) and the related fluorobenzamido analogue (p-MPPF) (13Zhuang Z.-P.

The neuroleptic spiperone is also a commonly employed antagonist for the 5-HT1A receptor, although it blocks a number of other receptors as well (17Leysen J.E. Gommeren W. Laduron P.M. Biochem.

Curiously, spiperone exhibits a wide variation in K i values depending on the mode of assay, and in particular on whether it competes with radiolabeled agonists, in the presence or absence of GTP or radiolabeled antagonists (9Fargin A.

The classical model of GPCR action implies that the binding of an agonist to a receptor, e.g. serotonin to the 5-HT1A receptor, is essential for activation of the receptor and transmission of the biological signal across the plasma membrane. However, studies of several GPCRs operating through distinct G proteins have revealed that receptor activation can occur to some extent spontaneously in the absence of an agonist. Agonist-independent, or constitutive, activity has been reported for the δ-opioid, α2-adrenergic, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors expressed normally (26Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 27Tian W.N. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Deth R.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 524-531PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hilf G. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Overexpression of the β2-adrenergic receptor in a transgenic mouse model also elicits a marked set of agonist-independent responses (33Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R.

Mutations in GPCRs, introduced near the junction of the third cytoplasmic loop and transmembrane domain 6 (30Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 72: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), can dramatically enhance constitutive activity. In part to account for constitutive activity but also to explain changes in ligand affinity as a function of conformations underlying this activity, the ternary complex model has been revised to include an equilibrium between inactive (R) and active (R*) conformations of the receptor (37Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 38Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). The active conformation, which through the established equilibrium can exist in some small amount without agonist, is capable of binding to and activating a relevant G protein. Agonists bind preferentially to R* and/or R*G, and thereby shift the equilibrium toward R* as represented by agonist·R* and agonist·R*·G complexes. The discovery of constitutive receptor activity has opened the way for reclassification of “antagonists” as neutral antagonists and inverse agonists (sometimes called reverse antagonists). Neutral antagonists, through competition with agonists for binding to the receptor, block the actions of agonists but have no effect on constitutive activity. Neutral antagonists are thought to bind R and R* in an equivalent fashion, thereby preserving the existing equilibrium between these two forms of receptor. Inverse agonists not only block the actions of agonists but suppress constitutive activity. Just as agonists shift the equilibrium toward R* and R*G by selectively binding R* forms of the receptor, inverse agonists may shift the equilibrium toward R by binding the R form of receptor in preference to R* or R*G. Inverse agonism was first recognized as a property of β-carbolines at the unrelated GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor (39Braestrup C. Schmiechen R. Neef G. Nielsen M. Petersen E.N. Science. 1982; 216: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been identified for a number of GPCRs (26Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Receptors, together with selected G protein α, β, and γ subunits, can be co-expressed in intact Sf9 cells through infection with appropriate recombinant baculoviruses. Receptor activity (with or without agonist) can then be characterized in subsequently isolated membranes as a facilitation of [35S]GTPγS binding to the G protein α subunit (49Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The protocol of reconstitution and assay using Sf9 cells is particularly advantageous for the reasons that the pairing of receptor with G protein can be defined precisely, that little or no interference is imposed by endogenous receptors and G proteins, and that G protein activation is a more direct correlate of intrinsic efficacy than effector activity. We demonstrated previously the expected selectivity in receptor·G protein coupling for several receptors working through one or more of the four families of G proteins (49Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Of interest in the previous study was the observation that the 5-HT1A receptor alone of the receptors examined expressed a perceptible level of what appeared to be constitutive activity. We confirm here that the 5-HT1A receptor exhibits constitutive activity and, using this activity as a starting point, demonstrate that the Sf9 cell reconstitution model can provide a direct and quantifiable assay to distinguish neutral antagonists from inverse agonists. We find that p-MPPF is a neutral antagonist, whereas p-MPPI and spiperone, respectively, are partial and full inverse agonists. We also describe the means by which unambiguously defined populations of uncoupled and coupled receptor can be constructed in Sf9 cells, and we provide definitions of efficacy based on G protein activation and ligand displacement analysis. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the G protein subunits β1 and γ2 (50Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Essentially, Sf9 cells were propagated in suspension culture with TNM-FH medium containing charcoal-treated serum. For infection with recombinant baculoviruses, the cells were subcultured in monolayer and infected with one or more viruses at a multiplicity of infection of at least one for each virus. The medium was replaced 16 h following infection with Sf900II optimized serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were harvested at 48 h, and membranes were prepared by differential pelleting following lysis of the cells under hypotonic conditions. [35S]GTPγS binding was assayed by incubation of the membranes (20 μg of protein per assay point) with or without agonists and/or antagonists for 5 min at 30 °C with 30 nm[35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 1 μm GDP and 3 mm free Mg2+. In experiments with antagonists, membranes were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with the antagonists prior to initiating the binding assay. Immunoprecipitation of αz was accomplished with antiserum 6354 (directed toward residues 24–33 (51Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) following extraction of the membranes with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation spectrometry. The procedures of analysis were those of Kreiss et al. (52Kreiss D.S. Wieland S. Lucki I. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sf9 cell membranes were resuspended in 0.1% ice-cold perchloric acid and sonicated briefly. Membrane protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Samples were applied to a Bioanalytical Systems 480 reverse-phase microbore column (1 × 100 mm), and fractions were analyzed with an LC-4C electrochemical detector. The mobile phase consisted of 0.67 mm EDTA, 0.43 mm sodium octyl sulfate, 10 mm NaCl, 32 mm NaH2PO4, and 11% acetonitrile, pH 4.0. 5-HT, which had a retention time of 8 min, was used as a standard. The limit of detection was 0.1 nm. Binding assays were carried out in glass tubes (12 × 75 mm) in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In competition experiments, membranes (1–2 μg of protein per assay tube) were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with 0.4 nm[125I]p-MPPI (2200 Ci/mmol) or 0.4 nm [125I]8-OH-PIPAT (2200 Ci/mmol) and the competing ligands. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was filtered through glass fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell No. 32, previously soaked in 0.3% polyethelenimine), and the filters were washed with 15 ml of ice-cold wash buffer using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were counted in a 1219 Wallac (Gaithersburg, MD) γ counter at an efficiency of 75%. Nonspecific binding for [125I]p-MPPI was defined with 30 μm spiperone or 100 μm 5-HT, and that for [125I]8-OH-PIPAT was defined with 10 μm5-HT. Specific binding of these compounds at their K d values was 70 and 78%, respectively. Curve fitting and linear regression were carried out using GraphPad Prism (ISI Software). One-site and two-site fits were compared by calculating the F ratio, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered to be significant. Parameter values are quoted as means ± S.E. 5-HT, p-MPPI, and spiperone were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. p-MPPF was a gift from Drs. H. F. Kung and M.-P. Kung at the University of Pennsylvania. The radiolabeled compounds were obtained from NEN Life Science Products or provided by Drs. H. F. Kung and M.-P. Kung. Sf9 cells expressing the human 5-HT1A receptor and Gz (i.e. αz, β1, and γ2) were used to explore the properties of compounds that bind to the 5-HT1A receptor. Gz is a member of the Gi family and has been used extensively by us to study the coupling of the receptor to G proteins (47Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The chief advantage of Gz is that it does not bind significant levels of [35S]GTPγS when expressed alone and thus affords a clear picture of activation achieved through the receptor. Activation is equated here with the binding of [35S]GTPγS to αz in Sf9 cell membranes as quantitated following immunoprecipitation. A fraction of Gz co-expressed with the 5-HT1Areceptor was found to assume an activated state in the presence of [35S]GTPγS but absence of added agonist (Fig.1, hatched column). As implied above, the activation was not achieved if Gz was expressed without the receptor (49Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation was not the consequence of 5-HT carried over from the medium used in cell culture. Serum-free conditions were employed during the time at which the 5-HT1A receptor was expressed, and no 5-HT was detected in membranes by direct analysis. These data demonstrate that the 5-HT1A receptor expressed in Sf9 cells exhibits a discernible level of constitutive activity. The receptor is not fully active, however, as 5-HT promoted further activation of Gz(Fig. 1, curve). The activation by 5-HT was dose-dependent, characterized by an EC50(14 ± 6 nm) comparable to that determined in mammalian cells. The compounds p-MPPI, p-MPPF, and spiperone are known to be antagonists of 5-HT at the 5-HT1A receptor (13Zhuang Z.-P. Kung M.-P. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1406-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Kung H.F. Kung M.-P. Clarke W. Maayani S. Zhuang Z.-P.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, all three compounds completely inhibited the activation of Gz evoked by 5-HT. IC50 values of p-MPPI, p-MPPF, and spiperone (at 100 nm 5-HT) were about 30, 40, and 310 nm, respectively. Of interest was the observation in these experiments that spiperone, and possibly to some extent p-MPPI, might actually suppress the activation of Gz to a level below that attributed to constitutive receptor activity. Such an action would represent a property of inverse agonism. The possibility was explored further, as shown for the receptor incubated without 5-HT in Fig.2 B. p-MPPF had no effect on constitutive activity at a concentration shown above to be sufficient to block the response to 100 nm 5-HT, and p-MPPI suppressed activity by only a small extent (16 ± 5%, which is significant (p < 0.01)). An almost complete suppression of constitutive activity, however, was achieved with spiperone. The IC50 for this action was 68 nm. These data imply that p-MPPF is a neutral antagonist, p-MPPI is a weak inverse agonist, and spiperone is a full inverse agonist. The effect of spiperone on constitutive receptor activity was completely reversed by p-MPPF (Fig.3). A similar reversal was achieved with p-MPPI, with the response returning to that observed in the presence of p-MPPI alone. These results confirm that the 5-HT1A receptor is the site of action for spiperone and that the constitutive activity of the receptor is not attributable to 5-HT carried over from the cell culture medium. Importantly, the data as a whole demonstrate that the direct activation of a G protein as reconstituted in Sf9 cells can serve as a monitor of constitutive activity and can thereby be used to distinguish inverse agonists from neutral antagonists. The ternary complex model predicts that spiperone, as an inverse agonist, would have a higher affinity for the receptor in the absence of Gz than in its presence, whereas a neutral antagonist would have an equal affinity in both cases. Initial binding experiments with [3H]spiperone were unsuccessful due to the high level of nonspecific binding at the high concentrations required. We therefore carried out competition assays using [125I]p-MPPI as the radioligand, on the basis that this compound is a nearly neutral antagonist and might bind to coupled and uncoupled forms of the receptor equivalently (the ready availability of p-MPPI over p-MPPF as a radioiodinated ligand was conducive to this and subsequent assays). Scatchard analysis of [125I]p-MPPI binding to Sf9 cell membranes expressing the 5-HT1A receptor alone and together with Gz gave K d values of 0.46 ± 0.06 and 0.51 ± 0.03 nm, respectively (n = 6) (data not shown). The binding of [125I]p-MPPI under the two conditions with apparently equal affinity provided the basis for determining whether other ligands might discriminate between coupled and uncoupled forms of receptor. Displacement of [125I]p-MPPI by 5-HT in the presence of Gz was best fit by a two-site model, wherein about 30% of the receptor exhibited high affinity for 5-HT (K i = 6 ± 3 nm), and the remainder exhibited low affinity (K i = 590 ± 60 nm) (Fig. 4 A). Despite the high level of expression of receptor and G protein, therefore, only one-third of the receptor was found to preexist in a coupled state or to enter into a coupled state consequent to binding 5-HT. In the absence of Gz, 5-HT displaced [125I]p-MPPI binding in a monophasic manner with uniformly low affinity (K i = 640 ± 100 nm). These data represent the first measurement of the “K H /K L ” ratio, a commonly employed index of efficacy, for 5-HT using a single G protein (the ratio is about 100). Displacement of [125I]p-MPPI by p-MPPF, as anticipated, was about the same regardless of G protein (K i = 3.5 ± 0.4 and 3.1 ± 0.3 nm in the absence and presence of G protein, respectively) (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained using p-MPPI to displace [125I]p-MPPI (K i = 2.4 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.1 nm, respectively) (data not shown). To our initial surprise, displacement curves with spiperone were essentially unaffected by G protein (K i = 60 ± 6 nm and 83 ± 9 nm, respectively) (Fig.4 C). Assuming that Gz couples to only 30% of the receptor in the absence of agonist (it may well be less), a difference in affinity of spiperone for uncoupled and coupled forms of the receptor greater than ∼20–30-fold would be required for a biphasic displacement to be clearly resolved. An assay to selectively label the G protein-coupled form of receptor was therefore designed. For labeling, we used the agonist [125I]8-OH-PIPAT. [125I]8-OH-PIPAT binds the 5-HT1A receptor only in the presence of G protein (47Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

K., Kusari, J., Bandyopadhyay, S. K., Samanta, H., Kumar, R., and Sen, G. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15293–15299). Sequence comparison of this region among the different isozymes of 2–5(A) synthetases revealed that the residues at positions 330 to 333 are highly conserved. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of these residues demonstrated that the residues present at 331, 332, and 333 are important for activity but the proline at position 330 was dispensable. The triple mutant containing Ala residues at 331, 332, and 333 was completely inactive. Different double mutants were slightly active, and the three single mutants were partially active. The triple mutant was further characterized for delineating the nature of its defect. The mutant protein was enzymatically inactive irrespective of whether it was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, Escherichia coli or Trichoplusia niinsect cells. It could bind double-stranded RNA and ATP as efficiently as the wild type protein. It was, however, defective in oligomerization. Gel filtration and sedimentation velocity analyses of in vitro synthesized proteins revealed that the wild type protein, but not the triple mutant, formed tetramers. The tetrameric fraction, but not the monomeric fraction of the wild type protein was enzymatically active. The failure of the triple mutant to participate in homomeric protein-protein interaction was confirmed by in vivo assays in insect cells. These results indicate that tetramerization of the protein is required for the enzymatic activity of the small 2–5(A) synthetases.

Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar, 2Hovanessian A. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These enzymes require double-stranded RNA as a co-factor and they polymerize ATP into 2–5(A), which activates the latent ribonuclease, RNase L. In an interferon-treated cell, virus infection often causes the production of dsRNA, which activates 2–5(A) synthetases leading to the production of 2–5(A), activation of RNase L, and degradation of cellular RNA. The 2–5(A) synthetase/RNase L pathway is responsible for mediating interferon's antiviral effect against picornavirus, and the same pathway has also been implicated in the antigrowth effects of interferon. Another interferon-induced enzyme that requires dsRNA as a co-factor is the protein kinase, PKR (1Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology.

The dsRNA-binding domain of PKR overlaps with its dimerization domain (5Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M.J. Williams B.R.G. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There are three size classes of 2–5(A) synthetases: large, medium, and small (2Hovanessian A. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The different isozymes are structurally related, and there is strong sequence conservation across the species (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large human synthetase is 100 kDa, and the medium synthetase is 69 kDa. The small synthetases have molecular weights ranging from 40 to 46 kDa (13Marie I. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two human small synthetases, E16 and E18, that are the products of alternatively spliced mRNAs of the same gene (14Chebath J. Benech P. Revel M. Vigneron M. Nature. 1987; 330: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There are three murine small synthetases: 9-2 and 3-9 isozymes are the products of two alternatively spliced mRNA (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas L3 is encoded by a separate gene (15Ichii Y. Fukunaga R. Shiojiri S. Sokawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 10117Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The different isozymes reside in different subcellular compartments. Their specific subcellular locations are sometimes dictated by their specific post-translational modifications. The small synthetases can form tetramers, whereas the medium synthetase exists as a dimer (16Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned the cDNA of the murine 9-2 isozyme and have been investigating its structure-function relationship (12Ghosh S.K.

We have reported that the loss of as little as 9 residues from the amino terminus of the protein inactivates it (18Ghosh A. Desai S.Y. Sarkar S.N. Ramaraj P. Ghosh S.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15452-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crucial residue within this region is proline at the 7th position. A mutant, P7Q, is enzymatically inactive. However, it can bind dsRNA and ATP, and the mutant protein can tetramerize like the wild type protein. In this report, we have investigated the properties of another class of 9-2 mutants which carry mutations near the carboxyl terminus. We have previously shown that a C-terminally truncated protein containing residues 1–344 is enzymatically active, but another deletion mutant containing residues 1–320 is inactive (12Ghosh S.K.

In this study, we have identified specific residues present between residues 320 and 344 that are required for enzymatic activity. A triple mutant containing alanine substitutions at position 331, 332, and 333 was enzymatically inactive. The mutant protein could bind dsRNA and ATP, but it failed to oligomerize. These results indicate that tetramerization of the protein is needed for its enzyme activity.

In vitro translated proteins were analyzed at room temperature on a 1 × 50-cm Sephacryl S300 column. The column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 450 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. 25 μl of in vitro translation product was diluted with 300 μl of the above buffer and applied to the column. 270-μl fractions were collected. Proteins in 200 μl of the fractions were precipitated by adding 1.0 ml of acetone in the presence of 50 μg of bovine serum albumin. The precipitates were dissolved in gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 9-2 protein bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The marker proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. FLAG-tagged radiolabeled WT 9-2 protein was synthesized in vitro. It was size fractionated by gel filtration as described above and the tetrameric and the monomeric fractions were pooled separately. The pooled fractions were mixed with anti-FLAG antibody bound to Sepharose in the gel filtration buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were centrifuged down, washed with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 °C. Some portions of the beads were analyzed by gel electrophoresis for quantitating the amounts of bound proteins. Equal amounts of tetrameric and monomeric proteins, bound to the beads, were incubated for 2 h with frequent mixing for activity assay.

WT and recombinant viruses were propagated in confluent monolayers of S. frugiperdacells (SF21), and high levels of proteins were expressed in T. ni cells (High five). The cells were cultured at 27 °C in Grace's supplemented insect media containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum that has been tested for insect cell growth and antibiotic and antimycotic reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The desired cDNA constructs of hexahistidine-tagged 9-2 proteins were cloned in PFastBac plasmid at the XbaI-XhoI sites. Recombinant clones were identified, and the plasmid DNA was used to transform DH10Bac cells. Colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by the loss of β-galactosidase activity. High molecular weight bacmid DNA was prepared and used to transfect S. frugiperda cells using cellfectin reagent. The culture media were collected and stored as virus stocks at −70 °C. Virus titers were measured by plaque assays using the same cells. For protein expression, T. ni (High five) cells were infected with the appropriate recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Cells were harvested after 40 h, washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C by sonication for 6 min, using four 30-s pulses in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The cell extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C for further analysis. High five cells were infected with appropriate recombinant viruses either singly or in combinations. When two viruses were used, equal quantities of each (5 plaque-forming units/cell) were used. Cell extracts were made as described above. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins present in these extracts was done as described before (18Ghosh A. Desai S.Y. Sarkar S.N. Ramaraj P. Ghosh S.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15452-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The anti-FLAG Sepharose beads were presoaked in uninfected cell extract (5 mg/ml protein) for 15 min at 4 °C with rotary shaking. This was followed by incubation with the test extract, at 15 mg/ml of protein, for 1 h at 4 °C with rotary shaking. The beads were washed five times before analysis of the bound proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The murine 9-2 isozyme of 2–5(A) synthetase has 414 residues. By deletion analysis, we have previously shown (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the protein can be truncated from the carboxyl terminus removing residues 345–414 without a loss of enzyme activity. Further deletion of residues 321–344, however, inactivated the protein completely. To obtain indications of what specific residues might be important, we compared the amino acid sequence of this region with those of the corresponding regions of other isozymes of 2–5(A) synthetase (Fig.1). Among the small synthetases, the residues are completely conserved among mouse 9-2 and 3-9 and human E16 and E18 proteins. The mouse isozyme L3, on the other hand, has only partial homology. The same is true for the medium synthetase P69. Since L3 and P69 were the most divergent isozymes and residues 330, 331, and 332 were conserved even in these proteins, we decided to focus on their roles in 9-2 activity. We added residue 333 to this list, although it was not conserved in L3 and we have previously shown that in 9-2 it can be mutated to Arg without a loss of activity. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was done to residues 330–333 singly or in combination for assessing their roles in 9-2 enzyme activity. The single mutants were partially active (Fig.2). The 330 mutant was almost as active as the WT protein suggesting that the proline residue at that position is not essential. The other three single mutants were 15–20% as active as the WT protein. Since mutations of residues 331, 332, or 333 caused severe impairments of activity, we decided to focus on these 3 residues. Three double mutants, combining the three mutations in pairs, were generated first. They had even less activities than the single mutants. When all three mutations were combined, the triple mutant (TM) was completely inactive. We wanted to ensure that the observed loss of activity of the TM is not a consequence of its synthesis in vitro in the reticulocyte system. We have previously shown that the 9-2 protein can be expressed in E. coli, and the WT protein has high enzyme activity (17Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The bacterial system was used to produce the TM protein as well, and equal amounts of partially purified WT and TM proteins were assayed for enzyme activity. The bacterially produced TM was also inactive (Fig. 3, A and B). We have recently developed a baculovirus expression system for producing the 9-2 protein in insect cells. 2S. Bandyopadhyay, A. Ghosh, S. N. Sarkas, and G. C. Sen, unpublished results. Since large amounts of proteins can be synthesized in insect cells and their post-translational modifications are similar to those in mammalian cells, this system is sometimes preferable to the bacterial expression systems. As shown in Fig. 3 C, both the WT and the TM 9-2 proteins were highly expressed in insect cells infected with the corresponding viruses carrying the 9-2 genes. Infection with the viral vector alone did not cause the production of any cross-reacting protein. Again, the WT protein was highly active (Fig. 3, Dand E), but the TM protein had no enzymatic activity. These results demonstrated that the TM Protein was inactive irrespective of its source, which included rabbit reticulocyte lysate, E. coli, and insect cells. Once we established that the TM was inactive, we wanted to examine its other properties. We used dsRNA-agarose and ATP-agarose as affinity matrices to evaluate the ability of the TM to bind to its substrate and co-factor. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the TM could bind to poly(I)·poly(C)-agarose as efficiently as the WT protein. Under our experimental conditions, about 30% of the input in vitrotranslated protein bound to the affinity resin. Similarly, both WT and TM proteins bound to ATP-agarose equally well (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we could not detect any deficiency of the TM with respect to its interaction with the substrate and the co-factor. Next, we investigated the oligomerization property of the TM. We have previously used sedimentation velocity gradient analysis to show that in vitro synthesized 9-2 protein can form tetramers (18Ghosh A. Desai S.Y. Sarkar S.N. Ramaraj P. Ghosh S.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15452-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, which use a high salt concentration for avoiding nonspecific aggregation of proteins, about 15% of the input WT 9-2 protein existed as a tetramer. However, for the TM, the tetrameric complex was not detectable (Fig.5). This result suggested that the induced mutations could have affected the oligomerization property of the protein. To confirm this conclusion, we performed a gel filtration assay, similar to the one originally used by Hovanessian and his colleagues (16Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to demonstrate that small synthetases exist as tetramers. In vitro translated radiolabeled proteins were chromatographed on a Sephacryl S300 column; proteins in different fractions were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the 9-2 bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig.6, the wild type protein was separated into several size classes: one peak was at the monomeric position, another was at the position of a dimer, and there was a distinct peak at the tetrameric position of 200 kDa. In contrast, the tetrameric peak was absent for the triple mutant; this protein was almost totally monomeric.Figure 6Gel filtration chromatography.Radiolabeled WT and TM proteins were analyzed by chromatography on Sephacryl S300. The positions of the different molecular weight markers are noted at the top. Synthetase protein present in each fraction is presented as percent of total.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since analysis of the in vitro synthesized proteins suggested that the TM is defective in multimerization, we wanted to examine this property further by using the mutant protein expressed in insect cells. In Fig. 7, we used a co-immunoprecipitation assay that detects in vivo homomeric interaction of the 9-2 protein. Cells were simultaneously infected with two viruses, one carrying a FLAG-tagged 9-2 gene and another carrying a non-tagged WT or TM 9-2 gene. Cell extracts were mixed with FLAG antibody bound to Sepharose; the Sepharose beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted, separated by gel electrophoresis, and detected by Western blotting using a synthetase antibody. The FLAG-tagged and the untagged proteins could be distinguished by their differences in mobility. Comparable amounts of the tagged and untagged proteins were synthesized in infected cells for both WT and TM viruses (Fig. 7, lanes 1–5). As expected, from cells infected with single viruses, the protein bound to the affinity matrix only if it contained the FLAG-tag (Fig. 7, lanes 6, 7, and 9). But with co-infections, the WT-untagged protein co-purified with the FLAG-tagged protein because of protein-protein interactions (Fig. 7, lane 8). On the other hand, the triple mutant failed to interact with the FLAG-tagged protein (Fig. 7,lane 10), although they were present in the same cells (Fig.7, lane 5). These results clearly demonstrate that the TM lacks the ability to interact with itself and thus form a tetramer. The above results suggested that the lack of activity of the TM is due to its failure to form tetramers. One would expect, therefore, that monomeric WT 9-2 protein is also inactive, whereas the tetrameric form is active. This possibility was tested in the experiment shown in Fig.8. A large quantity of FLAG-tagged radiolabeled WT 9-2 protein was synthesized in vitro, and the tetrameric and monomeric forms were separated by gel filtration. Fractions containing the two forms were pooled separately, and the proteins were recovered by binding to anti-FLAG antibody bound to Sepharose (Fig. 8 A). Equal amounts of the tetrameric and monomeric forms of the protein were assayed for enzyme activity (Fig.8 B). For the tetramer, over a 6-fold range, enzyme activity increased linearly with increasing concentrations of the protein (Fig.8 C). The monomer was, however, totally inactive even at the highest concentration tested. These results provide biochemical evidence for the conclusion that the 9-2 protein requires tetramerization for its enzymatic activity. Deletion analysis of the 9-2 protein in our previous studies had indicated the importance of the residues 321–344. A truncated protein containing the residues 1–320 could bind dsRNA, but it did not have enzyme activity (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of 24 more residues to the carboxyl terminus restored the activity fully. In the current study, we have focused on this region of the protein with the purpose of identifying the crucial residues. We took advantage of the strongly conserved sequences among the different synthetases for doing homology search. Comparison of the 9-2 sequence with those of the L3 and the P69 proteins was very useful. The longest contiguous stretch of conserved residues within this region spanned residues 330–334, and we performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis to this region of the protein. Although we originally expected the proline at 330 to be the crucial residue, its mutation to alanine did not affect the activity of the 9-2 protein. In contrast, individual mutations of Cys at 331, Phe at 332, and Lys at 333 reduced the enzyme activity considerably. The double mutants were even less active, and the triple mutant was completely inactive. We, thus, identified a stretch of 3 residues, CFK, whose mutation to AAA completely destroyed the protein's enzymatic activity. We decided to express the mutant protein in three different systems, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, E. coli, and insect cells. The wild type protein expressed in all three systems was active, but the TM was inactive irrespective of its source. These results suggest that the introduced mutations affect a fundamental property of the protein and not its putative interaction with post-translational modification enzymes, which are different in the three different systems of expression used by us. As expected from the previous knowledge of the location of the dsRNA (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ATP-binding sites on the protein (21Kon N. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the TM bound dsRNA and ATP as efficiently as the wild type protein. The mutant protein, however, was defective in forming tetramers. This result strongly suggests that the tetrameric structure is the enzymatically active form. The above suggestion was vindicated by our biochemical analysis. Activity measurements of physically separated tetrameric and monomeric WT proteins showed that only the tetrameric fraction was enzymatically active. Hovanessian and his colleagues (16Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the small synthetases exist as tetramers, and the medium synthetase exists as a dimer. Since the medium synthetase has two homologous domains, each of which has strong homology with the small synthetases (13Marie I. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they postulated that for both isozymes the active center is formed by the juxtaposition of four identical domains. The four domains are presumably supplied by four polypeptides in the case of the small synthetases, whereas two molecules of the medium synthetase, each containing two domains, are sufficient. Our mutational results clearly support this model. Consequently, we would expect that the same mutations, if introduced to the P69 protein, would also inactivate that protein by preventing its dimerization. This prediction remains to be experimentally tested. We do not have enough information yet to understand how the mutated residues affect oligomerization. Although a cysteine residue is included in the mutated region, disulfide bridge formation is probably not involved in the oligomerization process. The above conclusion is made because of the observations that oligomerization of the wild type protein, as measured by size fractionations and protein-protein interaction assay, is not affected by the presence of reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. Moreover, the C331A mutant was partially active, thus suggesting that the cysteine residue is not indispensable. Even though the TM failed to score positive in the protein-protein interaction assay, it would be premature to conclude that the mutated residues actually reside at the interacting site. The introduced mutations could have altered the conformation of the protein in such a way that the contact point at a different location of the protein would be distorted. These issues will be resolved when the pathway to tetramer formation is better understood. Although several alternative scenarios can be envisioned, the simplest steps will be dimerization of the protein followed by further dimerization of the dimers. The existence of dimers as intermediates is indicated in the results shown in Fig. 6. For the wild type protein, there was clearly a peak at the expected position of a dimer. For the mutant, although there was no peak at the position of the tetramer, the putative dimer peak was there. Thus, it seems that the triple mutant can form dimers but not tetramers. In that case, why does it score negative in the protein-protein interaction assay? The apparent discrepancy could be due to the different conditions used for the two assays. The protein interaction assay used a more stringent condition to eliminate nonspecific interactions, and that might have been too harsh a condition for maintaining dimeric interaction of the mutant protein. Clearly, more definitive assays need to be developed in the future to gain further insights. The presence of intermediate dimeric peaks in the gel filtration analysis of the triple mutant (Fig. 6) suggests that it may be able to form unstable oligomers that dissociate at a faster rate as compared with the WT oligomers. The enzymatically inactive triple mutant may be useful for exploring the cellular activities of 2–5(A) synthetases. Because it does not oligomerize with the wild type protein, it does not inhibit its activity in vitro. 3A. Ghosh, S. N. Sarkar, W. Guo, S. Bandyopadhyay, and G. C. Sen, unpublished observation. Thus, the mutant will probably not be useful as a trans-dominant inhibitor in vivo. It could, however, be useful as a sink for dsRNA in virus-infected cells. It would be interesting to examine if interferon can inhibit picornavirus replication in a cell overexpressing the triple mutant. Similarly, the triple mutant, being enzymatically inactive, will be a good tool for identifying cellular proteins that interact with 2–5(A) synthetases in vivo. The wild type protein is unsuited for that purpose because its expression causes cellular toxicity.

However, unlike that of other epithelia, little is known of the regulation of Cl− channels in salivary gland cells, in particular regulation by purinergic (P2) receptors.In the intact salivary gland secretion is regulated by several agonists, which include cholinergic, α-adrenergic, and β-adrenergic agonists (6Martin C.J.

The agonists act on both acinar and duct cells but modulate different activities in the two cell types. In acinar cells the agonists stimulate secretion primarily by stimulation of the basolateral NaKCl2 cotransporter (9Evans R. Turner J.R. J.

J. 1994; 255: 291-300Google Scholar), in the present work we studied the regulation of Cl− channel activity by P2 receptors in SMG duct and acinar cells. For the purpose of these studies it was necessary to characterize and localize the P2 receptors in the two cell types. Measurements of [Ca2+] i and Cl− current were used to show that SMG acinar and duct cells express at least two types of P2 receptors, a P2z and a P2u receptor. The action of the P2u receptors required the activation of G proteins, whereas that of the P2z receptors was independent of G proteins. Microperfusion of the SMG duct localized the P2z receptors in the luminal membrane and the P2u receptors in the basolateral membrane. In a companion study (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) we show that the two P2 receptors activate different Cl− channels that reside in the same membrane as the respective receptor.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to defined and localize the P2 receptors expressed in SMG acinar and duct cells. The overall evidence supports the presence of at least two separate types of P2 receptors that are expressed in specific membranes of SMG cells.Measurement of [Ca2+] i and Cl− current in the present and companion study (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) clearly shows the presence of P2z receptors in SMG acinar and duct cells. Thus, BzATP increases [Ca2+] i in intercalated, granular, and the main duct and in acinar cells. BzATP also activated the Cl− current in both cell types. The only P2 receptor responsive to BzATP and ATP but not to all the other nucleotides tested described so far is the P2z receptor (33Nuttle L.C. El-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 93-101PubMed Google Scholar).The situation was less clear concerning the presence of P2u receptors since UTP had minimal effect on [Ca2+] i in SMG cells. However, expression of P2u receptors in these cells is supported by the findings that at low concentrations UTP activated the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 100 μm UTP acted only from the basolateral membrane of the perfused duct, and, most importantly, inhibition of G proteins with GDPβS almost completely inhibited the effect of UTP on the Cl− current without affecting the ability of BzATP to stimulate the current in both cell types. The latter finding indicates that UTP acts through a G protein-coupled receptor to mobilize Ca2+ and activate the Cl− current.The expression of more than one P2 receptor that can increase [Ca2+] i and activate the Cl− current in SMG cells and the relatively small signals stimulated by UTP prevented definitive identification of the receptor activated by UTP. Unlike a previous study (38), pharmacological analysis with various nucleotides was not successful in our study to show the expression of P2Y1 receptors in SMG duct cells. A recent study reported the inducation of the P2Y2 receptor type in SMG acinar and duct cells when maintained in primary culture (23Turner J.T. Weizman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular analysis (23Turner J.T. Weizman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the small effect of UTP on [Ca2+] i reported here support the possibility that the P2Y2receptors are present at low levels in freshly isolated SMG cells. However, activation of the P2Y2 receptors must have increased [Ca2+] i to sufficiently high levels next to the plasma membrane to activate the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The use of the perfused duct allowed us to localize the P2z receptors to the luminal membrane of SMG duct cells. Although ATP stimulated duct cells when applied to the apical or basolateral membrane, BzATP affected [Ca2+] i only from the luminal side. UTP up to 100 μm acted only from the basolateral side, suggesting that SMG duct cells express the P2Y2 receptors in the basolateral membrane. The expression of these receptor subtypes in the respective membranes is quite specific to SMG and maybe to all salivary glands. Other CFTR-expressing epithelia, such as the airway and nasal epithelia, express P2Y2 or P2Y6receptors in the luminal membrane and P2Y3receptors in the basolateral membrane (3Boucher R.C. Am. J.

The unique property of the P2z receptor expressed in the luminal membrane of SMG cells is that this receptor also acts as an ion channel that can conduct Ca2+, Na+, and K+(33Nuttle L.C.

It would therefore be of interest to determine the type of Cl− channels activated by the P2z receptor and the role of [Ca2+] i in such activation. This, together with the characterization of the Cl− channels activated by the basolateral P2u receptors, is described in our companion study (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Acinar cells secrete the primary, NaCl-rich fluid into the duct, which reabsorbs most of the NaCl in exchange for K+-HCO3− (1Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). As in any other CFTR-expressing tissues (2Quinton P.M. Curr.

Oxford University Press, New York1996: 309-388Google Scholar), Cl− channels play a central role in transcellular ion transport in the two cell types of SMG (1Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). However, unlike that of other epithelia, little is known of the regulation of Cl− channels in salivary gland cells, in particular regulation by purinergic (P2) receptors. In the intact salivary gland secretion is regulated by several agonists, which include cholinergic, α-adrenergic, and β-adrenergic agonists (6Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflugers Archiv. 1971; 327: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Denniss A.R. Schneyer L.H. Sucanthanpree C. Young J.A. Am. J.

The agonists act on both acinar and duct cells but modulate different activities in the two cell types. In acinar cells the agonists stimulate secretion primarily by stimulation of the basolateral NaKCl2 cotransporter (9Evans R. Turner J.R. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the duct the same agonists reduce the transepithelial potential and Na+ reabsorption (6Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflugers Archiv. 1971; 327: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Denniss A.R. Schneyer L.H. Sucanthanpree C. Young J.A. Am. J.

Work on the cellular level showed that cholinergic and α-adrenergic agonists act on salivary acinar and duct cells to increase [Ca2+] i (10Valdez I.H. Turner J.R. Am. J.

Salivary acinar and duct cells also respond to purinergic stimulation by a change in [Ca2+] i (15Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J.

However, the identity of the receptors and their membrane localization is not clear. Response of duct cells to BzATP and several other nucleotides suggested that duct cells express P2z and P2Y1 receptors (37Amsallem H. Metioui M. Vander-Abeele A. Elyamani A. Moran A. Dehaye J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1546-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Response of acinar cells to BzATP was interpreted to suggest that acinar cells express P2z receptors (20Hurley T.W. Ryan M.P.

J. 1994; 255: 291-300Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that acinar and duct cells in long term culture up-regulate the P2Y2 receptors (23Turner J.T. Weizman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J.

However, whether native and freshly isolated cells express P2Y2receptors and how these and other purinergic receptors regulate cellular activity is not known.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 100 μm UTP acted only from the basolateral membrane of the perfused duct, and, most importantly, inhibition of G proteins with GDPβS almost completely inhibited the effect of UTP on the Cl− current without affecting the ability of BzATP to stimulate the current in both cell types. The latter finding indicates that UTP acts through a G protein-coupled receptor to mobilize Ca2+ and activate the Cl− current. The expression of more than one P2 receptor that can increase [Ca2+] i and activate the Cl− current in SMG cells and the relatively small signals stimulated by UTP prevented definitive identification of the receptor activated by UTP. Unlike a previous study (38), pharmacological analysis with various nucleotides was not successful in our study to show the expression of P2Y1 receptors in SMG duct cells. A recent study reported the inducation of the P2Y2 receptor type in SMG acinar and duct cells when maintained in primary culture (23Turner J.T. Weizman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular analysis (23Turner J.T. Weizman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the small effect of UTP on [Ca2+] i reported here support the possibility that the P2Y2receptors are present at low levels in freshly isolated SMG cells. However, activation of the P2Y2 receptors must have increased [Ca2+] i to sufficiently high levels next to the plasma membrane to activate the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The use of the perfused duct allowed us to localize the P2z receptors to the luminal membrane of SMG duct cells. Although ATP stimulated duct cells when applied to the apical or basolateral membrane, BzATP affected [Ca2+] i only from the luminal side. UTP up to 100 μm acted only from the basolateral side, suggesting that SMG duct cells express the P2Y2 receptors in the basolateral membrane. The expression of these receptor subtypes in the respective membranes is quite specific to SMG and maybe to all salivary glands. Other CFTR-expressing epithelia, such as the airway and nasal epithelia, express P2Y2 or P2Y6receptors in the luminal membrane and P2Y3receptors in the basolateral membrane (3Boucher R.C. Am. J.

The unique property of the P2z receptor expressed in the luminal membrane of SMG cells is that this receptor also acts as an ion channel that can conduct Ca2+, Na+, and K+(33Nuttle L.C.

The cation selectivity of the P2z receptor (33Nuttle L.C. El-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 93-101PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bretschnedier F. Klapperstuck M. Lohn M. Markwandt T. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 426: 691-698Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) makes it unlikely that the receptor directly mediates the Cl− current. It would therefore be of interest to determine the type of Cl− channels activated by the P2z receptor and the role of [Ca2+] i in such activation. This, together with the characterization of the Cl− channels activated by the basolateral P2u receptors, is described in our companion study (29Zeng W.-Z. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

PDGF is a disulfide-linked dimer of two related polypeptide chains, designated A and B, which are assembled as heterodimers (PDGF AB) or homodimers (PDGF AA and PDGF BB) (7Herren B. Rooney B.

PDGF exerts its biological activity by binding to structurally similar α- or β-PDGFRs, inducing receptor dimerization and intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (10Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

The next step in PDGFR signaling involves receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine, which creates the sites for physical interactions with a number of proteins that contain Src homology region 2 domains, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase Cγ, Src, Grb2, and Nck (for review, see Ref. 17Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions effect the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that mediate calcium and lipid metabolism, gene expression, changes in cell morphology, and cell replication. The PDGFRs belong to a subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, c-Kit, and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor, c-Fms. These type III receptor tyrosine kinases are characterized by an extracellular ligand-binding region comprising five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1–D5), a single transmembrane-spanning region, and a split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (18Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 19Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).

The objective of this study was to further characterize the functional roles of the extracellular Ig-like domains of the PDGFRs using domain-specific mAbs and receptor deletion mutants. PDGFR extracellular domain was purified from CHO cell conditioned media as described previously (8Fretto L.J. Snape A.J. Tomlinson J.E. Seroogy J.J. Wolf D.L. LaRochelle W.J. Giese N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3625-3631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing standard techniques (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg of α- or β-PDGFR protein and additional boosts were given every 2 weeks until a high serum titer was achieved. Spleens of mice with high serum titer were isolated, and their splenocytes were fused with P3X cells. Positive hybridomas were identified and cloned, and ascites fluid was prepared in BALB/c mice. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in New Zealand White rabbits immunized and boosted with 250 μg of α- or β-PDGFR extracellular domain protein. All antibodies were purified on Sepharose-protein A. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-α- or anti-β-PDGFR mAbs (∼0.3 nm) were incubated alone or together with non-conjugated homologous or heterologous mAbs (0.1–30 nm) in 96-well plates with plastic-immobilized PDGFR. After 1 h at 25 °C, wells were washed, ABTS™ was added, and the amount of bound mAb was detected by monitoring the rate of product formation at 650 nm using a plate reader (Molecular Devices). The α- and β-PDGFR c-DNAs were isolated form a human placental cDNA library (28Escobedo J.A. Navankasatussas S. Cousens L.S. Coughlin S.R. Bell G.I. Williams L.T. Science. 1988; 240: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Standard mutagenesis techniques were used to introduce translation termination codons or internal deletions (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The α-PDGFR mutant that encodes the full-length extracellular region, αR(D1–D5), was generated by introducing a translation stop at codon 525 (8Fretto L.J. Snape A.J. Tomlinson J.E. Seroogy J.J.

Mutants encoding larger carboxyl-terminal deletions, αR(D1–D4), αR(D1–D3), αR(D1–D2), and αR(D1) were made by introducing a translation termination at codons 413, 314, 213, and 125, respectively. αR(D2–D3) contained an internal deletion made by fusing codon 23 to codon 123 and a translation termination signal at codon 314. β-PDGFR cDNA encoding the extracellular domain, βR(D1–D5), was generated by introducing a translation stop at codon 532 (8Fretto L.J.

Mutant c-DNAs encoding larger carboxyl-terminal deletions, βR(D1–D4), βR(D1–D3), βR(D1–D2), and βR(D1) were constructed by introducing a translational stop at codons 415, 315, 214, and 124, respectively. Mutant c-DNAs encoding progressively larger amino-terminal deletions, βR(D2–D5), βR(D3–D5), βR(D4–D5), and βR(D5) were made by fusing codon 34 to codons 124, 214, 315, and 415, respectively; each had a stop codon at position 532. The c-DNA encoding βR(D2–D3) had codon 34 fused to codon 124 and a translation termination signal at codon 315. Following mutagenesis, each PDGFR cDNA variant was sequenced by automated dye-terminator cycle sequencing using Ampli-Taq FS (30Smith L.M. Sanders J.Z. Kaiser R.J. Hughes P. Dodd C. Connell C.R.

For transient expression, COS-7 cells were transfected with pBJ-1 PDGFR constructs using standard calcium phosphate precipitation methods and secreted PDGFR proteins were collected for analysis after 48 h. To generate cell lines that stably express PDGFR mutants, CHO-K cells were co-transfected with pBJ-1 PDGFR constructs and the selectable marker plasmid pSV2neo by the Lipofectin method. After G418 selection, conditioned medium was collected from cells for the analysis of mutant PDGFR proteins. Binding of125I-PDGF to affinity-purified α- or β-PDGFR full-length extracellular domains was analyzed using a solid-phase binding assay as described previously (8Fretto L.J. Snape A.J. Tomlinson J.E.

Anti-α- or anti-β-PDGFR mAbs (0.24–1000 nm) were incubated with immobilized PDGFR for 1 h at 25 °C prior to the addition of 1 nm125I-PDGF AA or BB (∼50,000 cpm/ng), and incubations were continued for 4 h. The wells were washed, and bound125I-PDGF was quantitated by γ counting. Nonspecific125I-PDGF binding, as determined by coincubation with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF, was <15% of total binding. The α-PDGFR autophosphorylation assay was developed using 32D-αR cells that were characterized previously (32Matsui T. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Greenberger J.S. LaRochelle W.J. Ruggiero M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells grown under standard conditions were washed and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI medium in the absence or presence of anti-PDGFR mAb (0.24–1000 nm). After 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were placed on ice and stimulated with 0.6 nm PDGF AA for 1.5 h. Cells were pelleted, lysed in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. Lysates were diluted in binding buffer (0.3% gelatin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) and transferred to anti-α-PDGFR polyclonal Ig-coated microtiter plate wells (0.5 μg/well). Plates were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C to allow for α-PDGFR capture and then washed three times with 0.02% Tween 20 in PBS. Peroxidase-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), was added at 1 μg/ml in binding buffer and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. Wells were washed prior to adding ABTS™, and the rate of substrate formation was monitored at 650 nm. For the β-PDGFR autophosphorylation assay, we used HR5, a previously described CHO cell line engineered to overexpress this receptor (28Escobedo J.A. Navankasatussas S. Cousens L.S. Coughlin S.R. Bell G.I. Williams L.T. Science. 1988; 240: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluence under standard conditions, followed by serum-starvation for 16 h. The cells were incubated with mAb (0.1–1000 nm) for 15 min at 25 °C and then stimulated with PDGF BB (1.2 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. PDGFR was captured from the lysates with anti-β-PDGFR polyclonal IgG, and receptor autophosphorylation was detected as described above for α-PDGFR. 32D-αR and 32D-βR cells, which were engineered to overexpress α- or β-PDGFR, respectively, were used in thymidine incorporation assays as described previously (32Matsui T. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Greenberger J.S. LaRochelle W.J. Ruggiero M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in log-phase growth were washed, resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium, and incubated at 37 °C in microtiter plates (50,000 cells/well) with either 1.2 nm PDGF AA or PDGF BB in the absence or presence of anti-PDGFR mAb (0.008–600 nm). After 48 h, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (15 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was added to each well and the incubation was continued for 5 h. Cells were harvested, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Anti-α- or anti-β-PDGFR polyclonal IgG (0.5 μg/well) was used to coat wells of microtiter plates, which were then blocked with 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.,6 prior to the addition of conditioned medium containing 50 ng of a PDGFR mutant. PDGFR was captured overnight at 4 °C, mAb was added at 6.6 nm, plates were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C, and bound mAb was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. ABTS™ substrate was added, and product formation was monitored at 650 nm. The signal obtained for binding of each mAb to the PDGFR full-length extracellular domain, D1–D5, was defined as 100% binding; the level of mAb binding to other PDGFR mutants was compared with this value. To identify PDGFR mutants that retained PDGF binding activity, each was immobilized in microtiter plates by capture with plastic-bound anti-PDGFR polyclonal IgG as described above. Captured PDGFR proteins were incubated with 0.5 nm125I-PDGF AA or BB (∼50,000 cpm/ng) for 4 h at 25 °C. The wells were washed and bound 125I-PDGF was determined by γ counting; nonspecific binding, as determined by coincubation with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF, was <15% of total binding. Using the same methods, varying concentrations of 125I-PDGF (0.1–10 nm) were incubated with α- and β-PDGFR mutants D1–D5 and D2–D3 and the data were analyzed by the method of Scatchard (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). A panel of mAbs directed against the extracellular region of each PDGFR were generated. Four anti-α-PDGFR mAbs (2H7C5, 2B2B11, 2F10E12, 1E10E2) and four anti-β-PDGFR mAbs (2A1E2, 1B5B11, 1C7D5, 2D4G10) were selected for further analysis. These were all specific for the PDGFR subtype to which they were raised; no cross-reactivity against the other receptor was detected at mAb concentrations up to 10 μm. 2N. A. Lokker, unpublished observations. TableI shows the mAb concentration required to obtain half-maximal binding to immobilized PDGFR; all bound with high affinity (0.1–0.6 nm). The mAbs presented in this study all were of the IgG1 subclass, except 1C7D5, which was an IgG2a.Table ICharacterization of Anti-PDGFR mAbsmAbIsotype1-aDetermined by mAb isotyping kit from Innogenetics.Antigen1-bAntigen used to immunize mice was purified α- or β-PDGFR extracellular domain.Relative affinity1-cValues shown are the concentration of mAb required for half-maximal binding to immobilized PDGFR as determined in a solid-phase ELISA.Antigenic site1-dDistinct antigenic sites were identified by determining the ability of mAbs to compete with each other for binding to immobilized PDGFR (see “Experimental Procedures”).nm2H7C5IgG1αR(D1–D5)0.33A2B2B11IgG1αR(D1–D5)0.13B2F10E12IgG1αR(D1–D5)0.26C1E10E2IgG1αR(D1–D5)0.16D2A1E2IgG1βR(D1–D5)0.14A1B5B11IgG1βR(D1–D5)0.15A1C7D5IgG2aβR(D1–D5)0.17B2D4G10IgG1βR(D1–D5)0.58C1-a Determined by mAb isotyping kit from Innogenetics.1-b Antigen used to immunize mice was purified α- or β-PDGFR extracellular domain.1-c Values shown are the concentration of mAb required for half-maximal binding to immobilized PDGFR as determined in a solid-phase ELISA.1-d Distinct antigenic sites were identified by determining the ability of mAbs to compete with each other for binding to immobilized PDGFR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab The topographic relationships of PDGFR epitopes recognized by these mAbs were determined by competitive solid-phase binding with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mAbs. The four mAbs directed against the α-PDGFR evaluated under these conditions showed no competition with each other for binding to α-PDGFR and therefore recognized distinct antigenic sites, designated A–D in Table I. A similar analysis of the mAbs directed against the β-PDGFR revealed that 2A1E2 and 1B5B11 competed with each other for binding to β-receptor but neither competed with 2D4G10 or 1C7D5, which did not compete with each other for β-PDGFR binding. Thus, 2A1E2 and 1B5B11 recognized epitopes within the same antigenic site, designated A, and 2D4G10 and 1C7D5 recognized distinct sites, designated B and C, respectively (TableI). The ability of these anti-PDGFR mAbs to block PDGF binding was examined using the specific, high affinity (K d = 0.5–1.0 nm), solid-phase PDGF bindings assays described previously (8Fretto L.J. Snape A.J. Tomlinson J.E. Seroogy J.J. Wolf D.L. LaRochelle W.J. Giese N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3625-3631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown for the α-PDGFR in Fig. 1(A and B), mAb 2H7C5 blocked binding of both125I-PDGF AA and BB with an IC50 of 6 nm, whereas the other anti-α-PDGFR mAbs and the anti-β-PDGFR mAb 2A1E2, at concentrations up to 250 nm, did not significantly inhibit 125I-PDGF binding. As shown in Fig. 1 C, inhibition of 125I-PDGF BB binding to immobilized β-PDGFR was observed with mAb 2A1E2 (IC50 = 1.5 nm) but not with 1C7D5 or 2D4G10. Less than 25% inhibition was seen with 1B5B11, at 250 nm. Anti-α-PDGFR mAb 2H7C5, which potently blocked 125I-PDGF AA and BB binding to the α-receptor, did not affect125I-PDGF BB binding to β-PDGFR. We examined the ability of these mAbs to inhibit PDGF-induced receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation using a sandwich ELISA in which PDGFR was captured from cell lysates and detected with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 32D-αR mouse hematopoietic cell line lacks endogenous PDGFRs, but was engineered to express fully functional human α-PDGFR (32Matsui T. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Greenberger J.S. LaRochelle W.J. Ruggiero M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the absence of mAb, PDGF AA induction of α-PDGFR autophosphorylation in 32D-αR cells is shown in Fig. 2 A. A maximum 200-fold increase in phosphotyrosine on the α-receptor was obtained with 0.6 nm PDGF AA; the EC50 was 0.1 nm. Fig. 2 B shows a comparable dose-response curve obtained using PDGF BB to induce β-PDGFR autophosphorylation in HR5 cells, a previously characterized CHO cell line that overexpresses recombinant human β-PDGFR (28Escobedo J.A. Navankasatussas S. Cousens L.S. Coughlin S.R. Bell G.I. Williams L.T. Science. 1988; 240: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PDGF BB at 4 nm caused a maximal 15-fold increase of β-PDGFR autophosphorylation; the EC50 was 0.2 nm. These findings were confirmed using anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis.2 The ability of anti-α-PDGFR mAbs to inhibit receptor autophosphorylation was determined by incubating 32D-αR cells with mAb prior to stimulating with 0.2 nm PDGF AA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mAb 2H7C5, which blocked 125I-PDGF binding to the α-PDGFR, was equally effective at blocking PDGF AA-induced α-receptor autophosphorylation with an IC50 of 3 nm; complete inhibition was observed at concentrations >30 nm. mAbs 2F10E12 and 1E10E2 displayed no inhibitory activity, and 2B2B11 inhibited α-receptor phosphorylation by 50% only at 200 nm. Anti-β-PDGFR mAb 2A1E2 did not inhibit α-receptor phosphorylation. The inhibition of β-PDGFR autophosphorylation by anti-β-PDGFR mAbs 2A1E2 and 1B5B11 was half-maximal at 2–3 nm (Fig.3 B). Complete inhibition by 2A1E2 and 70% inhibition by 1B5B11 was attained at concentrations >10 nm. mAb 1C7D5 had an IC50 of 100 nm but inhibited only up to 60%. The other anti-β-receptor mAb tested, 2D4G10, and the potent anti-α-receptor mAb 2H7C5 did not inhibit β-receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). ELISA methods used in these experiments could give an artificially high level of inhibition if preincubation with mAb were to interfere with capture of the receptor. To address this possibility, we used biotinylated anti-α- or anti-β-PDGFR polyclonal antibody to detect captured PDGFR and found that preincubation of cells with the inhibitory mAbs had no effect on the amount of PDGFR captured.2 Moreover, mAb inhibition of PDGFR autophosphorylation was confirmed with anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis.2 PDGF mitogenic responses in vitro are most commonly studied in fibroblast cell lines that invariably express both α- and β-PDGFR (16Hart C.E.

We examined mitogenic signaling mediated by each individual receptor subtype in 32D cell transfectants engineered to express only α-PDGFR (32D-αR) or β-PDGFR (32D-βR) (32Matsui T. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Greenberger J.S. LaRochelle W.J. Ruggiero M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Anti-α-PDGFR mAbs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit PDGF AA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into 32D-αR cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, mAb 2H7C5 was a potent inhibitor of the PDGF AA mitogenic response; its IC50 was 2 nm, and it gave complete inhibition at concentrations >10 nm. The other anti-α-PDGFR mAbs, 2F10E12, 2B2B11, and 1E10E2, showed no inhibition of 32D-αR cell mitogenic response at concentrations up to 100 nm. As expected, the same was true for the potent anti-β-PDGFR mAb 2A1E2. Fig. 4 B shows that three of the β-PDGFR mAbs were potent inhibitors of PDGF BB-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into 32D-βR cells. mAbs 2A1E2 and 1B5B11 blocked β-PDGFR-mediated mitogenesis with an IC50 of 0.08 nm and gave 90% inhibition at 1 nm. Additionally, mAb 1C7D5, which only weakly blocked β-PDGFR phosphorylation (IC50 = 100 nm, Fig. 3 B), inhibited mitogenesis in 32D-βR cells with an IC50 of 1.0 nm. The remaining anti-β-PDGFR mAb, 2D4G10, and the anti-α-receptor mAb 2H7C5 did not significantly inhibit mitogenesis at concentrations up to 200 nm (Fig. 4 B). To map the PDGFR Ig-like domain required for mAb binding, a deletion mutagenesis strategy was employed as shown schematically in Figs.5 A and6 A. These mutants were expressed either in COS or CHO cells, and conditioned media were collected for Western blot analysis using anti-α- or anti-β-PDGFR polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Figs. 5 B and6 B, each PDGFR mutant protein had an electrophoretic mobility consistent with the size predicted by the length of its coding sequence. The apparent molecular masses ranged from ∼110 kDa for the full-length extracellular domain to ∼20 kDa for the variants comprising a single Ig-like domain.Figure 6Domain structure and Western blot analysis of β-PDGFR mutants. A, extracellular Ig-like domains of β-PDGFR are designated D1 through D5; TM represents the transmembrane domain; B, Western blot analysis of β-PDGFR mutants was performed as described in Fig. 5 using anti-β-PDGFR polyclonal IgG for immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative level of binding of each anti-PDGFR mAb to these PDGFR mutants is summarized in Tables II and III. All anti-α-PDGFR mAbs readily detected αR(D1–D5) at the level that was taken to be 100% binding. mAb 2B2B11 did not recognize αR(D1–D4), which was recognized by the remaining mAbs, indicating that 2B2B11 binds D5 (Table II). Removal of D4 resulted in a loss of detection by 2F10E12 to 33% of that observed with αR(D1–D5), demonstrating that its major binding epitopes are within D4. mAb 1E10E2 detected αR(D1) and all other mutants that contain D1 but did not detect αR(D2–D3). Finally, the neutralizing α-receptor mAb, 2H7C5, bound to epitopes within D2 because it detected αR(D1–D2) and αR(D2–D3) but not αR(D1). Thus, as indicated in Table II, each anti-α-PDGFR mAb recognizes a different Ig-like domain (D1, D2, D4, or D5), which is consistent with the fact that no cross-competition for binding was observed with these antibodies (TableI).Table IIMapping of α PDGFR Ig-like domain detected by mAbsmAbαR(D1–D5)2-aStructure of each mutant protei"

A large central domain containing tandem repeats of 81 residues each is flanked by much shorter domains with sequences similar to the tandem repeats. Four disulfide-rich domains, three at the amino terminus and one at the carboxyl terminus, complete the chain. The disulfide-rich domains have significant sequence identity to those of other mucins and prepro-von Willebrand factor. The coding region of the mucin gene is highly polymorphic, and three alleles were identified in a single animal that encoded different numbers of the 81-residue tandem repeats.

It is now established that different cells of the mammalian respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts secrete structurally unique mucins that differ not only in the amino acid sequence of their polypeptide chains but also in the structure of the oligosaccharides covalently bound to the polypeptide chains. Nevertheless, the complete amino acid sequence of only one large, secreted mammalian mucin (1Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two smaller, less complex mucins (2Verma M. Davidson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hicks J.W. Swallow D.M. Lagace R.E. Byrd J.C. Lamport D.T.A. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1990; 171: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Porchet N. Van Cong N.

A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From this structural information, it has also become clear that there are structural similarities among the mucins. All contain tandemly repeated sequences, although the number of amino acids in each tandem repeat and the number of repeats in each polypeptide chain is different. The amino acid sequence of a repeat bears no identity from one mucin to another, except that each repeat is rich in serine and threonine. It is thought that the vast majority of the oligosaccharides in mucins is in O-glycosidic linkage to the hydroxyl groups in the serine and threonine residues of the repeat domains. Moreover, many secreted mucins appear to contain disulfide-rich domains that flank the tandem repeat domains (1Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

Many of these domains, called D-domains, 1The abbreviations used are: D-domain, disulfide-rich domain; kb, kilobase(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. have significant amino acid sequence identity to one another and to those in human prepro-von Willebrand factor (1Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D-domains of von Willebrand factor are required for assembly of prepro-von Willebrand factor disulfide-bonded dimers into multimers, which interact with platelet receptors to initiate hemostasis through platelet adhesion at the site of vascular injury (8Marti T. Rosselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Disulfide-bonded dimers of prepro-von Willebrand factor are formed through the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domains that show little sequence similarity with D-domains. The demonstration that the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of porcine submaxillary mucin can form disulfide-bonded dimers supports the suggestion that the D-domains in mucins may also be essential for assembly of mucin multimers from disulfide-bonded dimers (11Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We report here the complete polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide chain of porcine submaxillary mucin. Portions of these structures have been described (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

The new sequences described here account for about 90% of the mucin polypeptide, which is the largest polypeptide reported to date for a mammalian mucin. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Facility at Duke University. The following materials were obtained commercially: DNA restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, TaqDNA polymerase, 1-kb DNA ladder, high molecular weight DNA markers (8.3–48.5 kb), Glass-Max spin cartridges, ultra-pure agarose and cosmid mapping system (Life Technologies, Inc.); porcine genomic library in the pWE15 cosmid (average insert size 38 kb,CLONTECH); SeaPlaque GTG low melting point agarose (FMC); TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp.); Long Ranger gel solution (AT Biochem); ultrapure deoxynucleotides (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); Sequenase Quick-Denature plasmid sequencing kit, [γ-32P]adenosine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol), and [35S]2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-(α-thiotriphosphate) (1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Corp); ampicillin, sodium salt (Sigma); nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell); Qiagen columns (mini-, midi-, maxi-, and manifold preps, Qiagen); DE-81 ion exchange paper (Whatman International Ltd.); TnT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.); and [35S]cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol, ICN). The porcine genomic library in the pWE15 cosmid was screened by hybridization (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the 243-nucleotide tandem repeat monomer, which was isolated from the pPSM1B plasmid (13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected and purified by subsequent rounds of rescreening. Cosmid DNA was purified from cultures for each positive colony using the alkaline lysis miniprep method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The porcine genomic library was screened in succession with the following two primers, 5′-GTTGGCAGAGTTGTCCTTGAC, which hybridized 404 nucleotides upstream to the first tandem repeat, and 5′-GGCTACAACTTCCATAGAAGG, which hybridized three nucleotides downstream from the last tandem repeat. Three colonies were selected which were positive for both probes (Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70) and cosmid DNA prepared as above. Repeat positive cosmids were mapped for restriction sites by the procedure of Rackwitz et al. (15Rackwitz H.-R. Zehetner G. Frischauf A.-M. Lehrach H. Gene. 1984; 30: 195Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, cosmids were partially or completely digested with BamHI and the digests divided in half and hybridized to either oligonucleotide L (5′-AGGTCGCCGCCC) or oligonucleotide R (5′-GGGCGGCGACCT), which hybridize, respectively, to the left or right single-stranded cos termini. The size of a partially digested DNA fragment detected by hybridization with oligonucleotide L represented the distance from a restriction site to the left cos terminus. In this manner, the restriction sites for each of the cloned cosmid genomic DNA inserts could be mapped. The repeat positive cosmid clones from the first round of screening were digested with NotI and the full-length inserts purified by gel electrophoresis in low melting point agarose. All of the inserts were further digested with PstI, and the large resistant fragments that flanked the repeat regions were isolated by gel electrophoresis, cloned into pEMBL, and sequenced. Both strands were sequenced by methods used previously (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the cosmids identified by screening with the repeat monomer contained the entire repeat region. Total RNA was prepared from a porcine submaxillary gland as described previously (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (11 μg in 28 μl) and a primer (3.5 nmol) complementary to bases 4674–4702 of the submaxillary mucin cDNA were hybridized and reverse transcribed (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with Superscript II reverse trancriptase for 10 min at 25 °C and then transferred to 45 °C for 50 min, followed by heating to 70 °C for 15 min to stop the reaction. After cooling on ice for 1 min, 1 μl of RNase H (2 units) was added and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Single-stranded cDNA was purified from the reaction mixture using Glass-Max spin columns and the DNA eluted with 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA. The single-stranded cDNA was G-tailed at the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase as follows. Four μl of single-stranded cDNA prepared as described above was incubated in 0.1 mpotassium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 2 mm cobalt chloride, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm dGTP, and 15 units of terminal transferase in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. The poly-G-tailed single-stranded cDNA was purified using Glass-Max spin columns and eluted in 40 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. The poly-G-tailed single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR in an Ericomp Thermocycler using an anchor primer complementary to the poly-G-tail (5′-AAGCTTGGATCCTGCAGAATTCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) and a primer complementary to bases 4342–4362 of the submaxillary mucin cDNA. The PCR reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 5 μl of poly-G-tailed single-stranded cDNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed with a denaturation temperature of 94 °C for 2 min, an annealing temperature of 55 °C for 30 s, and an extension temperature of 72 °C for 3 min. The amplified products were subcloned into the pCRII vector as recommended by the supplier (Invitrogen Corp.). Plasmids were prepared from positive colonies, and the inserts sized by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced as above. From the deduced sequence, a new set of primers was synthesized for another cycle of anchored PCR. A total of six cycles was necessary to obtain the entire cDNA sequence for porcine submaxillary mucin. The primers used for each cycle of anchored PCR were complementary to the following submaxillary mucin cDNA sequences: cycle 2, bases 4255–4274, 4239–4258, and 4041–4058; cycle 3, bases 2927–2948, 2877–2900, and 2820–2839; cycle 4, bases 2208–2226, 2193–2215, and 1970–1987; cycle 5, bases 988–1012, 962–985, and 894–915; cycle 6, bases 638–660, 625–642, and 577–598. The 5′ end of the mucin mRNA was determined by anchored PCR as described above using total RNA as a template and two primers near the 5′ end of the deduced cDNA sequence. The primers, which were complementary to bases 85–103 and 73–94, were used for reverse transcription and PCR, respectively. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into the pCR II vector and the DNA inserts sequenced. cDNA (nucleotides 56–4136) was cloned into the pFastBac vector containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter immediately 5′ to the initiating methionine at nucleotide 56. The cDNA sequence was transcribed and translated in a mixture containing 5 μg of plasmid, T7 RNA polymerase, 14 μCi of [35S]cysteine, and TnT reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's directions. Plasmid was omitted in control reactions. After 30 min at 30 °C, the mixture was diluted 5-fold with SDS-sample dilution buffer, boiled, and analyzed on a 10% Laemmli-SDS gel (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The three cosmid clones, which contained the entire repeat region (Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70), were digested with NotI, and the inserts were sized, purified, and further digested with EcoRI, which released the entire tandem repeat region flanked on both ends by unique non-repeat cDNA sequences. Subsequent digestion of the purified EcoRI fragments with PstI reduced the large fragments to repeat monomers and the residual flanking pieces on the 5′ and 3′ ends. The decrease in size of the large EcoRI fragments was a measure of the size of the repeat region in each of the three clones. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (17Chirgwin I. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Ruttrer W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) from porcine tissues removed within 2 min of death and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde as described (18Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting (19Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with salmon sperm DNA and incubated with 32P-labeled tandem repeat as described above. The membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film. Genomic DNA prepared from lymphocytes (20Baas F. Bikker H. van Ommen G.B. DeVijlder J.J. Hum. Genet. 1984; 67: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and the fragments separated by electrophoresis (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA was transferred to nylon membranes by capillary blotting (19Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar) and hybridized to32P-labeled tandem repeat as described above. The membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film. The studies presented here give the complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA encoding porcine submaxillary mucin and the derived amino acid sequence of the mucin polypeptide chain. To facilitate the description of these studies, the structure of the polypeptide chain that was obtained is shown diagrammatically in Fig.1, along with the domain structure of human intestinal mucin (MUC2) (1Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was the largest secreted, mammalian mucin previously described, and has many structural similarities to submaxillary mucin. The polypeptide chain of submaxillary gland mucin shown in Fig. 1 contains 13,288 amino acid residues and can be divided into different domains. There are three D-domains, which are formed by amino acids within residues 1–1278, and a structurally unrelated disulfide-rich domain at the carboxyl terminus formed by residues 13059–13288. The tandem repeat domain extends from residue 1571 to residue 12529 and is the largest domain in the molecule. The tandem repeat domain varies somewhat in length, as discussed below, but the longest domain identified is composed of 135 81-residue repeats. The repeats are rich in glycine, serine, threonine, and alanine, which account for 75% of the amino acids in the domain. Flanking the tandem repeats are unique domains (residues 1279–1570 and residues 12530–13058) that have no sequence identity to one another or to any other domain in any mucin, but have an amino acid composition that is qualitatively much like that of the tandem repeat domain. The complete amino acid sequence of the mucin polypeptide chain and the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding it will not be given here, although portions of the sequence have been reported previously (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base, and are readily available by hyperlink in the electronic version of the Journal. 2The complete nucleotide sequence and the derived amino acid sequence of porcine submaxillary gland mucin have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under GenBank™ accession numberAF005273. The electronic version of the Journal (URL:http://www.jbc.org) employs direct hyperlink access to entries in the data base, and this sequence can be generated by clicking on the above accession number. The sequences of human intestinal mucin (MUC2, GenBank™ accession number L21998) and human prepro-von Willebrand factor (GenBank™ accession number X04385), which have sequence identities with porcine submaxillary mucin, can also be generated by hyperlink. Previous studies gave the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal cystine-rich domain (13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), several of the 81-residue tandem repeats (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the unique sequence domain that joins these two domains. Thus, further studies were undertaken to determine the sequence amino-terminal to the tandem repeats and the number of tandem repeats in the chain. Because of the great length of the DNA encoding the submaxillary mucin, clones that encode the entire length of the DNA were never found in the λgt11 library prepared from porcine submaxillary mRNA (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to extend the sequence amino-terminal to the tandem repeat domain, it was necessary to try to obtain this region, or some portion of it, from genomic DNA. For this purpose, a genomic DNA library in the cosmid pWE15 was screened with oligonucleotides encoding the tandem repeat sequence. Twenty cosmids were identified and purified, and their inserts, ranging in size from 33 to 43.5 kb, obtained after digestion with NotI. No inserts contained the entire repeat domain. The inserts contained varying numbers of tandem repeats and overlapped in sequence with nucleotides either 5′ or 3′ to the tandem repeats. The longest of these with sequence 5′ to the tandem repeats, designated Apo1 (35.6 kb), was digested with PstI. There is one PstI site in each tandem repeat (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, digestion of Apo1 with PstI gave the 243-nt DNA encoding the tandem repeats and a 3.6-kb DNA encoding the region 5′ to the repeats. Sequence analysis of the 3.6-kb DNA showed it to encode 170 nt of the first tandem repeat and 497 nt of an open reading frame that extended the amino acid sequence amino-terminal to the tandem repeats by 165 residues before it ended at an exon-intron boundary. The open reading frame 5′ to the repeats was different from that 3′ to the repeats. The nucleotide sequence determined in these studies encoded the amino acid sequence from residues 1406 to 1570 in the mucin polypeptide. With knowledge of the nucleotide sequence both 3′ and 5′ to the tandem repeat domains, it was possible to isolate clones from the genomic DNA library that hybridized with oligonucleotides containing sequences both 3′ and 5′ to the tandem repeats. Such clones would contain the entire length of the tandem repeat domain, and the number of repeats could be determined. Three cosmids, designated Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70, were isolated that hybridized with oligonucleotides both 3′ and 5′ to the repeats. The inserts in these clones were removed by digestion of the clones with NotI, and agarose gel electrophoresis showed the lengths of the NotI fragments from Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70 to be 43, 45, and 34 kb, respectively, as shown in Fig.2. Restriction maps of these cosmids for EcoRI and PstI are also shown in Fig.3. Each clone has two EcoRI sites at the same position on either side of the DNA encoding the tandem repeats and one PstI site in each of the tandem repeats. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3, PstI digestion of each EcoRI fragment derived from a NotI fragment gives on gel electrophoresis a band of 243 nt encoding the tandem repeats and two other bands that are 1.7 and 2.4 kb in length, respectively. Previous studies (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that each 243-nt repeat contains one PstI site, which gives rise to the 243-nt band. Purification and sequence analysis of the 1.7- and 2.4-kb fragments showed the smaller fragment encoded sequence immediately 5′ to the tandem repeats and the larger encoded sequence 3′ to the repeats (12Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the differing sizes of Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70 are the result of different numbers of tandem repeats they encode. The repeat domain of Apo50 encodes 125 repeats, that of Apo60 encodes 135 repeats, and that of Apo70 encodes 99 repeats, and each repeat domain is flanked by the 1.7- and 2.4-kb bands. These results show that porcine submaxillary mucin genes exhibit length polymorphism as a result of the different numbers of repeats they encode.Figure 3Electrophoretic analysis of the purified EcoRI fragment containing the entire repeat domain from Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70 before and after restriction digestion with PstI and BamHI. The purified EcoRI fragments were restriction digested with PstI or BamHI and the products analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Lanes 1,5, 9, and 13 are DNA standards with the following numbers of base pairs from the top to the bottom of the gel: 12,216, 11,198, 10,180, 9162, 8144, 7126, 6108, 5090, 4072, 3054, 2036, 1636, 1018, 506–517, 396, 344, 298, 220, and 201. Lanes 2, 6, and 10 are the purified EcoRI fragment from Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70, respectively.Lanes 3, 7, and 11 are the EcoRI fragment of Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70, respectively, after digestion with PstI. Lanes 4, 8, and 12 are the EcoRI restriction fragment from Apo50, Apo60, and Apo70, respectively, after digestion with BamHI. The 243-nt DNA fragments after PstI digestion are the tandem repeat monomer. The restriction map for the entire repeat domain is shown at the bottom of the gel. E,EcoRI; P, PstI; B,BamHI. There is one PstI site every 243 nt in the tandem repeats (shaded region), but only the first one at either end of the tandem repeat domain is shown. The restriction maps are drawn to scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 also shows that Apo50 and Apo70 have no restriction sites for BamHI, although Apo60 had four such sites. This result shows that the tandem repeat domain displays site specific polymorphism as well as length polymorphism. The above results also show that the genes encoding mucin contain no intervening sequences between the individual repeats, since PstI digestion produced only the tandem repeats and the unique sequences either 3′ or 5′ to the tandem repeat domain. Thus, an unusually long exon (34 kb to 32.8 kb) encodes the tandem repeat domain. The nucleotide sequence of the 135 tandem repeats in Apo60 encode the amino acid sequence of the mucin polypeptide from residues 1571 to 12529. The nucleotide sequence encoding the most amino-terminal portion of the mucin polypeptide was determined by anchored PCR with submaxillary gland RNA as template. The first cycle employed reverse transcriptase and primers with a sequence (bases 4674–4702) complementary to the unique sequence in Apo1 that was described above. A poly(G) sequence was added to the end of the single-stranded product from the first step and then amplified in a thermocycler with an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the poly(G) sequence and another primer complementary to bases 4342–4362 that encodes the unique sequence 5′ to the tandem repeats. The amplified products were ligated into the pCRII vector and the cells screened with an oligonucleotide complementary with bases 4316 and 4335 of the DNA encoding the mucin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inserts in positive colonies were then sequenced. From the newly determined sequence, new primers were synthesized for additional cycles of anchored PCR. In all, a total of six cycles of anchored PCR were performed generating a continuous open reading frame of 4600 bp, which encoded the entire mucin sequence to the amino terminus, including the start site methionine. Immediately 5′ to the codon for the start methionine, stop codons were found in the DNA sequence in all reading frames. The methionine at the start site is in the sequence MK LIFLYFIVALCFFC K, and the 14 hydrophobic residues flanked by lysine residues, are thought to be the signal peptide for the secreted mucin. The site for proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide has not been identified. The nucleotide sequence determined with aid of anchored PCR encodes the amino acid sequence of the mucin polypeptide chain from residues 1 to 1405. The results of these studies showed that the porcine submaxillary mucin polypeptide chain had three disulfide-rich doma"
https://openalex.org/W2068856408,"We report the synthesis, the physicochemical characterization, and biological evaluation of a new caged glutamate,N-(o-nitromandelyl)oxycarbonyl-l-glutamic acid (Nmoc-Glu), that liberates free glutamate on photolysis. The low affinity of certain glutamate receptors and their rapid entry into desensitization have effectively prevented the creation of an ideal caged glutamate. In the absence of an ideal compound, Nmoc-Glu was designed to resist spontaneous hydrolysis while maintaining reasonable photorelease yield and kinetics. Chemical and physiological analyses reveal that Nmoc-Glu, indeed, has exceptionally low residual activity and high chemical stability. The quantum yield of Nmoc-Glu is 0.11. Photolytic uncaging and release of free glutamate occur in two steps, consisting of an initial light-induced cleavage that proceeds on the sub-millisecond time scale, and a subsequent light-independent, pH-dependent decarboxylation step that proceeds on the millisecond time scale. The low residual activity and high chemical stability of Nmoc-Glu are important advantages in applications where pre-photolysis Glu receptor activation and desensitization must be minimized."

We have expressed nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (NIPP-1) in Sf9 cells, using the baculovirus-expression system.

Nearly all cellular processes are controlled by the reversible phosphorylation of key proteins, mostly on serine or threonine residues. Mammalian cells contain hundreds of independently regulated protein kinases and protein phosphatases that catalyze specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, respectively (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). One of the most abundant and conserved families of Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases are the type-1 enzymes (PP-1). 1The abbreviations used are: PP-1, protein phosphatase-1; NIPP-1, nuclear inhibitor of PP-1; PKA, protein kinase A; CK2, protein kinase CK2, previously called casein kinase-2; PP-1C, catalytic subunit of PP-1; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They consist of a common catalytic subunit (PP-1C) and one or two unique regulatory subunits that specify the activity, the substrate specificity, and the subcellular localization of the holoenzyme (2Bollen M.

PP-1 is particularly abundant in the nucleus where it is presumed to play a regulatory role in mRNA processing, in transcription, and in the progression of the cell cycle. Mammalian nuclei contain two major species of PP-1, which are heterodimers between PP-1C and the inhibitory polypeptides NIPP-1 or R111 (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

In addition, sds22 has been identified as an inhibitory subunit of a minor species of PP-1 in rat liver nuclei (6Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein (7Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have also been reported to interact with PP-1C, but it remains to be established whether they are real subunits of PP-1. NIPP-1 was originally isolated from bovine thymus nuclei as a mixture of two heat stable inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 (9Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA cloning and Western analysis later revealed that the purified inhibitors, termed NIPP-1a (18 kDa) and NIPP-1b (16 kDa), were proteolytically derived from a single polypeptide of 39 kDa that is not heat stable (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S.

Both the heat stable fragments and intact NIPP-1 were shown to be present in the nuclear particulate fraction as a complex with PP-1C, previously designated PP-1NR41 (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and now termed PP-1NNIPP-1. The inhibition of PP-1C by NIPP-1 was found to be mediated by the central third of the polypeptide (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which is also an excellent substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of NIPP-1a and NIPP-1b by these protein kinases reduced their inhibitory potency and resulted in their dissociation from PP-1C (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem.

Thus far, it has not been possible to study the properties of intact NIPP-1. Indeed, the inhibitor is rapidly degraded during purification of PP-1NNIPP-1 from nuclear extracts (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Likewise, the expression of NIPP-1 in bacteria has been hampered by rapid intrabacterial proteolysis (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Neither has it been possible to overexpress NIPP-1 protein in mammalian cells, due to a translational control mechanism mediated by the 5′-end of the coding region of NIPP-1 mRNA (14Wera S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as a XbaI-KpnI fragment and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 under control of the polyhedrin promotor (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses expressing NIPP-1 were generated through intracellular homologous recombination (22O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Feeman and Company, New York1992: 124-138Google Scholar). For the production of recombinant NIPP-1, Sf9 cells were grown as monolayer cultures at 27 °C in TC 100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 1,000 ×g) after 62–72 h, when the expression of NIPP-1 was maximal (see Fig. 1). The infected Sf9 cells from four 14-cm Petri dishes (∼8 × 107 cells) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 (1.8 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl) and resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (5 min at 1,000 × g), and the supernatant (about 50 ml) was mixed with 20 ml of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 6.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin (buffer B) plus 150 mm NaCl. After an incubation for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, the gel was first washed with five volumes of buffer B plus 150 mm NaCl. Subsequently, the retained proteins, including NIPP-1, were eluted with buffer B plus 400 mm NaCl. The eluate was concentrated until 2 ml in a Vivaspin ultracentrifugation unit (VivaScience). After a 10-fold dilution with buffer C containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin, the sample was applied to an anion exchange column (Poros HQ column from PerSeptive Biosystems), equilibrated in buffer C plus 50 mmNaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 40 ml of a linear salt gradient (50–300 mm NaCl) in buffer C. The fractions that contained NIPP-1 activity were pooled, dialyzed overnight against buffer C plus 60% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. All phosphorylations were done for the indicated time at 30 °C in buffer A, supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP (with or without [γ-32P]ATP), 2 mm magnesium acetate, and PKA (42 milliunits/ml), and/or CK2 (525 milliunits/ml). For phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analysis, 50 μg of NIPP-1 was radioactively phosphorylated for 90 min in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The washed and air-dried pellet was resuspended in 45 μl of digestion buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.5, 0.01% SDS, and 5 μg of trypsin of sequencing grade (Boehringer). After an incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, the resulting peptide mixture was applied to a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 reversed-phase column, equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium acetate at pH 6.5. The retained peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (0–70%) of acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) over a period of 90 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. The eluted peptides, as detected by absorbance measurements at 215 nm, were collected manually and counted for Cerenkov radiation. This resulted in the identification of four radioactive peaks, termed peaks A, B,C, and D in Fig. 5. Peak A was lyophilized, dissolved in 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 at pH 6.0 (buffer D) and reapplied to the C2/C18 column, equilibrated in buffer D. The column was developed with a linear gradient (0–10%) of acetonitrile in buffer D at a flow rate of 80 μl/min during 83 min. peptide A, as detected by the measurement of Cerenkov radiation eluted at 7% acetonitrile. Peaks B, C, and D were lyophilized, dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%, v/v, in water), and reapplied separately to the C2/C18 column, equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks B, C, and D were eluted with a linear gradient (0–70%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 90 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. The radioactively labeled peptides B, C, and D eluted at 27, 28, and 34% acetonitrile, respectively. Peptides A–D, derived from NIPP-1 phosphorylated by PKA and/or CK2 (see previous section), were subjected to hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 90 min at 110 °C. The digest was supplemented with phosphoamino acid standards and analyzed by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (23Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The radioactively labeled residues were localized by autoradiography and identified by comparison with the migration of phosphoamino acid standards visualized with ninhydrin. Peptides A, B, C, and D were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems Procise model 492 protein sequencer in the pulsed liquid mode. The repetitive yield of the sequencer was 94.5%. The molecular mass of purified recombinant NIPP-1 was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer Sciex API-300) in the presence of 50% (v/v) acetic acid to increase the protein solubility and ionization. The analysis was done in a single quadrupole operating mode using quadrupole 3 of the mass analyzer. Infection of Sf9 cells with the recombinant baculovirus resulted after 48–72 h in the generation of a polypeptide with the mass of NIPP-1 (47 kDa on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE) as detected by Coomassie staining of cell lysates (Fig. 1). The identity with NIPP-1 was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies against the C terminus of NIPP-1 and by Far Western analysis with digoxygenin-labeled PP-1C. The recombinant NIPP-1 was purified until homogeneity by consecutive chromatographies on heparin-Sepharose and Poros HQ (Fig. 1). Using this procedure, 8.0 ± 0.3 μg (n = 3) of NIPP-1 could be purified from 106 cells with an overall recovery of 22 ± 5%. Purified recombinant NIPP-1 did not affect the activity of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A (not shown), but completely inhibited PP-1C using as substrates phosphorylase, myelin basic protein, histone H1, histone 2A, or casein (not shown). Over a wide range of PP-1C concentrations, NIPP-1 was inhibitory at stoichiometric levels (not shown). The apparent K i value, calculated by extrapolation of the IC50 to infinite dilutions of the phosphatase (24Takai A. Mieskes G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), amounted to 9.9 ± 3.3 pm (n = 3). Recombinant NIPP-1 was an excellent substrate for phosphorylation by PKA and CK2 (Fig.2 A). The stoichiometries of phosphorylation amounted to 1.9 ± 0.2, 1.1 ± 0.1, and 2.9 ± 0.3 mol of phosphate/mol NIPP-1 (n = 4) for phosphorylation by PKA, CK2, and PKA + CK2, respectively. Phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by PKA or CK2 reduced the amount of digoxygenin-labeled PP-1C that was bound during Far Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). Virtually no binding of PP-1C was detected any more after phosphorylation of NIPP-1 with both kinases. Phosphorylation by PKA or CK2 also increased the concentration of NIPP-1 that was required for the half-maximal inhibition of PP-1C, and the effect of both kinases was additive (Fig. 2 C). NIPP-1 that had been phosphorylated by PKA + CK2 was completely inefficient in inhibiting a stoichiometric concentration of PP-1C (0.5 nm in Fig.2 C). Remarkably, the inactivation of NIPP-1 by phosphorylation was only detected at physiological salt concentrations (Fig.3). The same results were obtained with 150 mm of NaCl (Fig. 3), or KCl, NaHCO3, or still CH3COONa (not shown) in the assay, showing that the effect was due to the ionic strength rather than to the type of salt. On the other hand, the extent of phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by PKA and CK2 was not affected by the presence of 150 mm salt (not shown). Because NIPP-1 is associated with PP-1C in mammalian nuclei (see the Introduction), it remained important to determine whether the observed regulation of NIPP-1 by PKA and CK2 could also be demonstrated with the holoenzyme PP-1NNIPP-1. For that purpose an in vitro reconstituted heterodimeric complex between PP-1C and NIPP-1 was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of both components. The spontaneous phosphorylase phosphatase activity of the resulting complex (5 ± 1 milliunits/ml; n= 4), as measured in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, increased to 23 ± 1 and 72 ± 3 milliunits/ml after phosphorylation by CK2 or PKA, respectively. An even larger activation was obtained by phosphorylation with both PKA and CK2 (130 ± 5 milliunits/ml). Following proteolysis of the complex with trypsin, resulting in the release of a fully active, C-terminally nicked PP-1C (2Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the phosphorylase phosphatase activity amounted to 593 ± 12 milliunits/ml. We have also investigated whether the activation of PP-1NNIPP-1 by PKA and CK2 affected the holo-enzyme structure. In Fig. 4 it is shown that PP-1NNIPP-1 migrated as a protein of 120 kDa during gel filtration on Superdex-200. The holoenzyme was completely inactive, but an activity could be revealed by prior trypsinolysis of NIPP-1 in the column fractions (Fig. 4). After phosphorylation by PKA plus CK2, PP-1NNIPP-1 was spontaneously active but migrated identically to the nonphosphorylated holoenzyme. The co-migration of NIPP-1 and PP-1C was confirmed by Western analysis (inset of Fig. 4). These data show that the activation of PP-1NNIPP-1 by PKA plus CK2 was not associated with a release of NIPP-1. In agreement with this conclusion, we found that incubation of the nuclear particulate fraction (prepared as described in Ref. 4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with PKA and CK2 under phosphorylating conditions did not result in the release of NIPP-1 or PP-1C, as detected by Western blotting and activity assays of the resedimented particulate fraction, respectively (not shown). After phosphorylation of purified recombinant NIPP-1 by PKA and/or CK2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, the inhibitor was fragmented by trypsinolysis. The tryptic digest was fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography on a C2/C18 column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two major peaks of radioactivity (peaks A and Bin Fig. 5) were detected in the eluate after phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by PKA (see above). Likewise, two radioactive peaks (pools C and D in Fig. 5) were identified in the tryptic digest of CK2-phosphorylated NIPP-1, which eluted, however, differently from the phosphopeptides derived from PKA-phosphorylated NIPP-1. One of the peaks obtained from CK2-phosphorylated NIPP-1 was reproducibly less radioactive, suggesting a substoichiometric phosphorylation, in agreement with the lower stoichiometry of phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by CK2 as compared with that by PKA. After phosphorylation of NIPP-1 with both PKA and CK2, four radioactive peaks were obtained that eluted identically to peaks A, B, C, and D (Fig. 5,lower panel). The same four peaks were obtained after phosphorylation of NIPP-1 in a heterodimeric complex with PP-1C (not shown). The radioactive peptides corresponding to peaks A–D could be sequenced, following an additional purification step by reversed-phase chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). All four phosphopeptides ended with an Arg or Lys (TableI), as expected from the cleaving specificity of trypsin. Likewise, by comparison with the known primary structure of NIPP-1 (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it was confirmed that all peptides were preceded by an Arg or Lys residue (not illustrated). Peptides A, B, and C were exclusively phosphorylated on Ser, whereas peptide D was exclusively phosphorylated on Thr (Table I). Because there was only one Ser residue in peptides A and B, this already established Ser199 and Ser178 as the PKA phosphorylation sites. Moreover, it is well known that phosphorylation of a serine or a threonine results in a reduced recovery of the corresponding phenylthiohydantoin-derivative during sequencing (25Wang Y. Fiol C.J.

Cell Res. 1997; 230: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in each peptide there was a single residue with a severely reduced recovery, corresponding to Thr161, Ser178, Ser199, and Ser204, respectively (Table I). In contrast, all other Ser and Thr residues in the same peptides showed a recovery of ≥86% of the expected value (not shown). The reduced recovery of some Ser/Thr residues could not be explained by their covalent modification during the expression of NIPP-1 in Sf9 cells. Indeed, the mass of purified recombinant NIPP-1 was established by mass spectrometry as 38,520 Da (not illustrated), which is exactly the mass calculated from its known primary structure (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and shows that NIPP-1 had not been covalently modified, e.g. by phosphorylation, before its incubation with the protein kinases. We therefore conclude that Ser178 and Ser199 are the PKA phosphorylation sites and that Thr161 and Ser204 represent the phosphorylation sites of CK2.Table IThe sequence of NIPP-1-derived phosphopeptides and the identity of the phosphorylated residuesProtein kinasePeptideSequencePhosphorylated residuePhosphoamino acid analysisSer/Thr with reduced yield (% of expected value)PKAA197KN(S)R200SerSer199(31%)B176RI(S)TLTIEEGNLDIQR191SerSer178(13%)CK2C201VTF(S)EDDEIINPEDVDPSVGR221SerSer204(13%)D152GLLGLPEEE(T)ELDNLTEFNTAHNK175ThrThr161(34%) Open table in a new tab Sequence and phosphoamino acid analyses showed that the phosphopeptides derived from NIPP-1 that had been phosphorylated by both PKA and CK2 were identical and phosphorylated on the same residues as those obtained after phosphorylation with the individual kinases (not illustrated). Based upon the presence of consensus sequences, NIPP-1 was predicted to contain three phosphorylation sites for PKA, whereas only two of these sites were identified as real phosphorylation sites. Similarly, we only detected two phosphorylation sites for CK2, whereas NIPP-1 contains four additional consensus sequences for phosphorylation by CK2. We have used synthetic peptides to further analyze the substrate quality of two sites that were predicted to be phosphorylated by PKA or CK2 but were not recovered as phosphorylation sites in intact NIPP-1. Thus, Thr346 was predicted to be a PKA phosphorylation site. However, a synthetic peptide (PGKKPTPSLLI) comprising the C terminus (residues 341–351) of NIPP-1 was only phosphorylated marginally (<0.01 mol/mol) by PKA. Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the label was exclusively associated with phosphoserine, confirming that Thr346 is not a PKA phosphorylation site (not shown). On the other hand, a peptide (RPKRKRKNSRVTFSEDDEII) comprising residues 191–210 of NIPP-1 and containing the Ser199 and Ser204 phosphorylation sites for PKA and CK2, respectively, was phosphorylated by both kinases albeit not to stoichiometric levels (Fig. 6). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of p191–210 by PKA plus CK2 was additive. Interestingly, PKA phosphorylated this peptide much faster than did CK2, despite the 10-fold higher concentration of the latter kinase. A similar superior substrate quality for phosphorylation by PKA has previously also been described for the purified 16/18-kDa NIPP-1 fragments (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that p191–210 was exclusively phosphorylated on Ser by PKA and/or CK2 (not shown), providing additional evidence that Thr202, albeit a predicted CK2 phosphorylation site, was in reality not phosphorylated at all by this kinase. Baculovirus-expressed NIPP-1 (this work) and the heat stable NIPP-1a/b fragments (9Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) turned out to be equally potent inhibitors of PP-1C. Both the intact protein (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and NIPP-1a/b (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were also inactivated by phosphorylation with PKA and CK2. Collectively, these data suggest that the N- and C-terminal thirds of NIPP-1 are not directly involved in the inhibitory interaction with PP-1C. On the other hand, the heterodimeric complex of PP-1C and NIPP-1 was not dissociated by activation with PKA and CK2 (Fig. 4), although the complex with NIPP-1a/b was dissociated (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of intact NIPP-1 obviously decreases its affinity for the catalytic subunit (Fig. 2). This suggests that the N- and/or C-terminal thirds of NIPP-1 contain at least one additional binding site for the catalytic subunit (Fig. 7). Our finding that PP-1NNIPP-1 is not dissociated by activation also provides further evidence that NIPP-1 is a real subunit of PP-1 rather than a transiently associated regulator. In contrast to what has been reported for NIPP-1a/b (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the PKA- and CK2-mediated inactivation of intact NIPP-1 was only expressed at physiological ionic strength. This requirement for salt explains our previous failure to detect an activation of PP-1NNIPP-1 in nuclear extracts by phosphorylation with PKA or CK2 (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of some other regulators of PP-1 are also salt-dependent. Thus, the allosteric inhibition of the glycogen-synthase phosphatase activity of hepatic glycogen-bound PP-1 by phosphorylase a (2Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and the stimulation of this activity by glucose 6-phosphate (29Cadefau J. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) require salt. In contrast, the time-dependent inactivation of PP-1C by inhibitor-2 is blocked by physiological salt concentrations (30Bollen M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Stalmans W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thr161 and Ser204 of NIPP-1 were identified as the CK2 phosphorylation sites (Table I). Both sites were predicted to be CK2 phosphorylation sites (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), because they are followed by an acidic residue at position +3, which is the most essential determinant for recognition by CK2 (31Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar,32Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Similarly, the two PKA phosphorylation sites in NIPP-1 (Ser178 and Ser199) are canonical recognition sites for PKA, because they are preceded at positions −2 and −3 by basic residues. Although it remains to be investigated whether all these sites are phosphorylated in vivo, it should be pointed out that the glucagon-induced activation of PKA has previously been associated with a phosphorylation of NIPP-1 in rat liver in vivo (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Some predicted phosphorylation sites for PKA and CK2 (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were not identified as real phosphorylation sites in intact NIPP-1. This is particularly striking for Thr202, which has four downstream acidic residues (positions +3 to +6) and was expected to become an even better recognition site for CK2 after prior phosphorylation of Ser204 (31Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 32Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely that the absence of phosphorylation of Thr202 is explained by an inaccessibility due to conformational restraints because this residue was not phosphorylated either when present in a small synthetic peptide (see “Results”). A similar mystery is the absence of phosphorylation of Thr346 by PKA. We have found that intact NIPP-1 is exclusively phosphorylated by PKA on Ser, whereas the NIPP-1a/b fragments were reported to be phosphorylated also on Thr (11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Although it cannot be ruled out that NIPP-1a/b contains PKA phosphorylation sites that are not accessible in intact NIPP-1, there are no canonical Thr phosphorylation sites for PKA in the central third of NIPP-1, which roughly corresponds to NIPP-1a/b (10Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is more probable that the previously observed phosphorylation on Thr stemmed from a contaminant of the NIPP-1a/b preparation. Recently, Egloff et al. (33Egloff M.-P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) demonstrated that most known regulators of PP-1, including NIPP-1, contain an RVXF motif that mediates the binding to PP-1C. Interestingly, residue X in the RVXF motif of the glycogen-binding G-subunit of PP-1 corresponds to a Ser that can be phosphorylated by PKA, resulting in the dissociation of the G-subunit from PP-1C. Residue X of the RVXF motif in NIPP-1 corresponds to Thr202, which is a consensus phosphorylation site for CK2 but is not phosphorylated by CK2 (see above). However, the RVXF motif in NIPP-1 is N-terminally and C-terminally bordered by phosphorylation sites for PKA (Ser199) and CK2 (Ser204), respectively. We speculate that the phosphorylation of the latter sites causes a dissociation of the RVXF motif from PP-1C, resulting in an activation of PP-1NNIPP-1. Egloff et al. (33Egloff M.-P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) reported that a synthetic peptide comprising the RVXF motif of p53BP2 interfered with the interaction between PP-1C and the glycogen-binding or myosin-binding subunits (33Egloff M.-P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We found, however, that PP-1NNIPP-1 could not be activated by the addition of a large excess of p191–210 containing the RVXF motif of NIPP-1. 2M. Beullens, Q. Jin, W. Stalmans, and M.

Overexpression of poly(A) polymerase I, but not PNPase, partially compensated for the absence of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. These data show that poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase participate in the end repair process and are required to maintain functional tRNA levels when tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is absent. tRNA molecules from all organisms contain an identical trinucleotide sequence (-CCA) at their 3′ termini that plays an important role in the biological functions of this nucleic acid (reviewed in Ref. 1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Depending on the organism, the -CCA sequence arises either during transcription or by post-transcriptional addition catalyzed by the enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, which is capable of utilizing CTP and ATP to incorporate CMP and AMP residues into tRNAs with incomplete -CCA termini (1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, all tRNA genes encode the -CCA sequence (2Fournier M. Ozeki H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 379-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so post-transcriptional addition of these residues is not needed. The role of E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, encoded by the cca gene, lies not in the biosynthesis of tRNAs, but in its repair. It has been known since the earliest studies of tRNA metabolism that the terminal -CCA sequence normally undergoes an end turnover process in vivo that consists of the removal and re-addition of the 3′-terminal AMP and penultimate CMP residues of tRNA (3Deutscher M.P. Jacob S.T. Enzymes of Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Modification. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983: 159-183Google Scholar). It is now well established that the exoribonuclease RNase T is responsible for nucleotide removal (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is responsible for tRNA repair (5Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An E. coli cca strain totally devoid of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity is viable, but grows slowly because it accumulates defective tRNAs and has an increased level of ppGpp (5Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Deutscher M.P. Setlow P. Foulds J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In such a strain, ∼10–15% of the total tRNA population contains incomplete 3′ termini because of the decreased ability to carry out repair; however, tRNAs from different amino acid families are affected unequally (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that even in cells devoid of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, a low level of tRNA end repair continues. Thus, incubation of a cca mutant strain with chloramphenicol (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or of a cca null mutant in the presence of kanamycin (8Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), to prevent further end turnover, led to a decrease over time in the amount of defective tRNA originally present. In addition, in an experiment in which the encoded -CCA sequence of the tRNATyr su 3+ gene was changed to -CCC, -CCG, or -CCU and then introduced into a cca mutant strain, it was found that ∼15% of the suppressor activity found in a wild-type strain was retained despite the fact that removal and repair of the incorrect 3′-terminal residue was required (8Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, a low level of activity incorporating AMP into tRNA-C-C can be detected in extracts from cells devoid of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (5Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of this evidence suggested that additional activity able to slowly repair the 3′ terminus of tRNA is present in E. coli ccamutant cells. In this paper, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that this residual tRNA end repair involves the known enzymes poly(A) polymerase I and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). 1The abbreviation used is: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase. 1The abbreviation used is: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase. A model describing the action of these enzymes in the repair process is presented. [3H]ATP, [14C]ATP, and a 3H-labeled amino acid mixture were purchased from DuPont NEN Life Science Products. E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase was purified from a strain that overproduces this enzyme (9Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). tRNA was prepared by phenol extraction and isopropyl alcohol fractionation as described (10Deutscher M.P. Hilderman R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial strains used in this work all are derivatives of the E. coli K12 strain CA244 (lacZ, trp,relA, spoT) (11Brenner S. Beckwith J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 629-637Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). P1-mediated transduction was performed to construct a series of strains lacking poly(A) polymerase I (PAP−), polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNP−), and tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA−) in various combinations. The following selectable markers, prepared by the introduction of antibiotic resistance cassettes, were used:pcnB::kan for PAP− (12Kalapos M.P. Cao G.-J. Kushner S.R. Sarkar N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),pnp::Tn5 for PNP− (13McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cca::cam for CCA− (5Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For construction of the PAP−,PNP− double mutant and the CCA−,PAP−,PNP− triple mutant strains, the pnp::Tn5 mutation was introduced into the PAP− and CCA−,PAP− strains using a nearby Tn10 insertion as the selectable marker and assaying tetracycline-resistant transductants for the loss of PNPase activity. The mutations in pcnB, pnp, and cca are either deletion/substitution or interruption mutations, and all lead to a null phenotype based on direct assay of the relevant enzyme. Plasmids pJL89 (14Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pKAK7 (15Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), carrying pcnB and pnp, respectively, were obtained from Dr. Sidney Kushner. Strains carrying these plasmids overexpress poly(A) polymerase 5–10-fold and PNPase 3–5-fold. Cells were routinely grown in liquid YT (yeast extract/Tryptone) medium or, for doubling time measurements, in YT medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Antibiotics, when present, were at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml; and tetracycline, 12.5 μg/ml. Cells were grown to A 550 ≈ 1.0, concentrated 10-fold in 20 mm glycine (pH 9.4) and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated with two 15-s pulses with a 30-s cooling period while submerged in an ice bath (Heat System/Ultrasonics, Plainview, NY). The sonicate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was retained for assays. Assays of extracts for activity incorporating AMP into tRNA-C-C were carried out under conditions optimal for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (16McGann R.G. Deutscher M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained the following (in a volume of 50 μl): 50 mm glycine (pH 9.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA (predominantly tRNA-C-C), 1 mm [3H]ATP (∼103 cpm/nmol), and enzyme fraction. Incubation was at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate and left on ice for 10 min. Precipitates were collected on Whatman glass-fiber GF/C filters and washed five times with 3 ml of 2.5% cold trichloroacetic acid and once with 5 ml of ethanol/ether (1:1). Filters were dried and counted in a scintillation counter. Assay of tRNA for AMP incorporation was carried out in reaction mixtures of 100 μl containing 50 mm glycine (pH 9.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm[14C]ATP, 100 μg of tRNA from the indicated strain, and sufficient purified E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase for complete incorporation. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. Precipitation, washing, and counting were as described above. Assay of tRNA for aminoacylation was carried out in reaction mixtures of 100 μl containing 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm3H-labeled amino acid mixture, 100 μg of the indicated tRNA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (nuclease-free), and sufficient purified E. coliaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mixture for complete incorporation. Incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C. Precipitation, washing, and counting were as described above except that the 10% trichloroacetic acid contained 2.5% casamino acids. The tRNA used for aminoacylation was first stripped of endogenous amino acids by incubation in 1.7m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by ethanol precipitation (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar). tRNA samples of ∼9 μg were run on 6% acrylamide gels containing 8.3 m urea. Sample buffer contained 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF. Gels were run at 1250 V (∼32 V/cm) until the xylene cyanol dye had migrated 28 cm. The tRNA was transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane using a Genie Blotter. After transfer, the membrane was rinsed in 2 × SSC, dried, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out as described (18Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with the indicated32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for a single tRNA species. Membranes were stripped for reuse by boiling for 20 min in 0.1 × SSC containing 1% SDS. Earlier studies in this laboratory (8Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) 2N. B. Reuven, Z. Zhou, and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observations. focused attention on PNPase and poly(A) polymerase I as possibly contributing to the residual AMP-incorporating activity observed in extracts of E. coli CCA− cells. To investigate the role of these enzymes in detail, strains were constructed that contained null mutations in the cca, pcnB, and pnpgenes encoding tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase I, and PNPase, respectively, alone or in combination (see “Experimental Procedures”). Growth of these strains on YT plates at 37 °C showed that single mutant strains each produced colonies slightly smaller than the wild type. Each of the double mutant cells grew even more slowly than the single mutants; triple mutant cells, depending on the method of construction, either did not grow or produced extremely small colonies. Thus, when the triple mutant strain was prepared by introducing cca::cam into the PAP−,PNP− double mutant and selecting for chloramphenicol-resistant transductants, essentially no colonies could be recovered. Alternatively, when pnp::Tn5 was introduced into the CCA−,PAP− strain using a closely linked Tn10 insertion and selecting for tetracycline-resistant transductants, viable triple mutant colonies could be recovered, although they grew considerably more slowly than any of the double mutants. The differential effects of the antibiotics on the growth of the triple mutant were not investigated further. The identity of the triple mutant was confirmed by direct assay of the relevant activities. A more quantitative measure of the growth rates of the various strains was obtained from determination of their doubling times in liquid YT/glucose cultures (Table I), and these growth rates agreed well with the relative growth observed on plates. The double mutant strains grew more slowly than the single mutant strains, and the triple mutant strain grew even slower. For many of the CCA− strains, measurement of accurate doubling times was difficult because of the tendency of these cells to revert to faster growing forms (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Deutscher M.P. Hilderman R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize this problem, the values reported here are for the slowest reproducible growth rates observed in many growth experiments. The mutations resulting in faster growth are known to affect the rnt gene, resulting in a decreased level of RNase T (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite this problem, these data show that the addition of PAP− and/or PNP− mutations to a CCA− strain results in even slower growth, indicating that the functions of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase I, and PNPase must overlap in some common process in vivo. Inasmuch as the only known function of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in E. coli is the repair of the -CCA end of tRNA, these findings suggest that the other two enzymes participate in this process as well.Table IGrowth rates of strains lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase I, and/or polynucleotide phosphorylaseStrain relevant phenotypeDoubling time1-aMany of these strains tend to revert to faster growing forms.

The doubling times shown are the maximum values observed reproducibly. Open table in a new tab In support of this conclusion, we found that overexpression of poly(A) polymerase I in the CCA− background (strain CCA−/pJL89) led to faster growth (Table I), indicating that overexpression of poly(A) polymerase can partially compensate for the absence of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, as would be expected if their in vivo functions overlapped. Overexpression of PNPase (strain CCA−/pKAK7), in contrast, did not have such an effect, suggesting that it may already be present at sufficient levels; in fact, too much PNPase may even be inhibitory to growth of some strains. 3S. Pandit and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observation. To assess whether poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase could be involved in the repair of tRNA, extracts were prepared from strains lacking these enzymes, alone or in combination, and assayed for their ability to incorporate AMP into tRNA-C-C (Table II). Assays were carried out under conditions optimal for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Using these conditions, >80% of the total AMP-incorporating activity present in a wild-type extract was lost when this enzyme was absent. However, a significant level of residual AMP incorporation remained, and this was due entirely to poly(A) polymerase I, as an extract from a CCA−,PAP− double mutant was devoid of activity.Table IIActivity incorporating AMP into tRNA-C-C in extracts from cells lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase I, and/or polynucleotide phosphorylaseStrain relevant phenotypeSpecific activityRelative specific activityunits/mg protein%Wild type114100CCA−2017PAP−8575PNP−128112CCA−,PAP−<0.1<0.1CCA−,PNP−3531PAP−,PNP−114100CCA−,PAP−,PNP−<0.1<0.1 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, removal of PNPase activity from the wild-type, CCA−, or PAP− background uniformly led to an elevation of AMP-incorporating activity, indicating that under these in vitro assay conditions, PNPase was probably functioning as a degradative enzyme and destroying the product. As is well known, PNPase can act as either a synthetic or a degradative enzyme in vitro depending on the relative concentrations of nucleoside diphosphates and Pi and the specific assay conditions (19Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 518-553Google Scholar). In fact, under conditions favoring the synthetic reaction, PNPase adds stretches of A residues to tRNA-C-C (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and poly(A) polymerase I are the major enzymes responsible for AMP incorporation into tRNA-C-C in vitro. PNPase, on the other hand, appears to remove the AMP residues incorporated by the former two enzymes. Based on their in vitro activities, it is clear that poly(A) polymerase and PNPase could influence the process of tRNA end repair especially in cells lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, supporting the conclusions drawn from the growth experiments presented above that these enzymes overlap functionally in vivo. To directly determine the importance of each of the enzymes for tRNA end repair, tRNA was isolated from each of the mutant strains, and the status of their 3′ termini was determined based on the levels of AMP incorporation and aminoacylation (Table III). AMP incorporation is a reliable indicator of defective tRNA when 1 or 2 residues are missing from the -CCA sequence, but cannot be used when 3 or more residues are absent (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16McGann R.G. Deutscher M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the more defective tRNAs, aminoacylation provides a more accurate picture of the state of the 3′ termini. As is already known, cells lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase accumulate defective tRNA amounting to 10–15% of the tRNA population based on AMP incorporation (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the data presented here confirm this information. The amount of defective tRNA in a CCA− strain based on aminoacylation levels was consistent with this value (Table III). The absence of either poly(A) polymerase I or PNPase by itself did not increase the amount of defective tRNA compared with the wild type. The combined absence of both enzymes also had relatively little effect on the level of defective tRNA based on AMP incorporation. These data indicate that poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase are relatively unimportant for tRNA repair when tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is present.Table IIIStatus of the 3′ terminus of tRNA from strains lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase I, and/or polynucleotide phosphorylaseSource of tRNAAMP incorporation3-aMany of these strains tend to revert to faster growing forms.

The incorporation values presented are for the most defective tRNA preparations. For all strains, tRNA was prepared only if a strain grew with its typical doubling time (see Table I). Open table in a new tab On the other hand, these enzymes become quite important when tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is absent. Thus, the amount of defective tRNA in the CCA−,PAP− and CCA−,PNP− double mutant strains was increased compared with the CCA− strain based on both AMP incorporation and aminoacylation (Table III). The effect on the triple mutant was even more pronounced. In the latter case, the amount of defective tRNA based on aminoacylation levels increased to >50%. Paradoxically, AMP incorporation actually appears to decrease; however, this is due to the fact that a portion of the tRNA population has been shortened past the point at which tRNA nucleotidyltransferase can add back an AMP residue and therefore does not show up as defective tRNA in this assay (see the Northern analysis presented below). Control experiments showed that the elevated amount of defective tRNA in the triple mutant was not due to increased RNase T activity in this strain, to contamination of the tRNA preparation with other nucleic acids that could not accept amino acids, or to the presence of an aminoacylation inhibitor in the tRNA preparation. These data demonstrate directly that repair of the 3′-end of tRNA in the absence of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is dependent on both poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase. Moreover, overexpression of poly(A) polymerase (strain CCA−/pJL89) decreases the amount of defective tRNA based on AMP incorporation (Table III), supporting a direct role for this enzyme in the repair process. Overexpression of PNPase (strain CCA−/pKAK7), on the other hand, has no effect on the amount of defective tRNA in a CCA− strain (Table III), supporting the conclusion that it may already be present at sufficient levels for its role in tRNA repair. tRNAs from the mutant strains were also examined by Northern blotting to directly evaluate the length of their 3′ termini (Fig. 1). Four tRNA species (tRNA1Tyr, tRNA2Arg, tRNA3Ser, and tRNACys) were analyzed using 18-mer oligonucleotides as specific probes (18Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, for each of the tRNAs examined, a substantial portion of the population from the two triple mutant preparations consists of shortened molecules lacking as many as 3 nucleotide residues, indicative of the absence of any repair activity as well as increased nucleotide removal by a nuclease. This observation explains the greatly decreased aminoacylation of these tRNAs already presented in Table III. For tRNA3Ser and tRNA2Arg, defective tRNA is not observed in any of the other strains, whereas a small amount of tRNA1Tyr lacking 1 residue is seen in the CCA−,PAP− and CCA−,PNP− double mutant strains. In contrast, tRNACys is known to be highly defective in CCA− strains (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this is confirmed by the Northern analysis. Whereas the wild type, PAP− and PNP− single mutant, and PAP−,PNP− double mutant strains contain only intact tRNA, the tRNA populations from the CCA− single mutant, CCA−,PAP− and the CCA−,PNP− double mutant, and triple mutant strains consist largely of defective molecules. tRNACys molecules from the single and double mutants primarily are 1 residue shorter, whereas the triple mutants lack as many as 3 residues. It is also seen that the distribution of shortened tRNACys molecules differs in the two preparations from the triple mutant strain (Fig. 1), reflecting the different levels of RNase T observed when the cells were grown (data not shown). It has been reported that conversion of slow growing CCA− strains to faster growing forms is due to secondary mutations decreasing RNase T activity (4Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As noted above, the triple mutant strains studied here also tend to change to faster growing forms, and the differences in defective tRNACys between the two triple mutants shown in Fig.1 reflects the different number of faster growing cells in the two cultures from which tRNA was prepared. The Northern analyses provide further evidence that the absence of poly(A) polymerase and PNPase in CCA− strains increases the amount of defective tRNA present. Moreover, these data confirm what was previously shown for CCA− strains (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), that not all tRNA species are affected in an identical manner by the absence of repair enzymes. The information presented here, based on effects on growth, enzyme activity, and the structure of tRNA, supports the conclusion that the residual tRNA end repair observed in cells lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) depends on both poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase, two other template-independent enzymes. In wild-type cells, the level of tRNA molecules with defective 3′ termini is extremely low, amounting to <1% (Ref. 7Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and this study), implying that tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is very efficient in repairing defective tRNA molecules. In fact, mutant cells with only ∼20% of the normal amount of this enzyme do not accumulate defective tRNA (10Deutscher M.P. Hilderman R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that removal of poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase does not affect tRNA 3′-ends when tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is present. The slowed growth of the PAP−,PNP− double mutant strain is probably due to the role of these enzymes in mRNA decay (21Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, these enzymes make a substantial contribution to maintaining the function of the tRNA population when tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is absent. The additional removal of poly(A) polymerase and PNPase leads to a major increase in the amount of defective tRNA and consequently to extremely slow growth. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that compared with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, the residual repair in its absence is quite slow. Based on its in vitro activity, the function of poly(A) polymerase I in tRNA end repair is most likely the re-addition of the 3′-terminal AMP residue. Interestingly, poly(A) polymerase also shows significant sequence homology to tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (20Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, which adds only a single AMP residue to tRNA under normal conditions, poly(A) polymerase would be expected to incorporate runs of AMP residues into the defective tRNA termini. These multiple AMP residues would need to be removed to generate mature functional tRNAs with terminal -CCA sequences. Such a processing event may be no different from that in which normal tRNA precursors with extended 3′ termini are subjected to the actions of multiple exoribonucleases (18Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, recent work with RNA I and several mRNAs (21Cohen S.N.

Our in vitro measurements of AMP-incorporating activity are consistent with the notion that PNPase participates in removal of the multiple AMP residues generated by poly(A) polymerase. Such a role would be one explanation of the need for PNPase in the tRNA end repair process. Thus, our data are most consistent with a model in which a second, slower pathway for tRNA end repair exists that becomes important when the pathway dependent on tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is eliminated. This second pathway utilizes poly(A) polymerase I to incorporate multiple AMP residues into tRNA-C-C and uses PNPase to remove most of the extra AMP moieties. Other exoribonucleases may be needed to remove the last few AMP residues as in normal tRNA maturation (18Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this model, both poly(A) polymerase I and PNPase are essential, explaining why removal of either enzyme leads to slower growth. Whether poly(A) polymerase II, a recently discovered enzyme (25Cao G.-J. Pogliano J. Sarkar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11580-11585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), has any role in this process is not known. However, the role of PNPase may not be completely explained by this straightforward model. For example, it is not clear why removal of PNPase from the CCA−,PAP− double mutant to generate the triple mutant leads to slower growth and to a substantial increase in shortened tRNA. A similar question can be raised regarding the increased AMP incorporation into tRNA from the CCA−,PNP− double mutant compared with that from the CCA− strain. In both of these situations, the removal of PNPase results in more defective shortened tRNA, an unexpected effect if the only role of the enzyme is to degrade the poly(A) tail. One possibility explaining these observations is that PNPase can also participate in the synthetic phase of the repair process, especially when both tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and poly(A) polymerase are absent. PNPase does have synthetic capabilities (19Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 518-553Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, these have not yet been observed in vivo. Further work will be necessary to explore this interesting possibility.

https://openalex.org/W2067643914,"We cloned and expressed a cDNA encoding acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of type T from Electrophorus electricus organs. When expressed in COS, HEK, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, the AChET subunits generated dimers and tetramers. The cells produced more activity at 27 than at 37 °C. The kinetic parameters of a recombinant enzyme, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, were close to those of the natural AChE. Analysis of genomic clones showed that the coding sequence is interrupted by an intron that does not exist in Torpedo and differs in its location from that observed in the mouse. This intron is preceded by a sequence encoding a non-conserved 29-amino acid peptide, which does not exist in Torpedo or mammalian AChEs. According to a three-dimensional model, this non-conserved peptide is located at the surface of the protein, opposite from the entry of the catalytic gorge; its deletion did not modify the catalytic parameters. Sequence analyses and expression of various constructs showed that the gene does not contain any H exon. We also found that splicing of transcripts in mammalian cells reveals cryptic donor sites in exons and acceptor sites in introns, which do not appear to be used in vivo.

EC 3.1.1.7) attracts considerable interest, because of its fundamental role in cholinergic synapses. It appeared useful to clone AChE from Electrophorus, since this enzyme has been used as a model in numerous biochemical studies (1Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3834-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Quinn D.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Crossref Scopus (922) Google Scholar), due to its exceptional abundance in electric organs. The catalytic mechanism of AChE has been explored by site-directed mutagenesis, using mostly Torpedo and mammalian AChEs (3Cousin X. Hotelier T. Liévin P. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Cousin X. Hotelier T. Giles K. Liévin P. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The comparison of AChEs from different species has also been extremely informative, particularly for the structure of the peripheral site in enzymes that show little or no inhibition by peripheral site inhibitors, such as Bungarus AChE (5Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or chicken AChE (6Eichler J. Anselmet A. Sussman J.L. Massoulié J. Silman I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 335-340PubMed Google Scholar). It was also interesting to analyze the polymorphism of catalytic subunits, generated by alternative splicing, in a Teleost fish. In Torpedo and in mammals, the catalytic domain of AChE may be associated with different C-terminal peptides that determine the quaternary associations and anchoring of the enzyme in membranes or extracellular matrices (7Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurosci. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) as follows: the H and T peptides, encoded by alternative exons, characterize, respectively, AChEHsubunits, producing glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored dimers, and AChET subunits, producing an array of homo- and hetero-oligomers, including collagen-tailed molecules. This splicing pattern is, however, variable, since Drosophila possesses only AChEH subunits, and chicken possesses only AChET subunits. 2A. Anselmet, unpublished results. 2A. Anselmet, unpublished results.To understand this variability, it is necessary to explore the structure of AChE genes in the various vertebrate lineages. Reagents for biochemistry were purchased from Prolabo (Paris, France) or from Sigma. Products, enzymes, and kits for molecular biology were from Ambion, Biolabs, Bioprobe Systems, Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen, Macherey-Nagel, Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Promega, and U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genset. Radioactive α-35S-labeled and α-32P-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Corp. Phosphatidylinositol- phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the “flag” epitope was from Eastman Kodak. Live Electrophorus were obtained from Worldwide Scientific Animals (Apopka, FL); they were rapidly sacrificed, and their tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen. Collagen-tailed AChE was extracted from Electrophorus electric organs in a high salt buffer and purified by a combination of affinity chromatography, low ionic strength aggregation, and isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl (8Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Bon S. Huet M. Lemonnier M. Rieger F. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Tryptic fragments of the catalytic subunit were sequenced by Prof. Joel Vandekerckhove (Rijksuniversiteit Gent, Belgium), as described (10Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). mRNAs from Electrophorus electric organs were reverse-transcribed using oligonucleotide hexamers, for construction of a λZAP-II library, which contained 160,000 independent recombinants. The cloning strategy is schematically indicated in Fig. 1. To obtain a non-degenerate probe, we first amplified a fragment of the coding region by PCR, using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The forward primer F1 was deduced from the sequence of a tryptic peptide, LLDQR (170–174,Torpedo numbering). The reverse primer R1 was based on the peptide sequence WPEWMG (432–437), which is identically conserved in all known sequences of vertebrate and invertebrate cholinesterases. We thus amplified a fragment of 910 bp, called El1. This PCR product was ligated in the PCR-II plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the method of Sanger, with the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). We amplified an overlapping fragment of 320 bp (El2), extending further upstream, using a forward degenerate primer, F2, based on another conserved region (EMWNPN, 82–87) and a reverse primer R2 deduced from the sequence of El1. The cloned El1 and El2 fragments were used to synthesize radioactive α-32P probes to screen the cDNA library. We thus obtained clones C1, C2, C3 and C4, as shown in Fig. 1. Total RNA was extracted from electric organs (Bioprobe Systems). Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed from the poly(A) tail, using the oligonucleotide (dT)17-Ri-Ro (11Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in 20 μl. The products were diluted to 100 μl with water, and 10 μl of this dilution were used for amplification by PCR, using the forward primer F3 in the C3 sequence and Ro as the reverse primer (Fig. 1). For a second amplification, we used a specific downstream (nested) forward primer F4 and the Ri reverse primer, with 5 μl of the 100-fold diluted product of the first reaction. The RACE-3′ product, obtained after two amplifications, was cloned in the PCR-II vector. A complete coding region was constructed from the C3 cDNA fragment and the RACE-3′ product, using a unique HgaI restriction site and ligated into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), after digestion by HindIII and EcoRI. The resulting construct was called cDNAT. A model of Electrophorus electricus AChE, obtained by the first approach protocol of Swiss-Model, using the structure of Torpedo californica AChE as template, was displayed with the RASMOL program. Approximately 1 g of Electrophorus spleen, stored in liquid nitrogen, was powdered with liquid nitrogen in a mortar and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) for 2 h at 55 °C; 0.25 volume of saturated NaCl was added, and the homogenate was vigorously shaken and centrifuged for 20 min at 1500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NaCl) with 1 mg/ml RNase A. PCR was performed with 200 ng of genomic DNA, using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) and 20 pmol of each primer, in a final volume of 100 μl. After 10 min at 94 °C, we performed 35 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C). This was sufficient for all sets of primers (F1/R1, F3/R3, F4/R3, F5/R4, see Fig.2), except in one case (F2/R2), for which we performed a second amplification of 30 cycles with 1/100 of the product of the first amplification. The PCR products were cloned into PCR-II and sequenced either directly or after a series of deletions according to Henikoff (12Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), using exonuclease III (Biolabs), S1 nuclease from Aspergillus oryzae (Pharmacia), and T4 DNA ligase (Promega). A fragment of genomic DNA, which had been amplified by PCR with the primers F4/R3, was inserted in the PCR-II vector and digested by HgaI (in the coding sequence) and BamHI (in the polylinker). The product of digestion was ligated with a fragment of C3, between the HindIII and HgaI sites. The resulting DNA segment contained the complete coding sequence of AChET and the intronic regions located between exons 3, 4, and T; it was inserted into pCDNA3 after digestion by HindIII and BamHI. This partial genomic construction (lacking the intron between exons 2 and 3) was named iT (Fig. 2). We deleted the 3′ end of this construction, between a unique HincII site located 7 bp upstream of exon T and the polylinker, producing iΔT. In these constructions iT and iΔT, we also suppressed the acceptor splicing sites of exon T and pseudo-exon VLECC (see “Results”), by point mutations from AG to TT: the resulting constructions were called imT and imΔT (Fig. 2). Total RNA was extracted from cells that had been incubated for 48 h at 37 °C after transfection and was analyzed by RACE-3′ or by RPA. Labeled RNA probes were synthesized by Sp6 RNA polymerase with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). They were purified by electrophoresis in sequencing gels containing 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide and eluted in 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS at 37 °C. RNA from Electrophorus tissues or transfected cells was hybridized with radioactive probes and digested by RNase, using the HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion). The protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide sequencing gels and analyzed in a Fuji image analyzer (BAS 1000). In the constructions cDNAT, iΔT, and imΔT, a sequence encoding the flag peptide epitope DYKDDDDK (13Knappik A. Plückthun A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the stop codons of the coding sequences of the T and VLECC C-terminal peptides (Fig.2). Prior to analysis by gel electrophoresis, extracts and culture media from cells expressing these “flagged” constructions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 1/20 of the monoclonal antibody M2, which recognizes the epitope in a C-terminal position. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al. (14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), in pCDNA3, as described previously (5Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were used as primers for unmodified T7 DNA polymerase form II (Biolabs), on single strands which were produced according to Blondel and Thillet (15Blondel A. Thillet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the pCDNA3 constructions cDNAC and cDNACΔI, an EcoRI site was introduced 80 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon (see Fig. 2). The coding regions were inserted at the EcoRI site of the pHILD2 expression vector (Invitrogen). The GS115 P. pastorisstrain was transformed with the pHILD2 vector after linearization by either NotI or SalI, as described elsewhere (16Morel N. Massoulié J. Biochem. J. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the enzyme that was secreted in the culture medium 3–5 days after induction with 1% methanol. Plasmidic DNA was prepared with the Nucleobond plasmid purification kit (Macherey-Nagel). COS7, HEK293, and CHO cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA per 10-cm dish containing about 106 cells, using the DEAE-dextran method for COS cells, as described previously (17Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or the calcium phosphate method for HEK and CHO cells (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Contrary to HEK and COS cells, CHO cells do not possess the SV40 T antigen and thus do not allow the replication of the pCDNA3 vector. Transiently transfected cells were generally grown at 37 °C for 36–48 h after transfection and then transferred to 27 °C for 48–72 h. The transfected cells were scraped in 2 ml of cold TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl) and centrifuged 5 min at 1,500 × g at 4 °C. The cellular pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of extraction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 5 mm MgCl2; 0.01 mg/ml bacitracin; 1% Triton X-100) and homogenized in a Potter glass-teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged 20 min at 19,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the cellular extract. Extracts from various Electrophorus tissues were prepared by homogenizing approximately 0.5 g of tissue in 7 volumes of extraction buffer without detergent with an Ultraturrax T25 homogenizer (Janke and Kunkel, IKA Labortechnik). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 20 min, at 7 °C, was the “soluble” fraction. The pellet was re-homogenized in 7 volumes of extraction buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min, at 7 °C, yielding the “detergent-soluble” fraction. The AChE activity of tissue extracts, cellular extracts, and culture media was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (19Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20678) Google Scholar). Enzyme samples were added to 0.2 ml of the assay medium (1 mm acetylthiocholine, in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm at 30-s intervals, over a period of 5 min, using a Multiskan RC microplate reader (Labsystems). One Ellman unit (EU) corresponds to an increase in optical density of 1 per min, with a path length of 1 cm. For the determination of kinetic parameters, we used crude extracts from electric organs and from transfected cells, as well as secreted AChE from P. pastoris. The extracts were diluted to 0.5 EU/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; in some experiments, we added 1 m NaCl, as indicated. The values of K m and K ss, as defined by the Haldane equation, were fitted with the Kaleidagraph software, as described previously (5Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Catalytic turnover numbers (k cat) were determined by titrating the active sites of AChE with the irreversible inhibitor O-ethyl-S-[2-(diisopropylamino)-ethyl]methylphosphonothioate (20Vigny M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Leterrier F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed at the Centre d'Etudes du Bouchet. For sedimentation analyses, samples of tissue extracts, cell extracts, or culture medium containing about 100 mEU of AChE activity were centrifuged in 5–20% sucrose gradients, in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.08 mg/ml bacitracin, either without detergent or in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 or Brij-96, as described previously (5Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J.

The samples were mixed with Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (16 S) and alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) as internal standards of sedimentation coefficients. After centrifugation, the gradients were collected from the bottom of the tubes with a Microperpex peristaltic pump (LKB, Bromma, Sweden) and distributed into about 48 fractions of approximately 300 μl in microtitration plates with an FC 205 fraction collector (Gilson). Samples were transferred to other microtitration plates for assays of AChE (100 μl) and of sedimentation standards (50 μl). S values were obtained by assuming a linear relationship with fraction numbers. Nondenaturing electrophoresis was performed as described previously (17Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and AChE activity was stained by the method of Karnovsky and Roots (23Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). To clone AChE from Electrophorus, we used a partial sequence obtained from purified Electrophorus AChE, LLDQR, corresponding to residues 170–174 of Torpedo AChE (note: the number refers to the corresponding Torpedoresidue that is considered as a reference (24Massoulié J. Bon S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1982; 5: 57-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 25Massoulié J. Sussman J.L. Doctor B.P. Soreq H. Velan B. Cygler M. Rotundo R.L. Shafferman A. Silman I.

As shown in Fig.1, oligonucleotide primers allowed us to amplify successive fragments of the coding sequence by PCR, from cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of electric organ poly(A)+ RNA. The El1 fragment clearly encodes AChE, including the characteristic peptide motif that surrounds the active site serine, FGESAG. An R2 primer, derived from El1, was combined with F2, corresponding to the EMWNPN peptide sequence, allowing us to amplify an overlapping upstream fragment, El2. Using radioactive probes derived from the El1 and El2 fragments, we obtained several cDNA clones from a random-primed cDNA library, constructed from electric organ mRNA. The clone that contained the longest insert, C3, was totally sequenced; it extends 117 bp upstream of the initiation codon of the AChE open reading frame but is incomplete at the 3′ end. Using the RACE-3′ method, we obtained the 3′ end of the coding sequence and a 3′-untranslated sequence of approximately 770 bp that precedes the poly(A) tail. A complete coding sequence was constructed from these elements (Fig. 1) and used for expression of Electrophorus AChE. Partial genomic and other constructs are described in Fig. 2. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 633 amino acids, beginning with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The mature protein contains the peptides that were labeled and sequenced by Salih et al. (26Salih E. Chishti S.B. Vicedomine P. Cohen S.G. Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). (These sequences were published after our cloning of Electrophorus AChE.) Fig.3 shows an alignment of the deduced primary sequence of Electrophorus AChE with that of Torpedo AChE (type T). The catalytic domains of the two proteins present 68% identity, without taking into account a 29-amino acid insertion that exists only in Electrophorus AChE, between residues 415 and 416 of Torpedo AChE. The additional peptide is highly hydrophilic, containing 7 glycines and 7 serines. A three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of Electrophorus AChE, deduced from the structure of Torpedo AChE, indicates that this peptide is located at the surface of the molecule and may partially adopt an α-helical structure (Fig. 4).Figure 4Three-dimensional structure of Electrophorus and Torpedo AChEs. Left panels, Torpedo AChE; right panels, Electrophorus AChE. The ribbon structures of the two enzymes are shown in similar orientations, with the opening of the catalytic gorge (indicated by an arrow) on the right side (top) and on the left side (bottom). Selected residues are shown in space filling view; the active site serine (Ser-200, according to Torpedo numbering) is shown in red; in the peripheral site, tryptophan 279 is shown in green; the Ω loop (Cys-67–Cys-94) is shown in blue, with the two cysteines as well as the tryptophan 84 in the active site in dark blue. The non-conserved peptide of Electrophorus AChE and the two residues corresponding to its extremities in Torpedo AChE (415–416) are shown in yellow. Part of this peptide is predicted to assume an α-helical conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As expected, Electrophorus AChE possesses the 6 cysteines that form three intracatenary disulfide bonds, the three amino acids of the catalytic triad (Ser-200, Glu-327, and His-440), the aromatic residues Phe-288 and Phe-290, which define an acetylcholine-specific acyl pocket, the tryptophan residue Trp-84, which interacts with the choline moiety in the active site, as well as the 14 aromatic residues lining the walls of the gorge; 13 of these residues are identical, but Phe-330 of Torpedo AChE is replaced by Tyr in Electrophorus AChE, as well as in Drosophila,Bungarus, mouse, and human AChEs (3Cousin X. Hotelier T. Liévin P. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Together with Trp-84, this residue constitutes the choline-binding subsite of the catalytic site; both the Electrophorus Tyr-330 and TorpedoPhe-330 residues were found to react with the photoactivable ligand p-(N,N-dimethylamino)-benzenediazonium fluoroborate (27Harel M.

The peptide sequence contains 6 putative sites for N-glycosylation, one of which (Asn-161, corresponding to His-159 in Torpedo) has not been observed previously in other ChEs; it seems to be localized at the surface of the protein, in the loop joining the secondary structure elements β4 and αC. The C-terminal sequence (underlined in Fig. 3) clearly corresponds to a T peptide; it contains all the aromatic residues that are conserved in T peptides of vertebrate cholinesterases and a comparison with the Torpedo C-terminal 40 residues revealed only 9 differences (4Cousin X.

The cloned cDNA therefore encodes a catalytic subunit of type T, AChET, in agreement with the fact that Electrophorus electric organs only contain collagen-tailed forms of AChE (7Massoulié J.

COS, HEK, and CHO cells were transiently transfected with a pCDNA3 vector encoding the Electrophorus AChET subunit. The production of active AChE was considerably increased when the cells were incubated at 27 °C, rather than 37 °C, after transfection, as reported previously in the case of Torpedo AChE (17Duval N.

After 72 h, 40% of the total activity was released in the culture medium, as shown in Table I, indicating that secretion of this enzyme is somewhat less efficient than that of AChET from rat, but more than that of Torpedo, at 27 °C (30Bon S.

Sedimentation analyses showed that extracts from transfected cells contained mostly amphiphilic dimers, G2a, sedimenting at 5.9 S in the presence of Brij-96 and 7.1 S in the presence of Triton X-100, together with smaller proportions of amphiphilic tetramers, G4a, sedimenting at 10.3 S in Brij-96 and 11 S in Triton X-100, and of nonamphiphilic tetramers, G4na, sedimenting at 12 S in the presence of both detergents (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the culture medium also contained a majority of amphiphilic dimers, G2a, but the proportion of tetramers, G4na (12 S) and G4a, was higher than in the cell extract. In addition, the secreted amphiphilic AChE forms (G2a and G4a) sedimented slightly but reproducibly faster than the cellular forms, 6.3 S in Brij-96 and 7.3 S in Triton X-100 for the secreted G2a form and 11 S in Brij-96 for the secreted G4a form. The nature and the proportions of AChE forms produced in transfected HEK, COS, and CHO cells appeared identical, according to sedimentation analyses (not shown). However, in nondenaturing electrophoresis, the migration of AChE forms produced in CHO cells appeared slightly different from that of the corresponding molecules produced in COS cells (Fig. 6) and in HEK cells (not shown); this was probably due to differences in glycosylation. A flag epitope, when inserted at the end of the AChET protein, did not alter the production of active AChE, or the proportions of the different oligomeric forms, but increased secretion by more than 50%. Although the cellular enzyme was retarded by the anti-flag M2 monoclonal antibody in nondenaturing electrophoresis, most of the secreted enzyme was not affected (Fig. 7,lanes 1–6), indicating that proteolytic removal of a peptide fragment may occur upon release, as previously observed in the case of rat AChET (30Bon S.

We demonstrated that L/F-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. However, here we present data suggesting that the L/F-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Gram-positive species, such as Staphylococcus aureus. A sequence comparison of the known L/F-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the L/F-transferase family. Despite this sequence variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and L/F-transferase homologs from Providencia stuartii, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. all complemented an E. coli aat mutant (lacking L/F-transferase activity) for the degradation of N-end rule substrates. In vitro comparison of the most divergent L/F-transferase homologs, from E. coli and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of both substrate specificity and secondary structure. Finally, we demonstrated that variants of the E. coli L/F-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 N-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. Overall, our results identified an essential core of an L/F-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids."

Miflin B. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. 6. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U. K.1989: 115-162Google Scholar). This complex is embedded in the thylakoid membrane of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria and is made up of more than 20 different subunits (3Hankamer B. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1997; 48: 641-671Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is now accepted that the photochemical reactions of PSII take place in a reaction center comprised of two proteins, D1 and D2 (4Babcock G.T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 209-215Google Scholar), which show many characteristics similar to those of the L and M subunits of purple photosynthetic bacteria. These subunits bind all of the redox factors required for primary electron transfer. In higher plants the D1 and D2 subunits, encoded by the chloroplast psbA and psbD genes, respectively, are synthesized on the 70 S ribosomes that are attached to the stromal thylakoids. Evidence from several biochemical and molecular biological studies has shown that upon translation both proteins undergo a variety of structural modifications. It is believed that most of these covalent changes are involved in the development and assembly of active PSII complexes or in controlling the triggering and degradation of the photodamaged PSII components (for review, see Ref. 5Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry is a highly valuable technique in the field of structural biochemistry. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), with an accuracy of about 0.01%, provides an extremely sensitive method for determining the precise molecular mass of biological molecules >100 kDa. In many cases, the measurement of the intact molecular mass of a protein and comparison with the predicted value have been used to verify gene sequences, locate mRNA processing and editing events (1Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), identify mutations (6Lindo V.S. Kakkar V.V. Learmonth M. Melissari E. Zappacosta F. Panico M. Morris H.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 89: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), detect post-translational modifications, and provide confirmation of start and stop signals of a gene, which, in some instances such as that of the psbC gene encoding the CP43 protein, have been difficult to define by other methods (7Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, now a substantial number of publications, concerned mainly with hydrophilic proteins, describe the successful application of this technique. ESI-MS of very hydrophobic species such as membrane proteins has, however, proved significantly more challenging than related studies on hydrophilic proteins. This characteristic can be attributed mainly to the incompatibility between most mass spectrometric techniques and the presence of detergents and/or salts required to retain the analytes in solution. Thus, the successful analysis of hydrophobic proteins and peptides relies upon developing successful sample handling protocols that are compatible with the technique. Recently, we reported the use of MS to elucidate the complete primary structures of the small subunits of the isolated PSII reaction center complex (1Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we have employed ESI-MS together with a novel purification method to analyze the intact D1 and D2 subunits isolated from pea plants (Pisum sativum L.). Detailed characterization of the modification sites and further verification of the D1 and D2 protein sequences were obtained by mapping studies reported in the accompanying paper (12Sharma J. Panico M. Shipton C.A. Nilsson F. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The PSII reaction center preparations (RCII), consisting of the D1 and D2 proteins, the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559, and the product of the psbI gene, were isolated from pea thylakoid membranes as detailed previously (8Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Rogers L.J. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. 5. Academic Press, London1990: 171-193Google Scholar). Partial separation of the PSII reaction center proteins was achieved by using a Spherisorb Aquapore RP-300 (220 × 4.6 mm) column fitted to a Kontron HPLC system (Datasystem 450, HPLC pump 420, Detector 430 and Mixer M800). RCII were dialyzed against 2 × 2,000 ml of aqueous 5% acetic acid at 4 °C for 16–24 h and were loaded directly onto the column. The subunits making up the isolated reaction center were eluted with a solvent system of A = aqueous 5% acetic acid and B = propan-1-ol, using a linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Elution was monitored at 254 nm and 280 nm, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The fractions obtained from HPLC purification of the reaction center complex were analyzed by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using the LKB 2001 vertical electrophoresis apparatus (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Linear gradient, 10–17% polyacrylamide, gels containing 6 m urea of 1-mm thickness were used during analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The buffer system employed was 0.2 m glycine, 25 mmTris-HCl, and 0.1% SDS. The reaction center samples were solubilized in an equal volume of 250 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.9) before application to the gel. After electrophoresis the proteins were electroblotted onto polymeric membranes, nitrocellulose (Sartorius 0.45 mm), using Towbin buffer (Tris glycine, pH 8.3) according to a modification of the protocol first devised by Towbin et al. (10Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Transfer was performed at 4 °C using a plate electrode blotting system. The antibodies used to detect the D1 and D2 proteins were a kind gift from Dr. P. Nixon. An alkaline phosphatase conjugation procedure, developed by Sigma, was then employed followed by appropriate chromogenic substrates to visualize the products. ESI mass spectra of the intact reaction center proteins were obtained by direct injection of 10-μl aliquots of HPLC-purified samples into the ion source of a VG Bio-Q triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated using a carrier flow buffer of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, propan-1-ol, and 2-methoxyethanol in a 1:1:1:1 (v/v) ratio at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using a solution of horse heart myoglobin (1 pm μl−1). Two mass spectrometric techniques, ESI-MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-MS (MALDI-TOF-MS), are now used routinely for elucidating the intact molecular masses of large biological molecules. The main advantage of ESI-MS is that it offers a much higher mass accuracy than MALDI-TOF-MS; on the other hand, the latter procedure is thought to benefit from an ability to tolerate the presence of moderate quantities of salts and detergents. However, despite the anticipated utility of MALDI-MS for analyzing the hydrophobic proteins studied here, our initial studies to characterize partially purified D1 and D2 proteins by this technique were unsuccessful. A key factor in the structural studies reported in this paper has been the ability to develop appropriate sample handling and purification strategies. After attempting numerous liquid chromatographic separations, including ion exchange and gel permeation methods, all of which failed, an effective reverse phase chromatographic method for isolating the D1 and D2 proteins in media compatible with ESI-MS was obtained. The first step of our protocol involved the dialysis of the RCII samples against 5% aqueous acetic acid. We found that this step assisted in the slow removal of some of the salts and detergents that are present in the preparations while maintaining the solubility of the protein complex. The RCII subunits were then separated from the dialysis sample by employing a propan-1-ol and 5% aqueous acetic acid solvent mix in a gradient HPLC elution system. We found that a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 and linear 60-min elution gradient (increasing organic solvent) gave the best protein separation with this system while again avoiding precipitation of the protein on the column. The optimized HPLC profile generated for dark-treated RCII using the devised protocol is presented in Fig. 1. Apart from the broad UV-absorbing peak at approximately 36 min which shows virtually no separation at the peaks (but in later studies were shown to be deconvoluted), the rest of the UV-absorbing components at retention times of 27.0, 30.4, 32.8, and 47.0 min have been isolated to near base-line resolution. Subsequently, the HPLC fractions corresponding to these regions of UV absorption were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the D1 and D2 (Fig.2). It can be seen that the earlier HPLC fractions corresponding to the UV absorbance region at 33–43 min are dominated by the D1 subunit, whereas in the later ones, corresponding to the tail of this broad peak, D2 is the main component. Thus, this chromatographic procedure provides a partial separation of the two highly similar D1 and D2 proteins. The last UV absorbance peak, eluting at 47.0 min, which appeared as a green solution, has been attributed to the free pigments of the PSII samples. The three smaller UV peaks at 27.0, 30.4, and 32.8 min, were presumed, and later shown, to correspond to small subunits of the reaction center complex.Figure 2Western blot analysis using D1- and D2-specific antibodies, across the main UV-absorbing fractions obtained from the HPLC purification of dark-treated RCII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPLC fractions corresponding to all of the regions of UV absorbance were then analyzed by direct injection into the ESI-MS, avoiding a drying or concentration step that we have shown leads to irreversible protein adsorption. After deconvolution of the ESI mass spectra the components corresponding to the first three UV-absorbing peaks, 27.0, 30.4, and 32.8 min, were attributed average molecular masses of 4,394.8 ± 0.4, 9,283.7 ± 0.8, and 4209.5 ± 0.4 Da, respectively. These masses are in excellent agreement with values obtained from previous characterization studies (1Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and can be assigned to the β-subunit of cytochrome b 559, the α-subunit of cytochrome b 559, and the psbI gene product, respectively. In contrast to these components, the ESI mass spectra generated from the HPLC fractions corresponding to the D1 and D2 proteins were complicated; signal heterogeneity was observed within the peaks corresponding to distinct charge states (Fig. 3). This characteristic is indicative of structural heterogeneity within the D1 and D2 protein populations. However, by using relatively large scale reaction center preparations we have been able to determine accurate molecular masses for principal forms of both the D1 and D2 proteins (Fig. 4 and 5).Figure 4Transformed ESI mass spectrum of HPLC fraction 34. The molecular mass of the main component is in good agreement with that expected for the nonphosphorylated, NH2- and COOH-terminal processed D1 subunit. This spectrum also highlights the presence of heterogeneous forms of the D1 protein. The mass accuracy anticipated in this type of experiment is of the order of 0.01%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The average chemical molecular mass expected for the D1 protein of peas, calculated from its nucleotide-derived protein sequence and utilizing the known COOH- (11Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 420: 6-8Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and NH2-terminal modifications (7Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is 38,033.6 Da for the nonphosphorylated form and 38,113.6 Da for the phosphorylated form. In comparison, we obtained an average experimental molecular mass of 38,040.9 ± 6.5 Da for one of the principle components in HPLC fraction 34. This species is in relatively good agreement with the expected molecular mass of the nonphosphorylated form of the D1 subunit. However, the transformed ESI mass spectrum in Fig. 4 also clearly indicates the presence of heterogeneous forms of the D1 protein. The higher molecular mass products probably correlate with D1 subunits that have been modified in a way different from the nonphosphorylated protein. Subsequent mapping studies on the D1 protein using cyanogen bromide and trypsin digestion with MS analyses, reported in the accompanying paper (12Sharma J. Panico M. Shipton C.A. Nilsson F. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), have identified oxidations and phosphorylations as sources of the structural diversity observed. The calculated molecular mass for the D2 protein of pea, including NH2-terminal processing, is 39,463.5 Da for the nonphosphorylated form and 39543.5 Da for the phosphorylated form. An average chemical molecular mass of 39,456.1 ± 7.7 Da was obtained by deconvolution of the ESI mass spectrum of HPLC fraction 38. Thus, based on the close correlation of molecular masses, the protein characterized is assigned as the nonphosphorylated, NH2-terminally processed form of the D2 subunit. Once again, heterogeneous forms for this component can also be observed in the transformed spectrum (Fig. 5), possibly corresponding to oxidations reported in the accompanying paper (12Sharma J. Panico M. Shipton C.A. Nilsson F. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A classical protein purification technique used regularly in the preparation of samples for MS analysis is column chromatography. Two forms of this methodology, affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography, had previously been applied during the characterization of the NH2-terminal (7Michel H. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and COOH-terminal (11Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 420: 6-8Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) structures of the D1 protein. The former protocol was utilized to isolate phosphorylated polypeptides specifically and thus was of limited use in this study. On the other hand, the gel filtration protocol was found to provide a means for partially separating PSII reaction center proteins and pigments (11Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 420: 6-8Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This purification system, however, could not be applied directly for MS studies as it employed the use of SDS, which is incompatible with most MS ionization methods. Omitting the use of detergent in the gel filtration procedure was one of the first methods explored to separate the RCII components for MS studies. Unfortunately, the modified protocol was found to result in reduction of resolution and significant decrease in yield, thus this system was also unsuitable for application in these structural investigations. Despite the difficulties of purifying hydrophobic proteins for MS studies, we have developed an effective method for isolating the five RCII protein subunits in a salt- and detergent-free state and in a single chromatographic step. This is an important achievement because these hydrophobic polypeptides and proteins have previously only been separated using systems containing salts and detergents. Our protocol with its combined dialysis and HPLC purification steps gives a near base-line separation of the three small subunits and partial resolution of the D1 and D2 proteins. Moreover, we found it essential to analyze the purified components directly by ESI MS, thus allowing rapid characterization following their isolation. The precise molecular masses obtained for the three small subunits, the α-subunit of cytochrome b 559, β-subunit of cytochrome 559, and the psbI gene product, are 9,283.7 ± 0.8, 4,394.8 ± 0.4, and 4,209.5 ± 0.4 Da, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the values predicted from their protein sequences, after making allowances for the structural modifications reported in our previous paper (1Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During the HPLC purification, we noticed that the D1 and D2 proteins eluted over an unusually broad concentration range of propan-1-ol, between approximately 51 and 66%. Because the characteristics of this elution profile cannot be attributed solely to the extremely high hydrophobicity of these components, we believed that additional factors such as sample heterogeneity were present. This was substantiated further by the complexity of the ESI mass spectra for the D1 and D2 subunits; nevertheless we have made reasonably accurate assignments of the main forms of these proteins. The molecular mass ascribed to the D1 protein is in good agreement with that expected for the nonphosphorylated, NH2- and COOH-terminally processed component. Molecular ions corresponding to that anticipated for the nonphosphorylated, NH2-terminally processed form of the D2 subunit could also be identified in these studies. In addition, our data show for the first time that there is a degree of molecular diversity on the D1 and D2 proteins present in mature PSII reaction center complexes, a topic that is addressed in the following paper (12Sharma J.

Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, activates both ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors (mGluR) 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptors; G-protein, GTP-binding proteins; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; l-AP4,l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate; nt, nucleotides; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MPPG, α-methyl-4-phosphonophenyl glycine. coupled to GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Recent molecular cloning studies have identified eight different subtypes of glutamate metabotropic receptors (1Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R.

These receptors possess seven putative membrane-spanning domains preceded by a large extracellular domain that probably functions as the ligand-binding domain (3Takahshi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y.

Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Despite having an overall design similar to other G-protein-coupled receptors, mGluRs do not have sequence similarity to other G-protein-coupled receptors, except the recently cloned γ-aminobutyric acid β receptors where the identity is only 18–23% (5Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The coupling of mGluRs to G-proteins and second messenger systems has been studied in heterologous expression systems using either Xenopus oocytes or stable cell lines. From these studies, it appears that a variety of different G-proteins are involved in the coupling of mGluRs to either phospholipase C or adenyl cyclase (1Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 2Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1031-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate retina, glutamate is the neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors in the dark. At the synapse between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, glutamate functions as both an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter, exciting OFF-bipolar cells by opening ionotropic glutamate receptors and inhibiting ON-bipolar cells by activating a metabotropic receptor (6Nakanishi S. Trends Neurobiol. 1995; 18: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Devries S.H. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 139-149Google Scholar). l-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4) mimics the action of l-glutamate at ON-bipolar cells and selectively hyperpolarizes these cells (8Slaughter M.M. Miller R.F. Science. 1981; 211: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 9Shiells R.A. Falk G. Naghsgineh S. Nature. 1981; 294: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Based on a series of physiological and pharmacological studies, it has been suggested that both l-glutamate and l-AP4 activate the G-protein-coupled mGluR expressed in ON-bipolar cells and activate a cGMP biochemical cascade similar to the light-activated phototransduction cascade in the rod and cone photoreceptors. It has further been suggested that upon activation, mGluR6 can stimulate a transducin-like G-protein that activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase (10Nawy S. Jahr C.E. Nature. 1990; 346: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,11Shiells R.A. Falk G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1990; 242: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in intracellular concentrations of cGMP leads to the closure of cGMP-gated, cation-selective ion channels and results in hyperpolarization of ON-bipolar cells (12Nawy S. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1991; 7: 677-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Sheils R.A. Falk G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1992; 247: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Villa P.D.L. Kurahashi T. Kaneko A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3571-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Light, which hyperpolarizes the photoreceptors, transiently depolarizes the ON-bipolar cells. Thus, this metabotropic receptor, mGluR6, is likely the only metabotropic receptor that directly mediates synaptic transmission. Although there is considerable evidence to support the involvement of an mGluR (mGluR6) in mediating the dark, hyperpolarizing response of ON-bipolar cells, there is little evidence supporting the idea that the components of the mGluR6-linked second messenger pathway are similar to the proteins involved in the cGMP cascade found in photoreceptors. Using genetically engineered mice, it has recently been demonstrated that mGluR6 mediates the synaptic effects of glutamate in both rod and cone ON-bipolar cells and is essential for normal visual processing (15Masu M. Iwakabe H. Tagawa Y. Miyoshi T. Yamashita M. Fukuda Y. Sasaki H. Hiroi K. Nakamura Y. Shigemoto R. Nakao K. Katsuri M. Nakanishi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 16Ueda Y. Iwakabe H. Masu M. Suzuki M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MGluR6 was originally cloned from a rat retinal cDNA library and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (17Nakajima Y. Iwakabe H. Akazawa C. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this heterologous expression system the activation of mGluR6 inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenyl cyclase with no indication of involvement in a cGMP cascade (17Nakajima Y. Iwakabe H. Akazawa C. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made with the human homolog, hmGluR6 (18Laurie D.J. Schoeffter P. Wiederhold K.H. Sommer B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An alternate approach to attempt to link mGluR6 to a cGMP biochemical cascade has been to probe bipolar cells with immunological probes. No cross-reactivity was observed in vertebrate bipolar cells with antibodies to transducin, cGMP phosphodiesterase, cGMP-gated channel, or arrestin, which are some of the proteins involved in mediating the cGMP cascade of rod photoreceptors, suggesting that the proteins involved in the second messenger system in bipolar cells are not identical with those expressed in rod photoreceptors (19Noga V. Matesic D.F. Manning D.R. Liebman P.A. Sterling P. Visual Neurosci. 1993; 10: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Wassle H. Grunert U. Cook N.J. Molday R.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 134: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A recent physiological study demonstrated that the cGMP-gated channel expressed in cat bipolar cells has properties different from the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels found in either photoreceptors or olfactory receptors (14Villa P.D.L. Kurahashi T. Kaneko A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3571-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a different class of cGMP-gated channels may be expressed in ON-bipolar cells. Furthermore, Noga et al. found that a Go-specific antibody cross-reacted with rod bipolar cells, suggesting that mGluR6 may activate a Go-like G-protein (19Noga V. Matesic D.F. Manning D.R. Liebman P.A. Sterling P. Visual Neurosci. 1993; 10: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are needed to identify the second messenger system that links mGluR6 activation to hyperpolarization of retinal ON-bipolar cells. To address the coupling of mGluR6 to a G-protein, we examined it in an in vitro reconstitution system. We cloned and modified the human mGluR6, expressed it in COS-7 cells, purified it, and assayed its function in an in vitro GTP binding assay. Our results demonstrate that mGluR6 can activate both transducin and Goin an agonist-dependent fashion. The rate of Goactivation was 18-fold greater than the rate of transducin activation, suggesting that a Go type G-protein may be activated by mGluR6 in vivo. All reagents, except where indicated, were purchased from Sigma. l-AP4 was purchased from Tocris Neuramin. [35S]GTPγS was from NEN, and nonradiolabeled GTPγS (tetra lithium salt) was from Boehringer Mannheim. LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc. Go was obtained from Calbiochem. Frozen bovine retinas were obtained from Schenk Packing Company (Stanwood, WA). The monoclonal antibody rhodopsin 1D4, which is specific for the C terminus of rhodopsin has been previously described (21Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Peptide I (DEASTTVSKTETSQVAPA) was purchased from the American Peptide Co., Inc. Two million recombinants of human adult hippocampal λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) using oligo(dT) and randomly primed poly(A)+ RNA, were screened with a C-terminal (nt 1851–2750) rat mGluR4 probe (22Tanabe Y. Nomura A. Masu M. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mGluR4 probe was generated by random priming the gel purified fragment using [32P]dCTP (Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit, Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 60 °C in 5 × SSC/5 × Denhardt's/0.2% SDS/50 mg/ml herring testis DNA. Washes were done for 30 min each at 65 °C in 2 × SSC/0.2% SDS followed by two 1 × SSC/0.2% SDS washes. One plaque hybridized to the C-terminal fragment of mGluR4 and was rescued into Bluescript SK(−) phagemids by in vivo excision and characterized. One partial mGluR6 cDNA (pBS-cmR1; nt 1463–2140) was obtained. Unless otherwise noted, the nucleotide numbers in the text refer to the human mGluR6 coding and 3′-untranslated sequences reported here, with negative numbers representing 5′-untranslated sequence. One million recombinants from a λgt10 human retinal cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized with a32P-labeled 610-base pair PstI fragment isolated from pBS-cmR1 (nt 1541–2123) at 30% formamide, 5 × sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer (SSPE), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 4% SDS, and 2 mg/ml boiled herring sperm at 42 °C. The filters were washed at 0.2 - SSPE, 0.2% SDS; 65 °C. Twelve partial hmGluR6 cDNA clones were obtained (METAB65-METAB76) from this screen. Sequence analysis of these cDNAs revealed that METAB75 was the largest partial mGluR6 cDNA (nt 794–3105) isolated. To obtain the 5′ portion of human mGluR6, a specifically primed human retinal λgt10 cDNA library was constructed using an antisense mGluR6 oligonucleotide (nt 1083–1058) to prime human retinal poly(A)+ RNA essentially as described by Gubler and Hoffman (23Gubler U. Hoffman B. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar) and Lapeyre and Amalric (24Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.3 × 106 recombinants from the λgt10 specifically primed library were screened with a 582-base pair SmaI fragment (nt 820–1401) from METAB75 at the hybridization and washing stringencies described above for the retinal library screening. Twenty hybridizing plaques were identified in this screen and eight putative human mGluR6 clones (METAB77 to METAB85) were isolated and characterized. The full-length pCMV-2(−SA/SD)hmGluR6 construct was prepared using the METAB85 (nt −84 to 1083) and METAB75 (nt 794–3105) cDNAs. Initially, 1.1- and 2.3-kilobase EcoRI fragments isolated from METAB85 and METAB75, respectively, were subcloned into the pGEM7Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI). An EcoRI/ScaI fragment from pGEM-METAB85 (nt −84 to 1024) and a ScaI/HindIII fragment from pGEM-METAB75 (nt 1025–3105) were ligated with EcoRI/HindIII digested pCMV-T7–2(−SA/SD) vector to form pCMV-2(−SA/SD)-hmGluR6. The cDNA sequence of hmGluR6 was determined completely on both strands. The construction of the pCMV-T7–2 vector was described previously (25Daggett L.P. Sacaan A.I. Akong M. Rao S.P. Hess S.D. Liaw C. Urrutia A. Jachec C. Ellis S.B. Dreessen J. Knöpfel T. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Testa C.M. Young A.B. Varney M. Johnson E.C. Velicelebi G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The pCMV-T7–2(−SA/SD) vector was constructed by digesting pCMV-T7–2 with XhoI and then blunt ending the DNA. The pCMV construct was then digested with StuI. This series of digestions removes the sequence that encodes the splice donor and splice acceptor site recognition sequences (nt 1018–1147). The remaining portion of the vector was then religated to yield pCMV-T7–2(−SA/SD). The cDNA for the human mGluR6 was modified by the addition to the C terminus of 15 amino acids (STTVSKTETSQVAPA) corresponding to the epitope for the rhodopsin monoclonal 1D4. This epitope tag has been used with other transmembrane proteins (26Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.A. Lee N. Pelletier S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27McPhee J.C. Design, Synthesis and Expression of a Gene for the β2-Adrenergic Receptor and Purification and Mutagenesis of the Receptor. Brandeis University, Waltham, MA1991Google Scholar). This modified hmGluR6 cDNA was subcloned into a modified version of the eukaryotic expression vector pMT-2 (28Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,29Oprian D.D. Hargrave P.A. Methods in Neurosciences: Photoreceptor Cells. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 301-306Google Scholar). The hmGluR6 clone was expressed in COS-7 cells following transfection with LipofectAMINE. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection for purification. The transfected cells were then solubilized in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, and 10 mg/ml asolectin for 40 min at 4 °C. Expressed proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the bovine rhodopsin antibody, 1D4, as described by Oprian et al. (30Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The purified receptor in a CHAPS asolectin solution was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column to remove the detergent and form lipid vesicles containing the purified receptor (31Rim J. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11938-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the vesicles were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon-30. These vesicles were then assayed for activity, and the amount of expressed protein was estimated by Western blotting using the antibody 1D4 to visualize the receptor. Wild type bovine opsin was expressed, purified, and reconstituted into asolectin vesicles as described above for hmGluR6. Vesicles containing wild type bovine opsin were then incubated with the chromophore 11-cis-retinal (0.2 mm) in the dark for at least 1 h. Transducin was purified from bovine retina according to the procedure of Wessling-Resnick and Johnson (32Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 265: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and then subjected to ion exchange chromatography on DE-52 as described by Baehr et al. (33Baehr W. Morita E.A. Swanson R. Appelbury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6452-6460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified hmGluR6 in lipid vesicles was assayed for its ability to catalytically activate transducin or Go by following the binding of [35S]GTPγS as has been previously described for rhodopsin (34Zhukovsky E.A. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Science. 1991; 251: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Purified hmGluR6 in lipid vesicles (final concentration, 2.6 × 10−8m) was incubated with the indicated amounts ofl-AP4 in reaction buffer containing 1 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of transducin or Go and GTPγS resulting a final concentration of 1 μm. Aliquots were assayed at indicated times by filtering through nitrocellulose filters. Rhodopsin activation of transducin was performed as described previously (34Zhukovsky E.A. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Science. 1991; 251: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SDS/PAGE was performed according to Laemmli using both 10 and 15% polyacrylamide gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using silver staining according to the procedure of Bloom et al. (36Bloom H. Beir H. Gross H.S. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed according to the methods of Burnette (37Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin and the modified hmGluR6 were detected using the monoclonal antibody 1D4. Antibody binding was visualized using a radiolabeled secondary antibody that was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A full-length human cDNA clone for mGluR6 was constructed from two overlapping cDNA fragments isolated from human retinal cDNA libraries. The percentage of identity of the human and rat mature mGluR6 protein is 94.8%, and the divergence is largely due to the divergence of the signal peptide. The four putative Asn glycosylation sites and two putative PKC phosphorylation sites are conserved between the human and rat sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence of hmGluR6 reported here is 99.8% identical to the hmGLuR6 sequence reported by Laurie et al. (18Laurie D.J. Schoeffter P. Wiederhold K.H. Sommer B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The only differences occur at Arg59 → Pro and Val557 → Ala(the sequence of Laurie et al. mutated to our sequence). The underlined residue is identical to those reported for the rat sequence (17Nakajima Y. Iwakabe H. Akazawa C. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA clone for hmGluR6 was modified with the addition of a 15-amino acid epitope tag at the C-terminal tail, which corresponds to the epitope for the rhodopsin monoclonal antibody 1D4 (21Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The strategy of adding this epitope has been utilized previously for human color visual pigments and the β2-adrenergic receptor (26Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.A. Lee N. Pelletier S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27McPhee J.C. Design, Synthesis and Expression of a Gene for the β2-Adrenergic Receptor and Purification and Mutagenesis of the Receptor. Brandeis University, Waltham, MA1991Google Scholar). In these instances the additional amino acids did not alter the properties of the membrane proteins but allowed for easy purification using immunoaffinity chromatography (26Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.A. Lee N. Pelletier S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27McPhee J.C. Design, Synthesis and Expression of a Gene for the β2-Adrenergic Receptor and Purification and Mutagenesis of the Receptor. Brandeis University, Waltham, MA1991Google Scholar). The hmGluR6 protein was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the 1D4 antibody. Using this procedure a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 103,000 Da is visualized on an SDS/PAGE gel using silver staining (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblot analysis of a similar gel reveals proteins with apparent molecular masses of 50,000, 103,000, and 206,00 Da that cross-react with the rhodopsin monoclonal antibody 1D4 (Fig.1 B, lane 1). The 50-kDa band is most likely a proteolytic fragment and represents only 5% of the total protein visualized in this blot. A similar cleavage fragment has been observed with the in vitro expression of mGluR5 (38Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The two major bands (103,000 and 206,00 kDa) appear to be the monomer and dimer of the same protein. The monomer has an apparent molecular mass that is approximately 5 kDa greater than that predicted from the amino acid sequence of the gene and the additional epitope tag. This increase is probably due to posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation as has been shown for other mGluRs (39Seal A.J. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin was expressed and purified using a similar procedure and a protein of approximately 40 kDa and a dimer of 80 kDa cross-reacted with the 1D4 antibody (Fig.1 B, lane 2). The reason for the apparent dimerization of these G-protein-coupled receptors observed in SDS/PAGE gels is not known, but it is observed with rhodopsin (40Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and other mGluRs (25Daggett L.P. Sacaan A.I. Akong M. Rao S.P. Hess S.D. Liaw C. Urrutia A. Jachec C.

The functional coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors can be examined in functional reconstituted systems with the receptor and the G-protein using a GTPγS binding assay. GTPγS binding requires activation of the G-protein by an activated receptor. We used this method to examine the coupling of the purified mGluR6 protein with transducin purified from bovine retina as we have previously used to examine the coupling of rhodopsin with transducin. Using this preparation, we observed a time-dependent activation of transducin following the addition of 6 mml-AP4 shown by a time-dependent increase in GTPγS binding (Fig.2 A). The average activation observed with 6 mml-AP4 was 4-fold (n = 6). In control experiments in the absence of mGluR6 protein, l-AP4 does not activate transducin. Furthermore, we observed no GTPγS binding in the absence of transducin (data not shown). The EC50 for l-AP4 activation of mGluR6 as measured by transducin activation was 8.4 mm. To understand the level of activation of transducin by mGluR6 we observed in this reconstitution system, we examined the activation of transducin by rhodopsin purified in the same manner. We observed that transducin activation, determined by the rate of GTPγS binding, by light-activated wild type bovine rhodopsin expressed in COS and reconstituted in lipid vesicles is 14-fold greater than the rate observed when transducin is activated by mGluR6 under similar conditions (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that coupling of hmGluR6 to transducin is weak when compared with the activation observed with rhodopsin. This suggests that another G-protein may be the preferred substrate for hmGluR6. An immunological study by Noga et al. (19Noga V. Matesic D.F. Manning D.R. Liebman P.A. Sterling P. Visual Neurosci. 1993; 10: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) has suggested that ON-bipolar cells do not contain transducin but do include a Go-type G-protein. To further investigate the activation of hmGluR6 in this in vitro reconstitution system, we examined the ability of hmGluR6 to activate rat Go. We observed that Go was activated by hmGluR6 in the presence of the agonistl-AP4 (Fig. 3) and that the rate and extent of binding of GTPγS to Go in the presence of activated hmGluR6 is much greater than the rate observed with transducin (∼18-fold greater under comparable conditions; TableI). The EC50 forl-AP4 activation of mGluR6 as measured by Goactivation was 3.1 mm. Because the in vivoagonist for hmGluR6 is most likely glutamate, the ability of glutamate-activated mGluR6 to activate Go was also tested. A 3-fold increase in GTPγS binding was observed in the presence of 10 mm glutamate. In contrast, the activation of transducin under identical conditions was only 1.4-fold (data not shown). To further investigate the specificity of the coupling of hmGluR6 to Go in this reconstitution system, we examined the ability of the Class III-specific mGluR antagonist MPPG (44Jane D.E. Pittaway K. Sunter D.C. Thomas N.K. Watkins J.C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to inhibit thel-AP4-stimulated GTPγS binding. Preincubation with 10 μm MPPG in the binding assay inhibited thel-AP4-stimulated GTPγS binding by 42% (n= 3, Fig. 3 and Table II).Table IThe G-protein activation by hmGluR6 and rhodopsinReceptorTransducinGoRatio of Go/transducin activitypmol GTPγS bound/minhmGluR6 (L-AP4 = 6 mm)0.0574 ± 9.34 × 10−3 (n = 6)1.03 ± 0.62 (n = 3)18-foldRhodopsin0.81 ± 0.123 (n = 3)no light effect (n = 3)0 Open table in a new tab Table IIInhibition of G o activation by the Class III-specific inhibitor MPPG[MPPG]Activity (n = 3)μm%01001058 ± 5.93050 ± 1.7100037 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab In summary, the hmGluR6 protein has been expressed in vitro, purified, and functionally reconstituted into an in vitroG-protein activation assay. We observed activation of two G-proteins, transducin and Go, by agonist activated hmGluR6; the activation of Go was 18-fold greater than activation of transducin. In rodents, mGluR6 is nearly exclusively expressed in ON-bipolar (15Masu M. Iwakabe H. Tagawa Y. Miyoshi T. Yamashita M. Fukuda Y. Sasaki H. Hiroi K. Nakamura Y. Shigemoto R. Nakao K. Katsuri M. Nakanishi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Activation of this G-protein-coupled receptor by glutamate leads to the activation of a biochemical cascade that results in the hyperpolarization of ON-bipolar cells (8Slaughter M.M. Miller R.F. Science. 1981; 211: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 9Shiells R.A. Falk G. Naghsgineh S. Nature. 1981; 294: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have implicated a cGMP biochemical cascade in this signaling pathway (10Nawy S. Jahr C.E. Nature. 1990; 346: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 11Shiells R.A. Falk G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1990; 242: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The identity of the specific G-protein activated in this system as well as the effector enzyme have yet to be conclusively identified. In an attempt to address this problem, we have cloned, expressed, purified, and reconstituted the hmGlur6 protein in an in vitro system where the coupling of the receptor to different G-proteins can be explored. We found that hmGluR6 protein expressed in vitro and reconstituted into lipid vesicles can functionally couple to two known G-proteins. When activated by the agonist l-AP4, hmGluR6 can couple to both transducin and a Go. Activation was measured by the binding of GTPγS to the G-protein. The rate of activation of Go is 18-fold greater than the rate of activation of transducin. Glutamate can also activate hmGluR6 in this reconstituted system and agonist (l-AP4) activation is inhibited by the Class III-specific antagonist MPPG. These results indicate that we are measuring functional coupling of hmGluR6 to both Go and transducin. This is the first report of the purification and functional coupling of mGluR6 to a G-protein, or any glutamate metabotropic receptor, in an in vitroreconstitution system. The results reported here do not identify the G-protein that actually couples to the hmGluR6 in the ON-bipolar cells. They suggest that the specificity of hmGluR6 for Go is greater than it is for transducin. This is consistent with the finding that antibodies to Go but not transducin localize to ON-bipolar cells (19Noga V. Matesic D.F. Manning D.R. Liebman P.A. Sterling P. Visual Neurosci. 1993; 10: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that hmGluR6 can also activate transducin. Both Go and transducin are members of the same family of G-proteins (45Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It is possible that the G-protein in ON-bipolar cells has characteristics of both Go and transducin. Alternatively, there may be multiple G-proteins activated by mGluR6 in vivo. The second messanger system mediating the glutamate-dependent hyperpolarization in ON-bipolar cells remains to elucidated. Effectors enzymes activated by Goare now possible candidates for involvement in this second messanger system. Transducin is not known to be a promiscuous G-protein. It is not activated by many G-protein-coupled receptors and seems to retain some degree of specificity for visual opsins. It can be activated by the α2-adrenergic receptor (46Cerione R.A. Staniszewski C. Benovic J.I. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3901-3909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported here are important because they suggest that the hmGluR6 can activate transducin, the rod-specific G-protein. Because hmGluR6 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that does not have substantial sequence homology to opsin, these results suggest a novel coupling of a non-opsin G-protein-coupled receptor to transducin.

https://openalex.org/W2031448042,"C1q-bearing immune complexes have been observed in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and human immunodeficiency virus infection-associated neuropathy. For the purpose of understanding better the phenomenon of C1q-bearing immune complexes, we investigated the constancy of the C1q-IgG interaction. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed in which wells were coated with IgG to mimic antigen-complexed IgG. Serial dilutions of C1q were applied for distinct time intervals, and bound C1q was detected either directly or after exposure to one of several elution buffers. Our results show that a part of C1q attached to IgG forms a tight association that is not reversible under treatment with buffers containing usually protein-protein interaction-dissociating reagents such as 3m NaCl, 5 m urea, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or β-mercaptoethanol. The formation of the highly stable C1q-IgG complex was found to be time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent and to proceed with bound C1q even in the absence of free C1q in the supernatant. In ligand blotting experiments we demonstrate for the first time directly that all three chains of C1q can individually bind IgG. Altogether, our results provide a suitable explanation for the formation and persistence of C1q-bearing immune complexes.

Altogether, our results provide a suitable explanation for the formation and persistence of C1q-bearing immune complexes. The collagen-like C1q molecule is a subcomponent of C1, the first component of complement, and provides a link between the innate immune system, namely the classical complement pathway, and the acquired immunity and some of its most prominent actors, the immunoglobulin classes G and M.Human C1q is a glycoprotein of about 460 kDa (1Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In its electron microscopy image C1q appears as a bunch of tulips, with six globular heads, each connected by a stalk to a central bundle of fibers (2Knobel H.R. Villiger W. Isliker H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1975; 5: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the model of Reid and Porter (3Reid K.B.M. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), one C1q molecule is composed of 18 polypeptide chains. The chains are of three different types named A, B, and C, of 29, 27, and 23 kDa, respectively. They are linked by disulfide bonds to form six A-B and three C-C dimers. Each of the six individual segments of C1q comprises one chain of each type, which acquire a triple helical structure in the fibrillar region. In contrast, the globular domains appear to be folded to a large extent into β-sheets (4Smith K.F. Haris P.I. Chapman D. Reid K.B. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Marques G. Anton L.C. Barrio E. Sanchez A. Ruiz S. Gavilanes F. Vivanco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10393-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Serum C1q is the key molecule for initiation of the classical complement cascade pathway. Its globular domains recognize the Cγ2 domain of IgG or the Cμ3 domain of IgM, especially if these antibodies are complexed with antigen and thus fixed (6Tschopp J. Villiger W. Lustig A. Jaton J.C. Engel J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1980; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Poon P.H. Phillips M.L. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol.

Behring Inst. Mitt. 1993; 93: 131-137Google Scholar, 10Loos M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1983; 102: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). However, C1q differentiates among IgG subclasses because it attaches, in terms of binding efficiency, most strongly to IgG3, followed by IgG1, but it hardly associates with IgG2 and does not react with IgG4 (11Bindon C.I. Hale G. Bruggemann M. Waldmann H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Most studies on the interaction between C1q and IgG favor an ionic rather than a hydrophobic nature of the binding (5Marques G. Anton L.C. Barrio E. Sanchez A. Ruiz S. Gavilanes F. Vivanco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10393-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hughes-Jones N.C. Gardner B. Mol. Immunol. 1979; 16: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Duncan A.R.

Rep. 1983; 3: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but it has been shown that a dipeptide composed of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, Trp-Tyr, strongly inhibits the association of the two proteins (14Takada A. Shirahama S. Takada Y. Immunopharmacology. 1984; 8: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).The attachment site or sites for IgG on the globular regions of C1q have been a subject of investigation for years. It has been reported that the IgG recognition site is mainly of an ionic nature (8Hughes-Jones N.C. Gardner B. Mol. Immunol. 1979; 16: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that the arginine, histidine, and lysine residues might be essential (13Easterbrook Smith S.B. Biosci. Rep. 1983; 3: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,15Wines B.D. Easterbrook Smith S.B. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that Glu-198, Asp-200, and Lys-202 of the C1q A chain might fit with a binding site on IgG (12Duncan A.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Marques and colleagues (5Marques G. Anton L.C. Barrio E. Sanchez A. Ruiz S. Gavilanes F. Vivanco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10393-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that C1q provides two recognition sites for IgG. The first is thought to be located in a section ranging from positions 114 to 129 of the B chain with Arg-114 and Arg-129 being the important residues. The second site has been implicated to involve all three C1q protein chains with Arg residues at positions 162 in the A chain, 163 in the B chain, and 156 in the C chain. Histidine residues appeared again to be relevant for the C1q-IgG interaction too. However, all of these suggestions have been deduced from experiments in which distinct amino acid residues of C1q were modified chemically or where cross-linking to heterologous IgG was performed. Jiang et al. (16Jiang H. Robey F.A. Gewurz H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) suggested that the globular domain of the C chain provides the primary recognition site for IgG, based on Western blot studies. Kishore et al. (17Kishore U. Leigh L.E.A. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Reid K.B.M. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33 (abstr.): 88Google Scholar) reported that a recombinant form of the globular region of the B chain immobilized on a microtiter plate binds IgG but not IgM.Based on site-directed mutagenesis experiments, the binding site for C1q on IgG has been allocated to the fy2 β-sheet in the Cγ2 domain, the charged amino acids Glu-318, Lys-320, and Lys-322 being the suggested binding motif (12Duncan A.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A proline residue is present in position 331 in IgG1 but is replaced by a serine in IgG4 and has previously been demonstrated to be, at least in part, responsible for the differential ability of the two isotypes to bind C1q and activate complement (18Xu Y. Oomen R. Klein M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3469-3474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immune complexes (IC) 1The abbreviations used are: IC, immune complex(es); C1qIC, C1q-bearing IC; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NAC,N-acetylcysteine; hu, human; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mur, murine; α-, anti-; mAb, monoclonal antibody; gt, goat; rb, rabbit; SSBH, sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate; Ab, antibody; mS, millisiemens; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); SDSsb, SDS sample buffer; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IC, immune complex(es); C1qIC, C1q-bearing IC; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NAC,N-acetylcysteine; hu, human; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mur, murine; α-, anti-; mAb, monoclonal antibody; gt, goat; rb, rabbit; SSBH, sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate; Ab, antibody; mS, millisiemens; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); SDSsb, SDS sample buffer; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. bearing C1q (C1qIC) have been observed in patients suffering from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and HIV infection-associated neuropathy (19Antes U. Heinz H.P. Loos M. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,20Fukushima Y. Okuyama K. Komuro K. Ueda M. Fukutake K. Fujimaki M. Rinsho. Ketsueki. 1991; 32: 1540-1546PubMed Google Scholar), but their physiological role is still a mystery. However, persistence of these protein complexes implies a sufficient stability of the C1q-IgG association. To understand better the phenomenon of C1qIC, we investigated the formation and constancy of the C1q association with IgG.An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed in which wells were coated with IgG to mimic fixed/antigen-complexed IgG. Serial dilutions of purified and biotinylated or unlabeled C1q or serum were applied for distinct time intervals. Bound C1q was detected via its biotin tag using an avidin-peroxidase conjugate or antigenically, employing poly- or monoclonal antibodies, either directly or after exposure to one of several elution buffers. Interestingly, our results show that a part of C1q attached to IgG forms a tight association, which is not reversible under treatment with buffers containing usually protein-protein interaction-dissociating reagents such as 3m NaCl, 5 m urea, SDS, β-mercaptoethanol (ME), or dithiothreitol (DTT). The formation of the highly stable C1q-IgG complex was found to be time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent and proceeded with bound C1q even in the absence of free C1q in the supernatant.Because the C1q molecule comprises three disparate but similar protein chains, we wondered if all three contribute to the interaction with homologous IgG. Therefore, we performed ligand blotting experiments with the separated protein chains of C1q.Altogether, our results demonstrate directly for the first time that all three chains of C1q can bind IgG individually and that the C1q-IgG interaction is strengthened upon time and thus provides a suitable explanation of the formation and persistence of C1qIC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll substances, if not stated otherwise, were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Avidin-alkaline phosphatase and avidin-peroxidase conjugates, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, arginine, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, BSA, DTT, GSH, GSSG, glycine, iodoacetamide, sodium borohydride, ME, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), nitro blue tetrazolium, SDS, SDS 7B molecular weight marker kit, Tris base, Tween 20, and urea were purchased from Sigma Chemie GmbH, Deisenhofen, FRG. Lysine was from Serva, Heidelberg, FRG. C1q-deficient serum was from Quidel (San Diego, CA), and C4-deficient guinea pig serum was provided by the laboratory animal facility of our institute.Human Immunoglobulins and F(ab)′2FragmentsHuman (hu) IgG subclasses 1–4 and polyclonal huIgG were obtained from Sigma. F(ab)′2 fragments of huIgG were purchased from Dianova, Hamburg, FRG, diluted in PBS, and preadsorbed onto protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce, KMF Laborchemie Handels GmbH, St. Augustin, FRG) to remove any contaminating Fc fragments or complete IgG molecules. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue or copper staining (21Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) or by an ELISA as described later in this paper.Specific AntibodiesThe following murine (mur) anti- (α)-huC1q monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are of the IgG1 subclass and were employed in the present study: 242G3, 241F11, 244G8, 4A4B11, and 12A5B7. The clones 242G3, 241F11, and 244G8 were produced in our laboratory (22Golan M.D. Burger D. Loos M. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 445-447PubMed Google Scholar); 4A4B11 and 12A5B7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The polyclonal goat (gt) α-huC1q antibody was also produced in our laboratory, and the polyclonal rabbit (rb) α-huC1q antibody was purchased from Behring AG (Marburg, FRG). Antibodies were purified from serum, ascites, or culture supernatants by fast protein liquid chromatography using protein A or G (Pharmacia Biosystems GmbH, Freiburg, FRG) according to the supplier's instructions.The goat α-huC1q Ab was biotinylated using sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (SSBH; Serva) and, for some experiments, preadsorbed onto immobilized huIgG. Briefly, 11.4 mg of purified antibody (6 ml) was dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 9, overnight at 4–6 °C. 1.88 mg of SSBH was dissolved in the protein solution by vortexing, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Excess labeling reagent was removed by dialysis against two 5-liter volumes of PBS. To reduce background staining when detecting C1q bound to IgG in the ELISA system, 1 ml of labeled Ab was incubated twice for 1 h at 4–6 °C with a 100-μl packed volume of huIgG coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (0.5 mg IgG/ml beads; IgG-S4B, see below).Rabbit α-gtIgG Ab, goat α-rbIgG Ab, and rabbit α-huIgG Ab, all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were obtained from Bio-Rad(Munich, FRG), and a goat α-huIgG Ab, coupled to AP, from Sigma.Preparation and Labeling of Human C1qPurification and labeling (14C-methylation (23Tenner A. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 648-653PubMed Google Scholar), biotinylation) of human serum C1q were carried out as reported previously for guinea pig serum C1q (24Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the following additional step in the C1q purification procedure. Purified C1q was applied to a protein G column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the C1q storage buffer, to remove contaminating IgG as far as possible. The purity of the C1q preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE and ELISA (see below), and only IgG-free preparations were used in experiments in which binding to IgG was investigated.ELISA SystemsELISA systems were employed to detect and quantify C1q attached to IgG and also to evaluate the effects on the antigenicity and immunodetection of IgG and C1q of the reagents that were used to detach them.Assay for Assessment of C1q Binding to IgG96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc, Wiesbaden, FRG) were coated with 30 μl/well of a solution in PBS (0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.145 m NaCl, pH 7.4; conductivity, 15 mS) containing 250 μg/ml, in some experiments 125 or 62.5 μg/ml, of huIgG or IgG subclasses for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. As controls, wells were coated with BSA or in some experiments with F(ab)′2 fragments instead of whole IgG molecules. The plates were then washed three times with 200 μl/well PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1 m NaCl (conductivity, 63 mS) followed by three washes with PBST of physiological ionic strength (conductivity, 15 mS) if not stated otherwise. To block potentially remaining binding sites, 100 μl/well of a solution of 1% BSA in PBST was applied twice for 30 min. After two more washes with PBST, or in some experiments PBS containing 0.15 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (PBSCa, Mg), serial dilutions of C1q (concentrations ranging from 0.078 to 20.0 μg/ml) were applied and incubated for a certain time interval (usually 1 h) at room temperature or 37 °C, as indicated. Serial dilutions of C1q applied to wells coated with goat α-huC1q-IgG (1:400 dilution of a stock solution containing 1.9 mg/ml Ab) instead of huIgG served as quantitative standards. Controls in which C1q was omitted or incubated in BSA-coated wells were included in each assay, and all samples were analyzed in duplicate. Respective samples were subjected in parallel to three washes or treatment for a distinct time period with PBST and/or any other elution buffer as detailed in the text. Then the plates were washed sequentially three times each with 20 mmiodoacetamide in PBST and PBST alone. Wells containing C1q standards were always treated only with PBST. Detection of bound/remaining C1q was accomplished by sequential incubations with biotinylated goat α-huC1q-IgG (1:800) and avidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:750); or, in the case of biotinylated C1q, with avidin-peroxidase conjugate directly; or with a murine α-huC1q mAb (usually 242G3, 1:400) and a goat α-murIgG:horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000). All dilutions of Ab or avidin-peroxidase conjugate were prepared in PBST. 20 μl/well ABTS, 2 mg/ml, in 10 mm citrate, pH 4.5, containing 0.01% H2O2 served as substrate; the staining reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl/well PBS. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured in an Anthos Labtec microplate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments, Salzburg, Austria), and the data analysis was performed using Mikrothek software version 4.0, (Mikrothek Laborsysteme, Overath, FRG).Assessment of the Effects of Elution Buffers Employed to Remove C1q from Immobilized IgGWells coated with huIgG and blocked as detailed above, but not incubated with C1q, were treated in the same manner as if to liberate attached C1q. The remaining immobilized IgG was then detected with a rabbit α-huIgG Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described above for C1q. In some experiments, wells were coated with huIgG containing 0.5, 1, or 2% biotinylated IgG as tracer. Biotinylation of huIgG was performed as described before for the goat α-huC1q Ab. After treatment of the immobilized IgG with the respective elution buffers, the remaining IgG was detected using the avidin-peroxidase conjugate. Serial dilutions of IgG served as standards.Assays for Quantification and Evaluation of Alterations in the Antigenicity of C1qQuantification and analysis of changes of the antigenicity of C1q were accomplished using a previously described sandwich ELISA system (25Antes U. Heinz H.P. Loos M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 74: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, wells were coated with 30 μl of a 1:400 dilution of goat α-huC1q-IgG (1.9 mg/ml) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Remaining binding sites were blocked with BSA, as described before, followed by two washes with PBS. Serial dilutions of pretreated C1q or normal human serum were prepared in PBS or PBSCa, Mg respectively, with or without a final concentration of 20 mm EDTA. Dilutions of purified C1q served as standard. In some experiments, wells were coated with C1q directly instead of Ab. Detection of bound C1q was achieved as described before for C1q attached to huIgG, employing murine α-huC1q mAb 242G3 or biotinylated goat α-huC1q Ab or avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate in the case of biotinylated C1q.Measurement of C1q Hemolytic Activity and C4 ActivationThe hemolytic activity of C1q was assayed as reported earlier (26Golan M.D. Hitschold T. Loos M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). C4 activity was determined according to a method described by Atkinson and colleagues (27Atkinson J.P. McGinnis K. Shreffler D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Imidazole replaced Veronal in all buffers, and the assay was scaled down to 100 μl each, a suspension of IgG-coated sheep erythrocytes (1.5 × 108 cells/ml), dilutions of serum sample, and C4-deficient guinea pig serum containing human C2.Affinity AdsorptionHuman IgG was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), according to the supplier's instructions, at a concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml of beads. 10 μg of14C-labeled C1q in PBS was incubated with IgG-S4B (200-μl packed volume) in a total volume of 400 μl. The beads were kept in suspension by end-over-end rotation for 4 h at room temperature. Then the IgG-S4B was washed three times with 500 μl of PBS and sequentially eluted with the following. Step 1 was PBS with 50-mS conductivity (∼580 mm NaCl). Step 2 was SDS sample buffer (SDSsb: 62.5 mm Tris containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerin, 0.001% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8; Ref. 28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) for 2 min at 100 °C and 2 min at room temperature. Step 3 was SDSsb containing 1% ME for 2 min at 100 °C and 2 min at room temperature. The first two elution steps were followed each by three washes with 500 μl of the respective elution buffer to prevent a carryover of labeled protein into the next sample. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorographed as described previously (24Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Densitometry of the fluorographs was accomplished using a Herolab Enhanced Analysis System equipment (EASY plus Revision 3.16; Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany).Ligand BlottingC1q A, B, and C chains were separated under reducing conditions in a 12.5% acrylamide SDS slab gel containing 1.2% bisacrylamide and transferred onto Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, FRG) as reported earlier (24Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 2% milk powder (Frema Reform, Fink GmbH, Herrenberg, FRG) in 50 mm Tris, containing 70 or 145 mmNaCl, as indicated (pH 7.5; TBS) and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). After equilibration in the respective incubation buffer (TBST containing 70 or 145 mm NaCl) by two washes, each for 10 min, the membrane was incubated sequentially with 5 ml of a solution of huIgG or IgG subclasses (10 μg/ml, if not stated otherwise) in the respective incubation buffer for 1 h and an goat α-huIgG Ab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 30 min (dilution 1:20,000). Between the incubation steps, the membrane was washed three times with incubation buffer, and the controls received buffer without huIgG throughout the first incubation. Bound protein was visualized as described before (24Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates.Other MethodsDetermination of protein concentration was accomplished as described previously (24Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe present study addresses two currently open questions concerning the understanding of the interaction of complement with immunoglobulins: how constant the C1q-IgG association is and how the three protein chains of C1q contribute to this association.The binding of C1q to immobilized IgG was highly specific under the conditions of our ELISA system since, first, C1q bound selectively to IgG subclasses 1 and 3; second, no association with F(ab)′2fragments was observed, which indicates that the interaction is mediated by the Fc region; third, C1q barely attached to reduced IgG; and finally, no binding to immobilized BSA occurred (Fig. 2). However, the percentage of applied C1q that bound to IgG, which can be taken as a measure of the binding efficiency, varied among different C1q preparations but was always correlated inversely with the C1q concentration (Fig. 1).Direct fixation of IgG in the wells was preferred over antigen-bound antibody because we intended to expose the complex of C1q and immobilized IgG to reagents that would probably also interfere with the antigen-antibody interaction. However, some of the buffers employed to detach C1q from immobilized IgG, such as SDSsb or buffers containing reducing agents, removed also certain amounts of immobilized IgG (TableI). Because eluted IgG might have carried away C1q, an underestimation of the C1q quantity remaining attached to IgG is likely under these conditions.To investigate how constant the interaction is, we treated the complex of C1q and immobilized IgG with buffers that were slightly acidic (pH 5.5) or buffers containing arginine, lysine, or high concentrations of salt or denaturing substances, the last two in the presence or absence of reducing agents, respectively (Table I). Subsequent to each of the various elution procedures, which left behind at least about 12% of the immobilized IgG, IgG-bound C1q was still detectable. Arginine and Lysine have been reported to inhibit the hemolytic activity and binding of C1q to IgG (14Takada A. Shirahama S. Takada Y. Immunopharmacology. 1984; 8: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 31Takada A. Takada Y. Immunology. 1982; 47: 679-685PubMed Google Scholar). C1q hardly bound to IgG in the presence of 1–3m NaCl (Fig. 3) or at pH 5.5 (Fig. 10). Furthermore, 5m urea abrogated irreversibly the IgG binding ability of C1q (data not shown, but see Ref. 30Heusser C.H. Boesman M. Knobel H.R. Jacot Guillarmod H. Isliker H. Immunochemistry. 1975; 12: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). But once C1q was attached to IgG the respective agents or conditions failed to reverse the binding completely. Furthermore, the reagents that eluted a certain amount of C1q but which did not affect C1q antigenicity (arginine, 1–3m NaCl, or 1 or 2 m urea) appeared to be equally effective in releasing C1q (Fig. 5). Altogether, our results indicate for the first time that under certain conditions the binding of C1q to IgG is not reversible, in contrast to earlier suggestions by others (32Burton D.R. Boyd J. Brampton A.D. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Emanuel E.J. Novotny J. Rademacher T.W. Schravendijk M.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Dwek R.A. Nature. 1980; 288: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A part of C1q remained tightly attached to IgG even during exposure to usually strongly dissociating or denaturing agents such as 1 or 3 m NaCl, up to 5 m urea or SDS and heating, indicating that a change in the quality of the C1q-IgG interaction had occurred.C1q that had been incubated in suspension with IgG coupled to Sepharose beads also resisted elution with high salt buffer and SDSsb, indicating that the tight association could be a general feature of the C1q-IgG interaction. A closer investigation revealed that the binding of soluble C1q to immobilized IgG occurred faster than the formation of the high salt-resistant association between both proteins. The strengthening of the interaction of bound C1q and IgG was found to be time-, temperature- and pH-dependent, even in the absence of free C1q in the supernatant (Figs. 7 and 10). This demonstrated first that the attachment of C1q to IgG proceeds in two steps; second, that two qualitatively distinct states exist in the association of C1q and IgG; and third, that the C1q-IgG interaction cannot only be described in terms of an equilibrium process as suggested earlier (32Burton D.R. Boyd J. Brampton A.D. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Emanuel E.J. Novotny J. Rademacher T.W. Schravendijk M.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Dwek R.A. Nature. 1980; 288: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The first stage of the C1q-IgG association is characterized by its reversibility in the presence of, for example, high salt concentrations, and the following second stage by its constant nature under conditions that usually dissociate the protein-protein interaction, such as the presence of high salt buffer or denaturing agents.Based on our results and the following facts, we suppose that the strengthening of the C1q-IgG association is a consequence of a time-dependent arrangement of β-sheet interactions between both proteins. First, the globular regions of C1q appear to be to a large extent folded as β-sheets (4Smith K.F. Haris P.I. Chapman D. Reid K.B. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, IgG domains form β-sheets. Third, the binding site for C1q on the Cγ2 domain is located on the fy2 β-sheet (32Burton D.R.

Once bound to the Golgi membranes in the GTP form, mARF1 initiates the recruitment of the adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) complex and coatomer (COPI) onto these membranes and activates phospholipase D1 (PLD1). To map the domains of mARF1 that are important for these activities, we constructed chimeras between mARF1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARF2, which functions poorly in all of these processes except COPI recruitment.The carboxyl half of mARF1 (amino acids 95–181) was essential for activation by the Golgi guanine nucleotide exchange factor, whereas a separate domain (residues 35–94) was required to effectively activate PLD1 and to promote efficient AP-1 recruitment. Since residues 35–94 of mARF1 are critical for optimal activity in both PLD1 activation and AP-1 recruitment, we hypothesize that this region of ARF contains residues that interact with effector molecules.

Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and promote vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi (14Bi K. Roth M.G.

Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The PLD isoform responsible for this is presumably PLD1, which localizes to the Golgi, ER, and early endosomes as opposed to PLD2, which localizes to the plasma membrane (16Colley W.C. Sung T.C.

The amino acid sequences of ARFs are highly conserved between species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARFs (yARFs) 1 and 2 are more than 70% identical to mammalian ARF1 (mARF1) (17Sewell J.L. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4620-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mammalian and yeast ARFs also exhibit some degree of functional conservation. Thus while the simultaneous disruption of the yARF1 and yARF2 genes is lethal (18Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the double mutant can be partially rescued by expression of mammalian ARFs (19Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2606-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee F.-J.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24441-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, yARF2, in contrast to mARF1, is not activated by the BFA-sensitive rat Golgi GEF, although it is activated to a lesser extent by a BFA-resistant, GEF-independent mechanism probably mediated by Golgi membrane phospholipids. Once activated and bound to the Golgi membrane, yARF2 facilitates AP-1 binding much less efficiently than activated mARF1, although it is equivalent to mARF1 in initiating coatomer recruitment onto the membrane (21Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To begin to understand how mARF1 interacts with such a wide variety of target proteins, we constructed chimeras between mARF1 and yARF2 and tested their ability to interact with the Golgi GEF, to promote AP-1 recruitment onto Golgi membranes, and to activate purified human PLD1. Since yARF2 is deficient in each of these activities, we reasoned that the use of these chimeras should allow us to localize domains of mARF1 needed for these functions. Our results indicate that different domains of mARF1 are required for these various activities.

Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Richard Kahn (Emory University, Atlanta), and the human ARF6 expression vector was supplied by Richard Klausner (National Institutes of Health). pET-ARF2 was created by ligating the 538-base pair NdeI and BamHI fragment of pRecA-ARF2 containing the yeast ARF2 coding sequence into pET3c (Stratagene). Mutations were created in the mARF1 and yARF2 coding sequences using the sequential PCR procedure (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). The mutated bases are in bold face. For all PCR reactions, Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR reaction mixtures were subjected to 30–35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and then incubated at 72 °C for 10 min to extend incomplete products. All sequences changed by PCR were determined by sequence analysis using the DNA Sequencing Kit, Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (Perkin-Elmer). PCR products and restriction fragments were purified by excising the appropriate bands from an agarose gel, and recovering them with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). All ligations were performed using the DNA Ligation Kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Otsu, Japan). pET-mARF1* was created by site-directed mutagenesis of pOW12 using the mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-CTTTACGCTAGCAAGCTCTTCAAGGGCCTTTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CTTGCTAGCGTAAAGCCCCATATGTATATCTCCTT-3′. The final PCR product was digested with BglII and BsrG1, and the 194-base pair fragment containing the mutated bases was used to replace the corresponding region of pOW12. pET-mARF1*(K10S,G11N), pET-mARF1*(K15N), and pETmARF1*(K15A) were created by site-directed mutagenesis of pET-mARF1*. For pET-mARF1*(K10S,G11N), the mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-CTCTTCTCGAATCTTTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAAAAAGATTCGAGAAGAG-3′; for pET-mARF1*(K15N), they were 5′-GCCTTTTTGGGGACAAAGAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTCTTTGTCCCCAAAAAGGC-3′; for pET-mARF1*(K15A), they were 5′-CCTTTTCGGCGCCAAGGAAATG-3′ and 5′CATTTCCTTGGCGCCGAAAAGG-3′. The BglII and BsrGI fragments of the final PCR products were used to replace the corresponding region of pET-ARF1*. pET-yARF2(N15K) was made by site-directed mutagenesis of pET-yARF2 using the oligonucleotides 5′-TTTGGGAAGAAAGAAATGCG-3′ and 5′-TCTTTCTTCCCAAAAAGATTGCTG-3′. The SphI and BsrGI fragment of the final PCR fragment was used to replace the corresponding region of pET-yARF2. A BstB1 restriction site was engineered into pET-mARF1* and pET-yARF2 at base pair 280 (codon 94) of the respective coding sequences. For pET-mARF1*, the mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-GGTTGATTCGAATGACAGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCATTCGAATCAACCACAAAG-3′, and the BsrGI and HindIII fragment of the final PCR product was used to replace the corresponding region of pET-mARF1*. pET-yARF2 was mutagenized using 5′-CGATTCGAATGATAGATCGCGT-3′ and 5′-CGATCTATCATTCGAATCGATGAC-3′. The final PCR product was digested with BsrGI and BlpI, and the fragment was used to replace the corresponding region of pET-yARF2. All of the following constructs were made using these modified plasmids. The designation M is used when a region is derived from the mammalian ARF1 and Y is used when a region is derived from yeast ARF. pET-M*YY was constructed by transferring the SphI and BsrG1 fragment of pET-mARF1* to pET-yARF2. pET-YMM was constructed by transferring the SphI and BsrGI fragment of pET-yARF2 to pET-mARF1*. pET-M*YM and pET-YYM were constructed by transferring the BstB1 and HindIII fragment of pET-mARF1* to the corresponding regions of pET-M*YY and pET-yARF2, respectively. pET-YMY and pET-M*MY were constructed by ligating the BstBI and HindIII fragment of pET-yARF2 into the corresponding region of pET-YMM and pET-mARF1*, respectively. The polyclonal antibody RY/1 to the μ1 subunit of AP-1 (27Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was provided by Linton Traub of our laboratory and was used at a concentration of 1:5000 for immunoblotting. The monoclonal antibody M3A5, against β-COR subunit of coatomer, was a gift from Thomas Kreis (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) (28Allan V.J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2229-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and was used at a dilution of 1 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse and rabbit immunoglobins were purchased from Amersham Corp. Recombinant myristoylated and unmyristoylated ARFs were prepared from Escherichia coli as described previously (21Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except that yARF2 was expressed from pET-yARF2, and therefore its expression was induced like the mammalian ARFs. All of the mARF1/yARF2 chimeras were produced and prepared as described for mammalian ARF1. The percentage of ARF in the final product was determined by densitometry scanning of a Coomassie Blue-stained gel using a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) with Image-Quant software. The extent of myristoylation of each ARF preparation was determined by a gel shift assay as described previously (21Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and used to calculate the myristoylated ARF concentration in each experiment. All chimeras having yARF2 residues at positions 3–7 were well myristoylated (70–100%) when produced in bacteria co-expressing myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase, consistent with the results of Randazzo and Kahn (29Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat liver Golgi membranes and an AP-1- and coatomer-enriched fraction of rat liver cytosol were prepared as described (10Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 21Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The final coat protein-enriched fraction had an AP-1 concentration about three times that in cytosol, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting. No ARF was detectable in this fraction as analyzed by ligand blotting with [α-32P]GTP. A guanine nucleotide exchange assay was developed based on the assays of Northup et al. (30Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kahn and Gilman (31Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant ARF was added with or without 5 μg of Golgi membranes to a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm [35S]GTPγS (3–10 × 105 cpm). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by passing 50 μl over a HA-High Protein and Nucleic Acid Binding Plate in the Multiscreen Filtration System Vacuum Manifold (Millipore). Filters were washed 7 times with 200 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate. Radioactivity bound to the filter was measured and the amount of GTPγS bound to protein calculated. All reactions were done in duplicate or triplicate. Background binding of [35S]GTPγS to the nitrocellulose, determined by filtering a sample containing only [35S]GTPγS and buffer, was less than 0.1% of the radioactivity added. BFA, when included, was added to 50 μg/ml from a 5 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol, and an equal volume of ethanol was added to control reaction mixtures. The recruitment assays were performed in a total volume of 200 μl in 1.5-ml siliconized tubes to reduce background. The AP-1/coatomer-enriched cytosolic fraction was cleared by centrifugation at 220,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C before use in the assay. Golgi membranes (50 μg/ml), recombinant myristoylated ARF to the indicated concentration, the AP-1/coatomer-enriched cytosolic fraction (5.6 mg/ml), and either 50 μm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP were mixed together in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) on ice. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the tubes were returned to ice, and the reaction mixtures were transferred to fresh 1.5-ml siliconized tubes to further reduce background. The Golgi membranes were sedimented by centrifugation (14,700 ×g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the Golgi pellet was washed two times with 100 μl of assay buffer. The membranes were then solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2.3% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose), and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 13% gels. Bound ARF was detected by Coomassie Blue staining, bound AP-1 by immunoblotting using RY/1, a polyclonal antibody that recognizes μ1, and bound coatomer by immunoblotting using M3A5, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes β-COP. They were quantified by densitometry. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (10Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Gels to be analyzed by fluorography were incubated in 1% glycerol, 25% methanol for at least 1 h, and then in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) for 30 min. Gels were dried onto paper and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak). GTP-ligand blotting was carried out essentially as described (32Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melancon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Human PLD1a was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector and then immunoaffinity purified using PLD1-specific antibodies (33Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.

Assays were carried out in duplicate at least three times for each mutant ARF. Intra-assay variance was approximately 3%. We previously reported that mARF1 is activated well by the Golgi GEF, whereas yARF2 is not (21Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These two ARFs are 77% identical over their entire amino acid sequence but exhibit considerably less conservation of the 18 amino-terminal residues (Fig. 1). In addition, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–18 of mARF1 inhibits the activation of mARF1 by Golgi membranes in vitro(4Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and slightly shorter peptides stimulate the formation of secretory granules on the TGN (34Barr F.A. Huttner W.B.

Therefore, to begin the mapping of amino acids important for mARF1's activation by the Golgi GEF, we initially focused on residues in the amino-terminal regions of mARF1 and yARF2. In the first chimera, denoted mARF1*, amino acids 3–7 of mARF1 were changed to the corresponding residues of yARF2. Golgi membranes stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on myristoylated mARF1 and mARF1* equally over a range of ARF concentrations (Fig.2). The activation of myristoylated mARF1* by the Golgi membranes was inhibited 85% by BFA, an inhibitor of the Golgi GEF (Table I), indicating that this mutant ARF retains the ability to interact with Golgi exchange factor. In contrast, activation of myristoylated yARF2 by rat Golgi membranes was poorly inhibited by BFA (Table I).Table IBFA sensitivity of Golgi membrane-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on mutant and wild type ARFsGolgi-stimulated exchangeInhibition−BFA+BFApmol GTPγS%mARF1*16.1 ± 0.92.4 ± 0.185mARF1*(K10S, G11N)16.3 ± 2.22.5 ± 0.784mARF1*(K15N)7.1 ± 0.82.0 ± 0.472mARF1*(K15A)9.7 ± 2.52.5 ± 0.874yARF2(N15K)7.2 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.228yARF210.0 ± 3.68.2 ± 2.217 Open table in a new tab Since mARF1* was activated as well as mARF1, but was better myristoylated when produced in bacteria co-expressing myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (29Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), all additional mutants were made with yARF2 residues at positions 3–7. This is indicated by the * in their name. In the chimeras mARF1*(K10S,G11N) and mARF1*(K15N), amino acids 10, 11, and 15 of mARF1 were changed to the corresponding yARF2 residues. Mammalian ARF1*(K10S,G11N) was activated by the Golgi membranes to the same extent as mARF1*. By contrast, activation of mARF1* (K15N) was decreased to the yARF2 level (Fig. 3), but its activation was highly sensitive to BFA (Table I). This indicated that mARF1* (K15N) was being activated primarily through the Golgi GEF, although the extent of activation was less than mARF1. In contrast, activation of the reciprocal mutant, yARF2 (N15K) was not sensitive to BFA (Table I). Furthermore, when amino acid 15 of mARF1 was changed to an alanine instead of an asparagine, activation by the Golgi GEF approached that obtained with mARF1*, and this activation was very BFA-sensitive (Fig. 3 and Table I). These data indicate that lysine 15 is neither essential nor sufficient for activation by the Golgi GEF. In summary, the mutants mARF1*, mARF1*(K10S,G11N), and mARF1*(K15N) change all of the amino acids that differ between mARF1 and yARF2 in the region spanned by the inhibitory peptide (residues 2–18), and they are all activated by the Golgi GEF. Therefore, amino acids outside of this domain must be important for mARF1's interaction with the Golgi GEF. To evaluate the role of domains outside of amino acids 2–18, the coding sequences of mARF1* and yARF2 were separated into three parallel regions using restriction sites at the codons for amino acids 34 and 94. As a result, region I contained amino acids 2–34, and regions II and III included residues 35–94 and 95–181, respectively. Chimeras encoding all possible combinations of yARF2 and mARF1* sequences in these regions were constructed, and they were named as diagrammed in Fig. 4. For example, the chimera M*YM had mARF1* (M*) sequences in region I, yARF2 sequences (Y) in region II, and mARF1 sequences (M) in region III. Activation of YMM by the Golgi membranes was slightly reduced compared with mARF1*, particularly at lower ARF concentrations (Fig.5). This may be due to the presence of an asparagine at position 15, which impairs the activation of mARF1*(K15N), as shown in Fig. 3. Importantly, YMM activation was very sensitive to BFA (Table II). M*YY behaved similarly to yARF2 in terms of activation by the Golgi GEF (Fig. 5) and insensitivity to BFA (Table II). Taken together, the results with YMM and M*YY indicate that residues of mARF1 outside of region I are essential for activation by the Golgi GEF.Table IIBFA sensitivity of Golgi membrane-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on mARF1/yARF2 chimeric ARFsChimeraGolgi-stimulated exchangeInhibition−BFA+BFApmol GTPγS%YMM10.7 ± 1.12.0 ± 1.082YYM10.6 ± 1.45.4 ± 0.850M*YM8.4 ± 1.34.6 ± 0.545M*MY9.4 ± 2.57.5 ± 1.420YMY6.2 ± 0.85.5 ± 0.712M*YY5.6 ± 0.74.6 ± 0.917 Open table in a new tab We next tested whether either region II or III of mARF1 was capable of mediating activation by the Golgi GEF. YMY, which contains only region II of mARF1, was activated to approximately the same extent as yARF2 (Fig. 5), and its activation was not significantly inhibited by BFA (Table II). In contrast, YYM, which encodes only region III of mARF1, was activated by the Golgi membranes considerably better than yARF2, although not quite as well as mARF1* (Fig. 5). The activation of this chimeric ARF was inhibited by BFA to an intermediate extent (Table II). Therefore, region III of mARF1 contains amino acids critical for activation by the Golgi GEF. Table III summarizes the effect of BFA on the activation of the various chimeric ARFs observed over multiple experiments. Activation of chimeras with regions II and III of mARF1 was inhibited 75–84%, whereas activation of chimeras having only region III was inhibited 45–46%. Chimeras with region III of yARF2 were inhibited less than 25%. These differences between the three groups of chimeric ARFs are highly significant. The results confirm that region III of mARF1 is essential for activation by the Golgi GEF and support a minor role for region II.Table IIISummary of BFA sensitivity of mARF1/yARF2 chimera activationChimeraInhibition by BFA%mARF1*(n = 49)84 ± 6YMM (n = 6)75 ± 9YYM (n = 6)46 ± 9M*YM (n = 6)46 ± 14M*MY (n = 6)21 ± 16M*YY (n = 6)24 ± 21YMY (n= 5)15 ± 5yARF2 (n = 40)10 ± 19 Open table in a new tab After myristoylated ARF has been activated, it binds to Golgi membranes and promotes the recruitment of the coat protein complexes AP-1 and coatomer (7Donaldson J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2069370849,"H1t is a testis-specific histone 1 variant restricted to the male germ line and expressed only in pachytene spermatocytes. Understanding the regulation of the <i>H1t</i> gene is an interesting challenge as its promoter shares all of the recognized control elements of standard somatic H1 genes, yet <i>H1t</i> is not expressed in somatic or in early spermatogenic cells. To investigate the mechanism of this apparent repression, we exchanged three promoter subregions between <i>H1t</i> and a major somatic H1 gene (<i>H1d</i>) by introduction of suitable restriction sites just 5′ of the TATA box and 3′ of the conserved H1 AC box. Hybrid promoters were joined to a <i>lacZ</i> reporter gene and assayed by transient transfection in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In this system the wild type <i>H1d</i> promoter was 20-fold stronger than the <i>H1t</i> promoter. Much of this difference in activity was traced to inhibitory sequences immediately downstream of the TATA box in <i>H1t</i>, although sequences upstream of the H1t AC box and within the H1t 5′-untranslated region played some role as well. A series of deletions and short oligonucleotide mutations scanned across the region between the TATA box and cap site identified two tracts of C (GC box 2) as the inhibitory sequences. While both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to this region weakly <i>in vitro</i>, they are unlikely to be responsible for the inhibitory effect of GC box 2, and additional binding proteins (CTB-4 and CTB-5) were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as better candidates for mediating the repressive effect. When repression of the H1t promoter was relieved by mutation of GC box 2, additional mutations introduced into GC box 1 upstream of the CAAT box led to a large decrease in activity, indicating that these two G/C-rich elements have opposite effects on promoter activity."

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5586-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and provided by William Meek. Rabbit EF-1α was a gift from Dr. William C. Merrick, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH. To isolate the cDNA for EF-1δ from a rabbit spleen library, human EF-1δ cDNA was digested with PstI to obtain a 374-bp amino-terminal fragment to use as a probe. The cDNA fragment was radiolabeled with the random primer labeling method (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B.V. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar) and used to screen the cDNA library by in situ plaque hybridization. After the third screening, several positive clones were identified and these cDNAs were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Recombinant plasmids purified from single colonies were cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI followed by hybridization with the radiolabeled probe. The cDNA containing the longest insert was selected for cDNA sequencing and a set of nested deletions (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 13.39-13.41Google Scholar) was constructed. The EcoRI/BstXI and XhoI/KpnI sites were chosen for the construction of sense and antisense cDNA deletion clones, respectively. Sequencing of individual cDNA was carried out using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52211) Google Scholar) with T7 and T3 primers. Rabbit EF-1β was cloned from a rabbit spleen cDNA library, sequenced, and expressed in E. coli as described by Chen and Traugh (5Chen C.-J. Traugh J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cDNA for EF-1γ, cloned and sequenced from the rabbit spleen cDNA library (13Sheu G.-T. Traugh J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 20: 5849Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the cDNA for rabbit EF-1δ were subcloned into the pT7–7 expression vector. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared that contained a generated NdeI site in the 5′-end sense primer; (5′-3TTCGGCATATG GCGGCCGGGA23-3′) for γ and (5′-52AGGCATATG ACGACGAACTTCCTAG77-3′) for δ. The restriction sites are indicated by an underlineand the start codon ATG is indicated as bold. The sense and antisense primers were used for amplification of the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction for 30 cycles (29Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified cDNA fragment corresponding to EF-1δ was digested with NdeI and HindIII restriction enzymes to produce the sites for subcloning of the cDNA coding region into the pT7–7 vector. The recombinant plasmids were subcloned into competent BL21(DE3) cells by the CaCl2 precipitation method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant EF-1β and γ in E. coli was induced with 0.4 mm IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C, and the supernatant and pellet were prepared as described by Chen and Traugh (5Chen C.-J. Traugh J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pT7–7-δ was added to two flasks containing 25 ml of LB medium and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C to a density of 0.5 at A 600 and then induced with 0.4 mmIPTG. One culture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the other was incubated at 28 °C for 19 h. Samples (1 ml) were resuspended in 0.2 ml of SDS-sample buffer, and expression of the δ subunit was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205400) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The remainder of the E. coliwere harvested, and the pellet and supernatant were obtained as described above. The supernatant obtained from 250 ml of cultured E. coli containing EF-1β or γ was chromatographed on a DEAE cellulose column equilibrated with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (5Chen C.-J. Traugh J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl (200 ml) in buffer for EF-1β, and 0–0.3 m NaCl (200 ml) for EF-1γ. EF-1β or γ was purified further by FPLC on a Mono Q HR5/5 column as described (5Chen C.-J. Traugh J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a 10-ml gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer. Aliquots (20 μl) of the fractions were analyzed on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. E. coli(500 ml) containing the pT7–7-δ insert were grown at 28 °C for 19 h and harvested, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 15-cm). The column was washed with 120 ml of 200 mm NaCl in buffer, and δ was eluted in a single step with 700 mm NaCl in buffer. EF-1δ (0.5 ml) was chromatographed on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm KCl; 0.35-ml fractions were collected. EF-1δ was stored in aliquots at −70 °C for further analysis. Equimolar amounts of the β (400 μg) and γ (815 μg) subunits in a volume of 3.5 ml were incubated at 4 °C for 5 min and then diluted 5-fold with buffer to reduce the conductivity. The complex was isolated by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (1.2 × 8.0 cm) and eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer. Fractions containing βγ were pooled, and the complex was purified by gel filtration as described below. Purified EF-1β (30 μg), γ (100 μg), and δ (40 μg) in a final volume of 0.6 ml, and purified EF-1 γ (50 μg) and δ (55 μg) in a final volume of 1.5 ml were incubated on ice for 30 min. Each sample was analyzed separately by FPLC on Mono Q with a 10-ml gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl in buffer. Fractions containing the highest amounts of βγδ or γδ were selected for further analysis by gel filtration. EF-1β and γ (0.5 ml) purified by chromatography on Mono Q were analyzed separately on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with buffer containing 100 or 500 mm NaCl. Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected. Aliquots of 20 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein standards for gel filtration were blue dextran (V0), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), IgG (160 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (35 kDa), and cytochrome C (12 kDa). Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the EF-1βγ complex isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and EF-1βγδ and γδ isolated by FPLC on Mono Q were analyzed separately on a Superose 12 column at 4 °C. EF-1β (40 μg) and δ (17 μg) incubated together (0.5 ml) on ice were also analyzed for complex formation. The column was equilibrated with 200 mm KCl in buffer. Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected. Aliquots (20 μl) from each fraction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The stained proteins in the gels were scanned with a LKB laser scanner and quantified. Similar results were obtained when the ratio of each subunit in the complexes was determined according to the content of basic residues (lysine, arginine, and histidine) in each subunit (32Tal M. Silberstein A. Nusser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9976-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-1β contained 29 basic residues, γ contained 62, and δ contained 44. Recombinant EF-1βγδ (1.0 μg) was incubated in 0.07 ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.14 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence and absence of 30 units of CKII at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation of β and δ was determined by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE and 32P was quantified by excising the proteins and counting in a scintillation counter. The radiolabeled ATP was replaced with unlabeled ATP for analysis of elongation activity by poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis. The samples were kept on ice prior to assaying for elongation activity. The activity of native EF-1α alone and in combination with the β, γ, and δ subunits was analyzed by poly(U)-dependent [3H]polyphenylalanine synthesis as described by Venema et al. (20Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11993-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]phenylalanyl-tRNA was 3,100 dpm/pmol. Native EF-1α was preincubated alone and with the indicated subunits at 30 °C for 10 min, then added to the elongation assay mixture. Similar results were obtained by preincubation at 0 °C for 30 min. Protein concentrations of α, β, γ, and δ were determined by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211519) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The cDNA for EF-1δ isolated from a rabbit spleen library was 958 bp and contained the entire 840-bp coding region for EF-1δ, a 57-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 43-bp 3′-untranslated region and a poly(A) tail of 18 nucleotides. The derived amino acid sequence consisted of 280 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 31,075 and pI of 4.91 (Fig. 1) and was 91% homologous with human EF-1δ, which contained an additional asparagine at position 164. Comparing the sequences of EF-1δ from rabbit with those from human, Xenopus, and the partial sequence from Artemia, the carboxyl terminus containing the nucleotide exchange activity (3van Damme H.T.F. Amons R. Karssies R. Timmers C.J. Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was more highly conserved between species than the amino terminus, which contained a leucine zipper domain. The homologous carboxyl-terminal region started at residue Glu155 followed by a region rich in acidic amino acids. The conserved portion of the amino terminus contained a leucine zipper from Leu80 to Leu115 consisting of 6 leucine residues. A site on EF-1δ, Thr122, shown to be phosphorylated in Xenopus by p34 cdc2 kinase (34Mulner-Lorillon O. Minella O. Cormier P. Capony J.-P. Cavadore J.-C. Morales J. Poulhe R. Bellé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20201-20207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not present in rabbit and human, which contained a glutamic acid at the corresponding residue 139 (Fig. 1). The cDNA for EF-1δ was cloned into the pT7–7 vector and expressed in E. coli. Following induction with IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C, the protein was present in significant amounts, primarily (90%) as inclusion bodies (Fig.2). Upon induction and incubation at 28 °C, the majority (75%) of EF-1δ was present as soluble protein. The supernatant obtained at 28 °C was used for purification of the soluble δ subunit by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and eluted at 700 mm NaCl using a step gradient (data not shown). The δ subunits were pooled and purified to apparent homogeneity on Superose 12 as shown below. EF-1β, cloned into the pT7–7 expression vector, was present primarily as a soluble form at 37 °C when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3, left panel). EF-1β was purified from the supernatant by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and FPLC on Mono Q. The β subunit eluted from DEAE-cellulose at 250 mm NaCl (data not shown) and from Mono Q at 560 mm NaCl. From a 250 ml culture containing 42.9 mg of soluble protein, 5.4 mg of β were recovered after chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Further purification on Mono Q yielded 2.2 mg of pure β. EF-1γ was expressed almost exclusively as a soluble protein at 37 °C. Highly purified EF-1γ was obtained after chromatography of the supernatant on DEAE-cellulose, where it eluted at 75 mmNaCl (data not shown), and by FPLC on Mono Q, eluting at 450 mm NaCl. From a culture of 250 ml containing 46.6 mg of soluble protein, 5.6 mg of EF-1γ were recovered after DEAE-cellulose. The γ subunit was purified to apparent homogeneity by FPLC on Mono Q (Fig. 3, right panel); 1.5 mg of EF-1γ were obtained. When recombinant EF-1β (24.8 kDa) was analyzed by gel filtration on Superose 12, the protein eluted with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa (Fig. 4 A). The same elution pattern was observed at 50, 100, and 500 mm NaCl. Recombinant EF-1δ (31.0 kDa) migrated as a large aggregate in the void volume at 50, 200, and 600 mm NaCl. The addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 with 600 mm NaCl had no effect on the state of aggregation (Fig. 4 B). Unlike the β and δ subunits, the salt concentration during gel filtration was important for the γ subunit. Recombinant EF-1γ (50.0 kDa) migrated as a large aggregate when analyzed on Superose 12 at 100 mm NaCl (Fig.5, top panel). At 500 mm NaCl, the γ subunit migrated as a distinct peak of about 140 kDa (Fig. 5, bottom panel).Figure 5Gel filtration of EF-1γ expressed in E. coli. The recombinant γ subunit of EF-1 expressed in E. coli was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by FPLC on Superose 12. Aliquots (20 μl) of the fractions were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. Purified EF-1γ (0.5 ml from Mono Q) was eluted with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (upper panel). EF-1γ was eluted with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether recombinant EF-1β and γ were able to form a complex similar to that of native EF-1βγ, equimolar amounts of purified β and γ were incubated together for 5 min at 4 °C. Both subunits co-chromatographed at 200 mm NaCl on DEAE-cellulose (data not shown). On Superose 12, the βγ complex eluted with an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa (Fig.6 A). The ratio of β and γ subunits in the complex was 1:1 as determined by densitometric scanning of the polyacrylamide gel following electrophoresis. Because the calculated molecular mass for βγ is 74.8 kDa, the results suggested a heterodimer was formed. Purified EF-1γ and δ were combined in a ratio of 1:2 and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The proteins co-chromatographed during FPLC on Mono Q, eluting at 600 mm NaCl (data not shown). Upon gel filtration (Fig. 6 B), γ and δ migrated as a large molecular mass of ∼530 kDa but not in the void volume as observed with δ alone (Fig. 4 B). The ratio of γδ subunits was 2:1. The calculated molecular mass of γ2δ was 131 kDa, considerably smaller than the size determined by gel filtration, indicating the γδ complex was at least a heterodimer (γ4δ2) and possibly larger. Recombinant EF-1β and δ, combined in a ratio of 3:1 and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, showed no interaction (Fig. 6 C). EF-1δ migrated in the void volume as a large aggregate as observed with the pure protein, whereas all of β migrated around 50 kDa apparently as a dimer. For reconstitution of the βγδ complex, the subunits were combined at a molar ratio of 1:2:1, respectively, and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. To remove any free subunits, the βγδ complex was isolated by FPLC on Mono Q (data not shown). The peak of the complex chromatographing at 600 mm NaCl was selected for further analysis by gel filtration to confirm the existence of the subunit interactions and to determine the approximate size of the complex. EF-1βγδ migrated as a large complex of ∼670 kDa (Fig.6 D). The ratio of the β, γ, and δ subunits was 1β:2γ:1δ, as determined by densitometric scanning following SDS-PAGE. With a calculated molecular mass of 155.8 kDa for the complex, the results of gel filtration suggested that βγ2δ was a multimer. The activity of native EF-1α from rabbit reticulocytes was measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. With 10–40 pmol of EF-1α (0.5–2.0 μg), the elongation rate was linear over a 30-min incubation period (data not shown). To measure the effect of the reconstituted βγδ complex on EF-1α activity, changes in the rate of elongation upon addition of the nucleotide exchange complex were monitored using 10 pmol of EF-1α and increasing concentrations of recombinant EF-1βγδ (0.1–0.9 pmol). In the absence of EF-1 βγδ, 1.4 pmol of polyphenylalanine were synthesized (Fig. 7). A maximal stimulation of approximately 10-fold was observed at 0.5 pmol of EF-1βγδ with the molar ratio of 20α:1βγδ. Thus, the reconstituted βγδ complex was functionally active in stimulating elongation. EF-1β and δ were analyzed individually for the ability to stimulate elongation as shown in Fig. 8. Polyphenylalanine synthesis was stimulated 10-fold with EF-1β. EF-1δ also stimulated polyphenylalanine synthesis by 10-fold. However, the amount of the individual β and δ subunits required for stimulation of elongation was significantly greater (5α:2β or 2δ) than the optimal concentration of EF-1βγδ. CKII has been shown to phosphorylate the β and δ subunits of EF-1 (35Palen E. Venema R.C. Chang Y.-W.E. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8515-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When the purified recombinant subunits were examined separately as substrates for CKII, 0.6 and 0.8 mol/mol of phosphate were incorporated into the β and δ subunits, respectively. When these subunits were analyzed for the ability to stimulate the elongation activity of the α subunit, little or no effect of phosphorylation was observed over that obtained with the non-phosphorylated subunits (Table I).Table IStimulation of EF-1α activity by EF-1β and δ and the effects of phosphorylation by CKII on elongationSubunits of EF-1Polyphenylalanine synthesizedStimulationpmol-foldNone1.91 ± 0.11 (n = 3)1.0β14.02 ± 0.78 (n = 3)7.3β + CKII11.59 ± 1.26 (n = 3)6.1δ10.15 ± 0.67 (n = 3)5.3δ + CKII9.92 ± 0.58 (n = 3)5.2 Open table in a new tab When the reconstituted βγδ complex was phosphorylated by CKII, approximately 1.0 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of β and 0.7 mol/mol δ subunit. The effects of phosphorylation were monitored with the polyphenylalanine synthesis assay over a 30-min time period, using native EF-1α and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated EF-1βγδ (Fig. 9). Polyphenylalanine synthesis with EF-1α alone was linear for up to 30 min with 1.8 pmol of polyphenylalanine synthesized at 15 min. With the addition of βγδ, polyphenylalanine synthesis was linear for 15 min. At that time, the elongation rate was 5-fold higher than that observed with EF-1α alone. Phosphorylated EF-1βγδ showed the same degree of stimulation of EF-1α as the nonphosphorylated complex. Thus, phosphorylation of EF-1βγδ by CKII appeared to have no effect on elongation. The properties of the α, β, γ, and δ subunits of EF-1 from rabbit derived from the cDNA sequences are summarized in Table II. The α subunit is basic with an isoelectric point of 9.71. The β and δ are acidic with pIs of 4.33 and 4.91, respectively, whereas γ is relatively neutral. When the amino acid sequences of EF-1α, β, γ, and δ from rabbit are compared with those of human (9Sanders J. Maassen J.A. Amons R. Möller W.

Disulfide bond assignments in human (h)IL-7 are based upon the results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy and Cys to Ser mutational analyses. A gene encoding the hIL-7 was synthesized incorporating Escherichia coli codon usage bias and was used to express biologically active protein as determined by stimulation of precursor B-cell proliferation. MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis of trypsin-digested hIL-7 was performed and compared with the anticipated results of a simulated tryptic digestion. Many of the anticipated hIL-7 tryptic fragments were detected including one with a molecular mass equivalent to the sum of two polypeptides linked through a disulfide bond formed from Cys residues (Cys3 and Cys142). Subsequently, Cys to Ser substitution mutational analyses were performed. A hIL-7 variant with all six Cys substituted with Ser was found to be biologically inactive (EC50 > 1 × 10−7m). In contrast, a family of single disulfide bond-forming variants of hIL-7 were constructed by reintroducing Cys pairs (Cys3-Cys142, Cys35-Cys130, and Cys48-Cys93), and each could stimulate cell proliferation with an EC50 of 4 × 10−9, 2 × 10−8, and 2 × 10−9m, respectively. In single disulfide bond-forming mutants of hIL-7, the ability to stimulate cell proliferation was abolished in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol. The results presented strongly suggest that only a single disulfide bond is required for hIL-7 to form a tertiary structure capable of stimulating precursor B-cell proliferation.

Mature IL-7 contains six cysteine residues. Although it has been reported that biologic activity is lost upon reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (10Henney C.S. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 170-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the disulfide bond assignment of IL-7 has not been previously reported. Extensive work has been carried out on the biologic effects of IL-7; however, little is known of the cytokine's structure-function relationships. To begin an investigation of the tertiary structure of IL-7, we report on the construction of a synthetic gene encoding human IL-7 (hIL-7). We have biophysically and genetically mapped the disulfide bonds in hIL-7 using a combination of MALDI mass spectroscopy and site-directed cysteine to serine mutational analyses. MALDI mass spectroscopy performed on a tryptic digestion of hIL-7 under nonreducing conditions reveals a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 3 and 142. The mutational analysis incorporated the isosteric replacement of cysteine with serine residues to produce a family of mutant IL-7 proteins. The results presented demonstrate that cysteine residue pairs (Cys3-Cys142, Cys48-Cys93, and Cys35-Cys130) participate in disulfide bond formation. We further demonstrate that only a single disulfide bond between one of these pairs of cysteine residues is sufficient to retain a biologically active conformation. The bacterial strains, plasmids, and eukaryotic cell lines used in this study are listed in Table I. The parental plasmid for hIL-7 was pET11d (Novagen, Madison WI). Escherichia coli JM101 was the host for plasmid propagation, and the HMS174(DE3)pLysS strain was used for expression of recombinant proteins.Table IBacteria, plasmids, and eukaryotic cellsBacterial strains, plasmids, and eukaryotic cellsDescriptionSource or referenceBacterial strains E. coliJM101F′, traD36, proA+, proB+, laclq, lacZΔM15/supE,thiΔ(lac-proAB)Ref. 21Yanisch-Perron C.

Plasmid DNA and restriction fragments were purified and cloned according to standard methods (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases were used as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). DNA sequencing was performed according to the dideoxy chain termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All PCR reagents, reaction tubes, and the DNA thermal cycler 480 were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Reactions were carried out in 100-μl volumes in thin walled GeneAmp reaction tubes overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil. PCR was performed using a PCR reagent kit under the following conditions: 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.6 mm dNTPs (0.4 mm each), 2.5 units of Ampli Taq DNA polymerase, 500 ng of each primer, and 100 ng of each oligonucleotide template. The PCR cycle used was 1 min at 95 °C for strand separation, 1 min at 37 °C for primer hybridization, and 1 min at 72 °C for DNA polymerase activity. To minimize nucleotide misincorporations introduced by the PCR process, the number of cycles was maintained at twenty. Interleukin-7 and IL-7 mutant proteins were expressed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in derivatives of pET11d. Bacterial expression cultures were incubated at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani/ampicillin/chloramphenicol medium until an A 600 of 0.6 was reached. Recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g), and the pellet was frozen at −20 °C. Frozen bacterial pellets were thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, pH 7.5), and the bacteria were lysed by pulsed sonication for 4 min on ice (Branson Sonifier Cell Disruptor 200). The lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the insoluble inclusion body pellet was washed in 10 ml of buffer A. The inclusion bodies were washed three more times and resuspended in 5 ml of denaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5m guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mm EDTA), sonicated briefly, and dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 6 mm. Denatured IL-7 proteins were further purified by guanidine HPLC sizing. Protein preparations were refolded in refolding buffer (0.05 m glycine, 0.03 mNaOH, pH 10, 0.4 ml-arginine, 1 mmDTT) overnight at 4 °C. DTT and l-arginine were removed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Recombinant proteins were further purified by native HPLC sizing. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Pierce Chemical Co.) and then stored at −70 °C until used. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide and 0.1% SDS in a Mini-Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (14Diezal W. Kopperschlager G. Hoffman E. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight protein standards were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described by Towbin et al. (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Following transfer of proteins to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Brij 58) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a polyclonal goat anti-hIL-7 antibody (1:1000, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min at room temperature in TNB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Brij 58). The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-labeled horse anti-goat antibody (1:500, Sigma), was applied for another 30 min at room temperature in TNB buffer. The blots were rinsed in TNB buffer and developed by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine tetra-hydrochloride (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and 5 μl of 33% H2O2. Recombinant hIL-7 and related mutant proteins were tested for their ability to induce the proliferation of the IL-7-dependent murine immature B lymphocyte cell line 2E8 (ATCC TIB 239) (1Namen A.E. Lupton S. Hjerrild K. Wignall J. Mochizuki D.Y. Schmierer A. Mosley B. March C.J. Urdal D. Gillis S. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G.

Immunol. 1988; 18: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in vitro. 2E8 cells were maintained in Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.05 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml IL-7, and 5% fetal calf serum (Cellect, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. IL-7 remains biologically active in the presence of 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide salt) absorbance at 570 nm following reduction by active mitochondria. For proliferation assays, 2E8 cells were washed three times and seeded in 96-well plates (Linbro, Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) in 50 μl of IL-7 free medium at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. A 50-μl aliquot of protein was added to each well to give a range of concentrations from 10−12 to 10−8m in a final volume of 100 μl. After a 48-h incubation, A 30-μl aliquot of MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The formazan crystals were then solubilized by adding 100 μl of 20% SDS in 50% dimethyl formamide, pH 4.7, and incubating at 37 °C overnight (17Hansen M. Nielson S. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The following day the absorbance of the formazan product was measured on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 570 nm. Commercially available rhIL-7 preparations (Sterling Winthrop Inc., Collegeville, PA, and Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY) were used to establish the 2E8 Bioassay. Medium alone served as a negative control, and each sample was assayed in quadruplicate. Protein for MALDI mass spectroscopy was further purified using C4 reverse phase HPLC. Protein was eluted with an acetonitrile, 1% TEA gradient, fractions containing IL-7 were lyophilized and then resuspended in distilled water. Aliquots were digested with trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, for 18 h. Mass analysis was performed with a Vison 2000 reflectron TOF (Finnigan MAT) MALDI mass spectrometer using a nitrogen laser 337-nm, 3-ns pulse width (Laser Science, Inc., Newton, MA). Data were collected and analyzed with a Pentium-based system with a 500 MHz sampling rate. Protein (10 pmol) was analyzed in a matrix of either dihydroxy benzoic acid for undigested samples or sinapinic acid for trypsin fragments. The native DNA sequence encoding IL-7 (7Goodwin R.G. Lupton S. Schmierer A. Hjerrild K.J. Jerzy R. Clevenger W. Gillis S. Cosman D. Namen A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was modified in two ways to generate the synthetic sequence used in this work. First, all codons in the native hIL-7 sequence were changed to those favoring high level expression using E. coli codon bias (18de Boer H.A. Kastelein R.A. Rezinkoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworths, Boston1986: 225-280Crossref Google Scholar). These changes do not alter the native IL-7 amino acid sequence, and this strategy has been shown to increase recombinant IL-2 production in E. coli (19Williams D.P. Parker K. Bacha P. Bishai W. Borowski M. Genbauffe F. Strom T.B. Murphy J.R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Secondly, using genetic wobble in the third position, individual codons were altered to introduce four unique restriction sites into the synthetic IL-7 gene: NdeI,AgeI, NaeI, and XbaI at positions 139, 217, 305, and 339, respectively. These sites facilitated cloning of the synthetic hIL-7 gene and the cassette mutagenesis leading to the construction of Cys to Ser substitution mutants (TableI). The sequence of the synthetic hIL-7 gene used in this study has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF019762). The synthetic rhIL-7 gene was constructed from two pairs of overlapping oligonucleotides that spanned the entire length of the gene. The 5′ to 3′ construction of the gene was accomplished by PCR amplification of these oligonucleotide pairs. Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Oligo Set A) were PCR amplified to produce the 5′ half of the rhIL-7 gene, and the 3′ half of the gene was similarly amplified using Oligo Set B as the PCR template. The templates were designed such that both PCR products had a unique AgeI restriction site that would allow for in-frame annealing during subsequent cloning, to produce the entire synthetic hIL-7 gene. The 5′ half of the synthetic hIL-7 gene was subcloned into pET11d using NcoI and HindIII restriction sites. Subsequently, the 3′ half was subcloned into the intermediate plasmid construct using AgeI and HindIII restriction sites to produce the IL-7 expression plasmid, pES5. In this construct, the structural gene encoding hIL-7 is under the control of a T7 promoter. Because the rhIL-7 gene in pES5 was constructed using PCR amplification, the intact gene was sequenced to ensure correct nucleotide incorporation. E. coli HMS174(DE3)pLysS(pES5) were grown to an A 595 of 0.6, and hIL-7 gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. 2 h after induction, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. Following isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction a protein band with a molecular mass of 17 kDa is present (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The apparent molecular mass is in excellent agreement with the predicted mass of 17,518 Da, calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of hIL-7. Fig. 1 B shows an immunoblot of the SDS-PAGE probed with anti-hIL-7 antibody and demonstrates that the 17-kDa protein is immunoreactive. The hIL-7 expressed in E. coliHMS174(DE3)pLysS(pES5) formed inclusion bodies that were purified by centrifugation (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the hIL-7 was further purified by HPLC molecular sizing (Fig.1 A, lane 5). Also, note that Fig. 1 B(lanes 3 and 4) displays an anti-IL-7 immunoreactive protein with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa that corresponds to the size of an IL-7 dimer. To establish optimal refolding conditions for hIL-7, inclusion bodies were solubilized in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the denatured protein was allowed to refold under various conditions. Denatured protein was refolded by dialysis against citrate-phosphate buffers at pH 4, 5, and 7, and glycine-NaOH buffer (0.05 mglycine, 0.03 m NaOH) at pH 10, where all buffers contained 6 mm DTT. Disulfide bonds were then allowed to form by removing DTT by dialysis. Once refolded, hIL-7 was assayed for biologic activity by measuring the stimulation of IL-7-dependent 2E8 cell proliferation in vitro. Maximal stimulation of proliferation of 2E8 cells occurred in the presence of hIL-7 refolded at pH 10 and 7 (data not shown). Although the addition of 50 mm NaCl did not appear to enhance the refolding, the addition of 0.4 ml-arginine to the buffers increased the yield of biologically active monomeric hIL-7 protein. Following purification and refolding the ED50 for hIL-7 stimulation of 2E8 cell proliferation was 2 × 10−10m. We next examined the sensitivity of hIL-7 to reduction in the presence of various concentrations of DTT. As shown in Fig. 2, 2E8 cells incubated with hIL-7 (1 × 10−8m) resulted in a 2-fold increase in the A 570 nm compared with control. The 2-fold increase in the A 570 nm was lost when 2 mm DTT was added to the reaction. The loss of biologic activity in the presence of a thiol reducing compound suggests that the active tertiary structure of IL-7 is dependent on the formation of disulfide bonds. Mass spectroscopy of hIL-7 (17,518 Da) detected molecules with molecular masses of 17,519.1 Da and 8761.1 Da (Fig.2 A). The 8761.1-Da fragment represents a doubly ionized hIL-7 molecule. MALDI mass spectroscopy of trypsin-digested hIL-7 detected many protein fragments with masses corresponding to the size of predicted products (Table II). In addition, several of the polypeptides that contain a methionine appear to have been either oxidized as indicated by the addition of 15.9 Da to the predicted mass or coordinated with a Na+ that adds 22.9 Da. IL-7 trypsin fragments 7 and 12 were detected in both the oxidized and nonoxidized states, whereas fragment 15 was found with and without a bound Na+ (data not shown). The detection of molecules with a molecular mass of 1557.8 Da. corresponds well to the size of hIL-7 tryptic fragments 1 and 23 linked through a disulfide bond (Fig. 2 B). The association of these fragments physically maps the disulfide bond in hIL-7 to cysteine pair Cys3-Cys142. MALDI mass spectroscopy of hIL-7 tryptic digestion under reducing conditions did not detect the 1557.8-Da fragment (Fig. 2 C).Table IISimulated trypsin digestion of hIL-7FragmentPositionAverage molecular massAmino acid sequence11–8910.04MDCDIEGK29–11318.33DGK312–292099.46QYESVLMVSIDQLLDSMK430–441775.96EIGSNCLNNEFNFFK545–45174.20R646–52799.91HICDANK753–59899.08EGMFLFR860–62316.36AAR963–63146.19K1064–65287.36LR1166–69534.66QFLK1270–821490.70MNSTGDFDLHLLK1383–981662.93VSEGTTILLNCTGQVK1499–100231.26GR15101–1121210.40KPAALGEAQPTK16113–118718.76SLEENK17119–121346.43SLK18122–124403.44EQK19125–125146.19K20126–133965.18LNDLCFLK21134–134174.20R22135–140742.92LLQEIK23141–145650.76TCWNK24146–151661.87ILMGTK25152–153284.27EH Open table in a new tab Individual site-directed Cys to Ser alterations were introduced into the hIL-7 DNA sequence using PCR mutagenesis. The mutated sequences were then subcloned into the hIL-7 structural gene by cassette replacement, and each mutant gene was then DNA sequenced to ensure that only the desired Cys to Ser mutation was introduced. HIL-7 and Cys to Ser mutant proteins were then expressed and purified, and their ability to stimulate cell proliferation in the absence or the presence of DTT was measured (Fig.3). Although each of the single Cys to Ser substitutions in hIL-7 were found to be biologically active (data not shown), the simultaneous replacement of all six Cys residues with Ser resulted in a mutant protein with an ED50 > 1 × 10−7m. Based on the MALDI mass spectroscopy analysis, Cys residues 3 and 142 were genetically reintroduced to form hIL-7 (C35S,C48S,C93S,C130S). This variant form of hIL-7 was found to have an ED50 4 × 10−9m. Based upon computational molecular modeling and other site-directed mutagenesis experiments, cysteine pairs Cys48-Cys93 and Cys35-Cys130 were independently reintroduced into hIL-7 (C3S,C35S,C48S,C93S,C130S,C142S) producing hIL-7 (C3S,C35S,C130S,C142S) and hIL-7 (C3S,C48S,C93S,C142S). The latter two IL-7 variants were found to have an ED50 of 2 × 10−9 and 2 × 10−8m, respectively. The reintroduction of Cys pairs Cys3-Cys142, Cys48-Cys93, and Cys35-Cys130 into hIL-7 (C3S,C35S,C48S,C93S,C130S,C142S) resulted in three variant forms of hIL-7. Each of these variants had the ability to form a single correctly paired disulfide bond. In each case the formation of a single correctly paired disulfide bond was sufficient to produce a biologically active conformation of IL-7 that was sensitive to 2 mm DTT (Fig. 3 B). A summary of biological activity and IC50 for displacement of125I-labeled IL-7 from the IL-7 receptor for native and Cys to Ser hIL-7 variants is presented in TableIII.Table IIISummary of ED 50 for stimulation of 2E8 cell proliferation and IC50 for displacement of 125I-labeled IL-7 from the IL-7R by native and hIL-7 variantsProteinED50KimhIL-72.0 × 10−104.0 × 10−9hIL-7(C48S,C130S)>1.0 × 10−7>1.0 × 10−7hIL-7(C3S,C35S,C130S,C142S)2.0 × 10−96.0 × 10−9hIL-7(C3S,C48S,C93S,C142S)2.0 × 10−81.2 × 10−8hIL-7(C35S,C48S,C93S,C130S)4.0 × 10−92.0 × 10−8hIL-7(C3S,C35S,C48S,C93S, C130S,C142S)>1.0 × 10−7>5.0 × 10−8 Open table in a new tab The disulfide bond assignments in hIL-7 were assigned based upon the combination of MALDI mass spectroscopy and site-directed Cys to Ser mutational analyses. Mature hIL-7 contains six cysteine residues and has been reported to lose all biological activity when incubated in the presence of a thiol. MALDI mass spectroscopic analyses were performed on trypsin-digested hIL-7 only and detected a pair of peptide fragments, 1 and 23, linked by a disulfide bond that physically maps the Cys pair Cys3-Cys142. Mass analysis of a trypsin-digested hIL-7 in the presence of 2 mm DTT fails to detect the paired fragments confirming the existence of the Cys3-Cys142 disulfide bond. Subsequently, site-directed Cys to Ser substitution mutational analysis of hIL-7 was performed to compliment the MALDI mass spectroscopy work. A family of Cys to Ser substitution IL-7 mutants were constructed that included a biologically inactive non-disulfide bond-forming mutant, hIL-7 (C3S,C35S,C48S,C93S,C130S,C142S). Ser was chosen to replace Cys residues in IL-7 because of is similarity in size and structure and the inability to form a disulfide bond. In the absence of disulfide bond formation, this variant of hIL-7 displayed an EC50 > 1 × 10−7m for stimulation of 2E8 cell proliferation. Treatment of the non-disulfide bond-forming hIL-7 mutant with 2 mm DTT reduced biological activity to control levels, suggesting that disulfide bond formation in the 2E8 cell IL-7R is essential for stimulating cell proliferation. In fact, the IL-7R has been classified with a group of cytokine receptors based partially upon a predicted disulfide bonding pattern (20Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutational analysis of hIL-7 proceeded by reintroducing pairs of Cys residues into the non-disulfide bond-forming biologically inactive hIL-7 mutant. Reintroduction of Cys pair Cys3-Cys142 formed a variant of hIL-7 that displayed a biologically active tertiary conformation. In comparison, MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis of trypsin-digested hIL-7 revealed a polypeptide with a molecular mass corresponding to the union of two fragments covalently linked through a disulfide bond between Cys pair Cys3-Cys142. Subsequently, the individual reintroduction of Cys pairs Cys35-Cys130 and Cys48-Cys93 into the non-disulfide bond-forming biologically inactive hIL-7 variant produced two single disulfide bond-forming mutants that were biologically active (EC504 × 10−9, 2 × 10−8 and 2 × 10−9m, respectively) in the in vitro precursor B-cell proliferation assay. All three single disulfide bond-forming hIL-7 mutants failed to stimulate precursor B-cell proliferation in the presence of 2 mm DTT. The Cys to Ser mutational analysis confirms the MALDI mass spectroscopy data and has allowed the disulfide bond assignments in hIL-7. The analysis also suggests that a single correctly paired disulfide bond is all that is required for hIL-7 to retain a biologically active tertiary conformation. If hIL-7 functions as a bridging molecule between receptors, the redundancy in the number of disulfide bonds would be expected to help stabilize the complex. To perform the Cys to Ser substitution mutational analysis, we have synthesized a gene for hIL-7 with E. coli codon usage bias with the incorporation of four unique restriction sites that facilitated a cassette mutagenesis strategy. The family of synthetic hIL-7 genes were subcloned into an expression vector under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, which allowed for the expression hIL-7 proteins. Recombinant hIL-7 proteins accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies that were purified, denatured, and refolded into a biologically active conformation. During electrophoresis of protein samples taken during the purification process, an anti-IL-7 immunoreactive species with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa was noted in Fig.1 B. Electrophoresis of protein samples that were boiled in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol did not prevent the appearance of the 34-kDa species (data not shown), suggesting that strong protein-protein interactions are involved in forming an IL-7 dimer. The combination of MALDI mass spectroscopy and Cys to Ser mutational data in this work has allowed us to assign three pairs of Cys residues involved in forming disulfide bonds in hIL-7. Mapping the disulfide bonds in hIL-7 increases the resolution involved in predicting the tertiary structure of this cytokine. An inverted protein structure prediction based on the amino acid sequence of hIL-7 has been combined with the data in this report and used to propose a hypothetical three-dimensional molecular model of the tertiary structure. 2L. Cosenza, A. Rosenbach, J. V. White, J. R. Murphy, and T. Smith, manuscript in preparation. It is anticipated that this model of IL-7 will be of some help in predicting those amino acid residues that play a role in receptor binding and activation.

These effects are thought to be caused by the covalent binding of these species to nucleophilic groups on the bases of DNA. To address the molecular mechanisms by which these molecules induce mutations, this study employed oligonucleotides containing four site-specific N6 adenine-benz[a]anthracene diol epoxide adducts. Using a prokaryotic in vivo replication system, we have shown that both non-bay region anti-trans-benz[a]anthracene adducts are essentially nonmutagenic. In contrast, the bay region anti-trans-benz[a]anthracene lesions do induce point mutations at the adduct site. The mutagenic frequency of these bay region lesions is dependent on the stereochemistry about the adduct-forming bond, as well as the strain of Escherichia coli in which they are replicated. The ability of the bacterial replication machinery to bypass the lesions does not correlate with the differences observed in their mutagenesis. While both non-bay region adducts are readily bypassed in vivo, the bay region adducts are both blocking to approximately the same degree. In vitro studies of the interactions of E. coli DNA polymerase III with these adducts have also been undertaken to further dissect the relationship between adduct structure and biological activity.

In vitro studies of the interactions of E. coli DNA polymerase III with these adducts have also been undertaken to further dissect the relationship between adduct structure and biological activity. Under normal growth conditions, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III and its accessory factors constitute an extremely efficient enzyme system. The holoenzyme complex can incorporate up to 1000 nucleotides/s, and estimates of replication fidelity are in the range of 1 mistake/1010 bases copied (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 165-182Google Scholar). This extremely high fidelity is a result of multiple individual reactions, all of which have intrinsically high fidelity: the polymerization step, 3′ → 5′ proof-reading, and postreplicative mismatch correction. Factors that compromise the fidelity of any of these steps can lead to increased mutation rates and potentially to cell death or transformation/cancer in higher eukaryotes.

Benz[a]anthracene (BA) is one of the many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are formed during the incomplete combustion of organic materials, including gasoline, and tobacco. It is found in particularly high concentrations in coal tar and the wood preservative creosote, and it has been shown that levels of BA increase 7- to 8-fold in meat that is grilled over charcoal (2ICF-Clement Toxicological Profile for Benz[a]anthracene. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN1990Google Scholar). Like other PAHs, BA undergoes metabolic activation to form vicinal diol epoxides. The mutagenicity of numerous BA metabolites has been determined (3Harvey R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 218-226Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 4Slaga T.J. Huberman E.J.K. Harvey R.G.

A. 1977; 74: 2746-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and it is widely accepted that the biological effects of BA as well as other PAHs result from the reaction of bay region diol epoxides with the bases of DNA. A bay region diol epoxide is defined as a vicinal diol epoxide in which the epoxide ring encompasses one of the bay region carbon atoms (see Fig. 1). In comparison with other diol epoxides of BA, the bay region diol epoxides are 10–35 times more mutagenic in certain bacterial strains and 65–125 times more mutagenic in V79–6 Chinese hamster lung cells (4Slaga T.J. Huberman E.J.K. Harvey R.G. Bracken W.M. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1699-1704PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wood A.W. Chang R.L. Levin W. Lehr R.E. Schaefer-Ridder M. Karle J.M. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Proc.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Animal studies implicate BA as a mild carcinogen, especially in comparison with such compounds as benzo[a]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (3Harvey R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 218-226Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). The low rate of tumorigenicity of BA is thought to be due, at least in part, to the low level of metabolism of BA to the bay region diol epoxide (8Harvey R.G. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Cambridge University Press, UK1991Google Scholar, 9Thakker D.R. Levin W. Yagi H. Ryan D. Thomas P.E. Karle J.M. Lehr R.E. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Mol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5103-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly what it is about the bay region diol epoxides that leads to the biological effects seen is still unclear. The initial bay region theory of carcinogenesis was based on calculations which showed that the epoxide was particularly reactive at this position and could easily open to form a strongly electrophilic carbocation that would then be attacked by the nucleophilic groups in DNA. It was suggested that this increased reactivity of the bay region diol epoxides was the basis for the increased mutagenicity/carcinogenicity of these compounds (12Lehr R.E. Kumar S. Levin W. Wood A.W. Chang R.L. Conney A.H. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Harvey R.G. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Carcinogenesis. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1985Google Scholar). As has been pointed out, however, increased reactivity alone cannot account for the increased mutagenicity of these compounds since other (non-bay region) diol epoxides also form covalent DNA adducts with approximately the same efficiency (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 165-182Google Scholar). Further, some of the most potent bay region diol epoxides turn out to be some of the least reactive. An alternative explanation for the observed dichotomy between the bay region and the non-bay region diol epoxides of PAHs is that the adducts which they form adopt conformations that are recognized in different ways by the cellular repair/replication machinery and that these differences account for the varied mutagenicity of the adducts (13Kim S.K. Geacintov N.E. Brenner H.C. Harvey R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Clearly, these questions remain to be answered, and we consider site- and stereo-specific BA-DNA lesions to be ideal for determining structure-function relationships of adducts resulting from mutagenic versus non-mutagenic PAH metabolites. We initiated a project to study the biological effects of site-specific DNA adducts that form when certain PAH metabolites interact with DNA. A primary goal of this research, in conjunction with the structural studies which are being carried out by Dr. Michael Stone at Vanderbilt University, is to determine the basis for the different mutagenic effects of similar compounds, all of which bind to DNA in the same basic manner. In this study, we examined four benz[a]anthracene diol epoxide-DNA adducts (two bay region and two non-bay region). These adducts were synthesized chemically by methodology developed by Kim et al. (14Kim S.J. Stone M.P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5480-5481Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Kim S.J. Jajoo H.K. Kim H.-Y. Zhou L. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), but the same structures would result from trans opening of each of the following BA anti-epoxides by the exocyclic nitrogen (N6) of adenine: 1) 8S,9R,10R,11S-10,11-epoxy-8,9,10,11-tetrahydro-BA-8,9-diol; 2) 8R,9S,10S,11R-10,11-epoxy-8,9,10,11-tetrahydro-BA-8,9-diol; 3) 1S,2R,3R,4S-1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-BA-3,4-diol; and 4) 1R,2S,3S,4R-1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-BA-3,4-diol. The corresponding adducts will henceforth be referred to as non-bay region 11R-BA, non-bay region 11S-BA, bay region 1R-BA, and bay region 1S-BA, respectively (Fig. 1). While we recognize that these epoxides react mainly at the N2 position of guanine, the minor adenine lesions examined herein may have a disproportionate biological significance as has been suggested for adenine adducts resulting from the diol epoxide derivatives of dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (16Dipple A. Pigott M. Moschel R.C. Costantino N. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4132-4135PubMed Google Scholar), benzo[a]pyrene (17Vousden K.H. Bos J.L. Marshall C.J. Phillips D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) and pyridine were distilled from calcium hydride after reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h. Benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled from sodium/benzophenone after reflux under nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h. All glassware, syringes, needles, and magnetic stirring bars used in moisture-sensitive reactions were oven dried at 140 °C and stored in desiccators until used. All moisture-sensitive reactions were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography. TLC plates were purchased from EM Science (Kieselgel 60 F254, pre-coated, 20 × 20 cm, 0.25-mm layer thickness). TLC plates were visualized, after development, under ultraviolet (UV) light (254 cm−1) followed by staining with anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid.

The modified oligonucleotide (2 × 1 μmol), 5′-CGGA-CA*A-GAAG-3′ (Ras codon 61), where A* is the 6-fluoropurine nucleoside, was prepared using automated solid-phase synthesis (Applied Biosystems Model 391 synthesizer) with 6-fluoro-5′-DMTr-3′-phosphoramidite (14Kim S.J.

The cassettes were emptied into a 1-dram conical vial to which was added non-bay region (±)-anti-trans-benz[a]anthracene aminotriol (8.3 mg, 28 μmol), dry Me2SO (600 μl), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 μl). The mixture was heated for 3 days at 55 °C under N2. After cooling to room temperature, the supernatant was removed, and the residual beads were washed with CH3OH (3 × 1 ml) and diethyl ether (1 ×) and air-dried. The beads were transferred to a 3-dram vial, and concentrated NH4OH (3 ml) was added. The tightly closed vial was heated for 8 h at 60 °C to effect cleavage from the solid support and deblocking. After cooling, the vial was allowed to stand until the excess NH4OH had evaporated. The supernatant was transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The beads were washed with water (2 × 1 ml), and the washings were added to the original supernatant. After lyophilization, the dry materials were dissolved in H2O (1 ml), filtered through a 0.45-mm syringe filter, and passed through a 1.5 × 44 cm column of Sephadex G-15 with elution by H2O. The major UV-absorbing peak was collected, concentrated, and purified on a reverse-phase column (PRP-1, 7 × 305 mm, Hamilton) at 45 °C using a linear gradient of 10 mm ethylenediamine acetate, pH 7.45, containing 6–12% CH3CN over 40 min, flow rate 3.0 ml/min. The two diastereomers were eluted between 22 and 24 min. A second separation on the same column was performed at 25 °C using 0.1 mammonium formate, pH 6.39, containing from 27 to 30% MeOH over 20 min. After removal of solvent by lyophilization, the fractions were desalted on oligonucleotide purification cartridges (Applied Biosystems).

The modified oligonucleotide (3 × 1 μmol cassette), 5′-CGGA-CA*A-GAAG-3′ (Ras codon 61), where A* is the 6-fluoropurine nucleoside, was prepared by the same method as for the non-bay benz[a]anthracene-adducted oligonucleotide. Bay region (±)-anti-trans-benz[a]anthracene aminotriol (15.4 mg, 52 μmol) was placed in a conical vial containing the modified oligonucleotide in Me2SO (700 μl) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (15 μl). The mixture was heated for 5 days at 60 °C under N2. After cooling to room temperature, the beads were treated with the procedure described above. Following passage through Sephadex G-15 and lyophilization, the adducted oligonucleotide was dissolved in H2O (1 ml), and purified on a reversed-phase column (YMC-ODS-AQ (4.6 × 250 mm)) using a linear gradient of 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 6.5, containing 5–30% CH3OH over 30 min, 30% for 5 min, and 30–100% over 10 min, flow rate 1.25 ml/min. The collected peaks were lyophilized, redissolved, and desalted on OPC cartridges according to the manufacturer directions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Capillary gel electrophoresis was performed on either an Applied Biosystems Model 270, using gel-filled capillaries (Applied Biosystems) and the manufacturer's Micro-Gel buffer, or on a Beckman PACE 2000 system with the manufacturer's e-CAP gel-filled capillaries and Tris borate-urea buffer. Samples were applied at −5 kV and run at −15 kV at 30 °C. The oligonucleotides (0.2–0.6 ODs), lyophilized in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, were digested in a 2-stage process. In the first step, buffer (20 μl, 0.01 mTris-HCl, 0.01 m MgCl2, pH 7.0) was added, followed by nuclease P1 (Sigma N-8630, 4 μL). After digesting for 3–6 h at 36 °C, the second digestion step was performed. Tris-HCl buffer (20 μl, 0.1 m, pH 9.0) was added followed by snake venom phosphodiesterase (Sigma 5785, 0.04 units) and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma P-4282, 0.4 unit). Digestion was continued at 37 °C for 3–6 h. Before HPLC analysis, H2O (100 μl) was added to each sample. Following centrifugal filtration, the digests were analyzed by HPLC on either a C-18 or YMC-ODS-AQ column with a gradient of 1–10% CH3CN in 0.01 m ammonium formate, pH 5.9, over 15 min followed by 10–99% CH3CN over 20 min, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Under these conditions, the diastereomeric PAH-adducted nucleosides eluted at 30–32 min. Peak identification was by comparison with adducted nucleosides synthesized as described above. Each of the four BA-adenine lesions described above was constructed such that it was located in the center of an 11-mer oligonucleotide. The sequence of the 11-mer corresponded to the coding sequence of the human N-Ras gene from position 3 of codon 59 to position 1 of codon 63 (5′-C GGA CAA GAA G-3′). Thus, the adducted adenine residue was located at position 2 of codon 61, a biologically relevant site since point mutations in this sequence have been detected in numerous tumor types (23Karga H.

Each of the sites is formed from a nearly palindromic region that contains two functionally defined cAMP response elements. The region can switch between cruciform and linear duplex. Formation of the cruciform creates an alternative binding site for mediators of second messenger-directed transcription and abolishes the site present in the native duplex form. Use of the cruciform site has been shown to correlate with activated transcription. Analysis of DNA structure, protein binding, and gene expression from plasmids with mutant enhancers shows, however, that both sites are required for regulation of transcription. The two distinct structures form within the same enhancer. Shifting the balance between the two alters transcriptional response.

Transcription of the proenkephalin gene, which encodes the precursor to endogenous opiate-receptor ligands, is regulated by signals from growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cell depolarization. The pathways converge on an evolutionarily conserved, nearly palindromic region that contains two functionally defined cAMP response elements (CREs) 1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Only CRE-2 can independently bind transcription factors. However, point mutations in either CRE have quantitatively similar effects on transcription (2Comb M. Mermod N. Hyman S.E. Pearlberg J. Ross M.E. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the response to CRE-binding proteins depends on the presence of CRE-1 as well as CRE-2 (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the 23-base pair region containing the CREs is nearly palindromic, it can convert to a cruciform structure in which a transcription factor-binding site is formed from the sequences of both CREs on the same strand (3–5; Fig.1 a). The switch to the alternative site eliminates the native CRE-2, substituting a site with the same sequence but with two mismatched GT base pairs (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11960-11970Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The structural change, therefore, creates a single site comprising both CRE-1 and CRE-2 (Fig.1 a). Use of the site made from both CREs correlates with stimulated transcription, according to several types of analysis. In vivo, the site made from CRE-1 and CRE-2, but not the native duplex CRE-2 site, is occupied specifically during transcription (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dimethyl sulfate treatment of cells actively transcribing proenkephalin specifically modifies adenines that form non-Watson-Crick AC base pairs in the cruciform structure, indicating unusual charge distribution at those bases only during active transcription (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Electron spectroscopic images show that a CREB dimer occupies twice as much DNA in the proenkephalin gene as in the prodynorphin gene, consistent with binding to a cruciform in the proenkephalin gene (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The prodynorphin CRE is identical in sequence to proenkephalin CRE-2 but is in a region unable to form alternative structure (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, point mutations that do not alter transcription factor binding but that could modify hairpin stability modulate response to receptor signaling (2Comb M. Mermod N. Hyman S.E. Pearlberg J. Ross M.E. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4McMurray C.T. Wilson W.D. Douglass J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Within the proenkephalin gene, therefore, CRE-1 and CRE-2 form a single binding site that is essential for transcriptional response to extracellular signals. The native CRE-2 is a relatively low-affinity binding site for CREB (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Williams J.S. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but GT base pairs in the stem of the hairpin made from CRE-1 and CRE-2 enhance CREB binding (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The higher affinity site on the hairpin arm could correlate with high activity transcription because it is better able to recruit enhancer-binding proteins. To understand the mechanism of proenkephalin enhancer action and to test the hypothesis that enhanced protein affinity for the altered site allows more efficient transcription, we have analyzed gene expression, protein binding, and DNA structure of reporter plasmids with point mutations in the region of the CREs. Binding to the CREs is necessary for transcriptional response, but our analysis demonstrates that efficiency of binding of CREB alone does not correlate with transcription. CREB preference for the alternative site cannot by itself explain the enhanced activity of the hairpin versuslinear duplex binding site. The relative availability of the alternative sites does, however, affect transcription. Mutants in which strong binding to the linear duplex CRE-2 is favored, relative to the native gene, are less responsive to cAMP. Mutants with greater preference for hairpin rather than linear duplex CRE-2 site are more responsive to cAMP. Thus, proper regulation of transcription mediated by the native enhancer requires switching between both sites.

SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Proenkephalin-CAT reporter plasmids were introduced by DEAE-dextran-mediated transformation (250 μg/ml DEAE dextran + DNA for 2–2.5 h followed by 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 2 min). Forskolin (20 μm final) or dimethyl sulfoxide carrier (“control”) was added 15 h after 10% dimethyl sulfoxide treatment. Cells (10 cm dish) were harvested 24 h after forskolin treatment into 75 μl of enzyme extract; 15 μl was used for the CAT assay (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol.

Acetylated and unacetylated spots were quantified from digital images by IP Lab Gel (Signal Analytics), using supplied macros (“profile plot,” “auto peak find,” and “analyze peaks”). Percent acetylation and standard deviation of replicate plates were calculated in Excel (Microsoft), and data were plotted using KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck). Bacterially expressed CREB protein was expressed and purified as described previously (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol.

After separation of fragments on 8% sequencing gels, the gels were dried for exposure of phosphor storage screen. ImageQuant software was used to convert the data from the phosphor storage screen to images of gels and to numbers used to quantify band strength. Scale of scanned images was adjusted to reduce variation in signal between lanes. Comparison of bands was as described previously (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol.

The ability of specific mutations to either enhance or reduce transcription contributed to an understanding of the effect of secondary structure in proenkephalin gene expression (4McMurray C.T. Wilson W.D. Douglass J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Certain mutations eliminate protein binding, which can explain their deleterious effect on transcription (e.g. enk −88C,−89A; Refs. 3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G.

In contrast, other mutations do not abolish binding yet have a significant effect on transcription (e.g. enk subCRE1; Refs. 3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc.

To understand the relationships among binding efficiency, structure, and gene expression, we have produced and analyzed mutant proenkephalin-CAT reporter plasmids (Fig.1 b). Binding and structural analyses were carried out on intact plasmids, identical to those used for transcriptional analysis. The plasmids analyzed included the previously described mutants lacking a functional CRE-2 (enk −88C,−89A) or a functional CRE-1 (enk subCRE1) as well as mutants with single or two-base changes designed to alter the cruciform. Because CRE-2 is essential for binding to both the linear duplex and the hairpin site (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), modification of CRE-2 was avoided in this latter group of mutant plasmids. These mutations have been chosen for their ability to alter stability of the cruciform. The mutants designated enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A have a less stable cruciform structure because of reduced hydrogen bonding in the stem (Fig. 1 b; Refs. 4McMurray C.T. Wilson W.D. Douglass J.O.

The mutants designated enk −91A and enk −102A and the double mutant enk −91A,−102A have either one or both of the mismatched base pairs in the stem corrected and, consequently, a more stable stem-loop structure (Fig. 1 b). Alterations in the loop have been shown previously to modify hairpin stability (18.Gacy, A. M. (1996) The Role of DNA Hairpin Structure in the Regulation of Transcription and Replication. Ph.D. thesis, Mayo Graduate School.Google Scholar). Substitution of an A or T for the G at position −95 creates a more stable hairpin, as determined by thermal melting analysis (17Gacy A.M. McMurray C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11951-11959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18.Gacy, A. M. (1996) The Role of DNA Hairpin Structure in the Regulation of Transcription and Replication. Ph.D. thesis, Mayo Graduate School.Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids with the desired mutations were constructed for use in the analyses (Fig.1 b; and see “Experimental Procedures”). Transcription was analyzed by transient transfection of proenkephalin-CAT reporter plasmids into the SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cell line, in which the endogenous proenkephalin gene is expressed. CAT activity of mutant plasmids was compared with that of the native plasmid (Fig.2). Mutations that eliminate either CRE-1 (enk subCRE-1) or CRE-2 (enk −88C,−89A) reduce transcriptional efficiency (Fig. 2), as has been shown previously (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The strongest inhibition of transcriptional response is caused by the mutation that alters the conserved CGTCA in CRE-2 (Fig. 2, enk −88C,−89A), and, thereby, eliminates binding to the enhancer region (Fig. 3 a; Ref. 6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Modification of CRE-1 (enk subCRE-1) does not alter CRE-2, but it does destroy the palindromic character of the region, precluding formation of a cruciform (Refs. 3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; and Fig. 1). Two changes (enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A) cause reduced transcriptional response very much like that caused by the mutations that abolish CRE-1 in the mutant enk subCRE-1 (Fig. 2). Both modifications (in enk −98T and in enk −105G,−106) destabilize hairpins. Enk −98T has a single-base change in CRE-1, which introduces another mismatched base pair into each stem (Fig. 1 b), and enk −105G,−106A has two mutations which substitute mismatched base pairs at the base and reduce the stem to 8-base pairs (Fig. 1 b). Neither of these plasmids has a mutation in or close to CRE-2 in the linear duplex form (Fig. 1 b, left side), and one of them (enk −105G,−106A) modifies neither CRE at all, yet they both show an effect similar to the complete elimination of CRE-1 (Fig. 2). Mutations that correct mismatched base pairs in the stem, by substituting an A for the G at either −91 or −102 or at both, stabilize the cruciform (Ref. 4McMurray C.T. Wilson W.D. Douglass J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 b). Either or both of these changes enhance transcriptional response (Fig. 2). We do note, however, that each of these mismatch-correcting mutations complicates direct comparison with the native. The mutation at −102 creates within CRE-1 the conserved CGTCA of CREs, so that transcriptional response could be due in part to the creation of a different binding site. The mutation at −91 modifies CRE-2 so that the binding site is not identical to the CRE-2 in the native. Because of these ambiguities, we do not consider these mutant plasmids in our structural analysis (see below). The final two mutant plasmids were altered at base −95, which is between the two CREs in the linear duplex and forms the middle base in the loop (Fig. 1 b). Changes at the middle position of the loop (−95) all create more stable hairpins than native, as determined by thermal melting analysis of synthetic enhancers (17Gacy A.M. McMurray C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11951-11959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18.Gacy, A. M. (1996) The Role of DNA Hairpin Structure in the Regulation of Transcription and Replication. Ph.D. thesis, Mayo Graduate School.Google Scholar). The loop then contributes to hairpin stability. Analysis of the proenkephalin-CAT reporter plasmids shows that alteration to either A or T at position −95 enhances transcription, with a greater response than native to addition of forskolin (Fig. 2). In summary, mutants with predicted stabilization of the hairpin show enhanced transcriptional response, while destabilization correlates with reduced response. In short synthetic enhancers, insertion of GT base pairs into a duplex site increases CREB protein binding, indicating that GT base pairs enhance binding when the structure is otherwise held constant (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cruciform site, which has mismatched GT base pairs (Fig. 1 a; Ref. 5McMurray C.T. Juranic N. Chandrasekaran S. Macura S. Li Y. Jones R.L. Wilson W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11960-11970Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), can, therefore, have an advantage over the linear duplex site in recruiting transcription factors such as CREB, which mediates proenkephalin expression in vivo via the CREs (8Konradi C. Kobierski L.A. Nguyen T.V. Heckers S. Hyman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7005-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Borsook D. Konradi C. Falkowski O. Comb M. Hyman S.E.

Conversely, stabilizing the structure, even at the expense of eliminating the mismatched base pairs, can also enhance receptor response (Fig. 2, enk −91A and/or enk −102A). CREB binds to the enhancer in the plasmid with the substituted CRE-1 even at the lowest concentration of protein (Figs. 1 b and3 a, enk subCRE1; and Ref. 6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enk subCRE1 enhancer, however, cannot support efficient transcription (Fig. 2; Ref. 6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the response to CREB itself is abrogated in plasmids lacking a functional CRE-1 (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In plasmid enk subCRE1 protection is limited to the region around CRE-2; it does not extend into CRE-1 (Fig. 3 a). The plasmid designed to abolish CRE-2 (enk −88C,−89A) shows little protection even at the highest concentration of protein (Fig. 3 a). Thus CRE-2 alone is sufficient for binding and is necessary for CREB binding to either CRE. Binding, however, does not correlate with efficient transcription. Other mutants, which differ less from the native, are likely to be more informative as to the importance of individual bases in the action of the CREs. Thus, we have analyzed for binding those plasmids with least disruption of the CREs. Mutations in four plasmids (enk −98T, enk −105G,−106A, enk −95T, and enk −95A) do not modify CRE-2 and do not create possible new CREB-binding sites in CRE-1. Two of these four plasmids show diminished response (Fig. 2, enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A), while two of them are more responsive transcriptionally (Fig. 2, enk −95T and enk −95A). Only one of this group (enk −98T) has a change in either of the CREs (Fig. 1 b). The plasmids were incubated with CREB protein over a 30-fold range and then analyzed for protection from DNase I digestion. Binding was detected at all of the enhancers, but the depth and shape of the protected area along the top strand differed among these mutant plasmids and in comparison to the native (Fig.3 b). There was no greater protection at low levels of CREB in those mutants that were more active transcriptionally (enk −95T and enk −95A) as compared with those that were less active (enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A). On the contrary, at the lowest level of protein (second lane from left in each set), enk −105G,−106A showed greater protection around CRE-2 than the native, enk −95T or enk −95A (lower rectangles along the gels in Fig. 3 b). The protected area in mutant plasmid enk subCRE1 (Fig.3 a) is a useful reference for protection of CRE-2, since enk subCRE1 lacks CRE-1 and cannot form a stem-loop structure (Fig. 1 b). Thus the area from −78 through −95 can be protected along the top strand by binding to CRE-2 (Fig.3 a). The footprint in plasmid enk −98T is similar to that in plasmid enk subCRE1. That is, there is protection of CRE-2 but little within CRE-1 (upper rectangle along enk −98T in Fig. 3 b), even at the highest levels of protein. In mutant plasmid enk −105G,−106A, which has a diminished response to forskolin as compared with native, there is a footprint over CRE-1 (along upper rectangles in Fig. 3 b). In summary, more efficient binding of CREB protein alone does not correlate with stronger transcriptional response. Switching between structures cannot be detected in the absence of protein (Fig.3 b, 0 protein lane). Because CREB can bind to the site in the cruciform enhancer and protect from DNase I digestion, it is a probe for the cruciform. CREB binds to the linear duplex site as well, but the pattern of protection differs between the two sites (Fig.4). Binding to the linear duplex site should protect bases only in CRE-2 on both strands (Fig. 4, left side); binding to the cruciform should protect bases within both CRE-1 and CRE-2 but only on the top strand (Fig. 4, right side). Switching creates one site as it eliminates the other (Fig.1 a, Fig. 4, top). We have designed mutations to alter the stability of the cruciform, but the mutations have little to no influence on duplex stability. A single binding reaction might, therefore, contain some molecules with linear duplex enhancer and others with cruciform enhancer. Because protection in CRE-1 results only from binding to the cruciform site, increasing protection there indicates switching to the cruciform (Fig. 4, predicted patterns of protection). The pattern of protection in the mutant enk subCRE1 (Fig.3 a) can serve as a reference. The removal of the palindromic character of the region makes formation of the cruciform site impossible, but CRE-2 is intact (Fig. 1 b). Protection from DNase I is limited to CRE-2 (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, the native and the mutants with single or two base changes show some protection in CRE-1, indicating that there is switching to the alternative site (Fig. 3 b). Two of the plasmids (enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A) contain cruciform destabilizing mutations; two (enk −95T and enk −95A) contain loop mutations that stabilize cruciform. All four mutant plasmids and the native share an identical CRE-2 with the enk subCRE1 mutant (Fig. 1 b). Consequently, they show protection of CRE-2 but differ in protection at CRE-1 (Fig. 3). Differences in relative amount of protection in CRE-1 and CRE-2 can indicate changes in the balance of availability of the sites. In the native plasmid, there is protection throughout CRE-1 (native, Fig. 3 b). At the lowest concentration of protein, however, CRE-1 is not protected, but CRE-2 is (Fig. 3 b). This is consistent with the prediction that CRE-2 would be protected on the top strand in both linear duplex and cruciform (that is, all molecules) (Fig. 4, left side). CRE-1, in contrast, would be protected only in those molecules in which CREB protein stabilized the alternative (cruciform) binding site (Fig. 4, right side). Direct comparison of the native with each of the mutants shows that mutations affect protection of CRE-2 and CRE-1. Plasmid enk −98T shows little protection in CRE-1 as compared with the other plasmids (Fig.3 b), but at 1 μl (lowest amount of added protein) protection of CRE-2 is similar to the native (Fig. 3 b; see also Table I). Thus, this mutation, which adds another mismatched base pair near the hairpin loop (Fig.1 b), shifts the balance of protection toward the linear duplex site as compared with native. The plasmid enk −105G,−106A is modified in neither CRE, so that both linear duplex and hairpin binding sites are identical to the native (Fig. 1 b). Base changes upstream from CRE-1 (Fig. 1 b, left side) destabilize hairpin structure by shortening the stem (Fig. 1 b, right side). There is in enk −105G,−106A protection in CRE-1, so that a cruciform site is present. At the lowest concentration of protein there is greater protection throughout CRE-2, as compared with the native.Table IStrength of bands in DNase I protection assayBasenativeenk -98Tenk -105G–106Aenk -95Tenk -95ABase017.530017.530017.530017.530017.530−127275286 (1.04)268 (0.97)280 (1.02)372338 (0.91)361 (0.97)347 (0.94)159169 (1.06)157 (0.99)188 (1.18)295284 (0.96)263 (0.89)283 (0.96)309329 (1.06)303 (0.98)272 (0.88)−127−119691743 (1.08)690 (1.00)732 (1.06)946933 (0.99)965 (1.02)952 (1.01)744744 (1.00)759 (1.02)728 (0.98)13991280 (0.91)1399 (1.00)1369 (0.98)15481558 (1.01)1533 (0.99)1538 (0.99)−119−116154157 (1.02)157 (1.02)117 (0.76)219252 (1.15)212 (0.97)167 (0.76)175184 (1.05)163 (0.93)175 (1.00)338317 (0.94)297 (0.88)194 (0.57)385384 (1.00)347 (0.90)290 (0.75)−116−113196199 (1.02)204 (1.04)117 (0.60)261302 (1.16)274 (1.05)144 (0.55)291284 (0.98)207 (0.71)220 (0.76)414391 (0.94)327 (0.79)219 (0.53)428467 (1.09)342 (0.80)304 (0.71)−113−104149149 (1.00)203 (1.36)29 (0.19)189214 (1.13)316 (1.67)161 (0.85)155151 (0.97)78 (0.50)87 (0.56)198175 (0.88)135 (0.68)40 (0.20)238246 (1.03)171 (0.72)63 (0.26)−104−103362407 (1.12)489 (1.35)103 (0.28)456505 (1.11)720 (1.58)405 (0.89)845711 (0.84)220 (0.26)58 (0.07)532476 (0.89)362 (0.68)151 (0.28)683706 (1.03)533 (0.78)96 (0.14)−103−101373426 (1.14)414 (1.11)353 (0.95)489516 (1.06)694 (1.42)561 (1.15)347296 (0.85)257 (0.74)358 (1.03)556492 (0.88)428 (0.77)429 (0.77)627611 (0.97)633 (1.01)695 (1.03)−101−99251245 (0.98)173 (0.69)82 (0.33)190191 (1.01)188 (0.99)177 (0.93)583545 (0.93)630 (1.08)617 (1.06)367333 (0.91)305 (0.83)262 (0.71)412394 (0.96)293 (0.71)172 (0.42)−99−95432411 (0.95)52 (0.12)52 (0.12)305289 (0.95)67 (0.22)67 (0.22)438257 (0.59)39 (0.09)85 (0.19)578394 (0.68)121 (0.21)96 (0.17)492396 (0.80)103 (0.21)103 (0.21)−95−91558421 (0.75)61 (0.11)40 (0.07)651508 (0.78)78 (0.12)32 (0.05)557333 (0.60)56 (0.10)29 (0.05)14171072 (0.76)156 (0.11)72 (0.05)17501321 (0.75)179 (0.10)48 (0.03)−91−90308220 (0.71)37 (0.12)20 (0.07)369298 (0.81)62 (0.17)39 (0.11)338177 (0.52)27 (0.08)43 (0.13)452452 (1.00)50 (0.11)72 (0.16)500381 (0.76)80 (0.16)59 (0.12)−90−88213179 (0.84)68 (0.32)86 (0.40)376395 (1.05)109 (0.29)100 (0.27)286227 (0.79)74 (0.26)198 (0.69)641463 (0.72)224 (0.35)184 (0.29)768637 (0.83)247 (0.32)244 (0.32)−88−87367192 (0.52)33 (0.09)12 (0.03)343224 (0.65)41 (0.12)53 (0.15)262103 (0.39)18 (0.07)64 (0.24)120102 (0.85)35 (0.29)19 (0.16)375292 (0.79)79 (0.21)66 (0.18)−87−86130120 (0.92)25 (0.19)34 (0.26)214174 (0.81)62 (0.29)60 (0.28)156133 (0.85)39 (0.25)86 (0.55)184134 (0.73)39 (0.21)77 (0.42)266234 (0.88)89 (0.33)36 (0.14)−86−81587446 (0.76)117 (0.20)103 (0.18)683492 (0.72)157 (0.23)183 (0.27)505255 (0.50)91 (0.18)189 (0.37)660457 (0.69)198 (0.30)197 (0.30)807667 (0.83)235 (0.29)146 (0.18)−81−78584449 (0.77)222 (0.38)249 (0.42)745694 (0.93)313 (0.42)278 (0.37)628383 (0.61)226 (0.36)311 (0.50)824655 (0.79)404 (0.49)496 (0.60)992826 (0.83)440 (0.44)437 (0.44)−78 Open table in a new tab Both mutations at −95 (in plasmids enk −95T and enk −95A) enhance the transcriptional response (Fig. 2) and within synthetic enhancers can increase the stability of hairpin structures (17Gacy A.M.

(1996) The Role of DNA Hairpin Structure in the Regulation of Transcription and Replication. Ph.D. thesis, Mayo Graduate School.Google Scholar). Plasmids with each of these mutations show protection within CRE-2 that is similar to the native (compare 1 μl, Fig. 3 b, second lane, and Table I) but show greater protection in CRE-1 (which is protected only when protein is bound to the cruciform site) than the native (Fig.3 b, Table I, 7.5 μl). Thus, within the plasmids, the single change at −95 increases the availability of the hairpin binding site and increases the response to cAMP. This is consistent with previous observations that availability of the cruciform site correlates with enhanced expression (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc.

We considered the possibility that the loop mutants (enk −95T and enk −95A) might show different pattern of protection due to use of a different site. However, for these mutants, as for the native, binding depends on the presence of a functional CRE-2 (Fig.5). For gel shift analysis, probes were synthesized as 74-base oligos containing complementary proenkephalin sequence (−78 to −112) connected by a 4-T loop (Fig. 5 a). One oligonucleotide contained the mutations that abolish CRE-1 to force formation of a linear duplex (CRE-2-only) probe (enk subCRE1, Fig. 1 b, Fig. 5 a). One probe contained an insert of (TA)11T in the portion complementary to the 23-base pair palindrome to force hairpin formation and permit only the alternative binding site (forced hairpin, Fig. 5 a). Binding to four of the probes is similar, but elimination of CRE-2 abolishes binding (Fig. 5 b, enk −95A/−88C,−89A), consistent with what is seen in enk −88C,−89A plasmid (Fig.3 a). Protection in CRE-1 on the top strand indicates presence of the cruciform enhancer (Fig. 4, right side), and change in shape of the top strand footprint is direct evidence that the mutations affect enhancer structure (Fig. 3 b). Protection along the bottom strand provides additional evidence about structural switching. Bottom strand protection (Fig. 6) is a result of CREB's binding to molecules with the linear duplex enhancer (Fig. 4, left side). Protection of the bottom strand is limited to CRE-2 in native as well as in hyporesponsive (enk −98T) or hyperresponsive (enk −95A) mutants (Fig. 6). This is consistent with bottom strand protection resulting only from binding to the linear duplex site (Fig. 4, left side) and with the formation of the cruciform site from sequences on the top strand only (Fig. 4,right side). Stabilizing cruciform (enk −95A) or destabilizing cruciform (enk −98T) changes the shape of the top strand but not of the bottom strand footprint. Thus, in these plasmids, two distinct, double-stranded binding sites can be detected, one in the linear duplex and the other within a cruciform. Changing the relative availability of the sites by mutation modifies transcriptional response. In the brain, transcriptional control of the proenkephalin gene depends on CREB interaction with CRE-1 and CRE-2 (8Konradi C. Kobierski L.A. Nguyen T.V. Heckers S. Hyman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the kinetics of the transcriptional response of these two genes differ in the same tissue and in response to the same stimulus (22Douglass J. Grimes L. Shook J. Lee P.H.K. Hong J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After systemic administration of the excitatory amino acid kainic acid, prodynorphin mRNA levels in hippocampus rise rapidly, reaching a maximum at 3 h; in contrast, proenkephalin mRNA increases more gradually up to 24 h (22Douglass J. Grimes L. Shook J. Lee P.H.K. Hong J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The structure of the palindromic enhancer in the proenkephalin gene may account for differences in transcriptional response. We have probed structural changes in mutant and native proenkephalin-CAT plasmids by DNase I digestion of plasmid-CREB complexes and have analyzed the transcriptional response by transient transfection. The four plasmids analyzed for relative availability of the two sites (Fig. 3 b, Table I) were designed to be as close to the native as possible, and these mutants showed protection in the region of the CREs only slightly different from the native. The changes, however, correlated with altered transcriptional response. Increase in the ratio of availability of the hairpin over the linear duplex site (when compared with the native plasmid) correlates with greater than normal response to forskolin (enk −95T and enk −95A, Figs. 2 and 3 b, Table I). Conversely, reducing the hairpin over linear duplex site ratio correlates with lower than normal response to forskolin. The mutant enk −105G,−106A shows very strong protection in CRE-2, but protection is apparent in CRE-1 as well. For the mutant enk −98T there is little protection detected in CRE-1 even at the highest amount of protein (Figs. 2 and 3 b, Table I). Although the hyporesponsive plasmids (enk −98T and enk −105G,−106A) can respond to forskolin, their response is reduced compared with the native (Fig. 2). Both sites, with bound proteins, may enhance transcription in response to second messengers but at different efficiencies. In vivo analysis of the actively transcribed proenkephalin gene has shown that only the cruciform site is detected during active transcription in C6 glioma cells (6Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus factors other than CREB protein must be available to provide energy and stabilize the hairpin site, so that hairpin formation is greatly favored over linear duplex (Figs. 1 a and 4, right side would be favored). Affinity and gel shift analysis of nuclear extracts show that hairpin probes bind sequence and structure-specific factors not bound by linear duplex probes.2 The loop mutations described above (enk −95T and enk −95A) allow a DNA-directed shift toward availability of the hairpin site, and these mutations greatly enhance the receptor response (Fig. 2). The effect of the loop mutations indicates that both sites must be used for proper regulation of transcription. CRE-1 alone cannot independently bind transcription factors, and even several copies of CRE-1 cannot respond to receptor signals (23Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but CRE-1 is an essential part of the high activity binding site created by the alternative structure. Furthermore, response to CREB depends on the presence of CRE-1 (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have previously hypothesized (3Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structure may, however, affect transcription in other ways as well. We have demonstrated that by mutation the availability of the sites and the transcriptional response can be altered. Binding of CREB protein by itself does not account for the properties of the two sites within the palindromic region. The DNA may play an allosteric role: orientation of bound transcription factors would be different at the two sites. Polarity has previously been shown to alter selection of co-factors and, as a consequence, the direction of transcriptional response mediated by nuclear receptors (24Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, the cruciform may create new binding sites. Binding of factors to these sites could stabilize the cruciform and/or contribute to recruiting and stabilizing transcriptional machinery. Footprint analysis with nuclear extracts indicates that the pattern of protection distant from the CRE is modified by mutation or competitors for binding at the CREs. 2C. Spiro, M. Ruan, and C. T. McMurray, unpublished observations. This is consistent with the structure of the binding sites playing a critical role in assembly of the transcriptional complex. The data presented here demonstrate that DNA structure plays a regulatory role in gene expression. Two distinct sites are formed by structural switching within the same 23-base pair region, and both must be used for proper transcriptional regulation of the proenkephalin gene. We thank Dr. A. M. Gacy for critical discussion throughout the study; J. Z. Yao and Dr. X. Wu for purified protein; and Dr. Y. Bao and J. Collins-Hicok for preparing the proenkephalin-CAT mutants."

The gene is composed of 12 coding exons and 11 introns and spans more than 30 kilobases. The number and distribution of exons and introns differ from those reported for other human cysteine proteinases, indicating that these genes are only distantly related. Nucleotide sequence analysis of about 1.2 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene revealed a high GC content, a ratio of CpG/GpC close to unity, and the absence of consensus transcriptional sequences such as TATA box or CCAAT box. All these features are characteristic of housekeeping genes and provide an explanation for the widespread expression of bleomycin hydrolase in human tissues. The 5′-flanking region of the gene also contains a polymorphic CCG trinucleotide repeat that may be a target of genetic instability events and affect its transcriptional activity. Chromosomal localization of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene revealed that it maps to chromosome 17q11.2, very close to the locus of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene.

Finally, Southern blot analysis of DNA from leukocytes and autologous breast tumors has shown that the bleomycin hydrolase gene is not a frequent target of amplification in human breast carcinomas. Bleomycin is a glycopeptide produced by Streptomyces verticillus that is clinically used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of human malignancies because of its ability to cleave double-stranded DNA (1Carter S.K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, a general utilization of bleomycins in cancer therapy is limited by the finding of both pulmonary toxicity and resistance of certain tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of these compounds (3Lazo J.S. Hoyt D.G. Sebti S.M. Pitt B.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Hamilton R.F. Li L. Felder T.B. Holian A. Am. J.

Anticancer Drug Resistance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 267-279Google Scholar). Different mechanisms including reduced bleomycin uptake, increased metabolic drug inactivation, or enhanced DNA repair activity have been proposed to explain why certain tumors are refractory to therapy by these antibiotics. However, the finding in animal tissues of an enzymatic activity capable of hydrolyzing the amide bond of bleomycin to render an inactive metabolite strongly suggested that drug inactivation could play a major role in the tumor resistance to these compounds (7Umezawa H. Hori S. Tsutomu S. Yoshioka T. Takeuchi T.A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1974; 27: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In recent years, studies from different groups have contributed to elucidate structural and functional characteristics of this bleomycin inactivating enzyme, which has been designated bleomycin hydrolase. Thus, biochemical characterization of the enzyme purified from rabbit tissues has revealed that this enzyme is a cysteine proteinase sensitive to cysteine proteinase-specific inhibitors like E-64 (8Nishimura C.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6544-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More recently, we have reported the molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of a cDNA coding for human bleomycin hydrolase (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 455 amino acids that contains all of the structural features characteristic of cysteine proteinases and displays a significant sequence similarity to different yeast and bacterial proteins. These proteins, called yeast bleomycin hydrolase and bacterial aminopeptidases C, have about 35–40% identities with the human enzyme and also possess proteolytic activity (12Kambouris N. Burke D.J.

Biochem. 1994; 224: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conservation of this gene from bacteria to mammals points to an important although as yet undefined function for this protein. Consistent with this proposal, human bleomycin hydrolase is expressed in all examined tissues, suggesting that besides its highly specific role in the degradation of antitumor antibiotics, this enzyme may play a housekeeping role in human tissues as a protease involved in normal cellular protein turnover (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brömme D. Rossi A.B. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6706-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In fact, biochemical characterization of the recombinant human bleomycin hydrolase has confirmed that it acts as an aminopeptidase with a relatively broad substrate specificity (18Brömme D. Rossi A.B. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6706-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, in addition to this role of bleomycin hydrolase as a peptidase, it has been recently reported that the yeast bleomycin hydrolase also has DNA binding activity and acts as a repressor in the GAL4 regulatory system (19Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Joshua-Tor L. Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. Rees D.C. Science. 1995; 269: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results provide additional interest to the functional analysis of this enzyme. Preliminary analysis of bleomycin hydrolase expression in different human tumors has shown increased levels in some head and neck carcinomas when compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). We have also observed a variable degree of bleomycin hydrolase expression in different types of lymphoma, with low or undetectable levels in Hodgkin's disease samples and higher levels in Burkitt's lymphomas that are refractory to bleomycin treatment (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a proposed role for human bleomycin hydrolase in the resistance of some tumors to bleomycin chemotherapy. In fact, overexpression of yeast bleomycin hydrolase induced resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to the antibiotic effect of bleomycin (21Pei Z. Calmels T.P.G. Creutz C.E. Sebti S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 676-681PubMed Google Scholar). According to these data, it seems that mechanisms controlling bleomycin hydrolase expression may be altered in human malignancies. As a previous step to elucidate these regulatory mechanisms and to further evaluate the relationship of this human gene to its bacterial and yeast homologues, we have undertaken studies directed to identify and characterize the human bleomycin hydrolase gene. In this work, we describe the isolation and characterization of genomic clones coding for this cysteine proteinase. We have also analyzed the promoter region of the bleomycin hydrolase gene with the finding of different motifs that could modulate its transcription. In addition, we have established that this gene maps at 17q11.2, close to the locus of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene (22Cawthon R.M. Weiss R. Xu G. Viskochil D. Culver M. Stevens J.

Finally, we have examined the possibility that the human bleomycin hydrolase gene can be part of an amplicon recently described in this region of the human genome. Human P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) 1The abbreviations used are: PAC, P1 artificial chromosome; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; bp, base pair(s); FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) genomic libraries were supplied by the Human Genome Mapping Resource Center (Cambridgeshire, UK). Restriction endonucleases and other reagents used for molecular cloning were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a commercial random priming kit purchased from Amersham (Amersham, UK). Human PAC and YAC libraries were hybridized at 65 °C in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7), 1% SDS, 0.5% dried milk, and 6% polyethylene glycol 8000, with a full-length cDNA for human bleomycin hydrolase (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Posthybridization washes were performed in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Finally, the membranes were exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Four PAC and three YAC positive clones were identified and characterized by endonuclease restriction and by PCR amplification and pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis, respectively. DNA fragments were inserted in the polylinker region of pBlueScript (Stratagene) and M13 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Computer analysis of DNA sequences was performed with the GCG software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (24Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The junctions between exons and introns and the size of the introns of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene were determined by restriction analysis of the PAC clones followed by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. The primer pairs used contained sequences from opposite strands of two putative neighboring exons of the cDNA. PCR conditions included 250 μm dNTP, 150 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of the expand long Taq DNA polymerase mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) in the XL PCR buffer. The PCR amplification was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Each cycle consisted of a 15-s denaturation at 94 °C, 15 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 30 s to 10 min of extension at 68 °C. Each PCR fragment was subcloned in the EcoRV site of the pBlueScript polylinker and sequenced. These sequences were compared with the human bleomycin hydrolase cDNA to identify the coding sequences and the intron-exon boundaries. Fluorescent in situhybridization (FISH) was carried out using as probes DNAs prepared from the isolated PAC and YAC DNA by standard procedures. Then, 2 μg of the PAC or of the yeast genomic DNA were nick translated with biotin-16-dUTP, whereas the centromeric probe DZ17 was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim). Both probes were hybridized to normal male metaphase chromosomes as described (25Pendás A.M. Matilla T. Urı́a J.A. Freije J.P. Fueyo A. Estivill X. López-Otı́n C. Cytogenet.

Cell Genet. 1994; 67: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Chromosome slides were stained with diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, and the images were captured in a Zeiss fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics). Two oligonucleotides (5′-GACGGCGCTGACTCAGCAACG-3′) and (5′-GGTAACGGTAGCTTCCAGGGTC-3′) flanking a trinucleotide repeat present in the human bleomycin hydrolase gene were employed to PCR amplify this region in 10 unrelated genomic DNAs from healthy donors. PCR was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermal cycler using 200 ng of genomic DNA, 200 μmeach dNTPs, 50 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in 1 × standard buffer. PCR conditions were: 25 s at 96 °C, 15 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with a commercial silver staining kit (Promega) and photographed. High molecular DNA from YAC 947G11 was digested with several rare restriction enzymes (Boehringer Mannheim) and electrophoresed in a CHEF gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Agarose gels were blotted to Hybond-N+ and hybridized to random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes from bleomycin hydrolase and NF1 genes. Blots were washed at high stringency and autoradiographed at −70 °C. DNA was extracted from tumor tissue and blood leukocytes according to standard procedures. 10 μg of TaqI-restricted DNA was separated by electrophoresis in agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ filters. The filters were hybridized with nick-translated 32P-labeled probes, washed, and autoradiographed at −70 °C for an appropriate period. Restriction enzyme-digested tumor DNAs were compared with matching leukocyte DNA in the same agarose gels. Blots of these gels were hybridized with the bleomycin hydrolase probe and with a mos protooncogene probe (ATCC number 41004) as a control. The autoradiographs were scored by densitometry. Gene amplification was defined as two or more gene copies per haploid genome. To identify the gene coding for human bleomycin hydrolase, a PAC genomic library was screened with the full-length cDNA for this enzyme (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Four positive PAC clones were identified on the basis of their positive hybridization with the probe. After a preliminary restriction pattern analysis of the PAC DNA clones, followed by Southern blot analysis using two probes from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the bleomycin hydrolase cDNA, one of the four isolated clones hybridized with both probes, suggesting that it was the only one that could encompass the entire human gene. This PAC clone, called 88O23 and spanning more than 100 kilobases of human genomic sequence, was used for all subsequent analysis. To determine the exon-intron organization of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene, we designed a series of primers derived from separated regions of the cDNA sequence. These primers were used for PCR amplification of total DNA from the isolated PAC clone or of selected fragments subcloned from this genomic clone. After nucleotide sequencing of the restriction fragments and of the amplified products and comparison with the previously reported cDNA sequence (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brömme D. Rossi A.B. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6706-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we concluded that the human bleomycin hydrolase gene is composed of 12 exons and 11 introns (Fig.1). The position and size of exons and introns, the sequences of the exon-intron junctions, and the intron phases are indicated in Table I. The size of the exons ranges from 68 (exon 9) to 638 bp (exon 12, which also contains the 3′-untranslated region). The size of the introns was determined either by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR amplified products using specific primers contained in consecutive exons,or by Southern blot analysis using specific probes for the two exons flanking the analyzed introns. According to the results obtained by following both approaches, the intron sizes in the bleomycin hydrolase gene range from 125 (intron 8) to > 8,500 bp (intron 10). It is noteworthy that phase 0, 1, and 2 introns were found, with a clear predominance (6 of 11) of phase 0 introns. In addition, it should be noted that all these intervening sequences conform perfectly to the canonical acceptor and donor splice sites described by Mount (27Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar) (Table I).Table IExon-intron junction in the human bleomycin hydrolase geneNumberExon-intron junctionExon sizeIntron sizeAGCAGCTCGGgtgaggtgcc≈1000SSSG2ctcccaacagGACTGAATTCGAAGAGCTCAGgtgtgggctt198≈2500LNSKSSG3cttgtttcagGGCGATGCTGGTGGGACAAG gtatgggaca110≈1700RCWWDK4tactctttagGTTGAACGCAATATTGTTGgtaaaagttc142≈1000VERNIVE5tttcttttagAAAAATATGGTAATCACAAG gtacaatata89≈1500KYGNHK6tctgtcatagATGAGAGAAATGGAGGAG gtaataacaa93>8000MREMEE7gctcttccagATATTCCGAGAAGATAAG gttggtgaat156≈1500IFREDK8atcttgatagATTTGTTTAGATGGAGAG gttggtattg159≈125ICLDGE9ctgtttctagGCTGTGTGGGACATGAATCTgtgagtgcag68≈1200AVWDMNL10ctttttacagCTATGACCATTCAGAGAAG gtatgaccct118>7000YDHSEK11ttttttgcagGATGATCAGGGCCACAAAGgtgagctcag70>8500DDQGHKG12ttttctccagGTTACCTGTGC638YLC Open table in a new tab The number and distribution of exons and introns in the bleomycin hydrolase gene differ from those reported for other human cysteine proteinases belonging to the papain superfamily, such as cathepsins B, L, S, C, and K. Thus, the number of coding exons identified in the bleomycin hydrolase gene is higher than the number present in the coding sequences of the different human cathepsins so far analyzed: 9 in cathepsin B, 7 in cathepsins L, K, and S, and 2 in cathepsin C (28Gong Q.

Unlike all these lysosomal cathepsins, which contain clearly defined prepeptide, propeptide, and mature enzyme domains, bleomycin hydrolase is a cytosolic protein that does not have a modular structure, thus hampering the assignation of the different exons to hypothetical functional units. Nevertheless, the occurrence in bleomycin hydrolase of conserved regions around the cysteine, histidine, and asparagine residues that are essential for the catalytic properties of these enzymes allowed us a comparative study of the exon-intron junctions at these regions. In this regard, it is of interest that a common feature in the gene structures of human cathepsins is that the conserved region (SGRCW) around the cysteinyl active site is located adjacent to an exon-intron junction. In cathepsin B this junction is located immediately after the conserved sequence, whereas in cathepsins L, K, and S, it is located immediately before the conserved sequence. In contrast, in the bleomycin hydrolase gene, this active site sequence is interrupted by an intron. On the other hand, the regions containing the histidine and asparagine residues proposed to be essential in the catalytic processes are encoded within the same exon in all cathepsins. In contrast, these sequences are codified by separate exons in the bleomycin hydrolase gene (Fig. 1). In summary, these marked differences in both number and distribution of introns between the gene for bleomycin hydrolase and those encoding other cysteine proteinases, support the proposal that these molecules are only distantly related from an evolutionary point of view (34Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The human bleomycin hydrolase gene is widely expressed by normal tissues, which is consistent with a proposed role for this proteolytic enzyme in the normal protein catabolism occurring in all cell types (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brömme D. Rossi A.B. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6706-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the expression of this gene is increased in a series of tumor conditions including some head and neck carcinomas and lymphomas, thus contributing to explain why some of these tumors may become refractory to chemotherapeutic treatment with bleomycins (11Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several groups have reported a diminished expression of this gene in lung tissue, which could be the cause of the high pulmonary toxicity of this antineoplastic drug (1Carter S.K. Sikic B.Y. Rozencweig M. Carter S.K. Bleomycin Chemotherapy. Academic Press, New York1985: 3-35Crossref Google Scholar, 2Mir L.M. Tounekti O. Orlowski S. Gen.

As an initial attempt to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of this gene, we performed a structural analysis of its promoter region, searching for sequence motifs that could explain its wide expression pattern in human tissues. Simultaneously, we also looked for putative regulatory motifs that could affect the bleomycin hydrolase gene transcription in pathological conditions. For these purposes, we cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a genomic fragment comprising about 1.2 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 22;0. Nucleotide sequence comparison of the identified sequence with those present in data bases did not show significant homology with any of them. Further analysis of this 5′-flanking region revealed that consensus transcriptional sequences such as TATA box or CCAAT box are absent in the human bleomycin hydrolase gene. Because it is well established that eukaryotic promoters lacking these elements are usually found in housekeeping genes, their absence in the human bleomycin hydrolase gene should be consistent with its widespread expression in human tissues. Further support for this proposal was provided by analysis of the GC content and the ratio of CpG/GpC in the 650-bp sequence upstream of the start codon. As can be deduced from Fig. 2, the percentage of GC in this 5′-flanking region is 75%, whereas the ratio of CpG/GpC dinucleotides in the same region is close to unity. Because both high GC content and lack of CpG suppression are common features in promoter regions of constitutively expressed genes (35Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), their occurrence in the bleomycin hydrolase gene is again compatible with its ubiquitous expression pattern. However, despite the fact that all of these genomic features are characteristic of a weakly regulated gene, the expression of the bleomycin hydrolase gene appears to be regulated at least in some pathological circumstances. Consequently, we performed an additional analysis of its 5′-flanking region looking for putative elements that could be relevant in a regulated expression of the gene. Interestingly, a perfect match with the AP-1 consensus site (TGACTCA) is found 224 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. This motif is recognized by members of the c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF-1 families of transcription factors and has been found to mediate induction of different genes by a variety of tumor promoters, cytokines, and growth factors (36Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). The promoter sequence also contains several consensus sequences for Sp1 binding, as well as AP-2, PEA-3, NFE-1, and H4TF-1 sites. Functional analysis of these sequences will be required to elucidate its potential role in the altered expression of the bleomycin hydrolase gene in some pathological conditions. Finally, it is worthy to note the presence of a CCG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′-flanking region of the human bleomycin hydrolase gene (Fig.3 A). These repeated sequences are characterized by their high genetic instability causing an increasing number of human diseases (37Paulson H.L. Fischbeck K.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 38Ashley C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 703-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In fact, more than 10 neurological and neuromuscular disorders associated to expansion of trinucleotide repeats have been discovered in the past years. In two of these diseases, Fragile X syndromes FRAXA and FRAXE, the CGG or CCG trinucleotide repeats are located in the 5′-untranslated region of two genes called FMR1 and FMR2, respectively (39Verkerk A.J.M.H.

Genet. 1996; 13: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism of these diseases seems to be an increased methylation of both the expanded repeats and adjacent CpG islands, leading to transcriptional silencing of the gene. The finding of a CCG repeat in the 5′-untranslated region of the human bleomycin hydrolase, which is also located immediately adjacent to a CpG island, makes it a candidate for undergoing genetic instability. To evaluate the possible occurrence of polymorphism in this sequence, we performed a PCR-based amplification of this region in genomic DNA obtained from 10 unrelated healthy donors. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, these studies revealed that the trinucleotide repeat identified in the 5′-flanking region of the bleomycin hydrolase gene is polymorphic, with at least two different alleles"
https://openalex.org/W2004057392,"We identified a novel gene encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatase using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Northern blot hybridization of RNAs from various tissues with the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment showed that this gene was expressed exclusively in the testis. Complementary DNAs for this gene, termed typ (testis-specific tyrosine phosphatase), were obtained from a mouse testis cDNA library. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNAs revealed an open reading frame that encoded 426 amino acids. The predicted Typ protein contained a single catalytic domain at the carboxyl-terminal half. No hydrophobic stretch for a possible transmembrane sequence or signal sequence was found, suggesting that Typ is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The amino-terminal half of Typ did not share significant homologies with the other known proteins but contained a region rich in PEST residues. Indirect immunofluorescence studies and in situ hybridization analysis showed that Typ was specifically expressed in testicular germ cells that underwent meiosis. Developmentally, Typ was detected between 2 and 3 weeks after birth, in parallel with the onset of meiosis. Thus, Typ is a new member of the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatases that may play an important role(s) in spermatogenesis and/or meiosis.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the important regulatory events in cell growth, activation, and differentiation (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins are regulated by the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; AS, antisense. 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; AS, antisense. In contrast to the extensive information available on the protein-tyrosine kinases, that on the biological roles of PTPs is limited. PTPs have been classified into two subfamilies, receptor-type PTPs and nonreceptor-type PTPs, based on the presence or absence of the extracellular and transmembrane portions. Each nonreceptor-type PTP ordinarily comprises a single PTP domain and a variable length of noncatalytic segment. Some nonreceptor-type PTPs show dual specificity for both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (2Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 3Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 4Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PTP domain consists of approximately 240 amino acids carrying several consensus motifs including a sequence (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G (X can be any amino acid). The cysteine residue within the motif is involved in the formation of the catalytic core of the enzyme (5Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the consensus sequences, a number of cDNAs encoding PTPs have been identified using both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and low stringency hybridization methods. In mammals, spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous tubule in which mitotic division of spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and differentiation of spermatid to sperm occurs. Spermatogenesis is an apparently essential step in sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms by which differentiation of germ cells is regulated are not well understood. Recently, several genes have been reported to be expressed specifically before or at meiosis. These include the genes for protein-tyrosine kinases (c-Abl, c-Kit, and FerT) (6Iwaoki Y. Matsuda H.

Cell. 1992; 69: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because of the putative regulatory function of the protein kinases and phosphatases, these proteins are thought to contribute to germ cell differentiation. Indeed, c-Kit is directly involved in the mitotic cell cycle of spermatogonia (9Yoshinaga K. Nishikawa S. Ogawa M. Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Fujimoto T. Nishikawa S. Development. 1991; 113: 689-699PubMed Google Scholar), and the dual-specific phosphatase Twine is expressed specifically in germ cells and is suggested to be important in male meiosis in Drosophila (17Alphey L. Jimenez J. White C.H. Dawson I. Nurse P. Glover D.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here we report identification of the typ gene that encodes a novel cytoplasmic PTP. The typ gene is expressed specifically in spermatocytes that are under meiosis, suggesting an important role of the Typ protein in spermatogenesis. For the cDNA synthesis and PCR, oligonucleotide primers were designed from conserved regions within the PTP domain. A primer for first-strand cDNA synthesis corresponded to the amino acid sequence QT(E/D/A)Q (primer 1, 5′-(A/T) (A/G)(C/T)TG(C/G/T)(G/T)CX(G/T)(A/C/G)(C/G/T)GT(C/T)TG-3′), and primers for PCR corresponded to DYINA (primer 2 (sense), 5′-ATGAAGCTTGA(C/T)TA(C/T)AT(C/T)AA(C/T)GC-3′) and to HCSAG (primer 3 (antisense), 5′-CATGAATTC(A/G/T)GCACTGCA (A/G)TG-3′), where X is a mixture of A, C, G, and T in oligonucleotide sequences. Primer 2 and primer 3 contained restriction sites for HindIII and EcoRI (underlined), respectively. Total RNA was isolated from human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB453 and human embryo fibroblast cell line TIG1 using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform (AGPC) method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63142) Google Scholar). The cDNA was synthesized with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and primer 1. PCRs were performed for 50 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. At the end of the reaction, the samples were incubated at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products of the expected size (∼420 base pairs) were purified through 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pUC119 vector for sequence analysis. The pUC119 vector DNAs were ligated with the RT-PCR products amplified using RNAs from MDA-MB453 cells, and the resulting plasmids were transfected into Escherichia coli JM109. Colonies were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and colony hybridization of the filters was performed using a mixture of 32P-labeled PCR fragments corresponding to B-PTP2 (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar), PTP-MEG (20Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 737-740PubMed Google Scholar) as probes. Hybridization was performed in a stringent condition as described (23Semba K. Kamata N. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). A Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot, Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot II, and Human Fetal Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) were hybridized to the 32P-labeled human typ PCR fragment using the hybridization and washing conditions recommended by the supplier. Samples of total RNAs isolated from adult mice tissues were loaded on each lane (20 μg/lane) of 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and blotted overnight onto Hybond-N membrane filters (Amersham). The filters were hybridized to the32P-labeled human typ PCR fragment or the cDNA insert of clone 5 (see Fig. 2 A) using the previously described hybridization and washing procedures (24Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method (46Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52597) Google Scholar) using the BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit (Takara). The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were subjected to a homology search with GenBankTM and Protein Information Resource data bases using BLAST and FASTA programs. A mouse testis cDNA library was constructed with oligo(dT)12–18primer (TimeSaver™ cDNA synthesis kit, Pharmacia) in the LAMDA ZAP II cloning vector (Stratagene) using poly(A)+RNA prepared from 8–12-week-old mice testes. The library was screened with standard protocols of plaque hybridization using32P-labeled human typ PCR fragment as a probe. Hybridization of the filters representing 1 × 106 plaques was performed at low stringency condition as described (23Semba K. Kamata N. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA inserts of positive clones were excised and partially sequenced using an antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponding to amino acid sequence WPDHGT (5′-AGTGCCATGGTCTGGCCA-3′), a highly conserved sequence in the PTP domain. Amino acid sequences of residues 51–164, 165–285, and 168–427 of the predicted Typ protein were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GST-TypN1, GST-TypC1, and GST-TypPTP, respectively). For construction of plasmids encoding GST-TypN1, GST-TypC1, and GST-TypPTP, the blunted EcoRI-EcoRV fragment encompassing nucleotides 365–709, EcoRV-EcoRI fragment encompassing nucleotides 710–1071 and blunted EcoRV-XhoI fragment encompassing nucleotides 710–1525 were ligated to the SmaI-digested pGEX-3X vector, SmaI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX-3X vector, and SmaI-digested pGEX-5X vector (Pharmacia), respectively. For protein expression, these constructs and empty pGEX-5X vector were transformed into the E. coli JM109. The GST-Typ fusion proteins and GST protein made in E. coli were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (25Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant proteins were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), an aliquot of each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The amount of protein in the gel was estimated by comparing the stained band with that of a molecular weight marker (SDS-PAGE standard low range; Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the GST-TypN1 or GST-TypC1 protein. Affinity-purified anti-Typ antibodies were prepared from the crude anti-GST-TypN1 or anti-GST-TypC1 antiserum by use of affinity columns and the purified antibodies termed anti-TypN1 and anti-TypC1, respectively. To construct a typ expression plasmid, pME-Typ, the typ cDNA insert of clone 5 (HindIII-XhoI) was recloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, pME18S (Ref. 26Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 90: 5404-5408Google Scholar; a gift from K Maruyama, Tokyo Medical and Dental University). An amino-terminal-deleted Typ expression plasmid, pME-Flag-4M, contains the typ cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 98–426 tagged with FLAG epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) at the amino terminus. Expression plasmids with mutations at the ATG or CTG codon of typ (pME-Typ1MA, pME-Typ2MS, pME-Typ3MV, pME-Typ4ML, pMETyp1LV, and pME-Typ2LA) were made from pME-Typ by site-directed mutagenesis (27Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Introduction of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each plasmid DNA was transfected into human 293T kidney cells by the calcium phosphate method. 293T cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and aprotinine (50 units/ml) after 48 h of transfection. Cell lysates of the testis, ovary, and brain were prepared by using the same lysis buffer. Samples of 25 μg of proteins from the lysate of 293T cells and 100 μg of proteins from the lysate of mouse tissues were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The filters were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (24Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sense strand of the insert of clone 5 was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). The proteins encoded by the insert were translated in vitro in the presence of l-[35S]methionine by using the wheat germ cell extract (Promega). The catalytic activity of GST-TypPTP was assayed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate (24Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Gu M. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The glutathione beads capturing 0.25–3 μg of GST-TypPTP or GST were subjected to the reaction. Three DNA fragments (fragments 1–3, see below) were prepared from the cDNA insert of clone 5 (see Fig.2 A) by PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript II sk(−) vector. The resulting plasmid DNAs were linearized with appropriate enzymes and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). The transcripts from fragment 1 (nucleotide position 21–709 of typ), fragment 2 (position 218–709), and fragment 3 (position 710–1071) were used as antisense probes (antisense (AS)-probe 1, AS-probe 2, and AS-probe 3, respectively). Fragment 1 was also subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+), linearized, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a sense RNA probe. The RNA probes were labeled using the digoxigenin RNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following manufacturer's protocol. Testis samples of 8-week-old mice were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Miles) and frozen. The frozen sections (5–8 μm) were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde freshly prepared in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. They were then treated with 0.2 m HCl and acetylated with 0.1 mtriethanolamine containing 0.25% acetic anhydride. After washes in PBS, sections were dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes. The hybridization solution contained 50% formamide, 10 mmTris, pH 7.6, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 600 mm NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 μg/ml tRNA, and 5 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. Hybridization solution (80 μl) was placed on each section and incubated at 50 °C in a moist chamber. After a 16-h incubation, sections were washed in a solution containing 50% formamide and 2 × SSC (20 × SSC = 3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate) at 65 °C for 30 min, treated with RNase-A (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed again in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 60 min. The hybridization signals were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) by adding the substrate for alkaline phosphatase TNBT (Sigma). Testis sections were cut and fixed as described above and permeabilized by incubation at room temperature with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The permeabilized sections were treated with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V from Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Then the sections were incubated for 2.5 h with the anti-TypN1 and anti-TypC1 antibodies in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 at room temperature. As a control staining, anti-TypN1 antibody in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 were pre-incubated with GST-TypN1 (see Fig. 7 B). After being washed three times with PBS for 15 min, the sections were incubated for 1 h with the second immune reagent, FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. For localization of chromosomes, DNAs were stained with propidium iodide. Samples were observed using laser scanning microscopes (Zeiss and Bio-Rad). To identify novel PTPs, we employed the RT-PCR-based cloning procedure. Complementary DNAs were synthesized by RT of mRNAs prepared from MDA-MB453 cells and TIG1 cells. The RT reaction was primed with a degenerate primer (primer 1) designed from amino acid sequence QRE(A/E/D)Q, which was conserved among PTPs. The PCRs were performed using the cDNA and degenerate primers corresponding to other conserved regions in PTPs (primers 2 and 3 corresponding to DYINA and HCSA, respectively). The PCR products were subcloned into the pUC119 vector. Nucleotide sequencing of the inserts of the resulting 28 clones revealed that most of them encoded amino acid sequences corresponding to previously reported sequences of B-PTP2 (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar), PTP-MEG (20Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), DEP-1 (21Kuramochi S. Matsuda S. Matsuda Y. Saitoh T. Ohsugi M. Yamamoto T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and LAR (22Adachi M. Sekiya M. Arimura Y. Takekawa M. Itoh F. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 737-740PubMed Google Scholar). Some cDNA clones did not contain PTP consensus sequences. To identify clones that represent minor PCR products encoding novel PTPs, we employed a “negative selection” screening method. About 1,200E. coli clones carrying the PCR products were analyzed by colony hybridization with probes of a mixture of the32P-labeled PCR products containing sequences for B-PTP2, PTP-MEG, DEP-1, and LAR. Consequently, eight colonies gave negative or weak signals. DNA sequence analysis of the eight clones revealed that one clone had an insert encoding a novel PTP. The other clones contained sequences corresponding to known PTPs or sequences that did not share any homology to PTPs. Northern hybridization of RNAs from adult human tissues was carried out with the 32P-labeled PCR fragment encoding the novel PTP. Atyp RNA transcript of about 3.2-kilobases was detected exclusively in the testis (Fig.1 A). The transcript of this gene was not detected in fetal human tissues (brain, lung, liver, and kidney) nor in human cell lines examined, including MDA-MB453. Thus, we designated this novel PTP gene typ (testis-specific tyrosine phosphatase). Since the typ clone was obtained by RT-PCR amplification using mRNAs from MDA-MB453 cells, we assumed that the typ gene was expressed at very low levels in the cells. To clone the full-length cDNA of the typ gene, we constructed a cDNA library from mouse testis mRNAs. The library was screened with the human typ probe under conditions of reduced stringency. By screening 1×106 independent clones, nine positive clones were obtained. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the inserts of eight clones were overlapping, suggesting that they were derived from the same mRNA species (Fig.2 A). One remaining clone had a sequence for a putative mouse homologue of PTP-MEG (23Semba K. Kamata N. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This clone might have been selected by cross-hybridization because the screening was carried out under the low stringent condition. A composite sequence of 3,090 nucleotides constructed from the inserts of four clones, clones 2, 5, 6, and 8, contained the largest open reading frame of 426 amino acid residues. The coding frame began with a consensus-initiating methionine codon at position 218 that was preceded by five in-frame stop codons (Fig. 2 B). We tentatively concluded that the open reading frame encoded the mouse Typ protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis also revealed that the cDNA insert of clone 2 contained internal 441-base pair deletions in the coding region compared with the insert of the other clones. This resulted in the precise deletion of 147 amino acid residues (amino acids 168–314) in the predicted sequence. Therefore, the downstream coding frame was not affected. We then performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNAs extracted from mouse testis. Two pairs of oligonucleotide primers that flanked the deletion were utilized. Both sets of primers failed to amplify the fragment corresponding to the insert of clone 2 but was able to amplify the DNAs corresponding to the other cDNA clones. This suggested that the deletion was an artifact that occurred during the library construction. However, the possibility that the clone 2 cDNA was derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA species, which was expressed in very low abundance, cannot be excluded. The nucleotide sequence of the mouse typ cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence showed 74.8 and 84.1% identity, respectively, with the corresponding sequences of human typ.The similarities between human and mouse were relatively low when compared with those of the other PTPs. For example, predicted amino acid sequences of mouse SHP2 (29Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and the fist PTP domain of mouse PTPδ (30Mizuno K. Hasegawa K. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Ichikawa T. Yakura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5513-5523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are 99.6 and 96.3% identical with the corresponding sequences of their human homologues, respectively (31Freeman R.J. Plutzky J. Neel B.G.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are less homologous to each other (∼78% identity) even in their catalytic domains (37Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande W.G. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 38Watson R. Oskarsson M. Vande W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4078-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We then examined the expression pattern of mouse typ and compared it with that of human typ. RNAs were extracted from adult mouse tissues and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization under stringent conditions. Using the32P-labeled cDNA insert of clone 5 as a probe,typ mRNA of 3.2 kilobases, the same size as that detected in human testis, was detected only in testis among seven tissues examined (Fig. 1 B). The same result was obtained when the blot was probed with the human typ PCR fragment under a relaxed condition (data not shown). These data substantiated that we have cloned cDNAs for the mouse typ gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse typ protein revealed the presence of the PTP domain at the carboxyl-terminal half. The Typ protein had neither a signal peptide nor a membrane-spanning segment, indicating that Typ is a cytoplasmic PTP. The putative PTP domain contained the consensus sequences such as the catalytic core sequence (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G. Comparison of amino acid sequences between Typ and other PTPs at the catalytic domain revealed that the identity was about 45% at most. A computer-assisted search of the GenBankTM data base revealed no significant homologies of the amino-terminal half of the Typ protein to the other known proteins. However, there was a region rich in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine residues that was flanked by positively charged amino acids known as PEST sequences (39Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) (positions 66–87 in the predicted protein sequence). In addition, two potential phosphorylation sites for the p34 cdc2 kinase (S/TPXK) (40Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were present at amino acid positions 3 and 39 within the amino-terminal proximal region. To detect the protein product of the typ gene, antibodies were raised against the two different portions of the predicted Typ protein: residues 51–164 and 165–285. The resulting antibodies were termed anti-TypN1 and anti-TypC1, respectively. In the extract of adult mouse testis, about 45- and 40-kDa proteins were detected by both of the affinity-purified anti-TypN1 and anti-TypC1 antibodies (Fig.3 A). Two proteins were not detected in the brain extracts nor in the ovary extracts (Fig.3 A). The 40-kDa protein could be a degradation product of the 45-kDa protein. Alternatively, a downstream ATG codon might be utilized for an initiation methionine. Then the typ cDNA containing the entire open reading frame that initiates from the ATG-218 codon was translated in vitro. As shown in Fig.3 A, the 45- and 40-kDa proteins were synthesized (lane 6). In addition, in the lysates of 293T cells transfected with the Typ expression plasmid, pME-Typ, proteins of the same size as detected in the testis lysate were detected by the anti-TypN1 antibodies (Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, when the ATG-218 codon that encodes the first methionine was mutated to GCG, the resulting expression plasmid pME-Typ1MA gave rise to only the 40-kDa form of Typ upon transfection into 293T cells (Fig.3 C, lane 3). These results indicated that the 45-kDa Typ protein was initiated from the ATG-218 and that the 40-kDa protein was not produced by post-translational modifi"
https://openalex.org/W1984872480,"In the neurotrophin family, variable regions contain solvent-accessible residues important for receptor binding specificity, whereas many of the conserved residues are buried in hydrophobic cores or in the dimer interface. A stretch of six amino acids (from Asp-72 to Asn-77) in nerve growth factor (NGF) represents an exception to this general rule. These residues are highly conserved and yet form an exposed hydrophilic loop region away from other known determinants of receptor binding. We have investigated the functional importance of this region in NGF using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Individual mutation of Asp-72, Lys-74, or His-75 to alanine (mutants D72A, K74A, and H75A, respectively) reduced the binding affinity for the p75 neurotrophin receptor by 4–10-fold. Only the D72A mutant showed an additional impairment in binding to the TrkA receptor, which was accompanied by reduced biological activity in PC12 cells, indicating a structural and/or conformational effect of this mutation. Replacement of Ser-73 or Asn-77 with alanine (mutants S73A and N77A, respectively) had no measurable effects on receptor binding. The triple mutant K74A/H75A/N77A exhibited properties that were consistent with the combined effects of the individual mutations, namely impaired binding to p75 without deficits in its interaction with TrkA. In contrast, in the triple mutant D72A/S73A/K74A, the simultaneous replacement of Asp-72 and Lys-74 with alanine had a compensatory effect such that binding to both p75 and TrkA was comparable to that of wild-type NGF, despite the deficits seen in the individual replacements. This molecule, however, was produced at low levels, and its biological activity in sympathetic ganglion explants was reduced, which, together with results from TrkA phosphorylation assays, indicated a reduced stability during prolonged culture conditions. Taken together, these data reveal a second region of interaction with the p75 receptor in NGF with the positively charged residues Lys-74 and His-75 as candidate points of contact. In addition, Asp-72 appears to be a structurally important side chain for stabilizing the conformation of the loop through interactions with neighboring residues. In the neurotrophin family, variable regions contain solvent-accessible residues important for receptor binding specificity, whereas many of the conserved residues are buried in hydrophobic cores or in the dimer interface.

In addition, Asp-72 appears to be a structurally important side chain for stabilizing the conformation of the loop through interactions with neighboring residues. Neurotrophic factors are polypeptides important for the survival, maturation, and maintenance of vertebrate neurons (for an overview, see Ref. 1$$Google Scholar). Several families of molecules with neurotrophic activity have been identified, among which the neurotrophins are the best studied. Up to four neurotrophins have been isolated in any single vertebrate species: nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NT, neurotrophin. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NT, neurotrophin. brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). They are disulfide-bridged homodimers composed of two 110-residue-long protomers. In the crystal structure of NGF, each protomer is composed of two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands joined by looped structures (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The neurotrophins share with each other ∼50% of their amino acid sequence; segments of variability and identity are clustered, forming structurally distinct domains. Variable regions are found in the N and C termini, three β-hairpin loops, one turn, and one β-strand (3Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Persson H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, many of the conserved residues are buried in the dimer interface, indicating structural roles. Neurotrophins interact with two distinct classes of cell-surface receptors: members of the receptor tyrosine kinase Trk family and the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, which lacks intrinsic catalytic activity. Neurotrophin interaction with members of the Trk family is specific in that NGF binds to TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT-4 bind to TrkB, and NT-3 binds to TrkC. In contrast, all neurotrophins bind to p75 with similar affinity (K d = 10−9m), albeit with different kinetic constants (4Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.-A. Neuron. 1990; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Gotz R. Barde Y.-A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin binding to Trks leads to receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation in tyrosine residues, and downstream signal transduction (6Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). A wealth of in vitro as well as in vivo data have convincingly demonstrated that Trks can mediate many of the effects normally elicited by neurotrophins in the absence of p75. The biological role of p75, in contrast, is less clear. p75 is distantly related to tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, the Fas antigen, and CD40. This receptor has been shown to play a role in ligand internalization and ligand discrimination as well as in enhancing NGF-mediated activation of TrkA (7Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports indicate that p75 could play a role in the regulation of apoptosis (8Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 9Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

Moreover, recent evidence indicates that p75, at least in some non-neuronal cells in vitro, can function as a signal-transducing receptor in the absence of TrkA (reviewed in Ref.11Dechant G. Barde Y.-A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) via a pathway involving sphingomyelin hydrolysis (12Dobrowsky R. Werner M. Castellino A. Chao M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (14Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhäuser N. Böhm-Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (9Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar).The potential therapeutic applications of neurotrophins have stimulated efforts to define residues involved in receptor binding, with the ultimate goal of designing smaller peptide analogues with altered specificity and/or potency. Extensive mutational studies have been carried out to define these residues and to assess their contribution in receptor binding and biological activity (reviewed in Ref. 1$$Google Scholar). The binding surface of NGF to TrkA consists of several regions in the primary sequence including residues in the N terminus and in several variable loop regions. In the three-dimensional model of NGF, these residues delineate a continuous surface extending approximately parallel to the 2-fold axis of the NGF dimer (15Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, the main functional epitope involved in NGF binding to p75 is more localized, primarily involving the positively charged residues Lys-32, Lys-34, and Lys-95 located in two spatially close β-hairpin loop regions in the “north end” of the NGF molecule (16Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues to alanine diminishes binding to p75 in an additive manner, although mutant molecules retain wild-type TrkA binding and activation. Interestingly, positively charged residues in homologous positions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, and NT-4 are also involved in binding to p75, indicating a general role for basic residues at these positions in the contact with this receptor (17Rydén M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that although similar, these functional epitopes are not identical, and their differences could account for the differences in p75 binding kinetics observed among the neurotrophins (17Rydén M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).At the opposite end of the NGF dimer, a loop region consisting of six exposed residues (Asp-72, Ser-73, Lys-74, His-75, Trp-76, and Asn-77) is highly conserved among all of the NGF sequences isolated to date from different vertebrate species. The corresponding regions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, and NT-4 also show a similar evolutionary conservation. The solvent accessibility of these residues ranges from 20–30% (Asp-72, His-75, and Trp-76) to 50–80% (Ser-73, Lys-74, and Asn-77), indicating moderate to high side chain exposure (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The hydrophilicity, accessibility, and conservation of these residues suggest a common role for this loop region in all neurotrophins, possibly in modulating binding to cell-surface receptors. A previous study showed that mutation of Trp-76 to phenylalanine had no major effect on receptor binding and biological activity (18Ibáñez C.F. Hallböök F. Ebendal T. Persson H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A more recent study found reduced affinity for TrkA and decreased biological activity after replacement of His-75 with alanine (19Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, an increased affinity for the p75 receptor in H75A mutant NGF was also reported.We have investigated the functional importance of residues in this region in NGF using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The resulting mutant NGF molecules were studied with respect to receptor binding affinity and biological activity in NGF-responsive cell lines and primary neurons. We found that replacement of either Lys-74 or His-75 with alanine affected the affinity of NGF for p75 but not for TrkA, indicating a second site of interaction with the p75 receptor. The conservation of these residues in other neurotrophins indicates that variations in charge and conformation in this region may also be critical for p75 binding in other members of the neurotrophin family.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have investigated the functional importance of solvent-accessible residues in a conserved loop region of NGF by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that several charged residues in this region, notably Lys-74 and His-75, may be involved in the direct contact with the p75 receptor. Since these residues are located at the opposite end of the molecule relative to a first binding epitope found in previous studies (16Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), these data indicate an extended surface of interaction between NGF and p75. These data agree with the results of a mutagenesis study on NT-3 (24Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandón E. Parada L. Presta L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in which several residues important for p75 binding, including a lysine residue at the equivalent position to Lys-74 in NGF, were also found in this region. It is interesting to note that most of the residues important for binding to p75 detected so far in point mutation studies have positively charged side chains, reinforcing the importance of electrostatic contacts for the interaction between NGF and p75. Electrostatic interactions are generally thought to play a role in the initial steps of ligand binding by “guiding” the productive collision of ligand and receptor. The two distinct epitopes identified in NGF are adequately positioned to cooperate in the docking of the elongated NGF dimer to the p75 receptor, facilitating the subsequent alignment of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts that stabilize ligand-receptor association.Asp-72 and His-75 are less exposed compared with the other residues in the region studied (Fig. 7 and Table I), and their side chains form a hydrogen bond that stabilizes the overall conformation of the loop (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The polar residue Ser-73 and the hydrophobic residue Trp-76 are somewhat more exposed, with 50 and 33% solvent accessibility, respectively. Ser-73 is less evolutionarily conserved compared with other residues in the same region, which could perhaps explain the observed tolerance of this residue to mutation. Lys-74 and Asn-77 are highly exposed (66 and 79% solvent accessibility, respectively). The positively charged side chain of Lys-74 extends outwards from the core of the molecule, approximately parallel to the 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 7). Asn-77 extends to the side, perpendicular to the molecular axis (Fig. 7). Overall, the residues in this loop are solvent-accessible and, with the exception of Asp-72 and His-75, do not participate directly in structurally important interactions.The reduced biological activity of mutations of Asp-72 was accompanied by decreased expression levels in COS cells, indicating that replacements at this position may have effects on the structure and/or stability of the molecule. In agreement with this, we have also seen a markedly reduced production level in COS cells of a D72K mutant, 2M. Rydén and C. F. Ibáñez, unpublished observation. and a 37 °C preincubation of the D72A/S73A/K74A triple mutant affected its subsequent ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA receptors. Replacement of the negative charge at this position is expected to disrupt the hydrogen bond to His-75 that stabilizes the loop and may conceivably affect the folding of the molecule. The fact that production, TrkA binding, and biological activity were normal after replacement of His-75 suggests that, in the absence of the histidine, other residues, perhaps Lys-74, may contribute to the stability of the loop. Interestingly, we found very similar effects after mutation of either Lys-74 or His-75, suggesting equivalent roles for these two adjacent residues.Destabilization of the loop after replacement of Asp-72 may result in an aberrant position of the bulky residue Lys-74, thereby interfering with p75 and TrkA receptor binding via steric hindrance. In support of this interpretation, we found that the effect of the D72A mutation on receptor binding was alleviated if both Asp-72 and Lys-74 were simultaneously replaced (as in the D72A/S73A/K74A triple mutant). This triple mutation should have no effect on the net charge of the loop and could likely result in an increased solvent accessibility of the positively charged side chain of His-75 (Fig. 7), making it available for polar interactions with the p75 receptor. The fact that affinity for p75 was greatly reduced after simultaneous mutation of both Lys-74 and His-75 reinforces the importance of positively charged residues for ligand binding to this relatively acidic receptor.Reduced biological activity in the absence of detectable effects on TrkA binding could be the result of a reduced stability during the prolonged culture conditions required for biological assays compared with binding assays. In the latter, ligand is exposed to receptor for only a few hours and at low temperatures. Alternatively, a reduced capacity of inducing TrkA dimerization in otherwise normal binding ligands would also result in decreased biological activity. Nonproductive binding to tyrosine kinase receptors has previously been seen in various mutant growth factors including several chimeric neurotrophins (15Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the case of the triple mutant D72A/S73A/K74A, the results of TrkA phosphorylation experiments showed a reduced activity of this molecule after, but not before, prolonged incubation at 37 °C, indicating a reduced protein stability.In summary, the conformation of the conserved loop in NGF is likely to play a role in the interaction of NGF with its receptors as well as in the overall stability of the molecule. Exchange of positively charged residues with alanine in this exposed loop predominantly affected binding to p75. Together with previous studies, these results suggest an extended interaction between NGF and p75. Neurotrophic factors are polypeptides important for the survival, maturation, and maintenance of vertebrate neurons (for an overview, see Ref. 1$$Google Scholar). Several families of molecules with neurotrophic activity have been identified, among which the neurotrophins are the best studied. Up to four neurotrophins have been isolated in any single vertebrate species: nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NT, neurotrophin. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NT, neurotrophin. brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). They are disulfide-bridged homodimers composed of two 110-residue-long protomers. In the crystal structure of NGF, each protomer is composed of two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands joined by looped structures (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The neurotrophins share with each other ∼50% of their amino acid sequence; segments of variability and identity are clustered, forming structurally distinct domains. Variable regions are found in the N and C termini, three β-hairpin loops, one turn, and one β-strand (3Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Persson H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, many of the conserved residues are buried in the dimer interface, indicating structural roles. Neurotrophins interact with two distinct classes of cell-surface receptors: members of the receptor tyrosine kinase Trk family and the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, which lacks intrinsic catalytic activity. Neurotrophin interaction with members of the Trk family is specific in that NGF binds to TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT-4 bind to TrkB, and NT-3 binds to TrkC. In contrast, all neurotrophins bind to p75 with similar affinity (K d = 10−9m), albeit with different kinetic constants (4Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.-A. Neuron. 1990; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Gotz R. Barde Y.-A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin binding to Trks leads to receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation in tyrosine residues, and downstream signal transduction (6Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). A wealth of in vitro as well as in vivo data have convincingly demonstrated that Trks can mediate many of the effects normally elicited by neurotrophins in the absence of p75. The biological role of p75, in contrast, is less clear. p75 is distantly related to tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, the Fas antigen, and CD40. This receptor has been shown to play a role in ligand internalization and ligand discrimination as well as in enhancing NGF-mediated activation of TrkA (7Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports indicate that p75 could play a role in the regulation of apoptosis (8Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 9Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

Moreover, recent evidence indicates that p75, at least in some non-neuronal cells in vitro, can function as a signal-transducing receptor in the absence of TrkA (reviewed in Ref.11Dechant G. Barde Y.-A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) via a pathway involving sphingomyelin hydrolysis (12Dobrowsky R. Werner M. Castellino A. Chao M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (14Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhäuser N. Böhm-Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (9Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The potential therapeutic applications of neurotrophins have stimulated efforts to define residues involved in receptor binding, with the ultimate goal of designing smaller peptide analogues with altered specificity and/or potency. Extensive mutational studies have been carried out to define these residues and to assess their contribution in receptor binding and biological activity (reviewed in Ref. 1$$Google Scholar). The binding surface of NGF to TrkA consists of several regions in the primary sequence including residues in the N terminus and in several variable loop regions. In the three-dimensional model of NGF, these residues delineate a continuous surface extending approximately parallel to the 2-fold axis of the NGF dimer (15Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, the main functional epitope involved in NGF binding to p75 is more localized, primarily involving the positively charged residues Lys-32, Lys-34, and Lys-95 located in two spatially close β-hairpin loop regions in the “north end” of the NGF molecule (16Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues to alanine diminishes binding to p75 in an additive manner, although mutant molecules retain wild-type TrkA binding and activation. Interestingly, positively charged residues in homologous positions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, and NT-4 are also involved in binding to p75, indicating a general role for basic residues at these positions in the contact with this receptor (17Rydén M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that although similar, these functional epitopes are not identical, and their differences could account for the differences in p75 binding kinetics observed among the neurotrophins (17Rydén M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At the opposite end of the NGF dimer, a loop region consisting of six exposed residues (Asp-72, Ser-73, Lys-74, His-75, Trp-76, and Asn-77) is highly conserved among all of the NGF sequences isolated to date from different vertebrate species. The corresponding regions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, and NT-4 also show a similar evolutionary conservation. The solvent accessibility of these residues ranges from 20–30% (Asp-72, His-75, and Trp-76) to 50–80% (Ser-73, Lys-74, and Asn-77), indicating moderate to high side chain exposure (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The hydrophilicity, accessibility, and conservation of these residues suggest a common role for this loop region in all neurotrophins, possibly in modulating binding to cell-surface receptors. A previous study showed that mutation of Trp-76 to phenylalanine had no major effect on receptor binding and biological activity (18Ibáñez C.F. Hallböök F. Ebendal T. Persson H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A more recent study found reduced affinity for TrkA and decreased biological activity after replacement of His-75 with alanine (19Woo S.B. Timm D.E. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, an increased affinity for the p75 receptor in H75A mutant NGF was also reported. We have investigated the functional importance of residues in this region in NGF using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The resulting mutant NGF molecules were studied with respect to receptor binding affinity and biological activity in NGF-responsive cell lines and primary neurons. We found that replacement of either Lys-74 or His-75 with alanine affected the affinity of NGF for p75 but not for TrkA, indicating a second site of interaction with the p75 receptor. The conservation of these residues in other neurotrophins indicates that variations in charge and conformation in this region may also be critical for p75 binding in other members of the neurotrophin family. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have investigated the functional importance of solvent-accessible residues in a conserved loop region of NGF by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that several charged residues in this region, notably Lys-74 and His-75, may be involved in the direct contact with the p75 receptor. Since these residues are located at the opposite end of the molecule relative to a first binding epitope found in previous studies (16Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), these data indicate an extended surface of interaction between NGF and p75. These data agree with the results of a mutagenesis study on NT-3 (24Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandón E. Parada L. Presta L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in which several residues important for p75 binding, including a lysine residue at the equivalent position to Lys-74 in NGF, were also found in this region. It is interesting to note that most of the residues important for binding to p75 detected so far in point mutation studies have positively charged side chains, reinforcing the importance of electrostatic contacts for the interaction between NGF and p75. Electrostatic interactions are generally thought to play a role in the initial steps of ligand binding by “guiding” the productive collision of ligand and receptor. The two distinct epitopes identified in NGF are adequately positioned to cooperate in the docking of the elongated NGF dimer to the p75 receptor, facilitating the subsequent alignment of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts that stabilize ligand-receptor association.Asp-72 and His-75 are less exposed compared with the other residues in the region studied (Fig. 7 and Table I), and their side chains form a hydrogen bond that stabilizes the overall conformation of the loop (2McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The polar residue Ser-73 and the hydrophobic residue Trp-76 are somewhat more exposed, with 50 and 33% solvent accessibility, respectively. Ser-73 is less evolutionarily conserved compared with other residues in the same region, which could perhaps explain the observed tolerance of this residue to mutation. Lys-74 and Asn-77 are highly exposed (66 and 79% solvent accessibility, respectively). The positively charged side chain of Lys-74 extends outwards from the core of the molecule, approximately parallel to the 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 7). Asn-77 extends to the side, perpendicular to the molecular axis (Fig. 7). Overall, the residues in this loop are solvent-accessible and, with the exception of Asp-72 and His-75, do not participate directly in structurally important interactions.The reduced biological activity of mutations of Asp-72 was accompanied by decreased expression levels in COS cells, indicating that replacements at this position may have effects on the structure and/or stability of the molecule. In agreement with this, we have also seen a markedly reduced production level in COS cells of a D72K mutant, 2M. Rydén and C. F. Ibáñez, unpublished observation. and a 37 °C preincubation of the D72A/S73A/K74A triple mutant affected its subsequent ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA receptors. Replacement of the negative charge at this position is expected to disrupt the hydrogen bond to His-75 that stabilizes the loop and may conceivably affect the folding of the molecule. The fact that production, TrkA binding, and biological activity were normal after replacement of His-75 suggests that, in the absence of the histidine, other residues, perhaps Lys-74, may contribute to the stability of the loop.

Biol. 1995; 248: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) on crystals of deoxyhemoglobin Rothschild (βW37R) and des-Arg deoxyhemoglobin. Rivetti et al. (10Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Kwiatkowski L.D. Wierzba A.M. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6411-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the absence of chloride ions a 10-fold increase in oxygen affinity for crystalline deoxyhemoglobin Rothschild (βW37R) is associated with a significant increase in the mobility of the α-subunit COOH termini in the deoxy crystal structure (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but not with any detectable change in the stereochemistry of the deoxy heme groups. This suggested that the increased oxygen affinity of crystalline deoxyhemoglobin Rothschild is due at least in part to a weakening of the salt bridges associated with Arg-141α. More recent studies on crystalline des-Arg deoxyhemoglobin (12Kavanaugh J.S. Chafin D.R. Arnone A. Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) confirm the hypothesis that the salt bridges at the α-subunit COOH termini are fundamentally associated with the low oxygen affinity of T state hemoglobin. Removal of Arg-141α eliminates the COOH-terminal salt bridges and results in a 15-fold increase in the oxygen affinity of the crystalline T state, a change in oxygen affinity that is similar in magnitude to that observed in solution for the first Adair constant (13Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Kitagawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The increased oxygen affinity of crystalline des-Arg deoxyhemoglobin, like that of crystalline deoxyhemoglobin Rothschild, is associated with a large increase in the mobility of the α-subunit COOH termini. Previously, Kilmartin and Hewitt (14Kilmartin J.V. Hewitt J.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1971; 36: 311-314Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that the bulk properties of hemoglobin in solution are less sensitive to the removal of His-146β than to the removal of Arg-141α, and Perutz and Ten Eyck (15Perutz M.F. Ten Eyck L.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 36: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported a low resolution (3.5 Å) difference electron density map of des-His deoxyhemoglobin that confirmed the removal of His-146β and showed no evidence for any associated structural changes. In the present paper, we directly investigate the influence of the COOH-terminal salt bridges associated with the His-146β on the oxygen binding properties of the T state hemoglobin tetramer in the crystalline state and on the kinetics of carbon monoxide binding in solution. We also report the refined crystal structure of des-His deoxyhemoglobin at high resolution (2.1 Å). Unless otherwise noted, all procedures were carried out in the presence of CO. β chains were prepared from human HbA after treatment with an excess of PMB essentially as described by Bucci and Fronticelli (16Bucci E. Fronticelli C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 551-552Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The PMB reaction mixture was gel-filtered against 0.015 mHCl-bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and applied to a CM52 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Under these conditions, the β-PMB chains passed through this column in a dilute form. PMB was removed from the β chains with dithiothreitol according the method of Parkhurst and Parkhurst (17Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). If necessary, β chains were further purified by HPLC using a glass TSK gel SP-5PW cation exchange column (Toso-Haas, 22 × 150 mm) on a Waters model 650 preparative apparatus maintained at 10 °C with a 425-ml linear gradient and a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The starting buffer contained CO-saturated 0.02 m HCl-bis-Tris, 10 μm EDTA, pH 6.0, and the final buffer contained CO-saturated 0.02 m HCl-bis-Tris, 10 μm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0. Des-His-146β chains were formed by the digestion of βSH chains with carboxypeptidase B as described by Kilmartin et al. (18Kilmartin J.V. Hewitt J.A. Wootton J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 93: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The βSH chains were gel-filtered against 0.04 m HCl-Tris, pH 8.2, and brought to a concentration of 10 mg/ml before the addition of carboxypeptidase B. After 3 h of digestion, followed by the addition of arginine HCl and dithiothreitol, excess carboxypeptidase B was removed. The reaction mixture was then frozen in liquid nitrogen. HPLC analysis of a small aliquot of this reaction mixture demonstrated the removal of about 25% His-146β. Des-His-146β chains were separated from undigested β chains on a CM52 column as already described (18Kilmartin J.V. Hewitt J.A. Wootton J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 93: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Purity of the preparation was determined by analytical HPLC under conditions cited above and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Preparation of des-His-146β HbA and removal of uncombined des-His-146β chains were accomplished as described previously (18Kilmartin J.V. Hewitt J.A. Wootton J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 93: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Purity of the des-His-146β HbA preparation was checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical HPLC using a glass TSK gel DEAE-5PW anion exchange column under conditions described elsewhere (19Fowler S.A. Walder J. DeYoung A. Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Before use for crystallization and kinetic studies, des-His-146β HbA was converted to the oxy derivative (20Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Des-Arg-141α HbA was prepared as described previously (21Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. Proteins Struct. Funct Genet. 1987; 2: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Prior to crystallization the des-His hemoglobin was stripped of organic and inorganic ions by passing it over a Dintzis column (20Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that was modified by the addition of a 1-mm layer of chelating resin (iminodiacetic acid, Sigma C-7901) to the top of the column. The stripped des-His oxyhemoglobin was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until used for crystallization. Crystals of des-His deoxyhemoglobin were grown at room temperature as described previously for deoxyhemoglobin A (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from solutions consisting of 10 mg/ml hemoglobin, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium chloride, 3 mm sodium dithionite, and 10 to 10.5% PEG 6000 Mr. A single crystal (measuring 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.2 mm3) that was isomorphous with crystals of deoxyhemoglobin A (TableI) was mounted in a quartz capillary for data collection. The des-His deoxyhemoglobin and all crystallization stock solutions were thoroughly deoxygenated, and all work was conducted in a nitrogen-filled glove box.Table IUnit cell parametersHemoglobinabcÅDeoxy-HbA1-aThese values are from Kavanaugh et al.(11).97.199.365.8Deoxy-des-His Hb97.199.166.01-a These values are from Kavanaugh et al.(11Kavanaugh J.S.

Open table in a new tab Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku AFC6 diffractometer fitted with a San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector. A total of 247,179 measurements were made of 35,576 unique reflections, representing 98% of all possible data out to a resolution of 2.12 Å. After the diffraction data were scaled and merged according to the procedure of Howard et al. (22Howard A.J. Nielson C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the discrepancy between symmetry related reflections (as judged by the R sym value) was 9.0% on intensity for all data out to 2.12-Å resolution. The initial des-His atomic model was derived from the 1.9-Å structure of deoxyhemoglobin A (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the COOH-terminal histidine residues of the β-subunits removed. The additional oxygen molecule necessary for completing the new α-carboxyl group of Tyr-145β was not included in this model. The standard crystallographic R value for the initial model was 20.6% for all diffraction data between 8.0 and 2.12 Å resolution with magnitudes greater than 2ς (34,083 reflections). Following 11 cycles of restrained least-squares refinement (using the program PROLSQ (23Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 24Sheriff S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 53-55Crossref Google Scholar), the R value dropped to 17.7%. After the new COOH termini were constructed by fitting oxygens into F o − F c Fourier maps with the computer graphics program TOM/FRODO (25Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory, Spring. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 61Google Scholar, 26Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), 35 additional refinement cycles reduced the R value to 17.0%. The final deoxy des-His atomic model has r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond lengths of 0.010 Å and r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond angles of 1.4°. Individual atomic temperature factors were refined throughout the des-His deoxyhemoglobin refinement. Least-squares superposition methods (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were used to partition the structural perturbations in des-His deoxyhemoglobin into components of tetramer movement within the crystal lattice, changes in tetramer quaternary structure, and deformations of tertiary structure. Superpositions of the atomic models of deoxyhemoglobin A and des-His deoxyhemoglobin were carried out using the method of Kabsch (27Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) as implemented in the program BMFIT (28Yuen P.S. Nyburg S.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1979; 12: 258Crossref Google Scholar). When superimposing α-subunits, the first 5 residues and last 5 residues of each subunit were omitted from the superposition. When superimposing β-subunits, the first 5 residues and last 10 residues of each subunit were omitted from the superposition. The magnitudes of the structural perturbations were measured by calculating the vector magnitude of the main chain atomic displacements (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Kavanaugh J.S. Chafin D.R. Arnone A. Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specifically, the quantity as shown in Equation1 δ=14‖∑j−14Δrj‖Equation 1 is plotted versus residue number, where Δr j is the atomic displacement vector for the jth main chain atom of a residue. Crystals for microspectrophotometry were grown from PEG 8000M r solutions at room temperature as described previously (10Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Kwiatkowski L.D. Wierzba A.M. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6411-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Once grown, crystals were washed sequentially with 20 and 36% (w/v) anaerobic PEG 8000 M r solutions containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 30 mmsodium dithionite, pH 7.2. Crystals were stored at 20 °C until used. The crystals of des-His Hb, resuspended at least seven times in a deoxygenated solution containing 54% (w/v) PEG 8000M r, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 6000 units/ml catalase, pH 7.2, were loaded in a Dvorak-Stotler flow cell (29Dvorak J.A. Stotler W.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 68: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) within a deoxygenated glove box. This procedure prevents crystal damage caused by exposure to air (see below). Polarized absorption spectra of des-His-Hb crystals were recorded as a function of oxygen pressure at 15 °C with a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer, as described previously (1Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fractional concentrations of deoxygenated, oxygenated, and oxidized hemes were determined by fitting the observed spectra to a linear combination of deoxy-Hb, oxy-Hb, and met-Hb reference spectra (2Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since both fully oxygenated and oxidized des-His Hb crystals are severely cracked, reference spectra from HbA crystals were used for data analysis. Of the 23 spectra collected between 4.7 and 59 torr, 15 were accepted on the basis of two criteria as follows: (i) fractional concentration of oxidized hemes less than 20%, and (ii) the r.m.s. of residuals of the calculated versus observed spectrum within the averaged r.m.s. +3 S.D. To obtain stable fractional saturations, polarized absorption spectra were recorded over a period of several hours at constant oxygen pressure. This procedure limited data collection on a single crystal to no more than three data points. Carbon monoxide recombination following photodissociation was measured with a flash photolysis apparatus based upon the use of three photographic strobe lamps (19Fowler S.A. Walder J. DeYoung A. Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The concentration of hemoglobin was 4 μm in heme equivalents, and the CO concentration was 40 μm. To ensure anaerobic conditions, residual oxygen was removed by addition of sodium dithionite to 1.5 mm. The kinetics of combination of deoxygenated Hb with CO were measured in an Olis stopped-flow apparatus based on the Gibson-Durrum design (30Gibson Q.H. Milnes L. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as described previously (19Fowler S.A. Walder J. DeYoung A. Kwiatkowski L.D. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Anaerobic conditions were obtained using sodium dithionite. The hemoglobin concentration was 2 μm in heme, and the CO concentration was 40 μm after mixing. Both stopped flow studies and flash photolysis measurements were carried out at pH 6, 7, and 8. The buffers were prepared by titrating an amount of HCl equal to 0.1 m chloride with solid bis-Tris base (for pH 6 and 7) and solid Tris base (for pH 8). Inositol hexaphosphate, IHP (Sigma), was obtained in the sodium form. The pH of the stock solution (0.2 m) was adjusted to pH 5.6 with the protonated form of Amberlite IR-120 resin. IHP was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Reactions were followed at 420 and 435 nm, and the temperature of the sample maintained at 20 °C. Data collection and processing was by an Olis model 4000 data acquisition and instrument control system as already described (31Kwiatkowski L.D. DeYoung A. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5884-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Rigorous error analysis for the fitted rate constants is difficult. Because of the large numbers of data points obtained in each kinetic experiment, the estimated errors of the fits are very small. However, reproducibility between and among experiments indicates a more reasonable estimate of error to be ±10% for the rate constants and ±15% for the fractional contributions of the kinetic components of the reaction. The electron density images in Fig.1 show that the COOH-terminal β-subunit residues can be positioned accurately in both deoxyhemoglobin A and des-His deoxyhemoglobin. Moreover, the total absence of any electron density for His-146β in the deoxy des-His electron density map (Fig.1 B) confirms the complete removal of the COOH-terminal histidines in the purified des-His hemoglobin. Superposition analyses can be used to partition the structural differences between hemoglobin A and a modified hemoglobin into components of rigid-body rotation of the entire tetramer, changes in quaternary structure, and changes in tertiary structure (11Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The δ-profiles in Fig. 2 Awere calculated without superimposing the deoxyhemoglobin A and des-His deoxyhemoglobin atomic models. Therefore, these δ-profiles include rigid-body motion of the deoxy des-His tetramer within the crystal lattice. In the absence of rigid-body motion of the entire tetramer, the non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry of the hemoglobin tetramer requires that δ-profiles calculated for the symmetry related β1- and β2-subunits have similar shapes and magnitudes. The same is true for the α1- and α2-subunits. There are, however, significant differences between the β1-subunit (thin lines) and β2-subunit (thick lines) δ-profiles in Fig.2 A, where the r.m.s. value of δβ1-δβ2 is 0.12 Å. Likewise, an r.m.s. value of 0.14 Å for δα1-δα2 reflects significant differences in the shapes and magnitudes for the α1 and α2 δ-profiles calculated prior to any superposition of the atomic models (data not shown). If these differences in δ-profiles are largely the result of rigid-body motion, they should be reduced by superimposing the des-His deoxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin A tetramers. The δ-profiles in Fig. 2 B show this to be the case. That is, the shapes of the β1 and β2 δ-profiles calculated after superposition of the tetramers are much more similar (the r.m.s. value of δβ1-δβ2 is reduced to 0.05 Å). The same is true of the α1 and α2 δ-profiles (the r.m.s. value of δα1-δα2 is reduced to 0.05 Å). The rigid-body motion of the des-His deoxyhemoglobin tetramer amounts to a rotation of approximately 0.2° and a translation of 0.07 Å about an axis that passes through the outer edge of the α2-subunit. After the rigid-body motion has been removed, the remaining structural differences between deoxyhemoglobin A and des-His deoxyhemoglobin (Fig.2 B) are the result of rearrangements in quaternary structure and/or changes in tertiary structure. The tertiary component of the structural changes can be isolated from the quaternary component by superimposing corresponding subunits of des-His deoxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin A. When this is done (Fig. 2 C), the only significant tertiary structural changes are located at the β-subunit COOH termini, where the δ values are approximately 7.5–10 times the r.m.s. δβ1-δβ2 value of 0.05 Å. Elsewhere in the β-subunits, the δ values are only about 2 to 3 times the r.m.s. δβ1-δβ2 value. The same is true for α-subunits (data not shown). The only exception is the NH2 terminus of the β1-subunit, where the δ value is ∼8 times the r.m.s. δβ1-δβ2 value. This difference, however, most likely reflects the inherent mobility of the β-subunit NH2 terminus (see below), rather than a significant structural change that results from the removal of the COOH-terminal histidine. The small differences between the shapes of the δ-profiles in Fig.2 C and the corresponding δ-profiles in Fig. 2 Bare indicative of a slight quaternary structure change in the des-His deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. The existence of a small quaternary rearrangement in des-His deoxyhemoglobin is more clearly demonstrated by the δ-plot in Fig. 2 D, where the δ-profile for the β1-subunit was calculated after the α2-subunits were superimposed, and the δ-profile for the β2-subunit was calculated after the α1-subunits were superimposed. This type of δ-plot, a quaternary δ-plot, is very sensitive to any change in the position of the α1β1 dimer relative to the orientation of the α2β2 dimer. If there is no change in the relative orientation of the dimers, the δ-profiles in a quaternary δ-plot would be flat and featureless, as is the case when the βV1M model is compared with the deoxyhemoglobin A model (dashed line). The βV1M mutation does not result in any quaternary rearrangements, but it does cause a change in the tertiary structure of the β-subunit NH2 termini (32Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8640-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to the βV1M δ-profile, the δ-profiles for the des-His deoxyhemoglobin have clear maxima for residues located on the outside of the tetramer and minima for residues located within the dimer-dimer interface, confirming the presence of a slight quaternary structure change in des-His deoxyhemoglobin. Rigid-body calculations (33Cox J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 28: 151-156Crossref Google Scholar) show that this quaternary structure change amounts to a rotation of one dimer relative to the other by just over 0.4°. The structural perturbations detected in the des-His deoxyhemoglobin δ-plots are illustrated in Fig. 3. The only significant changes involve the main chain atoms of residues Lys-144β and Tyr-145β, as well as a slight repositioning of the Tyr-145β side chain. The remainder of the des-His deoxyhemoglobin atomic model, including the hemes and proximal histidines, is indistinguishable from that of deoxyhemoglobin A. In particular, despite the loss of the inter- and intrasubunit salt bridges associated with His-146β, no significant increases in mobility or changes in conformation are detected for the side chains of either Lys-40α or Asp-94β. No increase in the mobility of the β-subunit COOH termini is observed in crystals of des-His deoxyhemoglobin (Fig.4).Figure 4Changes in main chain temperature factors for des-Arg and des-His. Average main chain atom temperature factors for the α1-subunits (thin line) and α2-subunits (thick line) of deoxyhemoglobin A are plotted versus residue number (a), and the percentage change in α-subunit main chain temperature factors (des-Arg deoxyhemoglobin minus deoxyhemoglobin A) are plotted versusresidue number (b). Average main chain atom temperature factors for the β1-subunits (thin line) and β2-subunits (thick line) of deoxyhemoglobin A are plotted versus residue number (c), and the percentage change in β-subunit main chain temperature factors (des-His deoxyhemoglobin minus deoxyhemoglobin A) are plotted versusresidue number (d).

Exposure of crystals to oxygen pressures in excess of 65 torr, at 15 °C, causes first the formation of diagonal bands and then irregular cracks. Polarized absorption spectra were recorded during an oxygen pressure jump between 0 and 76 torr. Fractional concentrations of oxygenated hemes vary with time following complex kinetics that ultimately lead to a fully oxygenated Hb (Fig. 5 A). When the oxygenation is carried out in two steps, 0–50 torr and 50–76 torr, a stable fractional saturation is obtained after the first step, and a fully oxygenated Hb is obtained in the s"

Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes a variety of thiol/disulfide exchange reactions, including the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds during oxidative protein folding. PDI possesses two domains that are homologous to the redox active protein, thioredoxin (4Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). One is located near the N terminus, and another is found near the C terminus. Each of the domains is characterized by a redox-active dithiol/disulfide site with the general sequence CGHC. Thioredoxin domains, including active-site CXXC sequences, have been found in a number of redox-active proteins, suggesting that these proteins constitute a thioredoxin superfamily with versatile thiol/disulfide exchange activities including oxidation, reduction, and isomerization (5Freedman R.B. Hirst R.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Individual members of the thioredoxin superfamily have up to three thioredoxin domains linked together. Erp72 has three thioredoxin domains (6Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Erp61 has two (7Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of the thioredoxin superfamily such as thioredoxin itself, glutaredoxin (8Lundstrom-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or the Escherichia coli periplasmic protein, DsbA (9Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), have only one thioredoxin homology domain. All of these single domain proteins are poor catalysts of disulfide rearrangements, suggesting that domains other than the thioredoxin domains contribute significantly to substrate interactions that are important for disulfide rearrangements. PDI displays an amazingly large range of interactions including association with folded proteins, with unfolded proteins, and with small molecules. It serves as an essential subunit of prolyl hydroxylase (10Vuori K. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and triglyceride transferase (11Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9801-9807Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), two multi-subunit proteins of the ER. The catalytic activity of PDI is not essential to its function as a structural subunit of prolyl hydroxylase (12Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PDI can also interact with unfolded proteins in a number of ways. At concentrations in large excess over its unfolded protein substrate, PDI can function as a chaperone and inhibit aggregation (13Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) even for substrate proteins that do not form disulfide bonds (14Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). With unfolded proteins that also self-aggregate, substoichiometric concentrations of PDI can, surprisingly, facilitate aggregation (anti-chaperone activity), presumably by interacting with and non-covalently cross-linking smaller aggregates (13Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the multiple interactions that PDI can accommodate, the non-thioredoxin domains of the protein may be involved in interactions with other proteins. The cysteine residues of the two CXXC centers of the thioredoxin domains are responsible for the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI; a mutant PDI with all four active-site cysteines changed to serines has ≤0.5% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme in catalyzing ribonuclease oxidative folding (17Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At RNase concentrations near and below the K m, the two active sites contribute almost equally to catalysis of RNase refolding (10Vuori K. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when surveyed over a much larger range of substrate concentrations, the two PDI active sites contribute unequally to catalysis. Neither active site is totally essential for disulfide isomerase activity; however, the N-terminal active site contributes more to catalysis at saturating substrate, whereas the C-terminal active site contributes more to the binding of substrate in the steady-state (17Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At each thioredoxin domain active site, the cysteine that is closer to the N terminus interacts with the substrate to form a covalent intermediate (18Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PDI mutants with only a single active site cysteine (at the more N-terminal position) do not catalyze substrate oxidation, but still have significant activity in catalyzing disulfide rearrangements. The more C-terminal cysteine at each active site provides a mechanism to reduce substrate disulfides and enables PDI to escape from slowly rearranging complexes (18Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When expressed independently, the N-terminal thioredoxin domain (residues 1–120) folds into a stable species, and the structure has been solved by NMR (19Kemmink J. Darby J.J. Dijkstra K. Milges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The C-terminal thioredoxin domain (residues 348–462) can also be expressed, but it is somewhat less stable than the N-terminal domain. Each of the isolated thioredoxin domains is catalytically active in the oxidation of protein substrates, but neither isolated thioredoxin domain exhibits significant activity in catalyzing isomerization (20Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), often the rate-limiting step in the oxidative refolding of disulfide containing proteins. Recent characterization of a PDI fragment consisting of the first 257 residues, which encompasses the N-terminal thioredoxin domain and a substantial portion of the central region of the molecule, showed that this substantial fragment was also inactive in catalysis of disulfide isomerization (21Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Obviously, sequences in the C-terminal region of the protein other than the thioredoxin domain are essential for catalysis of rearrangements. During the expression of recombinant PDI in E. coli, we and others (22Haugejorden S.M. Srinivasan M. Green M. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 5: 405-414Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23De Sutter K. Hostens K. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) noted the co-expression of a 21-kDa fragment of PDI. N-terminal sequencing indicates that the fragment results from alternative translation initiation at the first internal AUG, located at Met-307. Here, we report that this C-terminal fragment of recombinant rat PDI (residues 308–491, termed weePDI) has substantial activity in catalyzing disulfide isomerization during the oxidative refolding of reduced RNase. The k catis comparable to that of a full-length PDI in which the N-terminal domain has been inactivated by mutation of the active site cysteines to serine. The activity of this C-terminal fragment suggests that the essential features that impart isomerization activity to PDI, even the isomerization activity of the N-terminal thioredoxin domain, reside in short segments flanking the C-terminal thioredoxin domain. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), 3′,5′-cCMP, dithiothreitol, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase), equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase, TPCK-treated trypsin, HEPES, and cells were from Sigma. DEAE-Sephacel and chelating Sepharose (fast flow) were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other reagents were analytical reagent grade or better. Deionized, glass-distilled water was used throughout. UV-visible spectrophotometry was performed on either a Beckman DU70 or DU7500 spectrophotometer with the cell compartment maintained at 25.0 °C. SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) was performed using the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), and proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. The concentrations of PDI and weePDI were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using E 0.1% of 1.0 (25Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 27: 7298-7305Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and 1.3, respectively. For weePDI, the E 0.1% was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (six replicates) after overnight hydrolysis in 6 m HCl. Quantitative amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Baylor College of Medicine protein core facility. HPLC was performed on a Beckman 110A gradient system using a Kratos variable wavelength UV-visible detector. The expression of weePDI accompanies the expression of full-length PDI when expression is induced from expression plasmid (pET-PDI.2) (26Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was transformed with a plasmid encoding the wild-type PDI or various cysteine mutants (18Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures from a single colony were grown on LB to an A 650 of 0.8–1.0 and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). After overnight growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted as described previously (26Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), dialyzed, and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 20 cm).weePDI was separated from wild-type PDI using a 2-liter linear gradient (total volume) of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 0.025m sodium phosphate, pH 6.3. weePDI and the various weePDI mutants eluted after the corresponding full-length PDI. Fractions containing predominantly weePDI were identified by SDS-PAGE and combined. The wild-type weePDI(SS) 2The designations S and Oare used to indicate sulfur or oxygen (Cys or Ser) at the active site cysteines located in the thioredoxin domains. The wild-type sequence (CGHC) is designated weePDI(SS), whereas the mutant sequence (CGHS) is weePDI(SO). In the full-length sequence, a mutant with serines (oxygen) at both positions of the N-terminal thioredoxin domain is designated wtPDI(OOSS). was purified further by ion-exchange (DEAE-5PW, Bio-Rad) HPLC with a gradient of 0.15–0.5 m NaCl in 0.025 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, over 30 min. SDS-PAGE showed that the highly purified weePDI was greater than 95% homogeneous and contained <1% wtPDI. For the mutant weePDIs, the final traces of full-length PDI were removed by HPLC gel filtration (7.5 × 600 mm, TSK-93000SW, CEL Associates, Inc., Houston, TX) after reduction with 10–20 mm DTT at pH 7.5–8.0 for at least 2 h. The solvent for gel filtration was 25 mmphosphate buffer (pH 6.3) containing 0.2 m NaCl. Protein-disulfide isomerase activity was determined using a previously published continuous assay for catalysis of the refolding of reduced, denatured RNase (27Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, reduced, denatured RNase was added to a cuvette containing a glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH, 0.2 mmGSSG), the RNase substrate, cCMP (4.5 mm), and the indicated concentrations of weePDI and RNase in 0.1m Tris·acetate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm EDTA. The temperature was maintained at 25.0 °C. After adding reduced RNase to initiate the reaction, the absorbance at 296 nm due to RNase-catalyzed cCMP hydrolysis was monitored continuously (0.5-min intervals) for 30 min. The amount of refolded RNase at any time was calculated from the first derivative of the absorbance with respect to time after correction for substrate depletion and product inhibition, as described (27Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Parallel controls with no PDI were performed at each RNase concentration and subtracted from the rate of the catalyzed reaction. Control rates were generally <25% the rate of the catalyzed reaction. At RNase concentrations greater than 30 μm, an additional control was performed in which cCMP was omitted from the assay to correct for the catalysis of RNase aggregation (17Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correction for aggregation was generally small compared with the catalyzed reaction (<9% at concentrations of RNase of 40 μm). Activities are reported in units of micromolar active RNase formed per min. Data were combined and analyzed by non-linear least squares fitting (28Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969Google Scholar) to a rectangular hyperbola. The reported error limits are the parameter standard deviations calculated from the fitting algorithm. The final yield of enzymatically active lysozyme was determined after oxidative refolding of reduced denatured lysozyme at pH 7.0 (HEPES), 37 °C as described previously (13Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The refolding buffer contained 5 mm GSH and 0.5 mm GSSG in 0.1 m HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mmMgCl2. The final lysozyme concentration was 10 μm. Yields, measured when the production of native lysozyme had reached a constant value, are based on the activity exhibited by the same concentration of native lysozyme. Alcohol dehydrogenase aggregation was induced by thermally denaturing 10 μm alcohol dehydrogenase at 40 °C. Aggregation was followed in a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 360 nm due to light scattering caused by increased turbidity. Alcohol dehydrogenase was added to temperature-equilibrated buffer (0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.0) containing PDI to initiate aggregation. An apparent velocity of aggregation was measured after any lag as the maximum change in absorbance with time as described previously (15Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). weePDI (1.0 mg/ml) was digested by incubating with 2% (w/w) TPCK-treated trypsin at pH 8.0 (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA) containing 5 mm CaCl2 for 4–6 h at 37 °C. After a further addition of 2% trypsin (w/w), the incubation was continued overnight. The digested sample was made 1% in trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto an appropriately charged and washed Sep-Pak C18 cartridge column, desalted with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0.1). After drying under nitrogen, the digested, desalted sample was resuspended in water:trifluoroacetic acid:formic acid (99:0.25:1), and an aliquot (10 μl) was analyzed by packed capillary HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry. The capillary HPLC consisted of two Waters prototype high pressure syringe pumps controlled by a Waters model 680 gradient controller with a Waters prototype interface. The capillary column was a 30 cm × 320-μm column (LC Packings) packed with C18 silica (5-μm particles). Solvent A was water:trifluoroacetic acid:formic acid (99:0.25:1), and solvent B was acetonitrile:methanol:water:trifluoroacetic acid:formic acid (47:47:5:0.25:1). The column was initially equilibrated with 5% solvent B at a flow rate of 9 μl/min. At the time of injection, a linear gradient increasing the percentage composition of solvent B by 2%/min was initiated and allowed to continue until the composition was 75% in solvent B. The HPLC effluent was introduced directly into the electrospray needle of a VG Quattro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in the positive ion MS1 mode under electrospray ionization conditions. During the course of the chromatogram the instrument was repetitively scanned from m/z 300 to m/z 1500 in 3 s, with an interscan time of 0.1 s. Data were acquired in the continuum (peak profile) mode. Selected raw electrospray mass spectra were converted to molecular mass data using the Maximum Entropy program of the VG MassLynx data system. HPLC gel filtration was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using a 7.5 × 60-mm TSKgel-3000SW column (Bio-Rad) eluted with either 0.025 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.3 (0.2 m NaCl) or 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Bio-Rad HPLC gel filtration standards were used to calibrate the column. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an electronic speed control, rotor temperature indicator control unit, and photoelectric scanner. The protein solution was dialyzed against 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were conducted by the method of Yphantis (29Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) in an ANF rotor with 12 mm double sector charcoal filled Epon centerpieces with sapphire windows at 20 °C and 24,000 rpm.weePDI samples under non-reducing conditions were analyzed at two loading concentrations of 0.056 and 0.39 mg/ml and at rotor speeds of 14,000 and 24,000 rpm. Both sets of data were subjected to simultaneous global fitting, which resulted in a molecular mass of 41.5 ± 0.2 kDa. The protein concentration was monitored at 280 nm as a function of radial position across the cell from top to bottom. Base-line correction was made by using the absorbance scans at 500 nm. Attainment of equilibrium was established by a constant distribution of protein in the cell over time in hours. The data are expressed as plots of C versus r 2/2, where C is concentration in mg/ml and r is radial distance in cm. The data sets were fitted to different self-association models by the non-linear least squares program, Nonlin (30Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The model chosen to describe the association behavior was the one with the lowest residual least squares and with no systematic deviation of the residuals. Inducing the expression of recombinant rat PDI (55 kDa) also induces the expression of a smaller protein (21 kDa) (Fig. 1). The 21-kDa band cross-reacts with anti-PDI antibodies (data not shown) and has an N-terminal sequence of TKYKPESDELTAEKI. This sequence begins immediately after the first internal ATG codon of the PDI cDNA, suggesting that the smaller protein is the product of alternative translation initiation (Fig. 2). Multiple induced proteins during PDI expression in E. coli have been reported previously (22Haugejorden S.M. Srinivasan M. Green M. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 5: 405-414Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23De Sutter K. Hostens K. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This C-terminal fragment (amino acids 308–491) 3The first amino acid corresponds to that of the human sequence of the mature protein after the removal of the 17-amino acid signal sequence. of PDI, designated weePDI, was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and HPLC gel filtration chromatography. An overloaded SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1) of purified weePDI shows that there is less than 1% wild-type PDI in the preparation. In addition to weePDI produced from the wild-type sequence, weePDI was also purified from mutants of PDI that contain a single active site cysteine (31Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8845-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) resulting in the isolation of the mutants,weePDI(SO) and weePDI(OO).Figure 2Domain structures of wtPDI and weePDI (wild-type domains are identified as described by Kemmink and co-workers (19Kemmink J.

The two thioredoxin domains containing the active sites are labeled a and a′. The internally homologous linker domains are labeled b and b′, and the acidic C-terminal domain is labeled cafter Edman and colleagues (4Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter R.J.

At saturating reduced RNase, the k cat, based on a 21-kDa monomer, is 0.26 ± 0.02 min−1 (Fig. 3). A mutant weePDI in which the active site cysteine nearer the C terminus had been mutated to serine (weePDI(SO)) showed detectable activity in the isomerization of RNase (Fig. 3). However, the activity was considerably lower than that of the wild-type weePDI. Because of the low activity, the K m for RNase could not be determined accurately; however, the k cat/K m was only 10% that of weePDI and only 1% that of the wild-type, full-length enzyme. A mutant weePDI molecule with no active site cysteines showed no detectable activity over background, even at high concentrations (32 μm).

With increasing time during the assay, the activity of weePDI increases by at least 2.3-fold (Fig. 4, inset). Examination of the weePDI on non-reducing gels (Fig. 1) shows that the weePDI as isolated is a disulfide-linked dimer of 42 kDa. The glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH and 0.2 mm GSSG) is sufficient to reduce the intermolecular disulfide of weePDI at catalytic weePDI concentrations (<3 μm). SDS-PAGE of N-ethylmaleimide-quenched refolding reactions indicates that the reduction is essentially complete within 10 min (data not shown), suggesting that the activity increase is associated with reduction of the intermolecular disulfide linking the two weePDI molecules. When RNase refolding is initiated with weePDI (2.8 μm) that has been prereduced by DTT, RNase refolding is initially faster than when the reaction is initiated with the disulfide-linked dimeric enzyme. Full-length, wild-type PDI has six cysteine residues (4Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), whereas weePDI has three (Fig. 2). With an odd number of cysteine residues, the possibility exists for the formation of intermolecular disulfides, and this proved to be the case. Reaction of the protein with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-carboxynitrobezoate) (32Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar) in 6 m guanidine HCl indicates that there are <0.1 free sulfhydryl groups per weePDI (21 kDa) as isolated. HPLC-electrospray mass spectral analysis of tryptic peptides of weePDI (TableII) shows the presence of a fragment with a molecular mass of 2915.4 Da, consistent with the presence of a symmetrical disulfide involving Cys-326.
