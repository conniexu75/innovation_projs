https://openalex.org/W2091229264,"Metamorphosis of the bugs Pyrrhocoris apterus and Oncopeltus fasciatus is blocked by the application of juvenile hormone analogs to the eqgs 4 weeks earlier. One or more supernumerary larval molts occur to form ""giant"" larvae which routinely die without undergoing netamorphosis. When the corpora allatta were excised at the outset of the fifth larval stage, the entire phenomenon vanished and all individuals underwent normal metamorphosis. The inhibition of metamorphosis can therefoore be attributed to a continuation of the secretion of endogenous juvenile hormone by the corpora allata of mature larvae deried from eggs treated with juvenile hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1979551983,"Range and Doppler tracking data from Mariners 6 and 7 have been used to obtain values for the ratio of the mass of the earth to that of the moon which are in substantial agreement with those determined from other Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft. There is an inconsistency of about 0.004 percent in values for the mass of the moon determined from lunar trajectories. A gravitational constant for Mars of 42,828.48 +/- 1.38 cubic kilometers per second per second, obtained on the basis of data collected during the 5 days prior to the closest approach of Mariner 6 to Mars, is in excellent agreement with the result obtained by Null from tracking data of Mariner 4."
