https://openalex.org/W1977127683,"Auditory evoked potentials were recorded from the vertex of subjects who listened selectively to a series of tone pips in one ear and ignored concurrent tone pips in the other ear. The negative component of the evoked potential peaking at 80 to 110 milliseconds was substantially larger for the attended tones. This negative component indexed a stimulus set mode of selective attention toward the tone pips in one ear. A late positive component peaking at 250 to 400 milliseconds reflected the response set established to recognize infrequent, higher pitched tone pips in the attended series."
https://openalex.org/W2000489985,"The cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome is a rare familial malady with cerebral, renal, and skeletal abnormalities, severe hypotonia, cirrhosis, iron and lipid storage, and death within 6 months. Correlated electron microscopic, histochemical, and biochemical studies demonstrate defects in two oxidative organelles. Peroxisomes cannot be found in hepatocytes and renal proximal tubules. In hepatocytes and cortical astrocytes, mitochondria are distorted in their appearance and glycogen stores are increased. Oxygen consumnption of brain and liver mitochondrial preparations with succinate and with substrates reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is markedly diminished, but the consumption is normal with ascorbate and tetramethylphenylenediamine, which suggests a defect in electron transport prior to the cytochromes. Histochemical studies of mitochondrial oxidation point to a defect between the succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein and coenzyme Q, possibly in the region of nonheme iron protein."

The data indicate that drug use by peers exerts a greater influence than drug use by parents. Friends are more similar in their use of marihuana than in any other activity or attitude. Parental use of psychotropic drugs has only a small influence, mostly related to maternal use. Peer and parental influences are synergistic; the highest rates of marihuana usage are observed among adolescents whose parents and friends are drug users."

The reaction proceeds easily enough to have potential synthetic applications; the proposed mechanism could explain some reported anomalies regarding the synthesis of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in vivo and in vitro.

The different structural features of the two types of collagen may account for some of the functional defects of osteoarthritic cartilage."

https://openalex.org/W1975907272,Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) injected into the third ventricle of ovariectomized rats increased plasma luteinizing hormone dramatically and follicle stimulating hormone slightly. PGE1 elevated prolactin; PGF1α or PGF2α had no effect. PGE2 or PGE1 injected directly into the anterior pituitary were ineffective. These results suggest that specific prostaglandins act at the hypothalamus to control pituitary hormone release.
https://openalex.org/W1894695910,"Abstract Human glutamine PP-ribose-P amidotransferase (PP-ribose-P amidotransferase; EC 2.4.2.14) has been found to exist in two interconvertible forms with molecular weights of 133,000 and 270,000. In the absence of purine ribonucleotides and PP-ribose-P the small and large form of the enzyme are both demonstrable in the same enzyme preparation. AMP and GMP, alone or in combination, convert the small form of the enzyme into the large form. PP-ribose-P dissociates the large form of the enzyme into the small form. This demonstration of a change in the physical properties of human PP-ribose-P amidotransferase by an end product inhibitor and a substrate confirms that this enzyme is an allosteric protein and may provide a molecular basis for understanding the regulation of purine biosynthesis de novo in man."
https://openalex.org/W2019657369,"Synaptosomes treated with radioactive gamma-aminobutyric acid can be stimulated to release this substance. The release is maximal within 40 seconds after stimulation and is dependent on calcium. Magnesium and manganese ions, known to block stimulus-secretion coupling processes, depress calcium-dependent release. This release is specific to synaptosomes because microsomal or myelin fractions do not release accumulated gamma-aminobutyric acid. The data illustrate a simple in vitro system suitable for analysis of secretion of gamma-aminobutyric acid in brain and in addition describe several new aspects of uptake and secretion of this compound at brain nerve endings."
https://openalex.org/W1582348132,"Abstract The effects of the hypoglycemic agent diphenyleneiodonium have been studied both in vivo and in vitro. In 2-day-old rats, diphenyleneiodonium lowered whole body and blood glucose concentrations. At higher concentrations of the agent (10 µg per g), this was accompanied by increased glucose utilization and accumulation of lactic acid. At 5 µg per g, diphenyleneiodonium inhibited gluconeogenesis from lactate and aspartate but had no effect on gluconeogenesis from xylitol, d-glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone. Analysis of hepatic intermediates showed that diphenyleneiodonium (5 µg per g) drastically decreased the ATP concentration, and this was accompanied by a marked decrease of the oxidation-reduction potential of NADH-linked systems in both mitochondria and cytosol. Diphenyleneiodonium did not alter the chloride ion distribution between the blood and hepatocytes of 2-day-old or adult rats but was itself extensively accumulated by the liver (70 µm at 15.5 nmoles per g) and was tightly, though not specifically, bound by mitochondria isolated from injected animals. Mitochondria isolated from rats at various times after injection of 5 µg per g of diphenyleneiodonium showed a time-dependent inhibition of the rate of oxidation of added glutamate-malate or β-hydroxybutyrate, but succinate oxidation was not significantly affected. This effect was independent of the chloride content of the assay medium. Oxidation of NADH-linked substrates in a chloride-free medium was also inhibited when diphenyleneiodonium was added to mitochondria in vitro, and this inhibition was completely overcome by catalytic amounts of menadione. In submitochondrial particles, diphenyleneiodonium inhibited NADH oxidation by the phosphorylating respiratory chain (apparent Ki = 4 µm) but had no effect on cytochrome c-dependent NADH oxidation. The results indicate that diphenyleneiodonium inhibits mitochondrial oxidation in vivo by a direct inhibition of the oxidation of NADH-linked substrates rather than as a result of the chloride-hydroxyl ion exchange across the inner membrane previously reported."

https://openalex.org/W1977799084,"To study the effect of changing serum osmolality on serum prolactin concentration 11 volunteers were given oral and intravenous hypotonic and hypertonic fluids. Mean serum prolactin fell to 10.5 percent of baseline after oral water loading and to 15 percent of baseline after intravenous hypotonic saline infusion. Conversely, mean prolactin rose to 417 percent of baseline after intravenous hypertonic saline administration. The correlation coefficient of simultaneously determined serum prolactin and osmolality was highly significant (P .001). Isoosmolar changes in extracellular fluid volume did not consistently affect the concentration of prolactin in the serum. Thus, prolactin may be involved in the physiologic regulation of osmolar balance and the kidney may be an important farget organ for prolaction."

The metals were removed from the native protein to produce the apoprotein, and copperthionein was prepared by equilibrium dialysis. Copperthionein from Wilson's disease patients had a copper-binding constant four times as great as that of the protein from control subjects. These results suggest that the alterations in copper homeostasis in Wilson's disease result from the synthesis of an abnormal metal-binding protein with an increased affinity for copper."

https://openalex.org/W1519485210,"Abstract Pentapeptides containing either glycine, l-alanine, l-valine, l-leucine, or l-isoleucine as central residue in the pattern glycylglycyl-X-glycylglycine have been studied by proton-decoupled natural abundance 13C Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Resonances were assigned by comparison with the free amino acids and by detailed observation of changes in chemical shifts with pH over the range 1.32 to 10.43. The effect of varying the central residue on the chemical shifts of the flanking glycine residues was established. Small effects ascribable to incipient aggregation were noted, both in terms of chemical shifts and relaxation properties. Each resonance was categorized according to the degree of sensitivity to the state of protonation of the terminal groups, and the pK values at 26° for those groups were determined from the pH dependence of the most sensitive resonances. The sensitive terminal resonances undergo broadening which is maximum near the pK. Spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, of protonated carbon nuclei were measured at two or more pH values in all cases except for the glycine pentapeptide. For each peptide Cα resonances showed gradients in increasing T1 to each side from the central residue, indicative of contributions from segmental motion and internal rotation along the backbone in addition to the over-all rotational motion of the molecule. Internal rotational modes are expressed as well in the aliphatic side chains, especially by the most peripheral methyl groups for which spinning around the attaching bond is clearly prominent. Comparison of the anionic and cationic forms of the alanine, valine, and leucine peptides indicates that the rate of internal rotation of Cα of the NH2-terminal glycine residues increases with deprotonation of the ammonium group."
https://openalex.org/W1595308056,"Abstract The active and inactive forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase were assayed in a mitochondrial extract prepared from rat skeletal muscle. The active form of this enzyme was increased almost 3-fold upon preincubation with 10 mm Mg++ and Ca++. There was a decrease of approximately 30% when 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm Mg++ were present in the original preincubation mixture. If citrate (5.0 mm) was added to the preincubation mixture containing 10 mm Mg++ and Ca++, the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase was almost completely prevented. The concentration of citrate required to reduce the rate of activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by 50% was approximately 2.0 mm in this system. Citrate did not inhibit the assay system for activated pyruvate dehydrogenase. Once the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase was complete, addition of 5 mm citrate to the preincubation mixture did not decrease this activity. Increasing the concentrations of Mg++ and Ca++ from 10 to 20 mm did not overcome the citrate (5 mm)-induced prevention of pyruvate dehydrogenase activation. Only the citrate analogues with a hydroxy group (citrate, (-) hydroxycitrate, fluorocitrate, 2-ethylcitrate and 2-methylcitrate) inhibited the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase independent of Mg++ and Ca++ concentration, whereas this was not the case with tricarboxylic acids without a hydroxy group (tricarballylate and 1,2,3-tricarboxybenzene). It is concluded that citrate can prevent the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by a mechanism independent of Mg++ and Ca++ chelation. Some possible physiological implications are discussed."

After intravenous infusion most of these perfluorinated emulsions are deposited in the liver and spleen in a matter of days, where they remain for the lifetime of the animal. Hence, while they may be useful as isolated organ perfusion media their value as artificial blood is limited. A family of perfluorocarbons has now been discovered, which, although deposited in the liver after circulation in the blood, leave the liver to be excreted via the lungs and skin in a matter of days without apparent harmn to the animal."

These regions have similar roles in the engram in the sense that they all seem to participate in responses to external events and in subsequent representations of these events. However, the relative contribution of these processes to the activity of different brain regions is quantitatively different, in that some regions are much more strongly affected than others. These results may constitute the basis for reconciliation of localizationist and antilocalizationist views of brain function."
https://openalex.org/W1631275459,"Abstract Phosvitin kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates the egg yolk protein phosvitin, has been purified more than 8000-fold from the supernatant of rooster liver, a tissue that synthesizes phosvitin only after estrogen administration. The purified enzyme prepared from the estrogen-treated liver was recovered in high yield (49%) and was very stable at 0–4°. It sedimented in sucrose as a single peak with a s20,w of approximately 7.6. Preliminary studies indicated that the native enzyme consists of several subunits with the major component having a molecular weight between 40,000 and 50,000. Rooster liver phosvitin kinase phosphorylated phosvitin at a 10-fold higher rate than it phosphorylated casein. It did not phosphorylate histone or protamine. Mg2+ stimulated the rate of phosphorylation, while Co2+ and Mn2+ were inhibitory. Phosvitin kinase activity was independent of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. A unique property of the enzyme was its ability to utilize GTP as well as ATP as a phosphate donor for phosphorylation of phosvitin. Despite the fact that estrogen administration to roosters led to a marked induction in the hepatic synthesis of phosvitin, there was no significant difference in the phosvitin kinases prepared from treated and untreated livers in either the specific activity or the apparent Km for ATP (7.7 µm). These data suggest that phosphorylation of phosvitin by phosvitin kinase is probably not a rate-limiting event in the over-all process by which estrogen induces specific protein synthesis in rooster liver."
https://openalex.org/W2059141207,"With the help of nonsiniusoidal acoustic stimuli, it is demonstrated that most fibers of the auditory nerve respond to both displacement and velocity of the basilar membrane. Except at very high stimulus levels, motion and displacement toward scala tympani produce excitation; motion and displacement toward scala vestibuli produce inhibition. The displacement and velocity responses interact. When both are excitatory or inhibitory, they reinforce each other; when they are of opposite nature, a partial cancellation occurs. The presence of both displacement and velocity responses in the single fibers suggests that outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea interact."

This change in the replaceable chalcogenide ligand shifts the potential at pH 7 from -235 mv (sulfur) to -245 mv (selenide). Analysis of the formal potentials of the sulfur protein over the range pH 6.5 to 10 indicates two proton-linked processes in the oxidized form (K' o1 = 1.0 x 10-8; K'o2 = 1.0 x 10-10) and one in the reduced form (K' r1 = 1.0 x 10-9).

https://openalex.org/W1645499448,"Abstract The reactions of hemoglobin Kansas (102 β Asn → Thr) have been examined by kinetic and equilibrium methods. The behavior of the T state toward oxygen, derived from oxygen binding and oxygen pulse experiments, appears similar to that of hemoglobin A. The behavior of the R tetramer is difficult to separate from that of the dimer (the dissociation constant, K4,2, for oxyhemoglobin Kansas is about 70 µm as against 1.5 µm for hemoglobin A), but correlation of kinetic and equilibrium data suggests that the R tetramer of hemoglobin Kansas has a lower affinity for oxygen than that of hemoglobin A. Carbon monoxide binding is slower than for hemoglobin A, chiefly because of a lower rate of binding by the β chains. Comparisons between carbon monoxide binding and release of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, and reaction with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate suggest that a conformation change (T → R transition) occurs on ligand binding as with hemoglobin A. Detailed examination of the dissociation reactions from the liganded dimers of oxygen and of carbon monoxide shows abnormally rapid dissociation from the β chain. The hemoglobin-haptoglobin reaction shows that deoxyhemoglobin Kansas is too slightly dissociated to give a measurable reaction. This result is consistent with an abnormally low ligand affinity of the R form. It is suggested that the differences between hemoglobin Kansas and hemoglobin A are due, at least in part, to differences between the R forms, and that an R → T transition occurs normally in hemoglobin Kansas. The allosteric effector 2,3-diphosphoglycerate lowers the affinity of hemoglobin Kansas for oxygen, but the effect is much smaller than for hemoglobin A when measured at high concentrations of hemoglobin. The data are most consistent with the assumption that the binding constant for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate at the primary site on tetrameric, liganded hemoglobin Kansas is only slightly lower than that for the unliganded form."
https://openalex.org/W1561193389,"Abstract The methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or methylcobalamin is converted to acetate in fermentations of pyruvate or α-ketobutyrate and has been studied using a cell free extract of Clostridium thermoaceticum. Evidence supporting the conclusion that the carboxyl of acetate is derived from the carboxyl of α-ketobutyrate (or pyruvate) by a mechanism involving transcarboxylation, and not from free CO2 as previously thought, is as follows: (a) carbon dioxide, a low potential reducing system (hydrogen, hydrogenase, and ferridoxin from Clostridium posteurianum (ATCC 6013)) and an adenosine triphosphate-generating system (acetyl-phosphate and adenosine diphosphate) do not replace the requirement for an α-keto acid in the conversion of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate to acetate; (b) attempts to demonstrate a dependence of the carboxylation upon CO2 were unsuccessful; the conversion was independent of CO2 at concentrations as low as 1 x 10-6 m; (c) kinetic tracer experiments conducted in the presence of either 14CO2 and a large pool of unlabeled α-ketobutyrate or α-[1-14C]ketobutyrate and a large pool of unlabeled CO2 demonstrated that the specific radioactivity of the acetate paralleled that of the carboxyl of α-ketobutyrate and not the CO2. The carboxyl of the α-keto acids exchanges rapidly with CO2; thus the acetate formed is labeled in both carbons from CO2 by C. thermoaceticum but not by a direct total synthesis from CO2 per se."

https://openalex.org/W1486735561,"The microsomal enzyme complex, aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase, is inducible by benz[a]anthracene in cells cloned from Buffalo rat liver. The enzyme complex can also be induced to high activity, without adding a polycyclic hydrocarbon inducer, by temporarily inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide or puromycin. This increase in enzyme activity is a function of both the degree and the duration of protein synthesis inhibition. It requires RNA synthesis during the period of inhibition of protein synthesis but not subsequent to the removal of the block; and it is prolonged in the presence of actinomycin D, when administered after the release of the block in protein synthesis. Combined exposure to benz[a]anthracene and cycloheximide is followed by an increase in enzyme activity which is greater than the sum of the increases which follow exposure to each compound alone. Qualitatively similar results were observed in four other mammalian cell culture systems. The results suggest two events in the regulation of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction: the inducer, benz[a]anthracene, acts primarily at the level of transcription, and a labile protein(s) regulates the translation of induction-specific RNA."

Methylation to the hexakis or heptakis (2,6-di-O-methyl) α- and β-cyclodextrins increases the stimulatory effect severalfold.

https://openalex.org/W2090989911,"The unresolved difficulties associated with defining and measuring population density strictly circumscribe the scope and nature of the conclusions that can be properly derived from differentials in man:land ratios. Any conclusions about human density will have meaning only to the extent that they are based on a recognition that this density must be viewed in both static and dynamic terms and that it cannot be isolated in analysis, from either the social and cultural setting, the demographic characteristics of the population, or the broader processes of social change within the society. In and of itself, the familiar man:land ratio says more about area than it does about either the human experience of density or the relation of population to resources. This ratio is therefore essentially meaningless as an indicator of comparative conditions of life among different countries and different geographic regions. The mere fact of having a relatively low average population density thus, does not automatically entitle a nation to complacency about its ability to adjust readily to future population change, either in terms of growth in numbers or in the geographic location of its people."

https://openalex.org/W1491124688,"The biosynthesis of proteins of chloroplastic (67 S) and cytoplasmic (83 S) ribosomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardi was studied in vivo using both wild type and the arginine auxotroph, arg-1. The incorporation of amino acids into nascent protein (chaseable label) and ribosomal structural protein (nonchaseable label) was examined. When cells of arg-1 were incubated with excess radioactive arginine, 83 S ribosomes were clearly labeled at 0.5 to 2.0 min. But, 67 S ribosomes were not, even though chloroplasts were carrying out protein synthesis. At these times much of the label in 83 S ribosomes was in nascent protein, but no labeled protein was found with 67 S ribosomes. When cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min and incubation continued, label was found in nascent protein of 83 S ribosomes at 2 and 4 min, but label was found only in structural protein at later times. In contrast, 67 S ribosomes did not become labeled until 6 min, and at no time from 2 to 20 min was label in nascent protein. When pulse-labeled cells were chased prior to 4 min, label in 83 S ribosomes decreased while label in 67 S ribosomes increased. At 6 min, chase had no effect on label in 83 S ribosomes, but increased label in 67 S ribosomes. The results could be explained if there was a delay in labeled amino acid reaching the chloroplast, or if 67 S ribosomes lost nascent protein during isolation. The results also indicated that labeled protein in 67 S ribosomes was not made on 67 S ribosomes, but appeared instead to have come from a pool of free labeled proteins whose ultimate source was nascent protein on 83 S ribosomes. When cells of arg-1 were labeled with radioactive arginine for 1 hour, both 67 S and 83 S ribosomes were clearly labeled, and were of equal specific radioactivities. Radioactivity was in structural protein. Similar results were obtained using wild type and radioactive leucine. Chloramphenicol was without detectable effect on labeling of structural protein of 67 S ribosomes, whether labeling was accomplished by incubating cells with radioactive amino acid for 2 min and chasing with unlabeled amino acid, or by incubating cells with radioactive amino acid for 60 min. Chloramphenicol, however, did effectively inhibit protein synthesis by the chloroplast, since it inhibited synthesis of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase. Also, chloramphenicol was ineffective as an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, since it was without inhibitory effect on synthesis of nascent protein attached to 83 S ribosomes. On the other hand, cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis by the cytoplasm, since it inhibited synthesis of nascent protein attached to 83 S ribosomes. It also inhibited synthesis of structural protein of 67 S ribosomes. It was concluded that most proteins of 67 S ribosomes were made on 83 S ribosomes. The possibility that a few proteins of 67 S ribosomes were made on 67 S ribosomes was not excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1647514464,"Abstract A mutant of Aerobacter aerogenes was isolated which is unable to synthesize purines de novo and to convert xanthylic acid to guanylic acid. Under suitable conditions, this mutant excretes xanthosine and riboflavin into the culture medium. The incorporation of 14C-labeled adenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine into riboflavin and xanthosince was studied with nonproliferating and proliferating cells of the mutant. No radioactivity from 14C-labeled adenine, hypoxanthine, or xanthine is incorporated into riboflavin, whereas all of these compounds are efficiently converted to xanthosine. On the other hand, [2-14C]guanine is incorporated into riboflavin without significant dilution, whereas only traces of radioactive label are incorporated into xanthosine. These results document with a high degree of certainty that the biosynthesis of riboflavin starts with guanine or a guanine compound."

The brain nuclei synthesized a similar proportion of RNA-poly(A) in the presence either of Mg(2+) or of Mn(2+) with (NH(4))(2)So(4). The RNA from neonatal brain nuclei appeared to have a greater proportion of poly(A)-containing RNA than nuclear products obtained from more mature neural tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1607172354,"Abstract This study attempts to identify the type and mechanism of RNA synthesis inhibited by N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-AAF). Two hours after the drug injection, the hepatic nuclear RNA synthesis was significantly inhibited when measured in intact nuclei in vitro. After the nuclei were sonicated and fractionated into nucleolar and nucleoplasmic fractions, it was found that the inhibitory effect was very slight in the nucleoplasmic fraction and was very extensive in the nucleolar fraction, where the inhibition by N-OH-AAF reached 90% 1 hour after the injection. Furthermore, when the endogenous template function of the nucleoli was abolished by actinomycin D and the RNA polymerase activity was determined in the presence of the exogenous synthetic template poly[d(A-T)], the polymerase activities of the nucleoli from the control and the carcinogen-treated animals became identical. These studies indicate that the inhibition of RNA synthesis, after acute N-OH-AAF treatment in vivo, is predominantly ribosomal RNA of nucleolar origin and is due to the impairment of the nucleolar DNA template function rather than to RNA polymerase per se."

https://openalex.org/W1544950188,"Abstract Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is metabolized via two enzymatic pathways: by phosphorylation to the nucleoside triphosphate arabinosyl-CTP or deamination to the inert metabolite uracil arabinoside. Resistance to cytosine arabinoside had been attributed to a decreased synthesis of arabinosyl-CTP, the active inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Steuart and Burke (Nature New Biol. 233, 109, 1971) suggested the increased deamination of cytosine arabinoside as an alternative mechanism of resistance in patients treated with this drug. In the present study the mechanism for the effect of cytosine arabinoside on nucleoside deaminase activity was investigated in cell culture. HeLa cells grown in medium with added cytosine arabinoside had a 4-fold increase in nucleoside deaminase activity. The increase is dependent on the concentration and time of exposure to cytosine arabinoside. The levels of four control enzymes were unaffected by this agent. No difference was found between the properties of nucleoside deaminase purified from cells grown in the presence of cytosine arabinoside and in controls. The early appearance of an increase in nucleoside deaminase in the absence of cell killing made selection of a mutant population improbable. Cycloheximide did not prevent the elevation in nucleoside deaminase indicating that the mechanism, unlike classical induction, may not be dependent on the synthesis of a new protein. These studies show that the presence of cytosine arabinoside in tissue culture leads to an increased activity of nucleoside deaminase which could result in accelerated drug degradation. This process may provide a mechanism for resistance to the antimetabolite."

https://openalex.org/W2047857632,"In the crystal structure of the thyroid hormone, 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, the 3' iodine is observed in the distal position, away from the alaninebearing ring of the thyroid hormone. This result had been anticipated from stereochemical and biological activity studies. However, previous observations of structures in which the 3' iodine was proximal had cast some doubt on the stability of the 3' distal conformation. This observation suggests that the relative energies of the two conformers is similar and that perhaps the barrier to rotation is not as great as previously supposed since both the distal and proximal conformers have now been observed in the solid state."
https://openalex.org/W2018882739,"Exposure of pine pollen to singlet oxygen, generated in an aqueous environment, resulted in a decrease in the relative quantities of unsaturated fatty acids that could be recovered by solvent extraction of surface and near surface pollen lipids. The involvement of excited oxygen was confirmed by substitution of deuterium oxide for water, which led to a twofold greater decrease in the unsaturated acids. The potential environmental and biomedical implications of these observations are discussed in terms of this model system."
https://openalex.org/W2038499053,Rats were rewarded for signaling large and small sensory evoked components with appropriate bar presses. Most rats operantly generated large components and correctly signaled only these. Two rats correctly signaled successful and unsuccessful attempts to generate large waves. One rat discriminated component amplitudes without operantly attempting to generate specific wave types.
https://openalex.org/W1613500138,"Abstract Tryptophanase from Aeromonas liquefaciens is composed of four apparently identical subunits of molecular weight near 54,000 as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium analyses in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 8 m urea, and tryptic peptide mapping. The 216,000 molecular weight native enzyme (now referred to as the monomer) aggregates into enzymatically active polymeric species. This is indicated from the fact that protein distribution and enzyme activity coincide in sucrose gradients and disc gel electrophoresis. From sedimentation coefficients and the molecular weights of the aggregates the type of polymerization appears to be monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer, etc. The degree of polymerization appears to be indefinite in that higher order polymers than a tetramer have been observed. This polymerization is readily induced by -20° freezing, but not by rapid freezing (about -70°) in an acetone-alcohol-Dry Ice bath. The aggregated species appear to be stable structures which are not in a rapid equilibrium with the monomer. Noncovalent forces are involved in holding together both the subunits of the monomer and the aggregated species of the monomer. KCl (1 m) or variation in pH does not result in polymerization of the monomer or depolymerization of its aggregates. Also, the charge per unit mass of the monomer and its aggregates are similar. These observations suggest that it is the interaction of nonpolar amino acid residues that stabilizes the structure of the aggregates."

This contamination may be a source of error in some studies, particularly in those measuring the endogenous concentrations of these catechols and their metabolic products."
