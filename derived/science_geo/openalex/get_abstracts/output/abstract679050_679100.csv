https://openalex.org/W3190872191,"Purpose We aimed to determine the degree to which reasons for primary care visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We used data from the University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to compare the most common reasons for primary care visits before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the number of visits and the number of patients seen for each of the 25 most common diagnostic codes. The proportion of visits involving virtual care was assessed as a secondary outcome. Results UTOPIAN family physicians ( N = 379) conducted 702,093 visits, involving 264,942 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2019 (pre-pandemic period), and 667,612 visits, involving 218,335 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Anxiety was the most common reason for visit, accounting for 9.2% of the total visit volume during the pandemic compared to 6.5% the year before. Diabetes and hypertension remained among the top 5 reasons for visit during the pandemic, but there were 23.7% and 26.2% fewer visits and 19.5% and 28.8% fewer individual patients accessing care for diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Preventive care visits were substantially reduced, with 89.0% fewer periodic health exams and 16.2% fewer well-baby visits. During the pandemic, virtual care became the dominant care format (77.5% virtual visits). Visits for anxiety and depression were the most common reasons for a virtual visit (90.6% virtual visits). Conclusion The decrease in primary care visit volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied based on the reason for the visit, with increases in visits for anxiety and decreases for preventive care and visits for chronic diseases. Implications of increased demands for mental health services and gaps in preventive care and chronic disease management may require focused efforts in primary care."
https://openalex.org/W3190057319,"Assessment in African populations suggest adjustment for ethnicity in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations derived from African Americans lead to overestimation of GFR and failure to determine severity in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, studies in African Europeans are limited. We aimed to assess accuracy of eGFR equations, with and without ethnicity adjustment compared with measured GFR in people of Black ethnicity in the United Kingdom. Performance of MDRD, CKD-EPI (with and without ethnicity adjustment), Full Age Spectrum (FAS), revised Lund Malmö (LM Revised), and European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) eGFR equations were assessed compared to 51Cr-EDTA GFR studies extracted from hospital databases. Participants with albumin <30g/l, liver disease, <18 years, of non-Black or non-White self-reported ethnicity were excluded. Agreement was assessed by bias, precision and 30%-accuracy and was stratified for ethnicity and GFR. 1888 51Cr-EDTA studies were included (Mean age-53.7yrs; 43.6% female; 14.1% Black ethnicity). Compared to White participants, eGFR-MDRD and eGFR-CKD-EPI equations in Black participants significantly overestimated GFR (bias 20.3 and 19.7 ml/min/1.73m2 respectively, p<0.001). Disregarding the ethnicity adjustment significantly improved GFR estimates for Black participants (bias 6.7 and 2.4ml/min/1.73m2 for eGFR-MDRD and eGFR-CKD-EPI respectively, p<0.001). The LM Revised equation had the smallest bias for both White and Black participants (5.8ml and -1.1ml/min/1.73m2 respectively). 30%-accuracy was superior for GFR≥60ml/min/1.73m2 compared to <60ml/min/1.73m2 using eGFR-CKD-EPI equation for both White and Black participants (p<0.001). Multivariate regression methodology with adjustment for age, sex and log(serum creatinine) in the cohort yielded an ethnicity coefficient of 1.018 (95% CI: 1.009-1.027). Overestimation of measured GFR with eGFR equations using ethnicity adjustment factors may lead to reduced CKD diagnosis and under-recognition of severity in people of Black ethnicity. Our findings suggest that ethnicity adjustment for GFR estimation in non-African Americans may not be appropriate for use in people of Black ethnicity in the UK."
https://openalex.org/W3151592636,"This study aims to determine how randomly splitting a dataset into training and test sets affects the estimated performance of a machine learning model and its gap from the test performance under different conditions, using real-world brain tumor radiomics data. We conducted two classification tasks of different difficulty levels with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features: (1) ""Simple"" task, glioblastomas [n = 109] vs. brain metastasis [n = 58] and (2) ""difficult"" task, low- [n = 163] vs. high-grade [n = 95] meningiomas. Additionally, two undersampled datasets were created by randomly sampling 50% from these datasets. We performed random training-test set splitting for each dataset repeatedly to create 1,000 different training-test set pairs. For each dataset pair, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model was trained and evaluated using various validation methods in the training set, and tested in the test set, using the area under the curve (AUC) as an evaluation metric. The AUCs in training and testing varied among different training-test set pairs, especially with the undersampled datasets and the difficult task. The mean (±standard deviation) AUC difference between training and testing was 0.039 (±0.032) for the simple task without undersampling and 0.092 (±0.071) for the difficult task with undersampling. In a training-test set pair with the difficult task without undersampling, for example, the AUC was high in training but much lower in testing (0.882 and 0.667, respectively); in another dataset pair with the same task, however, the AUC was low in training but much higher in testing (0.709 and 0.911, respectively). When the AUC discrepancy between training and test, or generalization gap, was large, none of the validation methods helped sufficiently reduce the generalization gap. Our results suggest that machine learning after a single random training-test set split may lead to unreliable results in radiomics studies especially with small sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3188813459,"Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification that regulates protein stability or function. Its substrate specificity is dictated by various E3 ligases. The human C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) complex is a newly discovered multi-subunit really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligase with only a few known ubiquitination targets. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques to gain insight into CTLH complex function and ubiquitination substrates in HeLa cells. First, global proteomics determined proteins that were significantly increased, and thus may be substrates targeted for degradation, in cells depleted of CTLH complex member RanBPM. RanBPM-dependent ubiquitination determined using diGLY-enriched proteomics and the endogenous RanBPM interactome further revealed candidate ubiquitination targets. Three glycolysis enzymes alpha-enolase, L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA), and pyruvate kinase M1/2 (PKM) had decreased ubiquitin sites in shRanBPM cells and were found associated with RanBPM in the interactome. Reduced polyubiquitination was validated for PKM2 and LDHA in cells depleted of RanBPM and CTLH complex RING domain subunit RMND5A. PKM2 and LDHA protein levels were unchanged, yet their activity was increased in extracts of cells with downregulated RanBPM. Finally, RanBPM deficient cells displayed enhanced glycolysis and deregulated central carbon metabolism. Overall, this study identifies potential CTLH complex ubiquitination substrates and uncovers that the CTLH complex inhibits glycolysis via non-degradative ubiquitination of PKM2 and LDHA."
https://openalex.org/W3187606788,"Normal pregnancy is essential for human reproduction. However, BaP (benzo(a)pyrene) and its metabolite BPDE (benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide) could cause dysfunctions of human trophoblast cells and might further induce miscarriage. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Herein, we identified a novel upregulated lnc-HZ04 and a novel downregulated miR-hz04 in villous tissues of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM) relative to those in healthy control tissues and also in BPDE-treated human trophoblast cells. Lnc-HZ04 directly and specifically bound with miR-hz04, diminished the reduction effects of miR-hz04 on IP3R1 mRNA expression level and on IP3R1 mRNA stability, and then activated the Ca2+-mediated IP3R1/p-CaMKII/SGCB pathway, which further promoted trophoblast cell apoptosis. The miR-hz04 target site on lnc-HZ04 played crucial roles in these regulations. In normal trophoblast, relatively less lnc-HZ04 and more miR-hz04 suppressed this apoptosis pathway and gave normal pregnancy. After exposure to BPDE or in RM tissues, p53 was upregulated, which might promote p53-mediated lnc-HZ04 transcription. Relatively more lnc-HZ04 and less miR-hz04 activated this apoptosis pathway and might further induce miscarriage. BaP could also induce mice miscarriage by upregulating its corresponding murine apoptosis pathway. Therefore, BPDE-induced apoptosis of human trophoblast cells was associated with the occurrence of miscarriage. This work discovered the regulation roles of lnc-HZ04 and miR-hz04 and provided scientific and clinical understanding of the occurrence of unexplained miscarriage."
https://openalex.org/W3189027226,"Influenza vaccination coverage in countries of Latin America is low among priority risk groups, ranging from 5 to 75% among older people. This paper aims to describe and analyze the determinants of influenza vaccination hesitancy through the lens of the 3C model of confidence, complacency and convenience among middle-class, urban risk group populations in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, countries in South America with contrasting vaccination coverage. Focus groups were conducted among four risk groups: pregnant women, mothers of children aged <6 years, adults with risk factors, and adults aged ≥60 years in samples of urban residents. Adults with risk factors expressed the most detailed perceptions about confidence in the vaccine. A wide range of perceptions regarding complacency were expressed across risk groups and countries, with pregnant women and mothers showing greater concerns while convenience had a narrower and generally more positive range of perceptions. Participants from Chile and Paraguay expressed the most contrasts regarding confidence and complacency. Information and communication strategies need to be tailored for risk groups while confidence and complacency should be addressed in synergy."
https://openalex.org/W3189843591,"The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying complex axon morphogenesis are still poorly understood. We report a novel, evolutionary conserved function for the Drosophila Wnk kinase (dWnk) and its mammalian orthologs, WNK1 and 2, in axon branching. We uncover that dWnk, together with the neuroprotective factor Nmnat, antagonizes the axon-destabilizing factors D-Sarm and Axundead (Axed) during axon branch growth, revealing a developmental function for these proteins. Overexpression of D-Sarm or Axed results in axon branching defects, which can be blocked by overexpression of dWnk or Nmnat. Surprisingly, Wnk kinases are also required for axon maintenance of adult Drosophila and mouse cortical pyramidal neurons. Requirement of Wnk for axon maintenance is independent of its developmental function. Inactivation of dWnk or mouse Wnk1/2 in mature neurons leads to axon degeneration in the adult brain. Therefore, Wnk kinases are novel signaling components that provide a safeguard function in both developing and adult axons."
https://openalex.org/W3189573944,"The COVID-19 pandemic incited unprecedented restrictions on the behavior of society. The aims of this study were to quantify changes to sleep/wake behavior and exercise behavior, as well as changes in physiological markers of health during COVID-19 physical distancing. A retrospective analysis of 5,436 US-based subscribers to the WHOOP platform (mean age = 40.25 ± 11.33; 1,536 females, 3,900 males) was conducted covering the period from January 1st, 2020 through May 15th, 2020. This time period was separated into a 68-day baseline period and a 67-day physical distancing period. To provide context and allow for potential confounders (e.g., change of season), data were also extracted from the corresponding time periods in 2019. As compared to baseline, during physical distancing, all subjects fell asleep earlier (-0.15 hours), woke up later (0.29 hours), obtained more sleep (+0.21 hours) and reduced social jet lag (-0.13 hours). Contrasting sleep behavior was seen in 2019, with subjects falling asleep and waking up at a similar time (-0.01 hours; -0.03 hours), obtaining less sleep (-0.14 hours) and maintaining social jet lag (+0.06 hours) in corresponding periods. Individuals exercised more intensely during physical distancing by increasing the time spent in high heart rate zones. In 2020, resting heart rate decreased (-0.90 beats per minute) and heart rate variability increased (+0.98 milliseconds) during physical distancing when compared to baseline. However, similar changes were seen in 2019 for RHR (-0.51 beats per minute) and HRV (+2.97 milliseconds), suggesting the variation may not be related to the introduction of physical distancing mandates. The findings suggest that individuals improved health related behavior (i.e., increased exercise intensity and longer sleep duration) during physical distancing restrictions. While positive changes were seen to cardiovascular indicators of health, it is unclear whether these changes were a direct consequence of behavior change."
https://openalex.org/W3187800666,"Pneumonia causes short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in a high proportion of patients, although the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pneumonia-elicited cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants: (1) are present in the circulation during infection; (2) lead to impairment of long-term potentiation; and, (3) inhibit long-term potentiation dependent upon tau. Cytotoxic amyloid and tau species were recovered from the blood and the hippocampus following pneumonia, and they were present in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation oxygenators of patients with pneumonia, especially in those who died. Introduction of immunopurified blood-borne amyloid and tau into either the airways or the blood of uninfected animals acutely and chronically impaired hippocampal information processing. In contrast, the infection did not impair long-term potentiation in tau knockout mice and the amyloid- and tau-dependent disruption in hippocampal signaling was less severe in tau knockout mice. Moreover, the infection did not elicit cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants in tau knockout mice. Therefore, pneumonia initiates a tauopathy that contributes to cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3190650812,"Despite significant public health emphasis on unintended pregnancy prevention among adolescent girls and young women in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a gap in understanding how adolescents' own reproductive priorities and the social influences on their decision-making align and compete. We examined the social context of contraceptive decision-making among Kenyan female adolescents.Using community-based sampling, we conducted 40 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group discussions among sexually-active or partnered adolescent girls and young women aged 15-19 in the Nyanza region of Kenya. We analyzed the data in Dedoose using an inductive, grounded theory approach, and developed a conceptual model from the data illustrating social influences on adolescent contraceptive decision-making.Participants viewed adolescent pregnancy as unacceptable, and described severe social, financial, and health consequences of unintended pregnancy, including abortion under unsafe conditions. Yet, their contraceptive behaviors often did not reflect their desire to delay pregnancy. Contraceptive decision-making was influenced by multiple social factors, centering on the intersecting stigmas of adolescent female sexuality, pregnancy, and contraceptive use, as well as unequal power in sexual relationships. To prioritize pregnancy prevention, adolescents must navigate conflicting social norms and power dynamics, and put their perceived future fertility at risk.Contraceptive decision-making among Kenyan female adolescents is strongly influenced by opposing social norms within families, communities, and sexual relationships, which compel them to risk stigma whether they use a contraceptive method or become pregnant as adolescents. These findings put into perspective adolescents' seemingly incongruent pregnancy preferences and contraceptive behaviors. Interventions to address adolescent unintended pregnancy should focus on supporting adolescent decision-making agency, addressing fertility-related contraceptive concerns, and promoting innovative contraceptive access points rather than increasing contraceptive prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3192226598,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) combined with immunosuppression has been the cornerstone of the initial management. To produce optimal benefits, emerging treatments must be used against a background of best standard of care. Clarifying current uncertainties is therefore crucial.The objective of this study was to analyze a large high-quality database (Marketscan) of TTP patients managed between 2005 and 2014, in the pre-caplacizumab era, in order to assess the impact of time to first TPE and use of first-line rituximab on mortality, and whether mortality declines over time.Among the 1096 included patients (median age 46 [IQR 35-55], 70% female), 28.8% received TPE before day 2 in the ICU. Hospital mortality was 7.6% (83 deaths). Mortality was independently associated with older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.024/year; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], [1.009-1.040]), diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 2.360; 95%CI [1.552-3.588]), and the need for mechanical ventilation (HR, 4.103; 95%CI, [2.749-6.126]). Factors independently associated with lower mortality were TPE at ICU admission (HR, 0.284; 95%CI, [0.112-0.717]), TPE within one day after ICU admission (HR, 0.449; 95%CI, [0.275-0.907]), and early rituximab therapy (HR, 0.229; 95% CI, [0.111-0.471]). Delayed TPE was associated with significantly higher costs.Immediate TPE and early rituximab are associated with improved survival in TTP patients. Improved treatments have led to a decline in mortality over time, and alternate outcome variables such as the use of hospital resources or longer term outcomes therefore need to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3187233370,"Salivary biomarkers have been widely used to help diagnose stress, anxiety, and/or depression. This study aimed to compare the responses of three commonly investigated salivary stress biomarkers that represent the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity (cortisol; sCort) and the sympathetic activity (alpha-amylase; sAA and chromogranin A; sCgA), using academic oral presentation as a model of stress. Twenty postgraduate dental students attended the seminar class as presenter and audience. The presenters' performances were evaluated by the instructors suggesting more stress than the audience. The saliva was collected two times: before attending class and after an academic presentation (for presenters) or during the class (for audience). The pulse rates (PR) were also recorded. The results showed that the levels of all three biomarkers, as well as PR, were significantly higher in the presenter group compared with the audience group; however, the changes were most prominent with sCort and sAA (99.56 ± 12.76% for sCort, 93.48 ± 41.29% for sAA, 16.86 ± 6.42% for sCgA, and 15.06 ± 3.41% for PR). When compared between pre-post presentation, the levels of sCgA were not different, while those of sCort and sAA were significantly increased. These results suggest more sensitive reactivity to academic stress of sCort and sAA compared with sCgA and that the response of sCgA did not necessarily follow sAA pattern even though both are claimed to reflect the sympathetic activity. More studies are needed to elucidate the roles of sCgA in stress."
https://openalex.org/W3193188230,"Background The remarkable progress seen in maternal and child health (MCH) in India over the past two decades has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to undertake a rapid assessment to identify key priorities for public health research in MCH in India within the context and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A web-based survey was developed to identify top research priorities in MCH. It consisted of 26 questions on six broad domains: vaccine preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary healthcare integration, maternal health, neonatal health, and infectious diseases. Key stakeholders were invited to participate between September and November 2020. Participants assigned importance on a 5-point Likert scale, and assigned overall ranks to each sub-domain research priority. Descriptive statistics were used to examine Likert scale responses, and a ranking analysis was done to obtain an “average ranking score” and identify the top research priority under each domain. Results Amongst the 84 respondents from across 15 Indian states, 37% were public-health researchers, 25% healthcare providers, 20% academic faculty and 13% were policy makers. Most respondents considered conducting systems strengthening research as extremely important. The highest ranked research priorities were strengthening the public sector workforce (vaccine preventable diseases), enhancing public-health surveillance networks (outbreak preparedness), nutrition support through community workers (primary care integration), encouraging at least 4–8 antenatal visits (maternal health), neonatal resuscitation to reduce birth asphyxia (neonatal health) and screening and treatment of tuberculosis (infectious diseases). Common themes identified through open-ended questions primarily included systems strengthening priorities across domains. Conclusions The overall focus for research priorities in MCH in India during the COVID-19 pandemic is on strengthening existing services and service delivery, rather than novel research. Our results highlight pivotal steps within the roadmap for advancing and sustaining maternal and child health gains during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3187192589,"As a result of the relatively few available antifungals and the increasing frequency of resistance to them, the development of novel antifungals is increasingly important. The plant natural product poacic acid (PA) inhibits β-1,3-glucan synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has antifungal activity against a wide range of plant pathogens. However, the mode of action of PA is unclear. Here, we reveal that PA specifically binds to β-1,3-glucan, its affinity for which is ~30-fold that for chitin. Besides its effect on β-1,3-glucan synthase activity, PA inhibited the yeast glucan-elongating activity of Gas1 and Gas2 and the chitin–glucan transglycosylase activity of Crh1. Regarding the cellular response to PA, transcriptional co-regulation was mediated by parallel activation of the cell-wall integrity (CWI) and high-osmolarity glycerol signaling pathways. Despite targeting β-1,3-glucan remodeling, the transcriptional profiles and regulatory circuits activated by caspofungin, zymolyase, and PA differed, indicating that their effects on CWI have different mechanisms. The effects of PA on the growth of yeast strains indicated that it has a mode of action distinct from that of echinocandins, suggesting it is a unique antifungal agent."
https://openalex.org/W3187441665,"Acute and chronic alcohol use can cause skeletal muscle myopathy in concert with impairments in skeletal muscle strength, function and fatigue resistance. However, the fundamental contractile deficits induced in the presence of alcohol versus those observed in the recovery period following the clearance of alcohol have not yet been characterized nor is it known whether sex influences these outcomes.Male and female mice received an intraperitoneal injection of either saline (Control) or ethanol (EtOH; 5g/kg body weight). Muscle force, fatigue, fatigue recovery and twitch characteristics of the posterior crural muscle complex were measured in situ 1 hour and 24 hours post alcohol.In the presence of alcohol (1-hour post treatment) absolute and normalized force generated at 80-150 Hertz was decreased in male and female mice with concurrent reductions in the rate of force development and increases in ½ relaxation time. When expressed as a percentage of maximum force, both males and females also displayed an alcohol-induced leftward shift in the force frequency curve indicative of a type I contractile phenotype. Alcohol enhanced fatigue in both males and females but had no effect on force recovery. Following clearance of alcohol (24-hour post treatment), contractile function was completely restored in females while alcohol treated males experienced sustained reductions in absolute force and had enhanced fatigue compared with male controls.In the presence of alcohol, both males and females exhibited significant declines in muscle force production and enhanced fatigue; however, following complete clearance of the alcohol, females recovered all functional parameters, while males did not."
https://openalex.org/W3187811987,"Background Mexico is one of the countries with the highest number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of this high mortality, in Mexico the number of confirmed cases and diagnostic tests per million population are lower than for other comparable countries, which leads to uncertainty about the actual extent of the pandemic. In Mexico City, healthcare workers represent an important fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a cross-sectional study whose objective was to estimate the frequency of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and identify associated factors in healthcare workers at a large hospital in Mexico City. Methods We conducted a serological survey in a non-COVID national referral teaching hospital. The study population included all the personnel that works, in any capacity, in the hospital. From this population we selected a representative sample of 300 individuals. Blood samples were collected and questionnaires were applied between August 10 th and September 9 th , 2020. Results ELISA results indicate a serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 13.0%. Working in the janitorial and security groups, having an educational level below a university degree, and living with a larger number of people, were all identified as sociodemographic factors that increase the probability of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions Less favored socioeconomic groups face significantly higher prospects of experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection and in institutions such as ours, providing janitorial and security workgroups with additional testing and counseling could help to limit the spread of contagion. The rate from the official number of confirmed cases in Mexico City is substantially smaller than the seropositive rate identified in this work."
https://openalex.org/W3189818057,"Conspiracy theories in social networks are considered to have adverse effects on individuals’ compliance with public health measures in the context of a pandemic situation. A deeper understanding of how conspiracy theories propagate through social networks is critical for the development of countermeasures. The present work focuses on a novel approach to characterize the propagation of conspiracy theories through social networks by applying epidemiological models to Twitter data. A Twitter dataset was searched for tweets containing hashtags indicating belief in the “5GCoronavirus” conspiracy theory, which states that the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of, or enhanced by, the enrollment of the 5G mobile network. Despite the absence of any scientific evidence, the “5GCoronavirus” conspiracy theory propagated rapidly through Twitter, beginning at the end of January, followed by a peak at the beginning of April, and ceasing/disappearing approximately at the end of June 2020. An epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model was fitted to this time series with acceptable model fit, indicating parallels between the propagation of conspiracy theories in social networks and infectious diseases. Extended SIR models were used to simulate the effects that two specific countermeasures, fact-checking and tweet-deletion, could have had on the propagation of the conspiracy theory. Our simulations indicate that fact-checking is an effective mechanism in an early stage of conspiracy theory diffusion, while tweet-deletion shows only moderate efficacy but is less time-sensitive. More generally, an early response is critical to gain control over the spread of conspiracy theories through social networks. We conclude that an early response combined with strong fact-checking and a moderate level of deletion of problematic posts is a promising strategy to fight conspiracy theories in social networks. Results are discussed with respect to their theoretical validity and generalizability."
https://openalex.org/W3190308499,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed the work of general practitioners (GPs). At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, German outpatient practices had to adapt quickly. Pandemic preparedness (PP) of GPs may play a vital role in their management of a pandemic. Objectives The study aimed to examine the association in the stock of seven personal protective equipment (PPE) items and knowledge of pandemic plans on perceived PP among GPs. Methods Three multivariable linear regression models were developed based on an online cross-sectional survey for the period March–April 2020 (the onset of the pandemic in Germany). Data were collected using self-developed items on self-assessed PP and knowledge of a pandemic plan and its utility. The stock of seven PPE items was queried. For PPE items, three different PPE scores were compared. Control variables for all models were gender and age. Results In total, 508 GPs were included in the study; 65.16% believed that they were very poorly or poorly prepared. Furthermore, 13.83% of GPs were aware of a pandemic plan; 40% rated those plans as beneficial. The stock of FFP-2/3 masks, protective suits, face shields, safety glasses, and medical face masks were mostly considered completely insufficient or insufficient, whereas disposable gloves and disinfectants were considered sufficient or completely sufficient. The stock of PPE was significantly positively associated with PP and had the largest effect on PP; the association of the knowledge of a pandemic plan was significant but small. PPE scores did not vary considerably in their explanatory power. The assessment of a pandemic plan as beneficial did not significantly affect PP. Conclusion The stock of PPE seems to be the determining factor for PP among German GPs; for COVID-19, sufficient masks are the determining factor. Knowledge of a pandemic plans play a secondary role in PP."
https://openalex.org/W3189231398,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a hereditary genetic disorder that results in numerous clinical manifestations including olfactory dysfunction. Of at least 21 BBS-related genes that can carry multiple mutations, a pathogenic mutation, BBS1M390R, is the single most common mutation of clinically diagnosed BBS outcomes. While the deletion of BBS-related genes in mice can cause variable penetrance in different organ systems, the impact of the Bbs1M390R mutation in the olfactory system remains unclear. Using a clinically relevant knock-in mouse model homozygous for Bbs1M390R, we investigated the impact of the mutation on the olfactory system and tested the potential of viral-mediated, wildtype gene replacement therapy to rescue smell loss. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in Bbs1M390R/M390R mice were significantly shorter and fewer than those of wild-type mice. Also, both peripheral cellular odor detection and synaptic-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb were significantly decreased in the mutant mice. Furthermore, to gain insight into the degree to which perceptual features are impaired in the mutant mice, we used whole-body plethysmography to quantitatively measure odor-evoked sniffing. The Bbs1M390R/M390R mice showed significantly higher odor detection thresholds (reduced odor sensitivity) compared to wild-type mice; however, their odor discrimination acuity was still well maintained. Importantly, adenoviral expression of Bbs1 in OSNs restored cilia length and re-established both peripheral odorant detection and odor perception. Together, our findings further expand our understanding for the development of gene therapeutic treatment for congenital ciliopathies in the olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W3189429484,"This study estimated the prevalence and incidence rate of schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders (SSDD) in Korea from 2008 to 2017 and analyzed the hospital admission rate, re-admission rate, and hospitalization period. It used the Korean nationwide National Health Insurance Service claims database. SSDD patients who had at least one visit to Korea's primary, secondary, or tertiary referral hospitals with a diagnosis of SSDD, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), were identified as SSDD cases if coded as F20-F29. Data were analyzed using frequency statistics. Results showed that the 12-month prevalence rate of SSDD increased steadily from 0.40% in 2008 to 0.45% in 2017. Analysis of the three-year cumulative prevalence rate of SSDD showed an increase from 0.51% in 2011 to 0.54% in 2017. In 2017, the five-year cumulative prevalence rate was 0.61%, and the 10-year cumulative prevalence rate was 0.75%. The hospital admission rate among SSDD patients decreased from 2008 (30.04%) to 2017 (28.53%). The incidence of SSDD was 0.05% and no yearly change was observed. The proportion of SSDD inpatients whose first hospital visit resulted in immediate hospitalization was 22.4% in 2017. Epidemiological indicators such as prevalence, incidence, and hospitalization rate play an important role in planning social and financial resource allocation. Therefore, efforts to produce more accurate epidemiological indicators are very important and this study's findings could have a significant social impact."
https://openalex.org/W3189676637,"Despite an ongoing focus on the role of diet in health and disease, we have only a limited understanding of these concepts at the cellular and molecular levels. While obesity has been clearly recognized as contributing to metabolic syndrome and the pathogenesis of adult asthma, recent evidence has linked high sugar intake alone to an increased risk of developing asthma in childhood. In this study, we examined the impact of diet in a mouse model of allergic airways inflammation with a specific focus on eosinophils. As anticipated, male C57BL/6 mice gained weight on a high-calorie, high-fat diet. However, mice also gained weight on an isocaloric high-sucrose diet. Elevated levels of leptin were detected in the serum and airways of mice maintained on the high-fat, but not the high-sucrose diets. We found that diet alone had no impact on eosinophil numbers in the airways at baseline or their recruitment in response to allergen (Alternaria alternata) challenge in either wild-type or leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. However, both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and eosinophils isolated from lung tissue of allergen-challenged mice exhibited profound diet-dependent differences in cytokine content. Similarly, while all wild-type mice responded to allergen challenge with significant increases in methacholine-dependent total airway resistance (Rrs), airway resistance in mice maintained on the isocaloric high-sucrose (but not the high-calorie/high-fat) diet significantly exceeded that of mice maintained on the basic diet. In summary, our findings revealed that mice maintained on an isocaloric high-sucrose diet responded to allergen challenge with significant changes in both BAL and eosinophil cytokine content together with significant increases in Rrs. These results provide a model for further exploration of the unique risks associated with a high-sugar diet and its impact on allergen-associated respiratory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3190301934,"Organisms are exposed to a wealth of chemical information during their development. Some of these chemical cues indicate present or future dangers, such as the presence of predators that feed on either the developing embryos or their nearby parents. Organisms may use this information to modify their morphology or life-history, including hatching timing, or may retain information about risk until it gains relevance. Previous research has shown predation-induced alterations in hatching among embryonic minnows that were exposed to mechanical-injury-released alarm cues from conspecific embryos. Here, we test whether minnows likewise hatch early in response to alarm cues from injured adult conspecifics. We know that embryonic minnows can detect adult alarm cues and use them to facilitate learned recognition of predators; however, it is unknown whether these adult alarm cues will also induce a change in hatching time. Early hatching may allow animals to rapidly disperse away from potential predators, but late hatching may allow animals to grow and develop structures that allow them to effectively escape when they do hatch. Here, we found here that unlike embryonic fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to embryonic cues, embryonic minnows exposed to adult alarm cues do not exhibit early hatching. The ability of embryos to recognize adult alarm cues as a future threat, but not a current one, demonstrates sophisticated ontogenetic specificity in the hatching response of embryonic minnows."
https://openalex.org/W3191173887,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a debilitating human pathogenesis in which the body's immune functions are severely compromised. Various subsets of T cells, including Th17 cells are important regulators of immune responses observed in various pathologies. The role of Th17 cells and its correlation with immuno-regulatory cytokines are however not well understood in human VL. Herein we studied how IL-17 is associated with the progression of Leishmania donovani infection using murine model of VL. We found induction of a strong IL-17 response at the early phase of infection which progressively reduced to basal level during chronic VL. The mechanistic study of this behavior was found to be linked with the role of regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+ T cells) that suppresses the proliferation of the Th17 cell population. Moreover, TGF-β and IL-35 derived from CD4+ CD25+ T cells are the key mediators for the downregulation of IL-17 during chronic VL. Thus, this study points to an antagonistic effect of Tregs and Th17 cells that can be used for designing better therapeutic and preventive strategies against leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W3191436732,"The nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) is a transcriptional regulator of macrophage activation and T-cell development, which controls stabilizing responses of cells to hypertonic and biomechanical stress. In this study, we detected NFAT5 in the media layer of arteries adjacent to human arteriosclerotic plaques and analyzed its role in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) known to contribute to arteriosclerosis through the uptake of lipids and transformation into foam cells. Exposure of both human and mouse VSMCs to cholesterol stimulated the nuclear translocation of NFAT5 and increased the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter Abca1, required to regulate cholesterol efflux from cells. Loss of Nfat5 promoted cholesterol accumulation in these cells and inhibited the expression of genes involved in the management of oxidative stress or lipid handling, such as Sod1, Plin2, Fabp3, and Ppard. The functional relevance of these observations was subsequently investigated in mice fed a high-fat diet upon induction of a smooth muscle cell-specific genetic ablation of Nfat5 (Nfat5(SMC)−/−). Under these conditions, Nfat5(SMC)−/− but not Nfat5fl/fl mice developed small, focal lipid-rich lesions in the aorta after 14 and 25 weeks, which were formed by intracellular lipid droplets deposited in the sub-intimal VSMCs layer. While known for being activated by external stimuli, NFAT5 was found to mediate the expression of VSMC genes associated with the handling of lipids in response to a cholesterol-rich environment. Failure of this protective function may promote the formation of lipid-laden arterial VSMCs and pro-atherogenic vascular responses."
https://openalex.org/W3192873986,"fMRI is the preeminent method for collecting signals from the human brain in vivo, for using these signals in the service of functional discovery, and relating these discoveries to anatomical structure. Numerous computational and mathematical techniques have been deployed to extract information from the fMRI signal. Yet, the application of Topological Data Analyses (TDA) remain limited to certain sub-areas such as connectomics (that is, with summarized versions of fMRI data). While connectomics is a natural and important area of application of TDA, applications of TDA in the service of extracting structure from the (non-summarized) fMRI data itself are heretofore nonexistent. ""Structure"" within fMRI data is determined by dynamic fluctuations in spatially distributed signals over time, and TDA is well positioned to help researchers better characterize mass dynamics of the signal by rigorously capturing shape within it. To accurately motivate this idea, we a) survey an established method in TDA (""persistent homology"") to reveal and describe how complex structures can be extracted from data sets generally, and b) describe how persistent homology can be applied specifically to fMRI data. We provide explanations for some of the mathematical underpinnings of TDA (with expository figures), building ideas in the following sequence: a) fMRI researchers can and should use TDA to extract structure from their data; b) this extraction serves an important role in the endeavor of functional discovery, and c) TDA approaches can complement other established approaches toward fMRI analyses (for which we provide examples). We also provide detailed applications of TDA to fMRI data collected using established paradigms, and offer our software pipeline for readers interested in emulating our methods. This working overview is both an inter-disciplinary synthesis of ideas (to draw researchers in TDA and fMRI toward each other) and a detailed description of methods that can motivate collaborative research."
https://openalex.org/W3189015354,"The growing global health burden of kidney disease is substantial and the nephrology workforce is critical to managing it. There are concerns that the nephrology workforce appears to be shrinking in many countries. This study analyses trends in South Africa for the period 2002-2017, describes current training capacity and uses this as a basis for forecasting the nephrology workforce for 2030.Data on registered nephrologists for the period 2002 to 2017 was obtained from the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa. Training capacity was assessed using data on government-funded posts for nephrologists and nephrology trainees, as well as training post numbers (the latter reflecting potential training capacity). Based on the trends, the gap in the supply of nephrologists was forecast for 2030 based on three targets: reducing the inequalities in provincial nephrologist densities, reducing the gap between public and private sector nephrologist densities, and international benchmarking using the Global Kidney Health Atlas and British Renal Society recommendations.The number of nephrologists increased from 53 to 141 (paediatric nephrologists increased from 9 to 22) over the period 2002-2017. The density in 2017 was 2.5 nephrologists per million population (pmp). In 2002, the median age of nephrologists was 46 years (interquartile range (IQR) 39-56 years) and in 2017 the median age was 48 years (IQR 41-56 years). The number of female nephrologists increased from 4 to 43 and the number of Black nephrologists increased from 3 to 24. There have been no nephrologists practising in the North West and Mpumalanga provinces and only one each in Limpopo and the Northern Cape. The current rate of production of nephrologists is eight per year. At this rate, and considering estimates of nephrologists exiting the workforce, there will be 2.6 nephrologists pmp in 2030. There are 17 government-funded nephrology trainee posts while the potential number based on the prescribed trainer-trainee ratio is 72. To increase the nephrologist density of all provinces to at least the level of KwaZulu-Natal (2.8 pmp), which has a density closest to the country average, a projected 72 additional nephrologists (six per year) would be needed by 2030. Benchmarking against the 25th centile (5.1 pmp) of upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) reported in the Global Kidney Health Atlas would require the training of an additional eight nephrologists per year.South Africa has insufficient nephrologists, especially in the public sector and in certain provinces. A substantial increase in the production of new nephrologists is required. This requires an increase in funded training posts and posts for qualified nephrologists in the public sector. This study has estimated the numbers and distribution of nephrologists needed to address provincial inequalities and achieve realistic nephrologist density targets."
https://openalex.org/W3190443583,"The objective was to investigate risk factors and risk profiles associated with neck pain in young adults using longitudinal data from the North-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). Risk factors were collected from adolescents (13–19 years of age), and neck pain was measured 11 years later. The sample was divided into two: Sample I included all participants (n = 1433), and Sample II (n = 832) included only participants who reported no neck/shoulder pain in adolescence. In multiple regression analyses in Sample I, female sex (OR = 1.9, 95% CI [1.3–2.9]), low physical activity level (OR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.0–2.5]), loneliness (OR = 2.0, 95% CI [1.2–3.5]), headache/migraine (OR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.2–2.6]), back pain (OR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.0–2.4]) and neck/shoulder pain (OR = 2.0, 95% [CI 1.3–3.0]) were associated with neck pain at the 11-year follow-up. Those with a risk profile including all these risk factors had the highest probability of neck pain of 67% in girls and 50% in boys. In Sample II, multiple regression analyses revealed that female sex (OR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.3–3.7]) and perceived low family income (OR = 2.4, 95% CI [1.1–5.1]) were associated with neck pain at the 11-year follow-up. Girls and boys with a perceived low family income had a 29% and 17% higher probability of neck pain than adolescents with a perceived high family income. The risk profiles in both samples showed that co-occurrence of risk factors, such as headache/migraine, neck/shoulder pain, back pain, low physical activity level, loneliness, and perceived low family income cumulatively increased the probability of neck pain in young adulthood. These results underline the importance of taking a broad perspective when studying, treating, and preventing neck pain in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3187387695,"As electronic cigarette (E-cig) use, also known as ""vaping"", has rapidly increased in popularity, data regarding potential pathologic effects are recently emerging. Recent associations between vaping and lung pathology have led to an increased need to scrutinize E-cigs for adverse health impacts. Our previous work (and others) has associated vaping with Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity in cultured human airway epithelial cells. Herein, we develop a vaped e-liquid pulmonary exposure mouse model to evaluate vaping effects in vivo. Using this model, we demonstrate lung pathology through the use of preclinical measures, that is, the lung wet: dry ratio and lung histology/H&E staining. Further, we demonstrate that acute vaping increases macrophage chemotaxis, which was ascertained using flow cytometry-based techniques, and inflammatory cytokine production, via Luminex analysis, through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. This increase in macrophage activation appears to exacerbate pulmonary pathology resulting from microbial infection. Importantly, modulating Ca2+ signaling may present a therapeutic direction for treatment against vaping-associated pulmonary inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3187475154,"Neuron-derived orphan receptor 1, NR4A3 (Nor1)/NR4A3 is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in the transcriptional control of developmental and neurological functions. Oxidative stress-induced conditions are primarily associated with neurological defects in humans, yet the impact on Nor1-mediated transcription of neuronal genes remains with unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that Nor1 is a non-conventional target of SUMO2/3 conjugation at Lys-137 contained in an atypic ψKxSP motif referred to as the pSuM. Nor1 pSuM SUMOylation differs from the canonical process with the obligate phosphorylation of Ser-139 by Ras signaling to create the required negatively charged interface for SUMOylation. Additional phosphorylation at sites flanking the pSuM is also mediated by the coordinated action of protein kinase casein kinase 2 to function as a small ubiquitin-like modifier enhancer, regulating Nor1-mediated transcription and proteasomal degradation. Nor1 responsive genes involved in cell proliferation and metabolism, such as activating transcription factor 3, cyclin D1, CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator, and enolase 3 were upregulated in response to pSuM disruption in mouse HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We also identified critical antioxidant genes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2, as responsive targets of Nor1 under pSuM regulation. Nor1 SUMOylation impaired gene transcription through less effective Nor1 chromatin binding and reduced enrichment of histone H3K27ac marks to gene promoters. These effects resulted in decreased neuronal cell growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced survival to oxidative stress damage, underlying the role of pSuM-modified Nor1 in redox homeostasis. Our findings uncover a hierarchical post-translational mechanism that dictates Nor1 non-canonical SUMOylation, disrupting Nor1 transcriptional competence, and neuroprotective redox sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3190857481,"Mutations in transcription factors often exhibit pleiotropic effects related to their complex expression patterns and multiple regulatory targets. One such mutation in the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) transcription factor, short circuit (Sci, Zfhx3Sci/+ ), is associated with significant circadian deficits in mice. However, given evidence of its retinal expression, we set out to establish the effects of the mutation on retinal function using molecular, cellular, behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Immunohistochemistry confirms the expression of ZFHX3 in multiple retinal cell types, including GABAergic amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells including intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Zfhx3Sci/+ mutants display reduced light responsiveness in locomotor activity and circadian entrainment, relatively normal electroretinogram and optomotor responses but exhibit an unexpected pupillary reflex phenotype with markedly increased sensitivity. Furthermore, multiple electrode array recordings of Zfhx3Sci/+ retina show an increased sensitivity of ipRGC light responses."
https://openalex.org/W3191066408,"Rates of cesarean sections (CS) have increased dramatically over the past two decades in India. This increase has been disproportionately high in private facilities, but little is known about the drivers of the CS rate increase and how they vary over time and geographically.Women enrolled in the Nagpur, India site of the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research Maternal and Neonatal Health Registry, who delivered in a health facility with CS capability were included in this study. The trend in CS rates from 2010 to 2017 in public and private facilities were assessed and displayed by subdistrict. Multivariable generalized estimating equations models were used to assess the association of delivering in private versus public facilities with having a CS, adjusting for known risk factors.CS rates increased substantially between 2010 and 2017 at both public and private facilities. The odds of having a CS at a private facility were 40% higher than at a public facility after adjusting for other known risk factors. CS rates had unequal spatial distributions at the subdistrict level.Our study findings contribute to the knowledge of increasing CS rates in both public and private facilities in India. Maps of the spatial distribution of subdistrict-based CS rates are helpful in understanding patterns of CS deliveries, but more investigation as to why clusters of high CS rates have formed in warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3191108094,"Alaskan sled dogs develop a particular metabolic strategy during multiday submaximal exercise, allowing them to switch from intra-muscular to extra-muscular energy substrates thus postponing fatigue. Specifically, a progressively increasing stimulus for hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis provides glucose for both fueling exercise and replenishing the depleted muscle glycogen. Moreover, recent studies have shown that with continuation of exercise sled dogs increase their insulin-sensitivity and their capacity to transport and oxidize glucose and carbohydrates rather than oxidizing fatty acids. Carnitine and acylcarnitines (AC) play an essential role as metabolic regulators in both fat and glucose metabolism; they serve as biomarkers in different species in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. We assessed the effect of multiday exercise in conditioned sled dogs on plasma short (SC), medium (MC) and long (LC) chain AC by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Our results show chain-specific modification of AC profiles during the exercise challenge: LCACs maintained a steady increase throughout exercise, some SCACs increased during the last phase of exercise and acetylcarnitine (C2) initially increased before decreasing during the later phase of exercise. We speculated that SCACs kinetics could reflect an increased protein catabolism and C2 pattern could reflect its hepatic uptake for energy-generating purposes to sustain gluconeogenesis. LCACs may be exported by muscle to avoid their accumulation to preserve glucose oxidation and insulin-sensitivity or they could be distributed by liver as energy substrates. These findings, although representing a ""snapshot"" of blood as a crossing point between different organs, shed further light on sled dogs metabolism that is liver-centric and more carbohydrate-dependent than fat-dependent and during prolonged submaximal exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3191545460,"Prisons are the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports have focused on whether transfers of incarcerated people between prisons have been the source of outbreaks. Our objective was to examine the relationship between intersystem prison transfers and COVID-19 incidence in a state prison system. We assessed the change in the means of the time-series of prison transfers and their cross-correlation with the time-series of COVID-19 tests and cases. Regression with automatic detection of multiple change-points was used to identify important changes to transfers. There were over 20,000 transfers between the state’s prisons from January through October 2020. Most who were transferred (82%), experienced a single transfer. Transfers between prisons are positively related to future COVID-19 case rates but transfers are not reactive to current case rates. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in carceral settings, it is crucial for transfers of individuals between facilities to be limited."
https://openalex.org/W3191568256,"Overwhelming evidence indicates that excessive stimulation of innate immune receptors of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family causes significant damage to multiple tissues, yet the role of these proteins in bone metabolism is not well known. Here, we studied the interaction between the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes in bone homeostasis and disease. We found that loss of NLRP3 or NLRC4 inflammasome attenuated osteoclast differentiation in vitro. At the tissue level, lack of NLRP3, or NLRC4 to a lesser extent, resulted in higher baseline bone mass compared to wild-type (WT) mice, and conferred protection against LPS-induced inflammatory osteolysis. Bone mass accrual in mutant mice correlated with lower serum IL-1β levels in vivo. Unexpectedly, the phenotype of Nlrp3-deficient mice was reversed upon loss of NLRC4 as bone mass was comparable between WT mice and Nlrp3;Nlrc4 knockout mice. Thus, although bone homeostasis is perturbed to various degrees by the lack of NLRP3 or NLRC4, this tissue appears to function normally upon compound loss of the inflammasomes assembled by these receptors."

Disparities in SARI death in children aged <5 years exist in urban and rural areas.To compare the factors associated with in-hospital death among children aged <5 years hospitalized with SARI in an urban vs. a rural setting in South Africa from 2009-2013.Data were collected from hospitalized children with SARI in one urban and two rural sentinel surveillance hospitals. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for ten respiratory viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital death.From 2009 through 2013, 5,297 children aged <5 years with SARI-associated hospital admission were enrolled; 3,811 (72%) in the urban and 1,486 (28%) in the rural hospitals. In-hospital case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher in the rural hospitals (6.9%) than the urban hospital (1.3%, p<0.001), and among HIV-infected than the HIV-uninfected children (9.6% vs. 1.6%, p<0.001). In the urban hospital, HIV infection (odds ratio (OR):11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI):5.4-24.1) and presence of any other underlying illness (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0-9.2) were the only factors independently associated with death. In the rural hospitals, HIV infection (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3-7.1) and age <1 year (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.9-7.2) were independently associated with death, whereas duration of hospitalization ≥5 days (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) and any respiratory virus detection (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) were negatively associated with death.We found that the case-fatality proportion was substantially higher among children admitted to rural hospitals and HIV infected children with SARI in South Africa. While efforts to prevent and treat HIV infections in children may reduce SARI deaths, further efforts to address health care inequality in rural populations are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3187085651,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired lung infections characterized by hyperinflammation, antibiotic resistance, and high morbidity/mortality. Here, we show that the genetic ablation of one cAMP-phosphodiesterase 4 subtype, PDE4B, is sufficient to protect mice from acute lung injury induced by P aeruginosa infection as it reduces pulmonary and systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as pulmonary vascular leakage and mortality. Surprisingly, despite dampening immune responses, bacterial clearance in the lungs of PDE4B-KO mice is significantly improved compared to WT controls. In wildtypes, P aeruginosa-infection produces high systemic levels of several cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, that act as cryogens and render the animals hypothermic. This, in turn, diminishes their ability to clear the bacteria. Ablation of PDE4B curbs both the initial production of acute response cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as their downstream signaling, specifically the induction of the secondary-response cytokine IL-6. This synergistic action protects PDE4B-KO mice from the deleterious effects of the P aeruginosa-induced cytostorm, while concurrently improving bacterial clearance, rather than being immunosuppressive. These benefits of PDE4B ablation are in contrast to the effects resulting from treatment with PAN-PDE4 inhibitors, which have been shown to increase bacterial burden and dissemination. Thus, PDE4B represents a promising therapeutic target in settings of P aeruginosa lung infections."

Where market matching uses an electronic limit order book (LOB), limit orders traders may make suboptimal price and trade decisions based on new but incomplete information arriving with market orders. This paper measures the information asymmetries in Bitcoin trading limit order books on the Kraken platform, and compares these to prior studies on equities LOB markets. In limit order book markets, traders have the option of waiting to supply liquidity through limit orders, or immediately demanding liquidity through market orders or aggressively priced limit orders. In my multivariate analysis, I control for volatility, trading volume, trading intensity and order imbalance to isolate the effect of trade informativeness on book liquidity. The current research offers the first empirical study of Glosten (1994) to yield a positive, and credibly large transaction cost parameter. Trade and LOB datasets in this study were several orders of magnitude larger than any of the prior studies. Given the poor small sample properties of GMM, it is likely that this substantial increase in size of datasets is essential for validating the model. The research strongly supports Glosten’s seminal theoretical model of limit order book markets, showing that these are valid models of Bitcoin markets. This research empirically tested and confirmed trade informativeness as a prime driver of market liquidity in the Bitcoin market."

Although research shows that caloric versus low-calorie sweeteners can have differential effects on the brain, it is unknown which neuronal populations are responsible for detecting the difference between the two types of sweeteners. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we investigated how drinking sucrose or sucralose (a low-calorie sweetener) affects the activity of glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Furthermore, we explored the consequences of consuming a free-choice high fat diet on the calorie detection abilities of these glutamatergic neurons. We found that glutamatergic neurons indeed can discriminate sucrose from water and sucralose, and that consumption of a free-choice high fat diet shifts the glutamatergic neuronal response from sucrose-specific to sucralose-specific, thereby disrupting calorie detection. These results highlight the disruptive effects of a diet high in saturated fat on calorie detection in the lateral hypothalamus."

Leg dominance mainly refers to differences between the dominant and nondominant legs. Eight males and eight females participated in this study. The weights of the shoes in this investigation were 255 g, 335 g, and 415 g, and the heights of the DJ were 30 cm, 40 cm, and 50 cm. The side-to-side asymmetry of the time of contact initiation for the 30DJ was greater than that of the 40DJ and 50DJ, and the asymmetry for shoes weighing 415 g and 355 g was greater than that for shoes weighing 255 g. When the drop height increased, the side-to-side asymmetry of the peak ground reaction force (PGRF). also increased. The ground contact time increased as the drop height increased to 50DJ. Higher drop heights caused greater side-to-side asymmetry of the PGRF. Heavier shoes caused the peak ground reaction force time (PGRFT) in the nondominant leg to appear earlier, reduced the jump height and affected the performance. Heavier shoes caused greater side-to-side asymmetry at the initial ground contact and at the ground contact time, affecting training effectiveness."

Distance to fresh water, the coast, major roadways, and neighborhood greenness measured by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were evaluated. Outcome indicators were semen volume, sperm concentration, percentage of progressive motility, vitality, normal morphology, and total motile sperm count. Linear regression models were fitted to standardized values of six semen indicators. Majority of men were white-collar, clerical, and service workers. Linear associations between built environment features and semen quality indicators were not evident except for NDVI within 500 m and sperm vitality (β = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.09). The 2nd quartile of distance to fresh water was associated with lower progressive motility compared to the 1st quartile (β = -0.10; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.03). Proportion of vitality was higher among men in the 2nd quartile of distance to roadways than those in the 1st quartile (0.08; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.15). Men in the 2nd quartile of NDVI had higher total motile sperm count (0.09; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.17).

https://openalex.org/W3191772641,"Human enteroviruses (EVs) comprise more than 100 types of coxsackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus and numbered enteroviruses, which are mainly transmitted by the faecal-oral route leading to diverse diseases such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, among others. Since enteroviruses are excreted in faeces, wastewater-based epidemiology approaches are useful to describe EV diversity in a community. In Uruguay, knowledge about enteroviruses is extremely limited. This study assessed the diversity of enteroviruses through Illumina next-generation sequencing of VP1-amplicons obtained by RT-PCR directly applied to viral concentrates of 84 wastewater samples collected in Uruguay during 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. Fifty out of the 84 samples were positive for enteroviruses. There were detected 27 different types belonging to Enterovirus A species (CVA2-A6, A10, A16, EV-A71, A90), Enterovirus B species (CVA9, B1-B5, E1, E6, E11, E14, E21, E30) and Enterovirus C species (CVA1, A13, A19, A22, A24, EV-C99). Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and echovirus 30 (E30) strains were studied more in depth through phylogenetic analysis, together with some strains previously detected by us in Argentina. Results unveiled that EV-A71 sub-genogroup C2 circulates in both countries at least since 2011-2012, and that the C1-like emerging variant recently entered in Argentina. We also confirmed the circulation of echovirus 30 genotypes E and F in Argentina, and reported the detection of genotype E in Uruguay. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the EV-A71 C1-like emerging variant in South-America, and the first report of EV-A71 and E30 in Uruguay."
https://openalex.org/W3192180213,"We analyze the connectivity of equity investments to the firms in the global ownership network that are reported as non-compliant with Environment, Social, and Government (ESG) benchmarks. We find that a large number of shareholders have ownership linkages to non-ESG firms, most commonly with three or four degrees of separation. Analyzing the betweenness centrality for shareholders connecting the ultimate owners and non-ESG firms, we find that the investment management companies play important roles in channeling the investment money into non-ESG firms, where largest American asset managers commonly have one to two degrees of separation on their ownership linkages to those problematic firms. Since asset managers collect capital from investors by running the equity funds, we analyze the ownership stakes and the associated voting rights attributable to the equity funds investors. We estimate the distribution of the power of corporate control over non-ESG firms among specific asset managers (such as BlackRock and Fidelity) and among different types of the equity funds (such as mutual funds and exchanged-traded funds), and explores how investing in the equity funds rather than ownership investing may have shifted the distribution of the power to control those non-ESG firms."
https://openalex.org/W3193227965,"Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) have changed the paradigm of hepatitis C therapy for both HCV/HIV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients. We aimed to describe the HCV continuum of care of HIV-infected patients treated in an HIV clinic after a free DAA program in Indonesia and identify factors correlated with sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (SOF-DCV) treatment failure.We did a retrospective cohort study of adult HIV/HCV co-infected patients under routine HIV-care from November 2019 to April 2020 in the HIV integrated clinic of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. We evaluated some factors correlated with sofosbuvir-daclatasvir treatment failure: gender, diabetes mellitus, previous IFN failure, cirrhosis, concomitant ribavirin use, high baseline HCV-RNA, and low CD4 cell count.Overall, 640 anti-HCV positive patients were included in the study. Most of them were male (88.3%) and former intravenous drug users (76.6%) with a mean age of 40.95 (SD 4.60) years old. Numbers and percentages for the stages of the HCV continuum of care were as follows: HCV-RNA tested (411; 64.2%), pre-therapeutic evaluation done (271; 42.3%), HCV treatment initiated (210; 32.8%), HCV treatment completed (207; 32.2%), but only 178 of these patients had follow-up HCV-RNA tests to allow SVR assessment; and finally SVR12 achieved (178; 27.8%). For the 184 who completed SOF-DCV treatment, SVR12 was achieved by 95.7%. In multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus remained a significant factor correlated with SOF-DCV treatment failure (adjusted RR 17.0, 95%CI: 3.28-88.23, p = 0.001).This study found that in the HCV continuum of care for HIV/HCV co-infected patients, gaps still exist at all stages. As the most commonly used DAA combination, sofosbuvir daclatasvir treatment proved to be effective and well-tolerated in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Diabetes mellitus was significant factor correlated with not achieving SVR12 in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3187131202,"Few studies have focused on the influencing factors of dietary practices among ethnic minority groups in China, particularly from a social capital perspective.Between May and September 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among adults (n = 1,813) from three ethnic minority communities (A Chang, De Ang and Jing Po) in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Dietary intakes during the past 12 months were measured with a 100-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and two forms of social capital (bonding and bridging) were measured using the validated Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCS-16). Principal component factor analysis was used to derive dietary patterns from 20 food groups. Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine the associations between social capital and dietary patterns.Two distinct dietary patterns were identified: the traditional and the modern. The traditional pattern was characterized by high consumptions of tubers, poultry, rice, fruits, vegetables and low consumptions of oil and salt, whereas the modern pattern was highly correlated with egg, nut, beverage, snack and oil consumptions. After adjusted for potential confounders, the modern pattern was positively associated with bonding capital (β = 0.066; 95%CI: 0.058, 0.075) and negatively associated with bridging capital (β = -0.017; 95%CI: -0.024, -0.010).In conclusion, an unhealthy dietary pattern was identified among the ethnic minority groups in Southwest China. The influences of people's social connections on dietary behaviors should be considered in designing and implementing nutrition intervention programs for the population."
https://openalex.org/W3190120720,"Sit-to-stand movement (STS) is a mundane activity, controlled by the central-nervous-system (CNS) via a complex neurophysiological mechanism that involves coordination of limbs for successful execution. Detailed analysis and accurate simulations of STS task have significant importance in clinical intervention, rehabilitation process, and better design for assistive devices. The CNS controls STS motion by taking inputs from proprioceptors. These input signals suffer delay in transmission to CNS making movement control and coordination more complex which may lead to larger body exertion or instability. This paper deals with the problem of STS movement execution in the presence of proprioceptive feedback delays in joint position and velocity. We present a high-gain observer (HGO) based feedback linearization control technique to mimic the CNS in controlling the STS transfer. The HGO estimates immeasurable delayed states to generate input signals for feedback. The feedback linearization output control law generates the passive torques at joints to execute the STS movement. The H 2 dynamic controller calculates the optimal linear gains by using physiological variables. The whole scheme is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulations illustrate physiologically improved results. The ankle, knee, and hip joint position profiles show a high correlation of 0.91, 0.97, 0.80 with the experimentally generated reference profiles. The faster observer dynamics and global boundness of controller result in compensation of delays. The low error and high correlation of simulation results demonstrate (1) the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme for customization of human models and (2) highlight the fact that for detailed analysis and accurate simulations of STS movement the modeling scheme must consider nonlinearities of the system."
https://openalex.org/W3192088375,"We propose a novel network formation game that explains the emergence of various hierarchical structures in groups where self-interested or utility-maximizing individuals decide to establish or severe relationships of authority or collaboration among themselves. We consider two settings: we first consider individuals who do not seek the other party's consent when establishing a relationship and then individuals who do. For both settings, we formally relate the emerged hierarchical structures with the novel inclusion of well-motivated hierarchy promoting terms in the individuals' utility functions. We first analyze the game via a static analysis and characterize all the hierarchical structures that can be formed as its solutions. We then consider the game played dynamically under stochastic interactions among individuals implementing better-response dynamics and analyze the nature of the converged networks."
https://openalex.org/W3192245258,"Epiphora and dermatochalasis are common presentations in the ophthalmology clinic. To evaluate the change of epiphora before and after functional blepharoplasty, this retrospective cohort study reviewed 39 medical records of epiphora patients who underwent upper blepharoplasty. Severity of epiphora using MUNK score was collected and compared between before and at 6 months after blepharoplasty. The analysis model was performed to measure tear breakup time (TBUT) and frequency of artificial tears use. Subgroups of subjects before blepharoplasty to short baseline TBUT (≤ 10 seconds) and long TBUT (≥ 10 seconds) were also evaluated for the MUNK score change. From the analysis of 39 patients, the results showed a statistically significant decrease in post blepharoplasty MUNK score compared to the baseline (all P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between baseline and post-operative TBUT (P &gt; 0.05). Twenty patients were in the short TBUT group and 19 in the long TBUT group. The reduction of MUNK score after blepharoplasty in the short TBUT group was not different to the long TBUT group (P = 0.50, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.41). However, in short TBUT group, frequency of artificial tears use after surgery was less than pre-operation. From the study, upper eyelid blepharoplasty might be one technique reducing the bothersome epiphora in dermatochalasis patients."
