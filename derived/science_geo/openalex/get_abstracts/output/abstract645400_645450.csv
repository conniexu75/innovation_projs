https://openalex.org/W2999883126,"Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of those potentially causal variants, using gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways were over-represented among the highest-confidence target genes. Fine-mapping of causal variants and integration of epigenetic and chromatin conformation data identify likely target genes for 150 breast cancer risk regions."
https://openalex.org/W2997876997,"Using genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to understand endocrine drug resistance, we discovered ARID1A and other SWI/SNF complex components as the factors most critically required for response to two classes of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) antagonists. In this context, SWI/SNF-specific gene deletion resulted in drug resistance. Unexpectedly, ARID1A was also the top candidate in regard to response to the bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor JQ1, but in the opposite direction, with loss of ARID1A sensitizing breast cancer cells to bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibition. We show that ARID1A is a repressor that binds chromatin at ER cis-regulatory elements. However, ARID1A elicits repressive activity in an enhancer-specific, but forkhead box A1-dependent and active, ER-independent manner. Deletion of ARID1A resulted in loss of histone deacetylase 1 binding, increased histone 4 lysine acetylation and subsequent BRD4-driven transcription and growth. ARID1A mutations are more frequent in treatment-resistant disease, and our findings provide mechanistic insight into this process while revealing rational treatment strategies for these patients. ARID1A and other SWI/SNF components are critical for response to estrogen-receptor antagonists in breast cancer. SWI/SNF-specific gene knockouts lead to drug resistance and ARID1A mutations are more frequent in resistant tumors from patients."
https://openalex.org/W2999787570,"The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal of each voxel. However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxel's ALFF by the global mean ALFF, named mALFF. Although fractional ALFF (fALFF), a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. The current study borrowed the percent signal change in task fMRI studies and proposed percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) for RS-fMRI. We firstly applied PerAF and mPerAF (i.e., divided by global mean PerAF) to eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC) RS-fMRI data. PerAF and mPerAF yielded prominently difference between EO and EC, being well consistent with previous studies. We secondly performed test-retest reliability analysis and found that (PerAF ≈ mPerAF ≈ mALFF) > (fALFF ≈ mfALFF). Head motion regression (Friston-24) increased the reliability of PerAF, but decreased all other metrics (e.g. mPerAF, mALFF, fALFF, and mfALFF). The above results suggest that mPerAF is a valid, more reliable, more straightforward, and hence a promising metric for voxel-level RS-fMRI studies. Future study could use both PerAF and mPerAF metrics. For prompting future application of PerAF, we implemented PerAF in a new version of REST package named RESTplus."
https://openalex.org/W2999680005,"Precipitation, as a primary hydrological variable in the water cycle plays an important role in hydrological modeling. The reliability of hydrological modeling is highly related to the quality of precipitation data. Accurate long-term gauged precipitation in the Mekong River Basin, however, is limited. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to assess the performances of various gridded precipitation datasets in rainfall-runoff and flood-inundation modeling of the whole basin. Firstly, the performance of the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model in this basin was evaluated using the gauged rainfall. The calibration (2000-2003) and validation (2004-2007) results indicated that the RRI model had acceptable performance in the Mekong River Basin. In addition, five gridded precipitation datasets including APHRODITE, GPCC, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP (RNL), and TRMM (3B42V7) from 2000 to 2007 were applied as the input to the calibrated model. The results of the simulated river discharge indicated that TRMM, GPCC, and APHRODITE performed better than other datasets. The statistical index of the annual maximum inundated area indicated similar conclusions. Thus, APHRODITE, TRMM, and GPCC precipitation datasets were considered suitable for rainfall-runoff and flood inundation modeling in the Mekong River Basin. This study provides useful guidance for the application of gridded precipitation in hydrological modeling in the Mekong River basin."

https://openalex.org/W3000213001,"Immunologic changes in the hematoma of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and the contribution of these changes to prognosis are unknown. We collected the blood samples and hematoma fluid from 35 patients with acute ICH (<30 hours from symptom onset) and 55 age-matched healthy controls. Using flow cytometry and ELISA, we found that the percentages of granulocytes, regulatory T cells, helper T (Th) 17 cells, and dendritic cells were higher in the peripheral blood of patients with ICH than in healthy controls, whereas the percentages of lymphocytes, M1-like macrophages, and M2-like macrophages were lower. Levels of IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β were higher in the peripheral blood of patients with ICH. The absolute counts of white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in the hematoma tended to be greater at 12-30 hours than they were within 12 hours after ICH, but the percentage of Th cells decreased in peripheral blood. Increased levels of IL-10 in the serum and hematoma, and a reduction in M1-like macrophages in hematoma were independently associated with favorable outcome on day 90. These results indicate that immunocytes present in the hematoma may participate in the acute-phase inflammatory response after ICH."
https://openalex.org/W2998897037,"The aim of this study was to assess the association between cigarette smoking and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among students in two different universities, and the potential mediating effect of depression. Participants were students who came for mandatory check-ups at Student Health Care Centers in two Universities in Serbia, differing by socio-politically and economically environments. Students completed socio-demographic questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the SF-36 questionnaire for assessment of HRQoL. In both populations, after adjustment for socio-demographic, behavioral and health factors, smoking was associated with poorer Mental Composite Score (MCS) and Physical Composite Score (PCS) (Belgrade 1,624 students: MCS β = 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31, 5.44, PCS β = 1.01, 95% CI -0.50, 2.52; Kosovska Mitrovica 514 students: MCS β = 5.06, 95% CI 1.74, 8.37, PCS β = 3.29, 95% CI 0.75, 5.83). After additional adjustment for BDI score, the observed associations were lost (Belgrade: MCS β = 1.12, 95% CI -0.57, 2.80, PCS β = -0.40, 95% CI -1.71, 0.92; Kosovska Mitrovica: MCS β = 0.77, 95% CI -2.06, 3.60, PCS β = 0.56, 95% CI -1.75, 2.87). Higher BDI score was associated with poorer PCS and MCS across all quintiles. The association of smoking with impairment of HRQoL among university students in two different settings was mediated by higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the need for further research on the interaction between smoking, mental health and quality of life, with implications for prevention, diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2999891155,"Background In 1999, Ghana introduced the Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) as the key primary health care strategy. In this study, we explored the challenges, capacity development priorities, and stakeholder perspectives on improving the CHPS concept as it has been fraught with a myriad of challenges since its inception. Our study is the outcome of the national programme for strengthening the implementation of CHPS Initiative in Ghana (CHPS+) introduced in 2017. Methods This exploratory research was a qualitative study conducted in two Systems Learning Districts (SLDs) of CHPS+ in the Volta Region of Ghana from March to May, 2018. Four focus group discussions and two general discussions were conducted among 60 CHPS+ stakeholders made up of health workers and community members. Data analyses were conducted using conceptual content analysis. Statements of the participants were presented as quotes to substantiate the views expressed. Results Negative attitude, high attrition, inadequacy and unavailability of health professionals at post when needed were challenges associated with the health professionals. Late referrals, lack of proper community entry and engagement, non-availability of essential logistics, distance of CHPS compounds from communities, and inadequate funding were challenges associated with the health system. Lack of community ownership of the CHPS programme, lack of security at CHPS compounds, and late reporting of cases by the community members were also realised as challenges emanating from the community members. Priority areas for capacity development of health workers identified included logistics management, community entry and engagement, emergency delivery, managing referrals at the CHPS level, and resuscitation of newborns. Conclusion Health-worker, community, and health systems-based challenges inhibit the implementation of CHPS in Ghana. Capacity development of health professionals and continuous community engagement are avenues that can improve implementation of the programme."
https://openalex.org/W2999629551,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and vaginal dysbiosis (disturbed resident microbiota presenting with abnormal Nugent score or candidiasis) have been associated with mucosal inflammation and risk of HIV-1 infection, cancer and poor reproductive outcomes. To date, the temporal relationships between aberrant cervical innate immunity and the clinical onset of microbial disturbance have not been studied in a large population of reproductive age women. We examined data from a longitudinal cohort of 934 Ugandan and Zimbabwean women contributing 3,274 HIV-negative visits who had complete laboratory, clinical and demographic data. Among those, 207 women later acquired HIV, and 584 women were intermittently diagnosed with C. trachomatis (CT), N. gonorrhoeae (NG), genital herpes (HSV-2), T. vaginalis (TV), candidiasis, and abnormal intermediate (4–6) or high (7–10) Nugent score, i.e. bacterial vaginosis (BV). Immune biomarker concentrations in cervical swabs were analyzed by generalized linear and mixed effect models adjusting for site, age, hormonal contraceptive use (HC), pregnancy, breastfeeding, genital practices, unprotected sex and overlapping infections. High likelihood ratios (1.5–4.9) denoted the values of cervical immune biomarkers to predict onset of abnormal Nugent score and candidiasis at the next visits. When controlling for covariates, higher levels of β-defensin-2 were antecedent to BV, CT and HSV-2, lower anti-inflammatory ratio IL-1RA:IL-1β–to intermediate Nugent scores and candida, lower levels of the serine protease inhibitor SLPI–to candida, lower levels of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 –to TV, and lower levels of the oxidative stress mitigator and endothelial activation marker VEGF–to NG. Changes in innate immunity following onset of dysbiosis and infections were dependent on HC use when controlling for all other covariates. In conclusion, imminent female genital tract dysbiosis or infection can be predicted by distinct patterns of innate immunity. Future research should characterize biotic and abiotic determinants of this pre-existing innate immunity state."
https://openalex.org/W2999894680,"In many countries the public's main source of information about science and technology is the mass media. Unfortunately, in recent years traditional journalism has experienced a collapse, and science journalism has been a major casualty. One potential remedy is to encourage scientists to write for news media about science. On these general news platforms, scientists' stories would have to compete for attention with other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and entertaining (e.g. celebrity news) topics written by professional writers. Do they stand a chance? This study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth ‘scientists’) trained to function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in the same news outlets. To measure users' behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50 scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science Education reporters’ program and published on two major Israeli news websites—Mako and Ynet between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by the website’s organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g., tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the public's engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference, e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on the stories written by scientists. This creates an optimistic starting point for filling the science news void by scientists as science reporters."
https://openalex.org/W2999823243,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignant tumor originating in the biliary tract, is well known to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high mortality rates due to the lack of effective therapy. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key contributor to therapeutic success and chemotherapy resistance in CCA, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of necroptosis, a novel regulated form of necrosis, could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic approach for CCA patients. The RNA sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed and revealed that both receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), two essential mediators of necroptosis, were upregulated in CCA tissues when compared with the levels in normal bile ducts. We demonstrated in a panel of CCA cell lines that RIPK3 was differentially expressed in CCA cell lines, while MLKL was more highly expressed in CCA cell lines than in nontumor cholangiocytes. We therefore showed that treatment with both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Smac mimetic, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist, induced RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis in CCA cells when caspases were blocked. The necroptotic induction in a panel of CCA cells was correlated with RIPK3 expression. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that Smac mimetic sensitized CCA cells to a low dose of standard chemotherapy, gemcitabine, and induced necroptosis in an RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent manner upon caspase inhibition but not in nontumor cholangiocytes. We further demonstrated that Smac mimetic and gemcitabine synergistically induced an increase in TNF-α mRNA levels and that Smac mimetic reversed gemcitabine-induced cell cycle arrest, leading to cell killing. Collectively, our present study demonstrated that TNF-α and gemcitabine induced RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis upon IAP depletion and caspase inhibition; therefore, our findings have pivotal implications for designing a novel necroptosis-based therapeutic strategy for CCA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2998887397,"Habits are automated behaviors that are insensitive to changes in behavioral outcomes. Habitual responding is thought to be mediated by the striatum, with medial striatum guiding goal-directed action and lateral striatum promoting habits. However, interspersed throughout the striatum are neurochemically differing subcompartments known as patches, which are characterized by distinct molecular profiles relative to the surrounding matrix tissue. These structures have been thoroughly characterized neurochemically and anatomically, but little is known regarding their function. Patches have been shown to be selectively activated during inflexible motor stereotypies elicited by stimulants, suggesting that patches may subserve habitual behaviors. To explore this possibility, we utilized transgenic mice (Sepw1 NP67) preferentially expressing Cre recombinase in striatal patch neurons to target these neurons for ablation with a virus driving Cre-dependent expression of caspase 3. Mice were then trained to press a lever for sucrose rewards on a variable interval schedule to elicit habitual responding. Mice were not impaired on the acquisition of this task, but lesioning striatal patches disrupted behavioral stability across training, and lesioned mice utilized a more goal-directed behavioral strategy during training. Similarly, when mice were forced to omit responses to receive sucrose rewards, habitual responding was impaired in lesioned mice. To rule out effects of lesion on motor behaviors, mice were then tested for impairments in motor learning on a rotarod and locomotion in an open field. We found that patch lesions partially impaired initial performance on the rotarod without modifying locomotor behaviors in open field. This work indicates that patches promote behavioral stability and habitual responding, adding to a growing literature implicating striatal patches in stimulus-response behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2999634895,"Many animals display morphological adaptations of the nose that improve their ability to detect and track odors. Bilateral odor sampling improves an animals' ability to navigate using olfaction and increased separation of the nostrils facilitates olfactory source localization. Many bats use odors to find food and mates and bats display an elaborate diversity of facial features. Prior studies have quantified how variations in facial features correlate with echolocation and feeding ecology, but surprisingly none have asked whether bat noses might be adapted for olfactory tracking in flight. We predicted that bat species that rely upon odor cues while foraging would have greater nostril separation in support of olfactory tropotaxis. Using museum specimens, we measured the external nose and cranial morphology of 40 New World bat species. Diet had a significant effect on external nose morphology, but contrary to our predictions, insectivorous bats had the largest relative separation of nostrils, while nectar feeding species had the narrowest nostril widths. Furthermore, nasal echolocating bats had significantly narrower nostrils than oral emitting bats, reflecting a potential trade-off between sonar pulse emission and stereo-olfaction in those species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the evolutionary interactions between olfaction and echolocation in shaping the external morphology of a facial feature using modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Future work pairing olfactory morphology with tracking behavior will provide more insight into how animals such as bats integrate olfactory information while foraging."
https://openalex.org/W2999444248,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells. Though durable remissions are possible, MM is considered incurable, with relapse occurring in almost all patients. There has been limited data reported on the lipid metabolism changes in plasma cells during MM progression. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of concurrent lipidomics and proteomics analyses from patient plasma cells, and report these data on a limited number of patient samples, demonstrating the feasibility of the method, and establishing hypotheses to be evaluated in the future.Plasma cells were purified from fresh bone marrow aspirates using CD138 microbeads. Proteins and lipids were extracted using a bi-phasic solvent system with methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and water. Untargeted proteomics, untargeted and targeted lipidomics were performed on 7 patient samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two comparisons were conducted: high versus low risk; relapse versus newly diagnosed. Proteins and pathways enriched in the relapsed group was compared to a public transcriptomic dataset from Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium reference collection (n = 222) at gene and pathways level.From one million purified plasma cells, we were able to extract material and complete untargeted (~6000 and ~3600 features in positive and negative mode respectively) and targeted lipidomics (313 lipids), as well as untargeted proteomics analysis (~4100 reviewed proteins). Comparative analyses revealed limited differences between high and low risk groups (according to the standard clinical criteria), hence we focused on drawing comparisons between the relapsed and newly diagnosed patients. Untargeted and targeted lipidomics indicated significant down-regulation of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in relapsed MM. Although there was limited overlap of the differential proteins/transcripts, 76 significantly enriched pathways in relapsed MM were common between proteomics and transcriptomics data. Further evaluation of transcriptomics data for lipid metabolism network revealed enriched correlation of PC, ceramide, cardiolipin, arachidonic acid and cholesterol metabolism pathways to be exclusively correlated among relapsed but not in newly-diagnosed patients.This study establishes the feasibility and workflow to conduct integrated lipidomics and proteomics analyses on patient-derived plasma cells. Potential lipid metabolism changes associated with MM relapse warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3000579337,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common todays public health problems. According to a survey by the World Health Organization, this metabolic disorder has reached global epidemic proportions, with a worldwide prevalence of 8.5% in the adult population.The present study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of aqueous extract of Mangifera indica (EAMI) leaves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Sixty male rats were divided into 2 groups: Normoglycemic and Diabetic. Each group was subdivided into negative control, glibenclamide 3 or 10 mg/kg, EAMI 125, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin 100 mg/kg was used to DM induction. The hypoglycemic response was assessed acutely after two and four weeks of treatment. After a 6-hour fasting period, the fasting blood glucose of animals was verified, and 2.5 g/kg glucose solution was orally administered. The insulin tolerance test and plasma insulin levels assessment were performed in the morning after fasting of 12 to 14 hours.The chemical analysis of EAMI showed high levels of phenolic compounds. There was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose between normoglycemic and diabetic groups, and that EAMI did not have an acute effect on diabetes. After two and four weeks of treatment, the extract significantly reduced blood glucose levels, exceeding glibenclamide effects. EAMI was effective in maintaining the long-term hypoglycemic effect, as well as, significantly increased the sensitivity of diabetic animals to insulin and the plasma insulin level."
https://openalex.org/W3000619066,"A significant proportion of osteoarthritis (OA) patients continue to experience moderate to severe pain after total joint replacement (TJR). Preoperative factors related to pain persistence are mainly studied using individual predictor variables and distinct pain outcomes, thus leading to a lack of consensus regarding the influence of preoperative parameters on post-TJR pain. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated knee and hip OA patients before, 3 and 6 months post-TJR searching for clinical predictors of pain persistence. We assessed multiple measures of quality, mood, affect, health and quality of life, together with radiographic evaluation and performance-based tasks, modeling four distinct pain outcomes. Multivariate regression models and network analysis were applied to pain related biopsychosocial measures and their changes with surgery. A total of 106 patients completed the study. Pre-surgical pain levels were not related to post-surgical residual pain. Although distinct pain scales were associated with different aspects of post-surgical pain, multi-factorial models did not reliably predict post-surgical pain in knee OA (across four distinct pain scales) and did not generalize to hip OA. However, network analysis showed significant changes in biopsychosocial-defined OA personality post-surgery, in both groups. Our results show that although tested clinical and biopsychosocial variables reorganize after TJR in OA, their presurgical values are not predictive of post-surgery pain. Derivation of prognostic markers for pain persistence after TJR will require more comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2998820256,"Background Apolipoprotein-AI (apo-AI) is the major apolipoprotein found in high density lipoprotein particles (HDLs). We previously demonstrated that apo-AI injected directly into high-fat diet fed mice improved insulin sensitivity associated with decreased hepatic inflammation. While our data provides compelling proof of concept, apoA-I mimetic peptides are more clinically feasible. The aim of this study was to test whether apo-AI mimetic peptide (D-4F and L-5F) treatment will emulate the effects of full-length apo-AI to improve insulin sensitivity. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks before receiving D4F mimetic peptide administered via drinking water or L5F mimetic peptide administered by intraperitoneal injection bi-weekly for a total of five weeks. Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were conducted to assess the effects of the peptides on insulin resistance. Effects of the peptides on inflammation, gluconeogenic enzymes and lipid synthesis were assessed by real-time PCR of key markers involved in the respective pathways. Results Treatment with apo-AI mimetic peptides D-4F and L-5F showed: (i) improved blood glucose clearance (D-4F 1.40-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, P<0.05; L-4F 1.17-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, ns) in the glucose tolerance test; (ii) improved insulin tolerance (D-4F 1.63-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, P<0.05; L-5F 1.39-fold AUC compared to HFD, P<0.05) in the insulin tolerance test. The metabolic test results were associated with (i) decreased hepatic inflammation of SAA1, IL-1β IFN-γ and TNFα (2.61–5.97-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.05) for both mimetics; (ii) suppression of hepatic mRNA expression of gluconeogenesis-associated genes (PEPCK and G6Pase; 1.66–3.01-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics; (iii) lipogenic-associated genes, (SREBP1c and ChREBP; 2.15–3.31-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics and; (iv) reduced hepatic macrophage infiltration (F4/80 and CD68; 1.77–2.15-fold compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics. Conclusion Apo-AI mimetic peptides treatment led to improved glucose homeostasis. This effect is associated with reduced expression of inflammatory markers in the liver and reduced infiltration of macrophages, suggesting an overall suppression of hepatic inflammation. We also showed altered expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, suggesting that glucose and lipid synthesis is suppressed. These findings suggest that apoA-I mimetic peptides could be a new therapeutic option to reduce hepatic inflammation that contributes to the development of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance."

Dyadic data were analysed for 6 sub-scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory, using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model.There were no statistically significant differences in emotional symptoms and health-related quality of life between patients with heart failure and their caregivers. Patients' and caregivers' emotional symptoms were associated with their own health-related quality of life. Caregivers' anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsession-compulsion, depression and hostility negatively influenced their partner's (i.e. the patient's) health-related quality of life. There were no partner effects of patients' emotional symptoms on the health-related quality of life of caregivers.The results of this study suggest that patients may be particularly vulnerable to the emotional distress, i.e. thoughts, impulses and actions of their caregivers. It may be possible to improve patients' health-related quality of life by targeting specific detrimental emotional symptoms of caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2999532880,"Introduction Pressure ulcers (PUs) nowadays are a major health problem in society, associated with increased morbidity and increased health care costs. The incidence of HAPU is an indicator of health care quality. Objective To describe the profile of patients with minimal risk on the Norton-MI scale who developed PUs during hospitalization, and to identify the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU). Methods Retrospective cohort study conducted between 2014 and 2017. Study population Patients over 18 years of age classified as ""minimum risk"" according to Norton-MI, admitted to acute hospital units of the Severo Ochoa University Hospital—Madrid-Spain. Patients were classified as patients with hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (PWHAPU) if they developed one or more new PU during their hospitalization. Variables Sociodemographic variables, hospitalization units, Morton-MI score and characteristics of the risk factors of HAPU were studied. Results The risk of PU was evaluated in 5530 patients, being 1260 patients classified as ""minimum risk"", with a median of 16 points in the Norton-MI scale. The average age was 76 years old and 52.5% were women. Principal causes of admission: traumatological pathologies (20.8%) and cardiovascular pathologies (20%). 129 HAPU were diagnosed in 112 patients, implying an incidence of HAPU of 8.89% (CI95%: 7.44–10.59). 106 PWHAPU (94.6%) presented up to 6 risk factors. The excess pressure and altered skin sensibility were identified as statistically significant risk factors as predictive factors of HAPU. In terms of severity, 55% of the HAPU were category I and 42.6% were category II, mainly with anatomical sacro-coxygeal location. In 65.2% of the patients the HAPU appeared in the first week of hospitalization. Conclusion In our study the incidence of HAPU in patients classified as minimum risk with Norton-MI scale was 8.89%. This elevated risk suggests for future investigations to develop new validity studies of the Norton-MI scale and to maintain a continuo training of professionals in the knowledge of PU risk assessment scales for their safe application in the patients, since it directs the practice of care in the prevention of PUs. It would be advisable to specially control the risk of PUs in care units, mainly in the first week of their hospital stay to minimize the HAPU incidence."
https://openalex.org/W3000097585,"In recent years, real-world studies (RWS) are gaining increasing interests, because they can generate more realistic and generalizable results than randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). In 2017, we published a RCT in 741 early childhood care and education providers (CCPs). It is the Phase I of our iLookOut for Child Abuse project (iLookOut), an online, interactive learning module about reporting suspected child maltreatment. That study demonstrated that in a RCT setting, the iLookOut is efficient at improving CCPs’ knowledge of and attitudes towards child maltreatment reporting. However, the generalizability of that RCT’s results in a RWS setting remains unknown. To address this question, we design and conduct this large RWS in 11,065 CCPs, which is the Phase II of the iLookOut. We hypothesize replication of the earlier RCT findings, i.e., the iLookOut can improve CCPs’ knowledge of and attitudes toward child maltreatment reporting in a real world setting. In addition, this RWS also explores whether demographic factors affect CCPs’ performance. Results of this RWS confirmed the generalizability of the previous RCT’s results in a real world setting. It yielded similar effect sizes for knowledge and attitudes as were found in the earlier RCT. Cohen’s d for knowledge improvement was 0.95 in that RCT, 0.96 in this RWS; Cohen’s d for attitude improvement was 0.98 in that RCT, 0.80 in this RWS. Also, we found several significant differences in knowledge and attitude improvement with regard to age, race, education, and employment status. In conclusion, iLookOut improves knowledge and attitudes of CCPs about child maltreatment prevention and reporting in a real-world setting. The generalizability of the initial RCT findings to this RWS provides strong evidence that the iLookout will be effective in other real world settings. It can be a useful model for other interventions aimed at preventing child maltreatment. Clinical trial registration for the original RCT: NCT02225301 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier)"

Genotyping of rs2070744 (T-786C) and rs1799983 (G894T) variants of the NOS3 gene was performed using TaqMan® assay. Results Rs1799983 genotypes showed a significant association with POAG but did not survive Bonferroni correction (pcorrection = 0.01). The minor ‘T’ allele was significantly associated with the risk of POAG among men (p = 0.025, odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–2.94). Likewise, the genotypes were significantly associated with POAG among men in dominant (p = 0.030, OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.06–3.48) and log-additive models (p = 0.022, OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08–3.07), and after adjustment for age and smoking. Genotype and allele frequencies of rs2070744 were not significantly different between POAG cases and controls, and after sex stratification. CG haplotype was significantly protective (p = 0.011, OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.32–0.87) and CT haplotype conferred significantly increased risk of POAG (p = 0.016, OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.16–5.82) among men. Rs1799983 showed trend (p = 0.054) towards risk of POAG independent of age, gender, smoking, and rs2070744 polymorphism in logistic regression analysis. Both the polymorphisms showed no association with POAG phenotypes such as intraocular pressure and cup/disc ratio. Conclusion Our results suggest that the polymorphism rs1799983 and the haplotypes of rs20707440 and rs1799983 in the NOS3 gene may significantly modulate the risk of POAG in Saudi’s, particularly among men. Further larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3000099540,"Iron is an essential trace mineral required for growth, metabolism, and immune response. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis is linked with the development and progression of various diseases. Iron accumulation is associated with inflammatory diseases and cancer, while iron deficiency leads to the growth retardation. Several studies have suggested that iron imbalance results in alteration of gut microbiota, leading to the disruption of microbial diversity, the increase of pathogen abundance, and the induction of intestinal inflammation. However, in screening studies done in the past decades, the association between the iron availability and gut microbiota has not been systemically explored. Furthermore, a noninvasive and convenient approach to determine the iron levels in tissues is lacking. In the present study, a murine model for iron dysregulation was established. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic algorithms were used to identify the key taxa. Using the key taxa identified and machine learning models, we established an easily accessible prediction model, which could accurately distinguish between iron-deprived or iron-fortified condition. This prediction model could precisely predict the iron level of the intestinal epithelial cells and the liver and could be used for early diagnosis of iron dysbiosis-related diseases, in a noninvasive manner, in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3000079170,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension might contribute to the increased incidence of AKI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of single and combined hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning and NADPH oxidase inhibition on oxidative stress, kidney function and structure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after renal ischemia reperfusion injury. HBO preconditioning was performed by exposing to pure oxygen (2.026 bar) twice a day for two consecutive days for 60 minutes, and 24h before AKI induction. For AKI induction, the right kidney was removed and ischemia was performed by clamping the left renal artery for 45 minutes. NADPH oxidase inhibition was induced by apocynin (40 mg/kg b.m., intravenously) 5 minutes before reperfusion. AKI significantly increased renal vascular resistance and reduced renal blood flow, which were significantly improved after apocynin treatment. Also, HBO preconditioning, with or without apocynin treatment showed improvement on renal hemodynamics. AKI significantly increased plasma creatinine, urea, phosphate levels and lipid peroxidation in plasma. Remarkable improvement, with decrease in creatinine, urea and phosphate levels was observed in all treated groups. HBO preconditioning, solitary or with apocynin treatment decreased lipid peroxidation in plasma caused by AKI induction. Also, combined with apocynin, it increased catalase activity and solitary, glutathione reductase enzyme activity in erythrocytes. While AKI induction significantly increased plasma KIM– 1 levels, HBO preconditioning, solitary or with apocynin decreased its levels. Considering renal morphology, significant morphological alterations present after AKI induction were significantly improved in all treated groups with reduced tubular dilatation, tubular necrosis in the cortico-medullary zone and PAS positive cast formation. Our results reveal that NADPH oxidase inhibition and hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, with or without NADPH oxidase inhibition may have beneficial effects, but their protective role should be evaluated in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3000379492,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) DNA cytosine deaminase 3B (A3B) is a DNA editing enzyme which induces genomic DNA mutations in multiple myeloma and in various other cancers. APOBEC family proteins are highly homologous so it is especially difficult to investigate the biology of specifically A3B in cancer cells. To easily and comprehensively investigate A3B function in myeloma cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate A3B reporter cells that contain 3×FLAG tag and IRES-EGFP sequences integrated at the end of the A3B gene. These reporter cells stably express 3xFLAG tagged A3B and the reporter EGFP and this expression is enhanced by known stimuli, such as PMA. Conversely, shRNA knockdown of A3B decreased EGFP fluorescence and 3xFLAG tagged A3B protein levels. We screened a series of anticancer treatments using these cell lines and identified that most conventional therapies, such as antimetabolites or radiation, exacerbated endogenous A3B expression, but recent molecular targeted therapeutics, including bortezomib, lenalidomide and elotuzumab, did not. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of ATM, ATR and DNA-PK suppressed EGFP expression upon treatment with antimetabolites. These results suggest that DNA damage triggers A3B expression through ATM, ATR and DNA-PK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2999062613,"Background Preoperative patients’ vulnerabilities such as physical, social, and psychological are implicated in postoperative pain variability. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to analyze a patient's psychological profile in the preoperative period in a practical and consistent way. Thus, we sought to identify if high preoperative emotional stress, evaluated by the Brief Measure of Emotional Preoperative Stress (B-MEPS) scale is associated with higher postoperative pain levels and poor rehabilitation in patients submitted to intermediate or major surgery. Moreover, the possible neurobiological or neurophysiological mechanisms implicated in high preoperative emotional stress, evaluated through preoperative quantitative sensory pain tests and serum biomarkers BDNF and S100B were investigated. Methods We conducted a prospective, observational, cohort study of ASA 2 and 3 adult patients undergoing major urologic, gynecologic, proctologic and orthopedic surgeries from March 2017 to March 2018. B-MEPS and Central Sensitivity Inventory were evaluated preoperatively, followed by a sequence of experimental pain tests and serum biomarkers collection. Postoperative evaluation carried out within the first 48 hours after surgery comprehended pain at rest and movement-evoked pain, and the consumption of morphine. Quality-of-Recovery was also evaluated in the 3rd postoperative day. Results 23 (15%) out of 150 patients included in the study presented high emotional preoperative stress. Variables significantly related to preoperative stress were: previous psychiatric diagnosis and Central Sensitization Inventory result. Mean movement-evoked pain in the first 12 to 48 hours was 95–105% higher than pain at rest. A mixed model for repeated measures showed a sustainable effect of B-MEPS as a movement-evoked pain predictor. Previous pain, cancer surgery, and preoperative pressure pain tolerance were also independent predictors of postoperative pain. Moderate to severe postoperative movement-evoked pain was predictive of poor rehabilitation in 48 hours after surgery. Conclusion We confirmed that a brief screening method of preoperative emotional states could detect individuals prone to experience severe postoperative pain. Specific interventions considering the stress level may be planned in the future to improve perioperative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2999525857,"Organisational readiness is an implementation pre-requisite to gain its members' appropriate and committed use of the intervention. Implementation climate and organisational readiness for implementing change were evaluated conjointly to assess organisational readiness for an obesity and HIV health intervention that imparts health information directly to Grade 6 learners, and indirectly to their parents/caregivers in their home environment. The study objectives were to assess the level of organisational readiness at schools and to identify organisational factors (facilitators, barriers and contextual factors). A mixed-methods approach collected data from five public schools in Gauteng, South Africa. Forty-six educators and school management answered a self-administered questionnaire and contributed to a focus group discussion at each school. Mean scores with standard deviations, or median scores with interquartile ranges, were calculated to determine levels of organisational readiness. Qualitative data were transcribed and analysed thematically. The overall implementation climate and organisational readiness for implementing change median scores were acceptable, at 3.6 (IQR 3.2–4.1) and 4.3 (IQR 3.8–4.9), respectively. Results indicated that educators collectively valued the change highly enough to commit to its implementation, and that the motivation for the intervention, associated goals and objectives, the realisation for change, and the benefits thereof were well-comprehended by educators. Thirteen barriers and 13 facilitators were identified. The perceived degree of fit between the significance and values attached to the intervention by educators, and how these would be received by the target group (parents and learners) was also beneficial. Key barriers and facilitators indicated that the intervention needed to be a fit with existing workflows and educational systems. Contextual factors such as intervention appropriateness and acceptability as well as sensitivity to HIV were identified. These findings suggested proactive improvements to further improve the intervention and its implementation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2999415641,"Ripe rot caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea causes extensive production losses in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planch.). Our previous study showed that kiwifruit variety “Jinyan” is resistant to B. dothidea while “Hongyang” is susceptible. For a comparative analysis of the response of these varieties to B. dothidea infection, we performed a transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing. A total of 305.24 Gb of clean bases were generated from 36 libraries of which 175.76 Gb was from the resistant variety and 129.48 Gb from the susceptible variety. From the libraries generated, we identified 44,656 genes including 39,041 reference genes, 5,615 novel transcripts, and 13,898 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these, 2,373 potentially defense-related genes linked to calcium signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cell wall modification, phytoalexin synthesis, transcription factors, pattern-recognition receptors, and pathogenesis-related proteins may regulate kiwifruit resistance to B. dothidea. DEGs involved in calcium signaling, MAPK, and cell wall modification in the resistant variety were induced at an earlier stage and at higher levels compared with the susceptible variety. Thirty DEGs involved in plant defense response were strongly induced in the resistant variety at all three time points. This study allowed the first comprehensive understanding of kiwifruit transcriptome in response to B. dothidea and may help identify key genes required for ripe rot resistance in kiwifruit."
https://openalex.org/W3000248885,"Objectives Fluctuation is a common but neglected phenomenon of physical activity (PA) behavior. This study aimed to explore the psychosocial profiles of PA fluctuation in office employees, and to examine the association of latent profiles with demographics and PA level. Method 434 Chinese office employees who were identified as PA fluctuators (M = 32.4 years, SD = 6.9, 55.5% female) completed a cross-sectional online survey covering demographics, PA behavior, and six psychosocial indicators (self-efficacy, planning, action control, affective attitude, social support, and perceived barriers). Latent profile analysis was used to determine PA fluctuators’ psychosocial profiles. Associated factors of profile membership were identified with multinomial logistic regression. Results The two-profile model (uncommitted vs. moderately committed) was selected as the best solution. The moderately committed group (n = 346, 79.7%) possessed a more active mindset by reporting significantly higher scores of self-efficacy (t = 9.42 p < .001), planning (t = 16.33 p < .001), action control (t = 14.55 p < .001), affective attitude (t = 13.33 p < .001), and social support (t = 11.50 p < .001) compared with the uncommitted group (n = 88, 20.3%). Results from a multinomial logistic regression showed that the moderately committed profile was associated with normal weight status (OR = 2.00, p< .05), having a medium managerial position (OR = 2.54, p< .01), and high level of moderate to vigorous PA behavior (OR = 4.85, p< .001). Conclusions These findings demonstrate the variability of PA fluctuators’ mindsets. Future tailored interventions are recommended to promote PA behavior for this population based on the categorization from the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2998050677,"The epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor cetuximab is the only oncogene-targeted agent that has been FDA approved for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Currently, there are no biomarkers used in the clinic to predict which HNSCC tumors will respond to cetuximab, and even in tumors that regress with treatment, acquired resistance occurs in the majority of cases. Though a number of mechanisms of acquired resistance to cetuximab have been identified in preclinical studies, no therapies targeting these resistance pathways have yet been effectively translated into the clinic. To address this unmet need, we examined the role of the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) in acquired cetuximab resistance in preclinical models of HNSCC. We found that IL-6 secretion was increased in PE/CA-PJ49 cells that had acquired resistance to cetuximab compared to the parental cells from which they were derived. However, addition of exogenous IL-6 to parental cells did not promote cetuximab resistance, and inhibition of the IL-6 pathway did not restore cetuximab sensitivity in the cetuximab-resistant cells. Further examination of the IL-6 pathway revealed that expression of IL6R, which encodes a component of the IL-6 receptor, was decreased in cetuximab-resistant cells compared to parental cells, and that treatment of the cetuximab-resistant cells with exogenous IL-6 did not induce phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, suggesting that the IL-6 pathway was functionally impaired in the cetuximab-resistant cells. These findings demonstrate that, even if IL-6 is increased in the context of cetuximab resistance, it is not necessarily required for maintenance of the resistant phenotype, and that targeting the IL-6 pathway may not restore sensitivity to cetuximab in cetuximab-refractory HNSCC."

Approval was accompanied by regulations that prohibited pharmacist dispensing of the medication. Reproductive health advocates in Canada recognized this regulation would limit access to medical abortion and successfully worked to have this regulation removed in 2017. The purpose of this study was to assess the leadership involved in changing these regulations so that the success may be replicated by other groups advocating for health policy change.This study involved a mixed methods instrumental design in the context of British Columbia, Canada. Our data collection included: a) interviews with seven key individuals, representing the organizations that worked in concert for change to Canadian mifepristone regulations, and b) document analysis of press articles, correspondence, briefing notes, and meeting minutes. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcripts of audio-recorded interviews. We identified strengths and weaknesses of the team dynamic using the Develop Coalitions, Achieve Results and Systems Transformation domains of the LEADS Framework.Our analysis of participant interviews indicates that autonomy, shared values, and clarity in communication were integral to the success of the group's work. Analysis using the LEADS Framework showed that individuals possessed many of the capabilities identified as being necessary for successful health policy leadership. A lack of post-project assessment was identified as a possible limitation and could be incorporated in future work to strengthen dynamics especially when a desired outcome is not achieved. Document analysis provided a clear time-line of the work completed and suggested that strong communication between team members was another key to success.The results of our analysis of the interviews and documents provide valuable insight into the workings of a successful group committed to a common goal. The existing collegial and trusting relationships between key stakeholders allowed for interdisciplinary collaboration, rapid mobilization, and identification of issues that facilitated successful Canadian global-first deregulation of mifepristone dispensing."
https://openalex.org/W3000443715,"Background To develop a method, using current clinical instrumentation, to estimate the Young’s modulus of the human cornea in vivo. Methods Central corneal curvature (CCC), central corneal thickness(CCT), intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with the Goldmann tonometer (IOPG) and the Pascal Dynamic Corneal Tonometer(PDCT) in one eye of 100 normal young human subjects (21.07 ± 2.94 years) in vivo. The Orssengo and Pye algorithm was used to calculate the Young’s modulus of the corneas of these subjects. Results The Young’s modulus(E) of the corneas of the subjects using the PDCT and IOPG results (Ecalc) was 0.25 ± 0.10MPa, and without the PDCT results (Eiopg) was 0.29 ± 0.06MPa. The difference in these results is due to the difference in tonometry results between the two instruments, as the mean PDCT result for the subjects was 16.89 ± 2.49mmHg and the IOPG result 15.06 ± 2.71mmHg. E was affected by the CCC of the subjects but more particularly by the CCT and IOP measurements. Corneal stiffness results are also presented. Conclusion Two methods have been developed to estimate the Young’s modulus of the human cornea in vivo using current clinical instrumentation. One method (Ecalc) is applicable to the general corneal condition, and Eiopg to the normal cornea, and these results can be used to calculate corneal stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W2999715746,"Background Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have the potential to act as disease reservoirs for wildlife and are important sentinels for common circulating pathogens. Therefore, the infectious disease seroprevalence among domestic dogs in northern Botswana may be indicative of pathogen exposure of various wildlife species. The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria immitis, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus, and canine distemper virus in domestic dogs as proxies of disease prevalence in the local wildlife in the Okavango Delta region of Botswana. Statistical analysis assessed crude and factor-specific seroprevalence proportions in relation to age, sex, and geographical location as predictors of seropositivity. Logistic regression was used to identify adjusted predictors of seropositivity for each of the pathogens of interest. Results Samples from 233 dogs in a total of seven locations in Maun, Botswana, and surrounding villages were collected and serologically analyzed. No dogs were seropositive for B. burgdorferi, while low seroprevalence proportions were observed for Anaplasma spp. (2.2%) and D. immitis (0.9%). Higher seroprevalence proportions were observed for the tick-borne pathogen Ehrlichia spp. (21.0%), and 19.7% were seropositive for canine adenovirus (hepatitis). The highest seroprevalence proportions were for canine parvovirus (70.0%) and canine distemper virus (44.8%). The predictors of seropositivity revealed that adults were more likely to be seropositive for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, and canine parvovirus than juveniles, and location was a risk factor for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and Ehrlichia spp. Conclusions Results indicate that increasing tick control and vaccination campaigns for domestic dogs may improve the health of domestic animals, and potentially wildlife and humans in the Okavango Delta since viral and vector-borne bacterial pathogens can be transmitted between them."
https://openalex.org/W3000603034,"The chikungunya East/Central/South/Africa virus lineage (CHIKV-ECSA) was first detected in Brazil in the municipality of Feira de Santana (FS) by mid 2014. Following that, a large number of CHIKV cases have been notified in FS, which is the second-most populous city in Bahia state, northeastern Brazil, and plays an important role on the spread to other Brazilian states due to climate conditions and the abundance of competent vectors. To better understand CHIKV dynamics in Bahia state, we generated 5 complete genome sequences from a local outbreak raised in Serraria Brasil, a neighbourhood in FS, by next-generation sequencing using Illumina approach. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that the new FS genomes belongs to the ECSA genotype and falls within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade that includes other older CHIKV sequences from the same location, suggesting the persistence of the virus during distinct epidemic seasons. We also performed minor variants analysis and found a small number of SNPs per sample (b_29L and e_45SR = 16 SNPs, c_29SR = 29 and d_45PL and f_45FL = 21 SNPs). Out of the 93 SNPs found, 71 are synonymous, 21 are non-synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Although those mutations are not related to the increase of virus replication and/or infectivity, some SNPs were found in non-structural proteins which may have an effect on viral evasion from the mammal immunological system. These findings reinforce the needing of further studies on those variants and of continued genomic surveillance strategies to track viral adaptations and to monitor CHIKV epidemics for improved public health control."
https://openalex.org/W2999209059,"Introduction Approximately two-thirds of HIV-infected individuals reside in sub-Saharan Africa. The region accounts for 68% of the new HIV infections occurring worldwide with almost one-half of these infections being among young adults aged 12–24 years. Cowan and colleagues conducted a community-based, multi-component HIV intervention aimed at youth in rural Zimbabwe. Despite some changes in knowledge and attitudes, the community-based intervention did not affect the prevalence of HIV or HSV-2. We selected this frequently cited study for replication since it incorporates individual-, community-, and structural- level intervention components that are often considered in global HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Additionally, the intervention could be easily scaled-up, which is especially important in the context of limited resources. Although this study indicated no intervention effects in reducing HIV, the authors acknowledged some key methodological challenges. Our replication analysis provided important insights regarding the impact of these challenges to the interpretation of the results of this study. Methods Our replication study focused on replicating Cowan’s findings and assessing the robustness of Cowan’s results to alternative analytical models based on their study design. We determined how out-migration occurring during Cowan’s study may have affected the population characteristics, the intervention exposure level, and the study findings. While the original intervention targeted knowledge and attitudes as a mechanism to decrease HIV/HSV-2, the Cowan study evaluated the intervention effects on knowledge, attitudes, and prevalence of HIV or HSV-2 separately. To better identify the pathway describing the interrelationship among the intervention and knowledge, attitudes, and prevalence of HIV or HSV-2, we assessed whether increases in knowledge or attitudes were associated with decreased HIV or HSV-2 prevalence. Results We replicated the original findings with minor discrepancies during the pure replication. Our additional analyses revealed that the study population characteristics changed over time in ways that may have affected outcomes. These changes also affected the levels of intervention exposure, with 48.7% males and 75.5% females of the intervention group receiving low-level exposure. Both genders with higher level intervention exposure experienced higher increments in multiple knowledge, attitude, and sexual risk behavior outcomes. Unfortunately, these did not translate to a significant reduction in HIV or HSV-2 regardless of the level and combination of knowledge and attitude domains. However, males receiving high-level intervention exposure compared to control indicated significantly lower odds of having HIV or HSV-2 under a Bayesian modeling paradigm. Conclusions Our findings suggest a more robust conclusion on the study intervention effects. Further study based on a design that more consistently maximizes the exposure level of the intervention is necessary and should ideally be an evaluated goal in similar studies. Evaluation of the intervention impact for key subgroups of the target population is important and would better advise the use and scale-up of the evaluated interventions in various contexts. Our observation of a consistent lack of relationship between knowledge/attitudes and HIV/HSV-2 suggests a need to explore and include relevant additional and or complementary interventions, e.g., promoting effective skills in reducing risky sexual behaviors and addressing cultural and structural bottlenecks that may reduce HIV/HSV-2 risk among youth."
https://openalex.org/W2999899233,"Mounting evidence indicates that coffee, a commonly consumed beverage worldwide, is inversely associated with various chronic diseases and overall mortality. Few studies have evaluated the effect of coffee drinking on telomere length, a biomarker of chromosomal integrity, and results have been inconsistent. Understanding this association may provide mechanistic insight into associations of coffee with health. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that heavier coffee intake is associated with greater likelihood of having above-median telomere length. We evaluated the cross-sectional association between coffee intake and relative telomere length using data from 1,638 controls from four previously conducted case-control studies nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Coffee intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and relative telomere length was measured from buffy-coat, blood, or buccal cells. We used unconditional logistic regression models to generate multivariable-adjusted, study-specific odds ratios for the association between coffee intake and relative telomere length. We then conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to determine summary odds ratios. We found that neither summary continuous (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99–1.03) nor categorical (OR <3 cups/day vs. none = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.71–2.65; OR ≥3 cups/day vs. none = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.81–2.66) odds ratio estimates of coffee drinking and relative telomere length were statistically significant. However, in the largest of the four contributing studies, moderate (<3 cups/day) and heavy coffee drinkers (≥3 cups/day) were 2.10 times (95% CI = 1.25, 3.54) and 1.93 times as likely (95% CI = 1.17, 3.18) as nondrinkers to have above-median telomere length, respectively. In conclusion, we found no evidence that coffee drinking is associated with telomere length. Thus, it is unlikely that telomere length plays a role in potential coffee-disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W2999963946,"Objective This study sought to assess whether changes in depressive symptoms, general health, and area-level socio-economic status (SES) were associated to changes over time in waist circumference and body mass index (BMI). Methods A total of 2871 adults (18 years or older), living in Adelaide (South Australia), were observed across three waves of data collection spanning ten years, with clinical measures of waist circumference, height and weight. Participants completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) and Short Form 36 health questionnaires (SF-36 general health domain). An area-level SES measure, relative location factor, was derived from hedonic regression models using residential property features but blind to location. Growth curve models with latent variables were fitted to data. Results Waist circumference, BMI and depressive symptoms increased over time. General health and relative location factor decreased. Worsening general health and depressive symptoms predicted worsening waist circumference and BMI trajectories in covariate-adjusted models. Diminishing relative location factor was negatively associated with waist circumference and BMI trajectories in unadjusted models only. Conclusions Worsening depressive symptoms and general health predict increasing adiposity and suggest the development of unhealthful adiposity might be prevented by attention to negative changes in mental health and overall general health."
https://openalex.org/W3000098210,"Natural hybridization plays important roles in plant evolution and speciation. In this study, we sequenced ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS), four low-copy nuclear genes (Dbr1, SOS4a, SOS4b and PCRF1) and the chloroplast intergenic spacer trnV-trnM to test the hypothesis of hybridization between two species of Phyllagathis and Sporoxeia (Sonerileae/Dissochaeteae, Melastomataceae). Our results provided compelling evidence for the hybridization hypothesis. All hybrid individuals sampled were first-generation hybrids. The failure of flower production in the F1 hybrid individuals may work as the barrier preventing later-generation hybridization or backcross. Analysis of the chloroplast trnV-trnM sequences showed that the hybridization is bidirectional with S. petelotii as the major maternal parent. Several factors, such as sympatry, similar habitat preference, overlapping flowering season and shared pollinators, might have contributed to this hybridization event. The ""intergeneric"" hybridization reported in this study suggests close relationship between P. longicalcarata and S. petelotii."

We include merger-specific cost efficiencies in a tractable manner in the model and extend the standard UPP formulation to account for these efficiencies. The efficacy of the new UPP formulations is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation of 40,000 mergers (8 scenarios, 5,000 mergers in each scenario). We find that the new UPP formulations yield substantial gains in prediction of post-merger prices, and there are substantial gains in merger screening accuracy as well. Moreover, the new UPP formulations outperform the standard UPP formulation at higher thresholds for all the standard cases in the paper. The results are robust to several additional analyses. The results show that including cost efficiencies in a manner guided by the theoretical model may yield substantial improvements in accuracy of UPP as a tool in antitrust analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2999203462,"Calcineurin B homologous proteins (CHPs) belong to the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein (EFCaBP) family. They have multiple important functions including the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). The human isoforms CHP1 and CHP2 share high sequence similarity, but have distinct expression profiles with CHP2 levels for instance increased in malignant cells. These CHPs bind Ca2+ with high affinity. Biochemical data indicated that Ca2+ can regulate their functions. Experimental evidence for Ca2+-modulated structural changes was lacking. With a newly established fluorescent probe hydrophobicity (FPH) assay, we detected Ca2+-induced conformational changes in both CHPs. These changes are in line with an opening of their hydrophobic pocket that binds the CHP-binding region (CBD) of NHE1. Whereas the pocket is closed in the absence of Ca2+ in CHP2, it is still accessible for the dye in CHP1. Both CHPs interacted with CBD in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis revealed high binding affinity for both CHPs to CBD with equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) in the nanomolar range. The KD for CHP1:CBD was not affected by Ca2+, whereas Ca2+-depletion increased the KD 7-fold for CHP2:CBD showing a decreased affinity. The data indicate an isoform specific regulatory interaction of CHP1 and CHP2 with NHE1."
https://openalex.org/W2999423727,"The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major forest pest of pines in western North America. Beetles typically undergo a one-year life cycle with larval cold hardening in preparation for overwintering. Two-year life cycle beetles have been observed but not closely studied. This study tracks cold-hardening and preparation for overwintering by adult mountain pine beetles in their natal galleries. Adults were collected in situ between September and December 2016 for a total of nine time points during 91 days. Concentrations of 41 metabolites in these pooled samples were assessed using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Levels of glycerol and proline increased significantly with lowering temperature during the autumn. Newly eclosed mountain pine beetles appear to prepare for winter by generating the same cold-tolerance compounds found in other insect larvae including mountain pine beetle, but high on-site mortality suggested that two-year life cycle adults have a less efficacious acclimation process. This is the first documentation of cold acclimation metabolite production in overwintering new adult beetles and is evidence of physiological plasticity that would allow evolution by natural selection of alternate life cycles (shortened or lengthened) under a changing climate or during expansion into new geoclimatic areas."

Data on individual’s personality were captured using the ‘16 Personality Factor’ assessment, a tool that produces scores for 16 different elements of an individual’s personality. The existence of perfectionist and pragmatic cognitive processing styles were identified as one theme emerging from a prior analysis of these interview transcripts. We aimed to validate this, explore our ability to categorise individuals into groups based upon their cognitive processing. We identified that some individuals strongly tended to either a perfectionist or pragmatic style of cognitive processing for the majority of their decisions; however most adapted their style of processing according to the nature of the decision. Overall participants generally demonstrated average scores for all 16 personality factors tested. However, we observed that some factors tended to higher scores than others, indicating a pattern within the personalities of our sample cohort. Whilst a small sample size, our data suggests that individuals working within the same critical care environment may have clear differences in their approach to problem solving as a consequence of both their personality type and preferred style of cognitive processing. Thus there may be individuals within this environment who would benefit from increased support to minimise their risk of cognitive dissonance and stress in times of challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3000091566,"While adipose tissue is required to maintain glucose metabolism, excessive calorie intake induces obesity via mechanisms including accelerated proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes, leading to insulin resistance. Here, we investigated the role of myoferlin (MYOF), a ferlin family protein, in regulating glucose metabolism by mainly focusing on its unknown role in adipose tissue. Whereas young MYOF knockout (KO) mice on a normal diet showed aggravated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, those on a high-fat diet (HFD) showed preserved glucose tolerance with an attenuated gain of body weight, reduced visceral fat deposits, and less severe fatty liver. The Adipose MYOF expression was reduced by aging but was restored by an HFD along with the retained expression of NFAT transcription factors. Loss-of-function of MYOF in preadipocytes suppressed proliferation and differentiation into mature adipocytes along with the decreased expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. The MYOF expression in preadipocytes was reduced with differentiation. Attenuated obesity in MYOF KO mice on an HFD was also accompanied with increased oxygen consumption by an unidentified mechanism and with reduced adipose inflammation due to less inflammatory macrophages. These insights suggest that the multifunctional roles of MYOF involve the regulation of preadipocyte function and affect glucose metabolism bidirectionally depending on consumed calories."
https://openalex.org/W3000115847,"In this study, we propose a method to quantitatively analyze the concentration of VOCs adsorbed on zeolite filters via gas chromatography (GC). The sampled VOCs from the filters with ethanol as a solution were characterized using GC to determine the concentration of the adsorbed VOCs by comparing the areas of GC peaks of the detected VOCs and ethanol. The proposed method also enabled determination of the desorption (regeneration) conditions of the zeolite filters according to heating temperature and time for various VOCs. Repeated adsorption and desorption of VOCs on zeolite filters and GC analyses allow us to evaluate the durability and reusability of the filter and could help predict the lifetime of zeolite filters in practice."
https://openalex.org/W3000594272,"Low-Back Pain (LBP) is a common public health problem that is often worsened by maladaptive beliefs and disability. Thus, necessitating the need for availability of outcome measures to assess these sequelae among patients with chronic LBP. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt and determine the psychometric properties of the Yoruba version of the ODI (ODI-Y).The ODI-Y was cross-culturally adapted following the process involving forward translation, synthesis, backward translation, expert review, and pilot testing. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the ODI-Y were determined using the Cronbach's alpha and intra-class correlation. Other psychometric properties explored included the factor structure, convergent validity, standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable change.One hundred and thirty-six patients with chronic LBP took part in the validation of the ODI-Y; 86 of these individuals took part in the test-retest reliability (within 1-week interval) of the translated instrument. The mean age of the respondents was 50.5±10.6years. The ODI-Y showed a high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha (α) of 0.81. Test-retest of the Yoruba version of the ODI within 1-week interval yielded an Intra-Class Correlation coefficient of 0.89. The ODI-Y yielded a three-factor structure which accounted for 61.56% of the variance. Correlation of ODI-Y with the visual analogue scale was moderate (r = 0.30; p = 0.001). The standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change of the ODI-Y were 2.0 and 5.5.The ODI was adapted into the Yoruba language and proved to have good psychometric properties that replicated the results of other obtainable versions. We recommend it for use among Yoruba speaking patients with LBP."
https://openalex.org/W3000625134,"A Yunnan branched-spike (Ynbs) barley mutant is useful for study of the genetic mechanisms underlying variation in barley spike architecture. In the current study, a mutant (Ynbs-1), a recombinant inbred line (RIL-1), and a cultivar (BDM-8) were used as parents to develop populations. Ynbs-1 exhibits typical branched spike, whereas the others exhibit six-row spike. Genetic analysis on their F1, F2 and F3 populations showed that one recessive gene is responsible for the branched spike trait. SLAF marker generated from specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) was used to genotype the populations. A high-density genetic map of barley was constructed using 14,348 SLAF markers, which covered all 7 chromosomes at 1,347.44 cM in length with an average marker density of 0.09 cM between adjacent markers. Linkage analysis of the branched-spike trait using the genetic map indicated that branched spike trait in the Ynbs-1 is controlled by single locus on chromosome 2H at the interval between 65.00 and 65.47 cM that is flanked by Marker310119 and Marker2679451. Several candidate genes that may be responsible for barley multiple-spikelet degeneration, single-floret spikelet increase and seed set rate decrease were identified in the region. The high-density genetic map and the gene locus revealed in this study provide valuable information for elucidating the genetic mechanism of spike branching in barley."
https://openalex.org/W2998893131,"Since the size of newly hatched larval fish is directly related to egg size, small differences in initial egg size can be critical to survival and further development of offspring. Underlying processes causing size variation in fish offspring are still not entirely understood. In this study we investigated whether the spatial position of an individual egg within a clutch affects size variation in two benthic spawning coral reef fishes, the clownfishes Amphiprion ocellaris and A. frenatus. To evaluate the effects of within-clutch position on embryonic development, egg growth metrics and protein content were analysed on day 2, 5 and 8 after deposition (adp). Additionally the activities of the key metabolic enzymes citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were investigated to evaluate the physiological status of the embryos. Central eggs of A. frenatus were significantly longer and heavier than peripheral eggs only on day 2 and 5 adp (2.07 mg, 2.59 mm vs. 1.84 mg, 2.49 mm). No significant differences were observed in A. ocellaris between eggs originating from a central or peripheral (5 mm from edge) position (1.33 mg, 2.26 mm vs. 1.15 mg, 2,18 mm). Diameter of the eyes did not differ between the two fish species nor between different positions, for any age group. The protein content of eggs (7.5% of wet weight) was independent of age, position and species. Enzymatic activity increased from 2 adp until peak activity was observed for both enzymes on day 8 adp, independent from position. The range of CS- and LDH-activity was 0.3–13.0 and 0.2–71.7 U g-1 wet weight, respectively. Significant differences in enzymatic activity were observed between age groups in both species, which in connection with significantly larger eggs of A. frenatus at day 2 and 5 adp could hint at a better O2 supply of central eggs. Potential implications for captive breeding are given."
https://openalex.org/W3000287048,"Macrocypraea mammoth is a new species from Trindade, a remote oceanic island located 1160 km off Espírito Santo, Brazil. This isolated species is described in a detailed morphological scenario that includes all Recent congeneric species. The detailed anatomy of two Recent species, M. zebra and M. cervinetta, were described in a previous paper. The remaining one, M. cervus, is included herein. Brief taxonomical comments on all these species is also included. The new species can be distinguished from other Western Atlantic species by its larger size, proportionally heavier and more solid shell, more rounded and wider outline, longer posterior tapered ending and slightly inflated base; anatomically it has some exclusivities, such as the mantle papillae mostly bearing 3-5 distal aligned projections, osphradium with a shorter branch, modifications in some odontophore muscles, penis with a clear glandular region, and a sac-like bursa copulatrix with a long duct. Based on the comparative analysis, the genus Macrocypraea can be defined by the wide distance between the osphradium and gill; a twofold buccal muscle (mc); a radular ventral tensor muscle (pair m11) surrounding radular sac; and a bursa copulatrix located at middle level of the pallial oviduct.

https://openalex.org/W3000290257,"Febrile illness caused by viral and bacterial diseases (e.g., dengue and leptospirosis) often have similar symptoms and are difficult to differentiate without diagnostic tests. If not treated appropriately, patients may experience serious complications. The question of what diagnostic tests to make available to providers in order to inform antibiotic therapy remains an open problem for health services facing limited resources.We formulated the problem of minimizing the weighted average of antibiotic underuse and overuse to inform the optimal diagnostic test and antibiotic treatment options for given occurrence probabilities of several bacterial and viral infections. We modeled the weight of antibiotic overuse as a monetary penalty per unnecessarily administered course, which we varied in both the base case and sensitivity analysis. Detailed Markov cohort models of febrile illness progression were used to estimate the weight of antibiotic underuse. The model accounted for multiple infections simultaneously and incorporated test, treatment, and other direct and indirect costs, as well as the effect of delays in seeking care and test turnaround times. We used the Markov models to numerically estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), pre-penalty costs, and likelihood of antibiotics overuse per patient for fifteen different strategies in two example settings in Thailand, one with a higher probability of bacterial infections (Northern Thailand, Scenario A) and one with a higher probability of viral infections (Bangkok, Scenario B). We found that empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients always incurs the lowest pre-penalty cost (Scenario A: $47.5/patient, $100.6/patient, $149.5/patient for patients seeking care on day one, day four, and day ten respectively; Scenario B: $94.1/patient, $108.7/patient, $122.1/patient on day one, day four, and day ten respectively), and the lowest DALYs, (Scenario A: 0.2 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient, 1.7 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 0.5 DALYs/patient, 0.7 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). However, such strategy resulted in the highest proportion of antibiotic overuse per patient (Scenario A: 38.1%, 19.3%, 7.5% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 82.9%, 42.1%, 16.3% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). Consequently, empirical antibiotic treatment became suboptimal with antibiotic overuse penalties above $12,800/course, $18,400/course, $23,900/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario A and above $1,100/course, $1,500/course, $1,600/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario B.Empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients provided the best outcomes if antibiotic overuse was not the primary concern or if presenting with viral disease (such as dengue) was unlikely. Empirical antibiotic treatment to severe patients only was in most cases not beneficial. Otherwise, strategies involving diagnostic tests became optimal. In particular, our results indicated that single test strategies (bacterial RDT or viral PCR) were optimal in regions with a greater probability of presenting with viral infection. PCR-led strategies (e.g., parallel bacterial PCR, or multiplex PCR) are robust under parameter uncertainty (e.g., with uncertain disease occurrence probabilities)."
