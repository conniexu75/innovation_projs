https://openalex.org/W2784806875,"Quantum key distribution1 has reached the level of maturity required for deployment in real-world scenarios2–6. It has previously been shown to operate alongside classical communication in the same telecommunication fibre7–9 and over long distances in fibre10,11 and in free-space links12–15. Despite these advances, the practical applicability of quantum key distribution is curtailed by the fact that most implementations and protocols are limited to two communicating parties. Quantum networks scale the advantages of quantum key distribution protocols to more than two distant users. Here we present a fully connected quantum network architecture in which a single entangled photon source distributes quantum states to many users while minimizing the resources required for each. Further, it does so without sacrificing security or functionality relative to two-party communication schemes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bipartite polarization entanglement, which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels. Six states are then distributed between four users in a fully connected graph using only one fibre and one polarization analysis module per user. Because no adaptations of the entanglement source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of users, without requiring trust in the provider of the source. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active optical switches and therefore limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus has the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds. A fully connected quantum network is demonstrated in which one source of entangled photons distributes quantum states to four users, with the potential for many more users to be added."
https://openalex.org/W2903675281,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening complication of several new immunotherapies used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases1-5. Here we report that atrial natriuretic peptide can protect mice from CRS induced by such agents by reducing the levels of circulating catecholamines. Catecholamines were found to orchestrate an immunodysregulation resulting from oncolytic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide through a self-amplifying loop in macrophages. Myeloid-specific deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase inhibited this circuit. Cytokine release induced by T-cell-activating therapeutic agents was also accompanied by a catecholamine surge and inhibition of catecholamine synthesis reduced cytokine release in vitro and in mice. Pharmacologic catecholamine blockade with metyrosine protected mice from lethal complications of CRS resulting from infections and various biotherapeutic agents including oncolytic bacteria, T-cell-targeting antibodies and CAR-T cells. Our study identifies catecholamines as an essential component of the cytokine release that can be modulated by specific blockers without impairing the therapeutic response."

https://openalex.org/W4238070307,"HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), which consists of trimeric (gp160)3 cleaved to (gp120 and gp41)3, interacts with the primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor (such as chemokine receptor CCR5) to fuse viral and target-cell membranes. The gp120-coreceptor interaction has previously been proposed as the most crucial trigger for unleashing the fusogenic potential of gp41. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a full-length gp120 in complex with soluble CD4 and unmodified human CCR5, at 3.9 Å resolution. The V3 loop of gp120 inserts into the chemokine-binding pocket formed by seven transmembrane helices of CCR5, and the N terminus of CCR5 contacts the CD4-induced bridging sheet of gp120. CCR5 induces no obvious allosteric changes in gp120 that can propagate to gp41; it does bring the Env trimer close to the target membrane. The N terminus of gp120, which is gripped by gp41 in the pre-fusion or CD4-bound Env, flips back in the CCR5-bound conformation and may irreversibly destabilize gp41 to initiate fusion. The coreceptor probably functions by stabilizing and anchoring the CD4-induced conformation of Env near the cell membrane. These results advance our understanding of HIV-1 entry into host cells and may guide the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2905456928,"The annotation of the mammalian protein-coding genome is incomplete. Arbitrary size restriction of open reading frames (ORFs) and the absolute requirement for a methionine codon as the sole initiator of translation have constrained the identification of potentially important transcripts with non-canonical protein-coding potential1,2. Here, using unbiased transcriptomic approaches in macrophages that respond to bacterial infection, we show that ribosomes associate with a large number of RNAs that were previously annotated as ‘non-protein coding’. Although the idea that such non-canonical ORFs can encode functional proteins is controversial3,4, we identify a range of short and non-ATG-initiated ORFs that can generate stable and spatially distinct proteins. Notably, we show that the translation of a new ORF ‘hidden’ within the long non-coding RNA Aw112010 is essential for the orchestration of mucosal immunity during both bacterial infection and colitis. This work expands our interpretation of the protein-coding genome and demonstrates that proteinaceous products generated from non-canonical ORFs are crucial for the immune response in vivo. We therefore propose that the misannotation of non-canonical ORF-containing genes as non-coding RNAs may obscure the essential role of a multitude of previously undiscovered protein-coding genes in immunity and disease. In mouse macrophages, a range of short and non-ATG-initiated open reading frames that can generate proteins are identified, one of which is shown to be essential for host immunity to enteric mucosal infection and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2904888175,"Gap junctions establish direct pathways for cell-to-cell communication through the assembly of twelve connexin subunits that form intercellular channels connecting neighbouring cells. Co-assembly of different connexin isoforms produces channels with unique properties and enables communication across cell types. Here we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the structural basis of connexin co-assembly in native lens gap junction channels composed of connexin 46 and connexin 50 (Cx46/50). We provide the first comparative analysis to connexin 26 (Cx26), which-together with computational studies-elucidates key energetic features governing gap junction permselectivity. Cx46/50 adopts an open-state conformation that is distinct from the Cx26 crystal structure, yet it appears to be stabilized by a conserved set of hydrophobic anchoring residues. 'Hot spots' of genetic mutations linked to hereditary cataract formation map to the core structural-functional elements identified in Cx46/50, suggesting explanations for many of the disease-causing effects."
https://openalex.org/W2905279928,"Many enzymes catalyse reactions that proceed through covalent acyl-enzyme (ester or thioester) intermediates1. These enzymes include serine hydrolases2,3 (encoded by one per cent of human genes, and including serine proteases and thioesterases), cysteine proteases (including caspases), and many components of the ubiquitination machinery4,5. Their important acyl-enzyme intermediates are unstable, commonly having half-lives of minutes to hours6. In some cases, acyl-enzyme complexes can be stabilized using substrate analogues or active-site mutations but, although these approaches can provide valuable insight7-10, they often result in complexes that are substantially non-native. Here we develop a strategy for incorporating 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (DAP) into recombinant proteins, via expansion of the genetic code11. We show that replacing catalytic cysteine or serine residues of enzymes with DAP permits their first-step reaction with native substrates, allowing the efficient capture of acyl-enzyme complexes that are linked through a stable amide bond. For one of these enzymes, the thioesterase domain of valinomycin synthetase12, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway by which it progressively oligomerizes tetradepsipeptidyl substrates to a dodecadepsipeptidyl intermediate, which it then cyclizes to produce valinomycin. By trapping the first and last acyl-thioesterase intermediates in the catalytic cycle as DAP conjugates, we provide structural insight into how conformational changes in thioesterase domains of such nonribosomal peptide synthetases control the oligomerization and cyclization of linear substrates. The encoding of DAP will facilitate the characterization of diverse acyl-enzyme complexes, and may be extended to capturing the native substrates of transiently acylated proteins of unknown function."

https://openalex.org/W2904841252,"Genetic manipulation of NOD/SCID (NS) mice has yielded numerous sub-strains with specific traits useful for the study of human hematopoietic xenografts, each with unique characteristics. Here, we have compared the engraftment and output of umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells in four immune-deficient strains: NS, NS with additional IL2RG knockout (NSG), NS with transgenic expression of human myeloid promoting cytokines SCF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 (NSS), and NS with both IL2RG knockout and transgenic cytokine expression (NSGS). Overall engraftment of human hematopoietic cells was highest in the IL2RG knockout strains (NSG and NSGS), while myeloid cell output was notably enhanced in the two strains with transgenic cytokine expression (NSS and NSGS). In further comparisons of NSG and NSGS mice, several additional differences were noted. NSGS mice were found to have a more rapid reconstitution of T cells, improved B cell differentiation, increased levels of NK cells, reduced platelets, and reduced maintenance of primitive CD34+ cells in the bone marrow. NSGS were superior hosts for secondary engraftment and both strains were equally suitable for experiments of graft versus host disease. Increased levels of human cytokines as well as human IgG and IgM were detected in the serum of humanized NSGS mice. Furthermore, immunization of humanized NSGS mice provided evidence of a functional response to repeated antigen exposure, implying a more complete hematopoietic graft was generated in these mice. These results highlight the important role that myeloid cells and myeloid-supportive cytokines play in the formation of a more functional xenograft immune system in humanized mice."
https://openalex.org/W2792505362,"The interplay between magnetism and doping is at the origin of exotic strongly correlated electronic phases and can lead to novel forms of magnetic ordering. One example is the emergence of incommensurate spin-density waves with a wave vector that does not match the reciprocal lattice. In one dimension this effect is a hallmark of Luttinger liquid theory, which also describes the low energy physics of the Hubbard model. Here we use a quantum simulator based on ultracold fermions in an optical lattice to directly observe such incommensurate spin correlations in doped and spin-imbalanced Hubbard chains using fully spin and density resolved quantum gas microscopy. Doping is found to induce a linear change of the spin-density wave vector in excellent agreement with Luttinger theory predictions. For non-zero polarization we observe a decrease of the wave vector with magnetization as expected from the Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. We trace the microscopic origin of these incommensurate correlations to holes, doublons and excess spins which act as delocalized domain walls for the antiferromagnetic order. Finally, when inducing interchain coupling we observe fundamentally different spin correlations around doublons indicating the formation of a magnetic polaron."
https://openalex.org/W2905197516,"Abnormal increases in nucleolar size and number caused by dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis has emerged as a hallmark in the majority of spontaneous cancers. The observed ribosome hyperactivity can be directly induced by the MYC transcription factors controlling the expression of RNA and protein components of the ribosome. Neuroblastoma, a highly malignant childhood tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, is frequently characterized by MYCN gene amplification and high expression of MYCN and c-MYC signature genes. Here, we show a strong correlation between high-risk disease, MYCN expression, poor survival, and ribosome biogenesis in neuroblastoma patients. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with quarfloxin or CX-5461, two small molecule inhibitors of RNA polymerase I, suppressed MycN expression, induced DNA damage, and activated p53 followed by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. CX-5461 repressed the growth of established MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma xenograft tumors in nude mice. These findings suggest that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis represent new therapeutic opportunities for children with high-risk neuroblastomas expressing high levels of Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2904454375,"Plexiform neurofibroma, a benign peripheral nerve tumor, is associated with the biallelic loss of function of the NF1 tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. Here, we show that FLLL32, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling, reduces neurofibroma growth in mice with conditional, biallelic deletion of Nf1 in the Schwann cell lineage. FLLL32 treatment or Stat3 deletion in tumor cells reduced inflammatory cytokine expression and tumor macrophage numbers in neurofibroma. Although STAT3 inhibition downregulated the chemokines CCL2 and CCL12, which can signal through CCR2 to recruit macrophages to peripheral nerves, deletion of Ccr2 did not improve survival or reduce macrophage numbers in neurofibroma-bearing mice. Interestingly, Iba1+; F4/80+;CD11b+ macrophages accounted for ~20-40% of proliferating cells in untreated tumors. FLLL32 suppressed macrophage proliferation, implicating STAT3-dependent, local proliferation in neurofibroma macrophage accumulation, and decreased Schwann cell proliferation and increased Schwann cell death. The functions of STAT3 signaling in neurofibroma Schwann cells and macrophages, and its relevance as a therapeutic target in neurofibroma, merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2903975653,"Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is the most widely prevalent and economically important of the complex of RNA viruses associated with grapevine leafroll disease (GLD). Phylogenetic studies have grouped GLRaV-3 isolates into nine different monophyletic groups and four supergroups, making GLRaV-3 a genetically highly diverse virus species. In addition, new divergent variants have been discovered recently around the world. Accurate identification of the virus is an essential component in the management and control of GLRaV-3; however, the diversity of GLRaV-3, coupled with the limited sequence information, have complicated the development of a reliable detection assay. In this study, GLRaV-3 sequence data available in GenBank and those generated at Foundation Plant Services, University of California-Davis, was used to develop a new RT-qPCR assay with the capacity to detect all known GLRaV-3 variants. The new assay, referred to as FPST, was challenged against samples that included plants infected with different GLRaV-3 variants and originating from 46 countries. The FPST assay detected all known GLRaV-3 variants, including the highly divergent variants, by amplifying a small highly conserved region in the 3’ untranslated terminal region (UTR) of the virus genome. The reliability of the new RT-qPCR assay was confirmed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that can detect all known GLRaV-3 variants characterized to date. Additionally, three new GLRaV-3 divergent variants, represented by four isolates, were identified using a hierarchical testing process involving the FPST assay, GLRaV-3 variant-specific assays and high-throughput sequencing analysis. These variants were distantly related to groups I, II, III, V, VI, VII and IX, but much similar to GLRaV-3 variants with no assigned group; thus, they may represent new clades. Finally, based on the phylogenetic analysis, a new GLRaV-3 subclade is proposed and named as group X."
https://openalex.org/W2905285542,"Temozolomide was recognized as the first-line therapy for glioblastoma to prolong the survival of patients noticeably, while recent clinical studies found that some patients were not sensitive to temozolomide treatment. The possible mechanisms seemed to be methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), mismatch repair, PARP, etc. And the abnormal expression of MGMT might be the most direct factor. In this study, we provide evidence that Fstl1 plays a vital role in temozolomide resistance by sequentially regulating DIP2A protein distribution, H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), and MGMT transcription. As a multifunctional protein widely distributed in cells, DIP2A cooperates with the HDAC2-DMAP1 complex to enhance H3K9Ac deacetylation, prevent MGMT transcription, and increase temozolomide sensitivity. Fstl1, a glycoprotein highly expressed in glioblastoma, competitively binds DIP2A to block DIP2A nuclear translocation, so as to hinder DIP2A from binding the HDAC2-DMAP1 complex. The overexpression of Fstl1 promoted the expression of MGMT in association with increased promoter H3K9Ac. Upregulation of Fstl1 enhanced temozolomide resistance, whereas Fstl1 silencing obviously sensitized GBM cells to temozolomide both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, DIP2A depletion abolished the effects of Fstl1 on MGMT expression and temozolomide resistance. These findings highlight an important role of Fstl1 in the regulation of temozolomide resistance by modulation of DIP2A/MGMT signaling."

Understanding how microorganisms deconstruct lignin is important for understanding the global carbon cycle and could aid in developing systems for processing plant biomass into valuable commodities. Sphingomonad bacteria use stereospecific glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) called β-etherases to cleave the β-aryl ether (β-O-4) bond, the most common bond between aromatic subunits in lignin. Previously characterized bacterial β-etherases are homodimers that fall into two distinct GST subclasses: LigE homologues, which cleave the β(R) stereoisomer of the bond, and LigF homologues, which cleave the β(S) stereoisomer. Here, we report on a heterodimeric β-etherase (BaeAB) from the sphingomonad Novosphingobium aromaticivorans that stereospecifically cleaves the β(R)-aryl ether bond of the di-aromatic compound β-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-γ-hydroxypropiovanillone (MPHPV). BaeAB's subunits are phylogenetically distinct from each other and from other β-etherases, although they are evolutionarily related to LigF, despite the fact that BaeAB and LigF cleave different β-aryl ether bond stereoisomers. We identify amino acid residues in BaeAB's BaeA subunit important for substrate binding and catalysis, including an asparagine that is proposed to activate the GSH cofactor. We also show that BaeAB homologues from other sphingomonads can cleave β(R)-MPHPV and that they may be as common in bacteria as LigE homologues. Our results suggest that the ability to cleave the β-aryl ether bond arose independently at least twice in GSTs and that BaeAB homologues may be important for cleaving the β(R)-aryl ether bonds of lignin-derived oligomers in nature.

https://openalex.org/W2903755828,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor and resistant to current available therapeutics, such as radiation. To improve the clinical efficacy, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying tumor responses to radiation. Here, we investigated long-term cellular responses of human GBM cells to ionizing radiation. Comparing to the initial response within 12 hours, gene expression modulation at 7 days after radiation is markedly different. While genes related to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage responses are mostly modulated at the initial stage; immune-related genes are specifically affected as the long-term effect. This later response is associated with increased cellular senescence and inhibition of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Mechanistically, TAZ inhibition does not depend on the canonical Hippo pathway, but relies on enhanced degradation mediated by the β-catenin destruction complex in the Wnt pathway. We further showed that depletion of TAZ by RNAi promotes radiation-induced senescence and growth arrest. Pharmacological activation of the β-catenin destruction complex is able to promote radiation-induced TAZ inhibition and growth arrest in these tumor cells. The correlation between senescence and reduced expression of TAZ as well as β-catenin also occurs in human gliomas treated by radiation. Collectively, these findings suggested that inhibition of TAZ is involved in radiation-induced senescence and might benefit GBM radiotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W4236705240,"Parturition is a painful event experienced by cows at the onset of lactation. This pain could lead to a reduced feed intake, altered metabolic and immunological status, and a host of other diseases that could seriously limit her productive herd lifespan. The objective of the current study was to assess the effect of administration of a single dose of oral meloxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), on the production and health status of cows during their lactation. A total of 2,653 (1,009 meloxicam-treated and 1,644 untreated control) cows were enrolled across 20 herds in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Relative to untreated controls, meloxicam-treated cows produced 0.64 kg/day (SE = 0.29. P = 0.03) more milk over the first 3 test days (90–120 days in lactation), had 0.75 times the odds of subclinical mastitis at first test (SE = 0.08, P = 0.01), and were culled or died at 0.46 times the rate (SE = 0.16, P = 0.03) before 60 days in milk. These results are consistent with previous research and lend support to the hypothesis that parturition is a painful event in cattle. Attempts to ameliorate such pain with analgesics is associated with a variety of positive health and production outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2905099677,"Levels of augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), a multifunctional protein, are reduced in steatohepatitis. ALR depletion from ALR flox/flox/Alb-Cre [ALR-L-knockout (KO)] mouse causes robust steatosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes, and pericellular fibrosis between 1 and 2 wk postbirth. Steatosis regresses by 4 wk upon reappearance of ALR-expressing hepatocytes. We investigated mechanisms of ALR depletion-induced steatosis. ALR-L-KO mice (1-, 2-, and 4 wk old) and Adeno-Cre-transfected ALR flox/flox hepatocytes were used for in vivo and in vitro studies. ALR depletion from hepatocytes in vivo downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT1)a, peroxisomal membrane protein 70 (PMP70) (modest down-regulation), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1). The markedly up-regulated (20X) novel microRNA-540 (miR-540) was identified to target PPARα, PMP70, ACOX1, and CPT1a. ALR depletion from primary hepatocytes increased oxidative stress, miR-540 expression, and steatosis and down-regulated PPARα, ACOX1, PMP70, and CPT1a expression. Anti-miR-540 mitigated ALR depletion-induced steatosis and prevented loss of PPARα, ACOX1, PMP70, and CPT1a expression. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and recombinant ALR (rALR) both inhibited ALR depletion-induced miR-540 expression and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Finally, treatment of ALR-L-KO mice with rALR between 1 and 2 wk prevented miR-540 expression, and arrested steatosis and fibrosis. We conclude that ALR deficiency-mediated oxidative stress induces generation of miR-540, which promotes steatosis by dysregulating peroxisomal and mitochondrial lipid homeostasis.-Kumar, S., Rani, R., Karns, R., Gandhi, C. R. Augmenter of liver regeneration protein deficiency promotes hepatic steatosis by inducing oxidative stress and microRNA-540 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2904102676,"Decomposing vertebrates, including humans, result in pronounced changes in surrounding soil biogeochemistry, particularly nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) availability, and alter soil micro- and macrofauna. However, the impacts of subsurface human decomposition, where oxygen becomes limited and microbial biomass is generally lower, are far less understood. The goals of this study were to evaluate the impact of human decomposition in a multi-individual, shallow (~70 cm depth) grave on soil biogeochemistry and soil microbial and nematode communities. Three individuals were interred and allowed to decay for four years. Soils were collected from two depths (0‒5 and 30‒35 cm) along linear transects radiating from the grave as well as from within and below (85‒90 cm depth) the grave during excavation to assess how decomposition affects soil properties. Along radiating surface transects, several extracellular enzymes rates and nematode richness increased with increasing distance from the grave, and likely reflect physical site disruption due to grave excavation and infill. There was no evidence of carcass-sourced C and N lateral migration from the grave, at least at 30‒35 cm depth. Within the grave, soils exhibited significant N-enrichment (e.g., ammonium, dissolved organic N), elevated electrical conductivity, and elevated respiration rates with depth. Soil biogeochemistry within the grave, particularly in the middle (30‒35 cm) and base (70‒75 cm depth), was significantly altered by human decomposition. Mean microbial gene abundances changed with depth in the grave, demonstrating increased microbial presence in response to ongoing decomposition. Human-associated Bacteroides were only detected at the base of the grave where anoxic conditions prevailed. Nematode community abundance and richness were reduced at 70‒75 cm and not detectable below 85‒90 cm. Further, we identified certain Plectus spp. as potential indicators of enrichment due to decomposition. Here we demonstrate that human decomposition influences soil biogeochemistry, microbes, and microfauna up to four years after burial."
https://openalex.org/W2904737867,"p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that maintains genome stability, but its Δ133p53β and Δ160p53β isoforms promote breast cancer cell invasion. The sequence truncations in the p53 core domain raise key questions related to their physicochemical properties, including structural stabilities, interaction mechanisms, and DNA-binding abilities. Herein, we investigated the conformational dynamics of Δ133p53β and Δ160p53β with and without binding to p53-specific DNA by using molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that the core domains of the 2 truncated isoforms are much less stable than wild-type (wt) p53β, and the increased solvent exposure of their aggregation-triggering segment indicates their higher aggregation propensities than wt p53. We also found that Δ133p53β stability is modulable by peptide or DNA interactions. Adding a p53 peptide (derived from truncated p53 sequence 107-129) may help stabilize Δ133p53. Most importantly, our simulations of p53 isomer-DNA complexes indicate that Δ133p53β dimer, but not Δ160p53β dimer, could form a stable complex with p53-specific DNA, which is consistent with recent experiments. This study provides physicochemical insight into Δ133p53β, Δ133p53β-DNA complexes, Δ133p53β's pathologic mechanism, and peptide-based inhibitor design against p53-related cancers.-Lei, J., Qi, R., Tang, Y., Wang, W., Wei, G., Nussinov, R., Ma, B.

https://openalex.org/W2904281727,"Following the emergence of H7N9 influenza in March 2013, local animal and public health authorities in China have been closing live bird markets as a measure to try to control the H7N9 influenza epidemic. The role of live bird market (LBM) closure on the spread of N7N9 influenza following the closure of LBMs during March to May 2013 (the first wave) and October 2013 to March 2014 (the second wave) is described in this paper. Different provinces implemented closure actions at different times, and intensive media reports on H7N9 in different provinces started at different times. Local broiler prices dropped dramatically in places with outbreaks and more live chickens were transported to other LBMs in neighboring areas without human cases from infected areas when live bird markets were being closed. There were six clusters of human infection from March to May 2013 and October 2013 to March 2014 and there may have been intensive poultry transportation among cluster areas. These findings provide evidence that the closure of LBMs in early waves of H7N9 influenza had resulted in expansion of H7N9 infection to uninfected areas. This suggests that provincial authorities in inland provinces should be alert to the risks of sudden changes in movement patterns for live birds after LBM closure or increased publicity about LBM closure."

https://openalex.org/W2905217852,"Cytochrome c (cyt c) is a small hemoprotein involved in electron shuttling in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is now also recognized as an important mediator of apoptotic cell death. Its role in inducing programmed cell death is closely associated with the formation of a complex with the mitochondrion-specific phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), leading to a gain of peroxidase activity. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this gain and eventual cyt c autoinactivation via its release from mitochondrial membranes remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the kinetics of the H2O2-mediated peroxidase activity of cyt c both in the presence and absence of tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL)- and tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (TLCL)-containing liposomes to evaluate the role of cyt c–CL complex formation in the induction and stimulation of cyt c peroxidase activity. Moreover, we examined peroxide-mediated cyt c heme degradation to gain insights into the mechanisms by which cyt c self-limits its peroxidase activity. Bottom-up proteomics revealed >50 oxidative modifications on cyt c upon peroxide reduction.

However, the single-chain hemoprotein is nowadays also known as a key mediator of apoptosis (1Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Upon apoptosis induction, the protein is released from the inner membrane space of the mitochondria to the cytosol where it binds to apoptosis-activating factor 1 (2Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Mitochondria and apoptosis.Eur. J.

Furthermore, CL acts not only as a passive template for the induction of peroxidase activity in cyt c but actively provides substrates for its enzymatic activity. CL-induced peroxidase activity of cyt c leads to lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) formation in CL, which further promotes its enzymatic activity as well as the subsequent release of cyt c from the mitochondria (7Kagan V.E.

However, it remains to be clarified whether pre-existing lipid hydroperoxides in CL may be sufficient to initiate the proposed autocatalytic cycle or whether H2O2 is still mandatory for the cyt c peroxidase-derived permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane upon apoptosis induction (19Puchkov M.N.

Several studies report an increased degradation of cyt c upon complex formation with CL (20Tyurina Y.Y. Kini V. Tyurin V.A. Vlasova I.I. Jiang J. Kapralov A.A. Belikova N.A. Yalowich J.C.

Cyt c oxidative modifications were also observed in the absence of CL after incubating the protein with H2O2 (21Harel S. Salan M.A. Kanner J.

Oxidative modification of cytochrome c by hydrogen peroxide.Mol. Cells. 2006; 22 (17085975): 220-227PubMed Google Scholar). Thereby, both cyt c–derived peroxidase activity and Fenton chemistry were described as possible oxidative pathways, suggesting that peroxidase activity of cyt c and a subsequent heme degradation may be interlinked (24Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Cytochrome c-catalyzed membrane lipid peroxidation by hydrogen peroxide.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288 (1654818): 118-12510.1016/0003-9861(91)90172-FCrossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether CL-dependent degradation of the protein is a result of its peroxidase activity and subsequent heme degradation by released radical by-products. Here, we examined the kinetics of the H2O2-mediated peroxidase activity of cyt c both in the absence and presence of CL-containing liposomes to evaluate the role of cyt c–CL complex formation in the induction and promotion of its enzymatic activity. Thereby, the role of the CL fatty acyl chains was also considered, thus expanding comparable recent studies (25Yin V. Shaw G.S. Konermann L. Cytochrome c as a peroxidase: activation of the precatalytic native state by H2O2-induced covalent modifications.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139 (29048162): 15701-1570910.1021/jacs.7b07106Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subsequent heme degradation in cyt c was evaluated to gain insights into the self-limiting mechanisms occurring during the cyt c–based peroxidase activity, providing a basis for free radical chemistry. Furthermore, over 50 oxidative modifications of cyt c resulting from the enzymatic activity of cyt c–CL complexes were studied using a bottom-up proteomics approach, and a new mechanism of autocatalyzed cyt c carbonylation via Tyr-derived cofactor leading to the reduction of protein positive charge and dissociation of cyt c–CL complex was proposed. We first performed kinetic measurements to investigate cyt c–based peroxidase activity in the sole presence of H2O2. The averaged kinetic curves (Fig. 1A) clearly show a time-dependent 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical formation upon addition of increasing H2O2 concentrations (straight lines). Three different kinetic phases were observable, namely a lag phase with low enzymatic activity, a subsequent steady-state phase of constant ABTS oxidation followed by a complete cease of the peroxidase activity. Thereby, at higher H2O2 concentrations (bolder lines), shorter lag phases, higher steady-state enzyme activities, and a quicker deactivation of the latter were observed, apparently also leading to lower ABTS radical yields. In the absence of H2O2 (dashed line) or cyt c (not shown), no ABTS oxidation took place. Thus, H2O2 activates and promotes cyt c–based peroxidase activity but subsequently also leads to its autocatalytic limitation. A replot of the steady-state ABTS radical formation rate against the applied amount of H2O2 (Fig. 1B) showed a linear concentration dependence, which indicates pseudo-first order reaction conditions and translates to a kobs value of 6.0 ± 0.5 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 2B). By comparing the obtained ABTS radical yield with the applied H2O2 concentration, the relative efficiency of the cyt c–based peroxidase activity was also calculated, again assuming formation of two ABTS radicals per peroxidase cycle. However, even at 25 μm H2O2, only the formation of 20.13 μm ABTS radicals was observed, corresponding to a relative yield of 40.3 ± 3.5%. With increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations, this value considerably decreased (Fig. 1C). Thus, a strong H2O2-mediated promotion of cyt c–based peroxidase activity translates to lower relative enzymatic efficiencies due to quick enzyme inactivation. We next tested whether the presence of CL influences the H2O2-dependent peroxidase activity of cyt c by applying large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) liposomes with different lipid compositions. The kinetic measurements (Fig. 2A) clearly showed that both in the absence (black) and in the presence of tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL)-containing liposomes (blue) no cyt c–based peroxidase activity was observed in the absence of H2O2 (dashed lines), but TOCL strongly promoted the cyt c enzymatic activity in the presence of H2O2 (straight lines). A shorter lag phase and an about 5-fold higher subsequent H2O2-dependent steady-state ABTS radical formation rate (Fig. 2B; 26.7 ± 1.6 m− s−1) were observed as compared with the lipid-free samples. Thus, TOCL promotes the H2O2-mediated cyt c–based peroxidase activity, which also translates to an about 2.6-fold higher relative product yield (Fig. 2A; 53 μm ABTS radicals). Upon application of tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (TLCL)-containing liposomes (red), cyt c–based peroxidase activity was observed even in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 2A, dashed line), yielding about 20 μm ABTS radicals after 1 h. Moreover, the three kinetic phases described above were clearly visible. In the additional presence of H2O2 (Fig. 2A, straight line) a shorter lag phase, an unchanged subsequent steady-state ABTS radical formation rate, and a quicker cease of peroxidase activity were observed, yielding similar overall product yields (22 μm after 40 min). As TLCL does not influence the H2O2 concentration–dependent cyt c–based peroxidase activity (Fig. S1), a comparable rate was determined (Fig. 2B; 4.3 ± 0.6 m−1 s−1) as compared with the lipid-free measurements. Thus, TLCL is able to replace H2O2 in terms of activation and promotion of cyt c–based peroxidase activity but shows no cumulative effects in the additional presence of H2O2. Control measurements with 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC)-containing liposomes (green) showed no effect of this lipid on the cyt c–based peroxidase activity either in the absence or presence of H2O2. This holds for the kinetics of ABTS radical formation (Fig. 2A) as well as for the calculated H2O2-dependent steady-state peroxidase activity of cyt c (Fig. 2B; 6.0 ± 1.0 m−1 s−1). Thus, the reported effects of TOCL and TLCL on cyt c–based peroxidase activity are cardiolipin-specific. Control measurements were also performed at continuous H2O2 production by applying the glucose oxidase (GO)–glucose system. Again, the ABTS-based measurements showed sigmoidal kinetics (Fig. S2). Both in the absence of lipid (black) and in the presence of TOCL-containing liposomes (blue), higher constant H2O2 production rates translated to shorter lag phases, higher steady-state enzyme activities, and a quicker cease of cyt c–based peroxidase activity. TOCL strongly promoted those effects. Accordingly, in the presence of the lipid, about 3.5-fold higher relative enzymatic efficiencies of cyt c were observed as calculated from the amount of ABTS radicals formed after 180 min. However, both in the absence and in the presence of TOCL-containing liposomes, the relative product yield again decreased at higher H2O2 production rates. To further prove the connection between cyt c–based peroxidase activity and its subsequent inactivation, we monitored spectral changes of cyt c upon its incubation with H2O2 and/or cardiolipin. The cyt c spectrum (Fig. 3A) clearly showed that in the absence of H2O2 (dashed lines) almost no Soret band loss was observed within 3 h of incubation (gray to black), indicating no substantial heme destruction. However, increasing amounts of H2O2 (bolder straight lines) led to a concentration-dependent decrease both of the Soret band at 409 nm and the lower α and β bands beyond 510 nm, indicating heme bleaching. By continuously monitoring the Soret band loss at 409 nm (Fig. 3B), H2O2 concentration–dependent sigmoidal curves correlated with the time-dependent peroxidase activity of cyt c (Fig. 1A). In the absence of H2O2 (dashed line), no significant Soret band loss was observed. By replotting the kobs values determined from the linear part of the time-dependent Soret band loss versus the H2O2 concentrations used, a linear correlation was observed (Fig. 4B, black) and translated to a k2 value of 0.53 ± 0.01 m−1 s−1 for the H2O2-derived heme destruction in cyt c (Fig. 4C). Control measurements showed a correlation of the H2O2-derived Soret band loss (Fig. S3, squares) with the release of free iron (Fig. S3, circles), thus providing additional proof for the H2O2-derived heme destruction as a cause for the autocatalytic inactivation of cyt c–based peroxidase activity. Thereby, the free iron concentration was determined by repeated sampling and application of the ferrozine assay. The corresponding calibration curve is given as Fig. S4. Comparable measurements with TOCL-containing liposomes (Fig. 4A, blue) also showed no Soret band loss in the absence of H2O2 (dashed line). However, in its presence (straight line), considerably faster but only partial heme degradation was observed. Again, a linear correlation between the kobs values (linear part of the kinetics) and the H2O2 concentration was determined (Fig. 4B), yielding a k2 value of 1.58 ± 0.03 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, the promoting effect of TOCL on H2O2-mediated cyt c–based peroxidase activity (Fig. 2) translates to an about 3 times faster heme degradation. PLPC (green) did not influence the H2O2-derived heme degradation (Fig. 4, A–C) as the lipid has no effect on cyt c–based peroxidase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). The results in the presence of TLCL-containing liposomes (red) were also comparable with the data from the peroxidase activity measurements. Even in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 4A, dashed line), a short lag phase was followed by an exponential loss of the Soret band intensity, indicating heme destruction in about 77% of the cyt c proteins. In the additional presence of H2O2 (straight line), an instant, even faster, and almost complete loss of the Soret band was observed, corresponding to the quick deactivation of the cyt c–based peroxidase activity observed under these conditions (Fig. 2). From the replot of the linear part of the Soret band loss against the H2O2 concentration, a k2 value of 2.48 ± 0.21 m−1 s−1 was calculated, indicating an almost 5 times faster H2O2-derived heme degradation in the presence of TLCL. Thereby, the linear relationship is shifted to higher kobs values, illustrating the heme-degrading effect of this lipid in the absence of H2O2. The results clearly show that TOCL promotes both cyt c–based peroxidase activity (Fig. 2) and subsequent heme degradation (Fig. 4) only in the presence of H2O2, whereas TLCL promotes the named processes even in the absence of H2O2. This difference may result from the activation of cyt c–based peroxidase activity by pre-existing LOO"
https://openalex.org/W2903984439,"Background and Aims Patients who leave Emergency Department before physician’s visit (LWBS) or during treatment (LDT) represent a useful indicator of the emergency care's quality. The profile of patients LWBS was described: they are generally males, young, with lower urgency triage allocation and longer waiting time. They have a greater risk of ED re-admission compared to discharged patients, but effect on hospitalization and mortality are more controversial. The aims of this study are to identify determinants and adverse short term outcomes for LWBS and LDT patients. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study that include all ED visits of LWBS, LDT and discharged patients in 2015 in the Lazio region, Central Italy. Determinants of LWBS or LDT were selected from gender, age, citizenship, residence area, triage category, chronic comorbidities, number of uncompleted ED visit in the previous year, mode of arrival in ED, time-band, day of the week, waiting time and ED crowding, using a multi-level logistic regression. A multivariate logistic regression was used to test if LWBS or LDT have a greater risk of short term adverse outcome compared to discharged patients. Results The cohort consists in 835,440 visits in ED, 86.8% subjects visited and discharged, 8.9% subjects are LWBS patients and 4.3% LDT. LWBS and LDT patients are mainly young, males, with a less severe triage, with long waiting times in ED. Moreover, ED crowding and leaving ED before physician’s visit in the previous year are risk factors of self-discharging. LWBS and LDT patients have a higher risk of readmission (LWBS: OR = 4.63, 95%CI 4.5–4.7; OR = 2.89, 95%CI 2.8–2.9; LDT: OR = 3.12, 95%CI 3–3.2; OR = 2.25, 95%CI2.2–2.3 for readmissions within 2 and 7 days respectively) and hospitalization (LWBS: OR = 3.65, 95%CI 3.4–3.9; OR = 2.25, 95%CI 2.1–2.4; LDT: OR = 3.96, 95%CI 3.6–4.3; OR = 2.62, 95%CI 2.4–2.8 for hospitalization within 2 and 7 days respectively). Furthermore, we find a mortality excess of risk for LWBS patients compared to the reference group (OR = 2.56, 95%CI1.6–4.2; OR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.3–2.2 within 2 and 7 days respectively). Conclusions Determinants of LWBS confirmed what already known, but LDT patients should be further investigated. There could be adverse health effects for people with LWBS and LDT behaviour. This could be an issue that the Regional Health System should deal with."
https://openalex.org/W2904639297,"An increasing number of antibody-based therapies are being considered for controlling bacterial infections, including Clostridium difficile by targeting toxins A and B. In an effort to develop novel C. difficile immunotherapeutics, we previously isolated several single-domain antibodies (VHHs) capable of toxin A neutralization through recognition of the extreme C-terminal combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain, but failed at identifying neutralizing VHHs that bound a similar region on toxin B. Here we report the isolation of a panel of 29 VHHs targeting at least seven unique epitopes on a toxin B immunogen composed of a portion of the central delivery domain and the entire CROPs domain. Despite monovalent affinities as high as KD = 70 pM, none of the VHHs tested were capable of toxin B neutralization; however, modest toxin B inhibition was observed with VHH-VHH dimers and to a much greater extent with VHH-Fc fusions, reaching the neutralizing potency of the recently approved anti-toxin B monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab in in vitro assays. Epitope binning revealed that several VHH-Fcs bound toxin B at sites distinct from the region recognized by bezlotoxumab, while other VHH-Fcs partially competed with bezlotoxumab for toxin binding. Therefore, the VHHs described here are effective at toxin B neutralization when formatted as bivalent VHH-Fc fusions by targeting toxin B at regions both similar and distinct from the bezlotoxumab binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2905340293,"Multiple cancer signalling networks take part in regulatory crosstalks with the Hippo tumour suppressor pathway through the transcriptional cofactor Yes-associated protein (YAP). Nevertheless, how YAP is controlled by pathway crosstalks in tumourigenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a targeted kinase inhibitor screen in human cancer cells to identify novel Hippo pathway regulators. Notably, we identified the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK1), a molecule not previously associated with Hippo signalling. NTRK1 inhibition decreased YAP-driven transcription, cancer cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, using a complementary functional genomics approach and mouse xenograft models, we show that NTRK1 regulates YAP oncogenic activity in vivo. Mechanistically, NTRK1 inhibition was found to induce large suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) phosphorylation and to control YAP subcellular localization. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence of crosstalks between the NGF-NTRK1 and Hippo cancer pathways."

Information channels and sources both play an important role in the dissemination of information. Trust in a source is often used as a proxy for whether a particular piece of information is credible. To determine preferences for information channels and trust in various sources for information on nature-related topics, a mail-out survey was sent to randomly selected U.S. addresses (n = 1,030). Diverse groups of people may have differing communication preferences. Therefore, we explored differences in channel preferences and trust by demographics using regression models. Overall, the most preferred channels were personal experience, reading online content, and watching visual media online. The most trusted sources were science organizations, universities, and friends/family. Channel preferences varied the most by education level and age, while source trust was most influenced by education, race, age, and size of current residence (rural-urban). The influence of demographics varied depending on the individual channel and source, with some groups preferring certain channels or sources but not others. Results are useful to consider when disseminating information on nature-related topics to a general public audience. More broadly, results also suggest spreading information using different channels and sources depending on the specific audience being targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2905022420,"Recently, the clinical importance of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and its protective role against several chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and several types of cancers has been reported. However, its association with cardio-metabolic risk factors among patients candidate for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has not been evaluated yet. CABG is associated with increased oxidative stress and free radicals; so, the current study was aimed to evaluate the potential association of TAC with cardiovascular risk factors among patients candidate for CABG.In the current cross-sectional study, 454 patients aged 35-80 years as candidates of CABG and hospitalized in Tehran Heart Center were enrolled. Anthropometric and demographic characteristics were obtained from all participants. Total dietary antioxidant capacity (TAC) was calculated according to the findings of semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Biochemical parameters including serum lipids, albumin, creatinine, HbA1C, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipoprotein (a), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum vitamin D concentrations were also assessed by commercial laboratory methods.Male patients in the top quintiles of TAC had significantly lower prevalence of hypertension (35.1% vs 45.9%). Moreover, male patients at fifth quintile of TAC were 2% more serum vitamin D concentrations, 3% lower serum cholesterol concentrations compared with lowest quintile. Top quintiles of TAC make patients more likely to have low hematocrit and high serum albumin concentrations compared with lowest quintiles (P < 0.05). However, in female participants, only serum creatinine concentration was in negative association with TAC. In comparison of clinical parameters, females in the fifth quintile of TAC had 9% higher EF compared with patients in the first quintile (P = 0.021).To our findings, higher dietary antioxidant capacity was associated with lower prevalence of hypertension, lower hematocrit, total cholesterol and higher albumin and vitamin D concentrations. Therefore, high dietary TAC could be considered as a potent protective tool against cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients CABG candidate for especially in male patients."
https://openalex.org/W2905225240,"Background While HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is increasing in Hong Kong, unprotected sex apparently remains prevalent among those infected but virally non-suppressed. Little is known about how sexual behaviours and sexual connections may change among MSM along their HIV care continuum. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, HIV-positive MSM attending the largest HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong between October and December 2014 were invited to complete a self-administrated structured questionnaire. Their behavioural profile and partner sourcing patterns during the one-year period respectively (a) before HIV diagnosis, (b) after HIV diagnosis, (c) after initiation of antiretroviral treatment and (d) preceding the survey were examined. Results Of 345 recruited MSM, 304 (88.1%) had treatment initiated and 272 (78.8%) had viral load suppressed. In the first year after HIV diagnosis, the proportion reporting inconsistent condom use dropped from 47.0% to 17.5% (p<0.05) and from 49.6% to 17.8% (p<0.01) for anal sex with main and casual partners respectively. Except for mobile applications, usage of most sex-networking venues decreased significantly after diagnosis. Inconsistent condom usage rate remained at around 20% after treatment initiation and viral load suppression, but the frequency of use of sex-networking venues further varied among virally suppressed MSM. Conclusions Most HIV-positive MSM had persistently low level of sexual risk behaviours along their care continuum and achieved viral load suppression, conferring a general reduction of secondary transmission risk in Hong Kong. To increase the effectiveness of Treatment as Prevention strategy, uptake of HIV testing for undiagnosed HIV-positive MSM shall be emphasised."
https://openalex.org/W2905346092,"Water conservation and economics dictate that fresh produce processors reuse/recirculate the process water. However, the ensuing accumulation of organic matter in water depletes the chlorine sanitizer required for food safety. In this study, we comprehensively investigated chemical compounds that are responsible for water quality in relation to chemical oxygen demand (COD) and chlorine demand (CLD), the two most critical factors associated with water treatment and chlorine replenishment. Simulating commercial fresh-cut wash operations, multiple batches of diced cabbage (0.3 x 0.3 cm2) were washed in the same tank of water. The major components were isolated from the wash water and analyzed by HPLC. Sugars were the predominant compounds (82.7% dry weight) and the major contributor to COD (81.6%), followed by proteins/peptides (7.3% dry weight, 5.3% COD), organic acids (6.2% dry weight, 3.6% COD), and phenolics (0.5% dry weight, 0.5% COD). By repeated time course measures, the effect of these chemicals on CLD are dependent on the chemical structure, concentration in the wash water, and their rate of reaction. Proteins/peptides accounted for about 50% of the total CLD over a 120-min period and phenolics was 21% at 5 min, but diminished with time. The contribution by organic acids and sugars increased continuously, reaching 22% and 16% of total CLD at 120 min of chlorination, respectively. Collectively, these compounds represented 86% of the CLD in cabbage wash water at 5 min and greater than 94% CLD afterwards. This is the first systematic report on the source of COD and CLD during fresh produce washing. It provides essential information for the produce processors to develop safe, effective, and economical wash water treatment/reuse and chlorine replenishment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2904320214,"Using time-series transcriptomic data from poplar roots undergoing polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress, we built a genetic network model of the involved putative molecular responses. We found that the network resembled a hierarchical structure. The highest hierarchical level in this structure is occupied by 9 genes, which we called superhubs because they were primarily connected to 18 hub genes, which are then connected to 2,934 terminal genes. We were only able to regenerate transgenic plants overexpressing two of the superhubs, suggesting that the majority of the superhubs might interfere with the regeneration process and did not allow recovery of transgenic plants. The two superhubs encode proteins with closest homology to JAZ3 and RAP2.6 genes of Arabidopsis and were consequently named PtaJAZ3 and PtaRAP2.6. PtaJAZ3 and PtaRAP2.6 overexpressing transgenic lines showed a significant increase in both root elongation and lateral root proliferation and these responses were specific for the drought stress conditions and were highly correlated with the levels of overexpression of the transgenes. Several lines of evidence suggest of regulatory interactions between the two superhubs. Both superhubs were significantly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Because jasmonate signaling involves ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation, treatment with proteasome inhibitor abolished the MeJA induction for both genes. PtaRAP2.6 was upregulated in PtaJAZ3 transgenics but PtaJAZ3 expression was not affected in the PtaRAP2.6 overexpressors. The discovery of the two genes and further future insights into the associated mechanisms can lead to improved understanding and novel approaches to regulate root architecture in relation to drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W2903882073,"Background The number of patients with diabetes is increasing particularly in Asia-Pacific region. Many of them are treated with antidiabetics. As the basis of the studies on the benefit and harm of antidiabetic drugs in the region, the information on patterns of market penetration of new classes of antidiabetic medications is important in providing context for subsequent research and analyzing and interpreting results. Methods We compared penetration patterns of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States. We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a random sample of the Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, the Japan Medical Data Center database, and a 5% random sample of the US Medicare database converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership’s Common Data Model to identify new users of oral antidiabetic medications. We standardized prevalence and incidence rates of medication use by age and sex to those in the 2010 Taiwanese population. We compared age, sex, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications between new users of DPP-4 inhibitors and biguanides. Results Use of DPP-4 inhibitors 1 year after market entry was highest in Japan and lowest in Hong Kong. New users had more heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and renal failure than biguanide users in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States while the proportions were similar in Japan. In a country with low penetration of DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, Hong Kong), users had diabetes with multiple comorbid conditions compared with biguanidine users. In a country with high penetration (eg, Japan), the proportion of users with comorbid conditions was similar to that of biguanide users. Conclusions We observed a marked difference of the penetration patterns of newly marketed antidiabetics in different countries in Asia. Those results will provide the basic information useful in the future studies."

https://openalex.org/W2904212789,"Researchers typically conduct fatality monitoring to determine a wind energy facility's direct impacts on wildlife. In the United States, wind energy impacts on eagles have received increased attention in recent years because eagle incidental take permits became available. Permit holders are required to conduct fatality monitoring to evaluate compliance with permitted eagle take. Our objective was to develop an efficient eagle fatality monitoring protocol with a quantifiable detection probability based on a stationary scanning search method. We conducted scanning searches for eagle carcasses at four wind energy facilities. We estimated searcher efficiency of the scanning search method using feathered turkey decoys as eagle carcass surrogates, used publicly available data on large raptor carcass distances from turbines to evaluate the proportion of carcasses expected to occur in searched areas, and estimated carcass persistence rates for game birds and raptors. These three bias adjustments were combined to estimate the overall probability of detection for the scanning search method. We found generally high searcher efficiency for the scanning search method, with 76% of decoys detected; however, detection decreased with distance and difficulty of visibility class. Mean carcass persistence time varied between 28 and 76 days for raptors and between three and nine days for game birds, showing that game birds do not persist as long as raptors. We estimated that 95% of large avian carcasses fall within 100 m of turbine bases, and 99% fall within 150 m. Using these estimates and assuming a 30-day search interval for all facility turbines, we estimated that the probability of detecting a large raptor carcass using the scanning search method at a wind facility ranged from 0.50 to 0.69. Our research suggests a monitoring program that uses scanning searches can be a cost-effective approach for gathering data necessary to meet incidental eagle take permit requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2905009623,"Introduction Shared decision making (SDM) is a process whereby decisions are made together by patients and/or families and clinicians. Nevertheless, few patients are aware of its proven benefits. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability and impact of an intervention to raise public awareness of SDM in public libraries. Materials and methods A 1.5 hour interactive workshop to be presented in public libraries was co-designed with Quebec City public library network officials, a science communication specialist and physicians. A clinical topic of maximum reach was chosen: antibiotic overuse in treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. The workshop content was designed and a format, whereby a physician presents the information and the science communication specialist invites questions and participation, was devised. The event was advertised to the general public. An evaluation form was used to collect data on participants’ sociodemographics, feasibility and acceptability components and assess a potential impact of the intervention. Facilitators held a post-workshop focus group to qualitatively assess feasibility, acceptability and impact. Results All 10 planned workshops were held. Out of 106 eligible public participants, 89 were included in the analysis. Most participants were women (77.6%), retired (46.1%) and over 45 (59.5%). Over 90% of participants considered the workshop content to be relevant, accessible, and clear. They reported substantial average knowledge gain about antibiotics (2.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.0–2.8; P < .001) and about SDM (4.0, 95% CI: 3.4–4.5; P < .001). Self-reported knowledge gain about SDM was significantly higher than about antibiotics (4.0 versus 2.4; P < .001). Knowledge gain did not vary by sociodemographic characteristics. The focus group confirmed feasibility and suggested improvements. Conclusions A public library intervention is feasible and effective way to increase public awareness of SDM and could be a new approach to implementing SDM by preparing potential patients to ask for it in the consulting room."

Understanding of the different functional roles of S-palmitoylation of disparate sites within a given GPCR or across members of a GPCR family remains incomplete. These generalities are well instantiated in the case of the βARs. The β1AR is S-palmitoylated at an additional site within the C-terminal tail distal to the canonical site, comprising two Cys that are not conserved in the β2AR or β3AR (9Zuckerman D.M. Hicks S.W. Charron G. Hang H.C. Machamer C.E. Differential regulation of two palmitoylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the β1-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21464135): 19014-1902310.1074/jbc.M110.189977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the β2AR is S-palmitoylated at an additional site within the third intracellular loop that is not conserved within the β1AR or β3AR (15Adachi N. Hess D.T. McLaughlin P. Stamler J.S. S-Palmitoylation of a novel site in the β2-adrenergic receptor associated with a novel intracellular itinerary.J. Biol.

We examined mouse and human β3ARs and found that both are modified at the canonical C-tail site (Cys-361/363 and Cys-358 in human and mouse, respectively). Surprisingly, however, the human β3AR was modified at two additional sites, Cys-153 and Cys-292 within the second and third intracellular loops, respectively, which are not conserved in the β1AR or β2AR. Furthermore, Cys-153 is apparently unique in phylogeny to the human receptor, and Cys-292 is conserved primarily among primates. S-Palmitoylation of the canonical site within the β3AR facilitated receptor-effector coupling in the human but not in the mouse β3AR. S-Palmitoylation of the additional sites within the human β3AR increased receptor membrane abundance, but only S-palmitoylation of Cys-361/363 enhanced the half-life of the receptor at the membrane. Thus, S-palmitoylation of different sites within the human β3AR differentially regulates receptor disposition. The unique pattern of S-palmitoylation of the human β3AR provides a molecular distinction between human and rodent β3ARs, which may be associated with the differential response of humans and rodents to β3AR agonists as therapeutic agents. To examine S-palmitoylation of the β3AR, we used the acyl-RAC method (resin-assisted capture of fatty-acylated proteins) in which the thioester bond linking palmitate to Cys is cleaved with neutral hydroxylamine and the resultant free thiol is coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose for pulldown and subsequent Western blot analysis (18Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Thompson J.W. Hultman R. Moseley M.A. Stamler J.S. Casey P.J. Site-specific analysis of protein S-acylation by resin-assisted capture.J. Lipid Res. 2011; 52 (21044946): 393-39810.1194/jlr.D011106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This method directly assesses the presence of palmitate-modified Cys, and omission of hydroxylamine provides a rigorous control for false positives. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were used in all experiments. We have shown previously that 19 of the ∼23 mammalian DHHC palmitoyltransferases as well as the protein depalmitoylases APT1/2 are expressed in HEK293 cells (15Adachi N. Hess D.T. McLaughlin P. Stamler J.S. S-Palmitoylation of a novel site in the β2-adrenergic receptor associated with a novel intracellular itinerary.J. Biol.

We first used acyl-RAC with HEK293 cells stably expressing wildtype (WT) or Cys → Ala mutant β3ARs to assess the occurrence of S-palmitoylation and to locate the sites of modification. Analysis was restricted to clones in which levels of receptor expression varied by <10%. Analysis of HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged WT mβ3AR revealed that the mβ3AR is basally S-palmitoylated (Fig. 1A). The mβ3AR contains 10 Cys, two of which are predicted to be cytoplasmic: Cys-272 and Cys-358. One of these, Cys-358, is predicted to have a juxtamembrane location adjacent to the seventh transmembrane domain and thus represents the canonical site of GPCR S-palmitoylation (Fig. 1B and see also Fig. 2, D and E). Mutation of Cys-358 to Ala eliminated S-palmitoylation of the mβ3AR (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, the mβ3AR is S-palmitoylated solely at the canonical C-tail site. Cys-358 within the mβ3AR was identified previously as a site of S-palmitoylation in a global survey of the mouse brain palmitoyl proteome (19Collins M.O. Woodley K.T. Choudhary J.S. Global, site-specific analysis of neuronal protein S-acylation.Sci.

E, a schematic summary comparing localization of S-palmitoylation within the mβ3AR and hβ3AR. Within the hβ3AR, Cys-153 and Cys-292 are located within the second and third intracellular loops, respectively, and are predicted to have a juxtamembrane location.

Hamilton S. Summers R.J. Alternative splicing generates two isoforms of the β3-adrenoceptor which are differentially expressed in mouse tissues.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127 (10455305): 1525-153110.1038/sj.bjp.0702688Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cys-400 is conserved in the mouse β1AR and β2AR and in the human β1AR but apparently is not S-palmitoylated (9Zuckerman D.M. Hicks S.W. Charron G. Hang H.C. Machamer C.E. Differential regulation of two palmitoylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the β1-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol.

Analysis by acyl-RAC of FLAG-tagged hβ3AR stably expressed in HEK293 cells demonstrated S-palmitoylation (Fig. 2A). However, unlike the mβ3AR, mutation of either or both of the Cys residues comprising the canonical site, Cys-361/363, did not significantly diminish S-palmitoylation as detected with acyl-RAC (Fig. 2B), indicating the existence of additional sites of S-palmitoylation. The hβ3AR contains 16 Cys, eight of which are predicted to be cytoplasmic. Of those, four are predicted to be juxtamembrane, including, in addition to the canonical Cys-361/363, Cys-153 located adjacent to the N terminus of the fourth transmembrane domain and Cys-292 located adjacent to the N terminus of the sixth transmembrane domain (see Fig. 2, D and E). Mutation of all four of these Cys (designated C4A) effectively eliminated S-palmitoylation (Fig. 2C). Because the acyl-RAC assay cannot distinguish between one or more sites of S-palmitoylation within a given substrate, we stably expressed hβ3AR in which three of the four Cys that were potential sites of S-palmitoylation were mutated to Ala. The hβ3AR containing either Cys-153, Cys-292, Cys-361, or Cys-363 was S-palmitoylated, demonstrating that all four Cys were sites of S-palmitoylation (Fig. 2C). Note that the populations of S-palmitoylated receptors as revealed by acyl-RAC were diminished relative to WT receptor when only a single site of S-palmitoylation was present (Fig. 2C), suggesting that individual receptors may be differentially S-palmitoylated at one or more sites under these conditions. Notably, on the basis of comparison of available sequences of the β3AR, Cys-153 is apparently unique to the β3AR in humans, and Cys-292 is restricted largely to primates (human, ape, and Old World monkey) (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E summarizes the differences between S-palmitoylation of the mβ3AR and hβ3AR. It was reported that mutation of the canonical C-tail target of S-palmitoylation within the human β2AR (Cys-341) diminished ligand-induced production of cAMP, interpreted as disrupted coupling of the receptor via Gs to G protein–activated adenyl cyclase (4O’Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. Palmitoylation of the human β2-adrenergic receptor. Mutation of Cys341 in the carboxyl tail leads to an uncoupled nonpalmitoylated form of the receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2540197): 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of S-palmitoylation on receptor-effector coupling of the β3AR, we transiently expressed, in HEK293 cells, WT or Cys-mutant hβ3AR or mβ3AR and, 24 h after transfection, assessed by ELISA cAMP production elicited by exposure for 5 min to the β3AR-specific synthetic ligand mirabegron (21Takasu T. Ukai M. Sato S. Matsui T. Nagase I. Maruyama T. Sasamata M. Miyata K. Uchida H. Yamaguchi O. Effect of (R)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-4′-{2-[(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)amino]ethyl} acetanilide (YM178), a novel selective β3-adrenoceptor agonist, on bladder function.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321 (17293563): 642-64710.1124/jpet.106.115840Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To avoid interpretive difficulty resulting from different levels of expression of different constructs, we calculated the EC50 following exposure to mirabegron over the effective concentration range of 10−2–104 nm. Mirabegron did not elicit cAMP production in the absence of transfected receptor (Fig. 3A). The EC50 of cAMP production by WT mβ3AR (3.66 nm) was unaffected by mutation of the sole site of S-palmitoylation, Cys-358 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, mutation of all four sites of S-palmitoylation within the hβ3AR substantially increased the EC50 from 2.17 nm in WT to 4.82 nm in the absence of S-palmitoylation (Fig. 3, B and C). Transfection with the hβ3AR lacking only Cys-153, Cys-292, or Cys-361/363 revealed that the canonical C-tail sites of S-palmitoylation (Cys-361/363) accounted for the effects of S-palmitoylation on receptor-coupled cAMP production (Fig. 3, B and C). The ∼2.2-fold increase in EC50 is larger than the ∼1.5-fold increase reported following mutation of the canonical S-palmitoylated Cys within the human β2AR (4O’Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. Palmitoylation of the human β2-adrenergic receptor. Mutation of Cys341 in the carboxyl tail leads to an uncoupled nonpalmitoylated form of the receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2540197): 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that the effect of S-palmitoylation on EC50 observed with transient transfection was comparable in HEK293 cells stably expressing C4A versus WT hβ3AR (∼2.2-fold increase) (Fig. 3D). Thus, S-palmitoylation of different sites within the hβ3AR mediates different functions, and S-palmitoylation of the canonical site within the mβ3AR and hβ3AR differs in functionality. We note that the WT mβ3AR and hβ3AR differ substantially in the EC50 of cAMP production by mirabegron (3.66 versus 2.17 nm) (Fig. 3C), but we have not explored this difference with alternative agonists. S-Palmitoylation of GPCRs (which may be co- and/or post-translational) has been implicated in the governance of receptor plasma-membrane abundance that may reflect receptor processing/membrane targeting as well as plasma-membrane stability (turnover) (5Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Role of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation reactions in G-protein-coupled receptor function.Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97 (12493533): 1-3310.1016/S0163-7258(02)00300-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We first assessed steady-state plasma-membrane abundance of WT versus Cys-mutant mβ3AR or hβ3AR in HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged receptor. The FLAG tag in all constructs was localized to the N terminus of the β3AR and was therefore extracellular in plasma-membrane–localized receptors. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were labeled with anti-FLAG Ab without membrane permeabilization followed by a fluorescently labeled secondary Ab and analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Fluorescence immunocytochemistry confirmed that very little intracellular labeling occurred with this protocol (see Fig. 4D). C358A mutation of the mβ3AR resulted in a small (∼8%) but consistent decrease in steady-state levels of plasma-membrane–localized receptor (Fig. 4A). C4A mutation of the hβ3AR or mutation of either Cys-153, Cys-292, or Cys-361/363 resulted in a larger decrease that was of similar magnitude for each mutation (∼20–32% decrease) (Fig. 4A). We asked whether diminished levels of plasma-membrane–localized hβ3AR might reflect a decrease in overall receptor abundance. We transiently expressed FLAG-tagged WT or mutant receptor, and 24 h following transfection, cells were fixed, permeabilized to allow intracellular access of antibody, and labeled with anti-FLAG Ab conjugated with fluorescent dye followed by FACS. C4A mutation significantly diminished hβ3AR abundance, and mutation of individual Cys revealed that this decrease was due to abrogated S-palmitoylation of Cys-292 (Fig. 4B). The abundances of mβ3AR and hβ3AR mRNAs were unaltered by any mutation as assessed by quantitative PCR (Fig. 4C). Diminished levels of C292A hβ3AR would be consistent with deficient processing resulting from abrogation of cotranslational S-palmitoylation of Cys-292 that triggers (endoplasmic reticulum–based) proteostatic degradation and/or with post-translational destabilization. We then further examined the influence of S-palmitoylation on receptor disposition with fluorescence immunocytochemistry, comparing transiently expressed WT FLAG-hβ3AR with C4A receptor as well as with receptors with individual Cys mutation (Fig. 4D). In cells that were permeabilized before staining (as above), we observed consistently that the C4A receptor accumulated in the cytoplasm where it exhibited predominantly a punctate distribution (Fig. 4D). Examination of the effects of selective mutation of Cys-153, Cys-292, and Cys-361/363 revealed that only mutation of Cys-153 replicated this intracellular accumulation (Fig. 4D). Mutation of Cys-292 resulted in a diffuse intracellular distribution consistent with receptor degradation. Thus, the decrease in plasma-membrane–localized C153A receptor, demonstrated by FACS (Fig. 4A), is due at least in part to deficient receptor targeting to the plasma membrane, consistent with a requirement for Cys-153 S-palmitoylation in efficiently engaging the transport mechanism that conveys receptors from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (22Ernst A.M. Syed S.A. Zaki O. Bottanelli F. Zheng H. Hacke M. Xi Z. Rivera-Molina F. Graham M. Rebane A.A. Björkholm P. Baddeley D. Toomre D. Pincet F. Rothman J.E.

Our results therefore indicate that the diminished plasma-membrane abundance of the hβ3AR resulting from mutation of Cys-153 and Cys-292 (Fig. 4A) reflects at least in part different mechanisms. On the basis of mutational analysis, S-palmitoylation of Cys-361/363 within the hβ3AR also diminishes plasma-membrane abundance (Fig. 4A) but does not result in enhanced receptor degradation (diminished total levels of receptor) (Fig. 4B) or diminished transport of receptor to the plasma membrane (signified by cytoplasmic accumulation of receptor) (Fig. 4D). Membrane-receptor abundance will be determined at least in part by membrane-receptor turnover (membrane stability). To examine directly a possible role for S-palmitoylation in membrane-receptor stability, we labeled cells transiently expressing WT or Cys-mutant mβ3AR or hβ3AR with anti-FLAG Ab and, at subsequent intervals over 25 h, labeled unpermeabilized cells with fluorescent secondary Ab followed by FACS. We observed that the half-life of the plasma-membrane–localized mβ3AR was about 4 times greater than that of the hβ3AR (29.3 versus 7.82 h) (Fig. 5). Mutation of Cys-358 did not affect the membrane half-life of the mβ3AR (Fig. 5, A and C). Thus, the small diminishment of plasma-membrane receptor abundance associated with mutation of Cys-358 within the mβ3AR (Fig. 4A) is likely to reflect deficient receptor processing/targeting. In contrast, transient expression of C4A mutant hβ3AR substantially diminished membrane-receptor half-life (55% decrease), which we confirmed in cells stably expressing C4A mutant hβ3AR (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the effects of individual mutations demonstrated that diminished membrane-receptor half-life could be ascribed to Cys-361/363 (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, S-palmitoylation of different sites within the hβ3AR regulates membrane-receptor abundance differentially: S-palmitoylation of Cys-153 and Cys-292 within the second and third intracellular loops, respectively, is required for efficient receptor processi"
https://openalex.org/W2905105573,"Background In 2011, the Australian government introduced national healthcare reforms aimed at increasing the timeliness and quality of hospital care. The healthcare reforms included, but were not limited to, emergency department (ED) time-based targets, financial incentives, and public performance reporting of hospital data. We sought to evaluate the impact of the national healthcare reforms on ED time-based process outcomes. Methods A quasi-experimental study of ED presentations from 2006 to 2016 in the state of Victoria, Australia. Uncontrolled, interrupted time-series analyses were used to evaluate, by hospital peer groups, the effect of national healthcare reforms on: patient wait times for treatment; treatment within recommended time; and patient departure within four hours of arrival in ED. Results There were small improvements in ED time-based process outcomes following the introduction of the national healthcare reforms. These occurred in most hospital peer groups immediately and over the longer term, across the various triage categories. The largest improvements occurred in small hospitals and smallest improvements in medium sized hospitals. ED time-based targets, now abolished by the Australian government, were not achieved in any hospital peer groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that national healthcare reforms had the potential to prompt fundamental changes in ED processes leading to significant improvements in ED performances across most hospital peer groups but were generally unable to reach the ED targets imposed nationally. ED performances also varied by hospital peer groups. Attention to ED time-based process outcomes within hospital peer groups may provide insights into hospital practices that could improve the quality and efficiency of ED care."
https://openalex.org/W2904439448,"Genome-wide DNA methylation studies are becoming increasingly important in unraveling the epigenetic basis of cell biology, aging and human conditions. The aim of the present study was to explore whether different methods for extracting DNA from whole blood can affect DNA methylation outcome, potentially confounding DNA methylation studies. DNA was isolated from healthy blood donors (n = 10) using three different extraction methods (i.e. two automatic extractions methods based on magnetic beads or isopropanol precipitation, and manual organic extraction). DNA methylation was analyzed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip (Infinium 450K) (n = 30 samples in total), which is a frequently used method in genome-wide DNA methylation analyses. Overall, the different extraction methods did not have a significant impact on the global DNA methylation patterns. However, DNA methylation differences between organic extraction and each of the automated methods were in general larger than differences between the two automated extraction methods. No CpG sites or regions reached genome-wide significance when testing for differential methylation between extraction methods. Although this study is based on a small sample, these results suggest that extraction method is unlikely to confound Infinium 450K methylation analysis in whole blood."
https://openalex.org/W2905556573,"Many studies have identified the risk of polypharmacy, but physiological evidence and methods of evaluation in these studies were poor. The relationship between polypharmacy and heart rate variability in older adults remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between polypharmacy in older adults, including atomic bomb survivors, and heart rate variability.We surveyed 56 older adults who did not need nursing care assistance in the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Survivors Recuperation Center. Chronic diseases, types of medication, and lifestyle were assessed, and heart rate variability at rest was measured. We calculated heart rate variability indices including standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN), total power (TP), and very low frequency (VLF) and analyzed the relationship between the number of daily medication types and heart rate variability indices in older adults. The differences in heart rate variability indices were analyzed using six medications as a cut-off point.Participants included 36 atomic bomb survivors and 20 non-atomic bomb survivors. The mean number of medication types was 3.6±3.4 (mean±standard deviation). SDNN, TP, and VLF decreased with an increased number of medications in all participants (P<0.01). When the standard of polypharmacy was set to more than six types of medications, SDNN, TP, and VLF were significantly lower in older adults who took six or more medications. Additionally, the mean number of medication types among atomic bomb survivors was higher than that of non-atomic bomb survivors (P = 0.008). The SDNN was significantly lower when atomic bomb survivors took six or more medications (P<0.001).We found that a lower heart rate variability in older adults, including atomic bomb survivors, is associated with polypharmacy. We showed physiological evidence of the influence of polypharmacy, which may be important for the healthy life expectancy and prognosis in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2903906639,"Infection with Plasmodium species parasites causes malaria. Plasmodium parasites are purine auxotrophic. They import purines via an equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT). In P. falciparum, the most virulent species, the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (PfENT1) represents the primary purine uptake pathway. This transporter is a potential target for the development of antimalarial drugs. In the absence of a high-resolution structure for either PfENT1 or a homologous ENT, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) to investigate the membrane-spanning domain structure of PfENT1 to identify potential inhibitor-binding sites. We previously used SCAM to identify water-accessible residues that line the permeation pathway in transmembrane segment 11 (TM11). TM2 and TM10 lie adjacent to TM11 in an ab initio model of a homologous Leishmania donovani nucleoside transporter. To identify TM2 and TM10 residues in PfENT1 that are at least transiently on the water-accessible transporter surface, we assayed the reactivity of single cysteine-substitution mutants with three methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives. Cysteines substituted for 12 of 14 TM2 segment residues reacted with MTS-ethyl-ammonium-biotin (MTSEA-biotin). At eight positions, MTSEA-biotin inhibited transport, and at four positions substrate transport was potentiated. On an α helical wheel projection of TM2, the four positions where potentiation occurred were located in a cluster on one side of the helix. In contrast, although MTSEA-biotin inhibited 9 of 10 TM10 cysteine-substituted mutants, the reactive residues did not form a pattern consistent with either an α helix or β sheet. These results may help identify the binding site(s) of PfENT1 inhibitors."

Seabirds are considered important bioindicators of the oceans, but accessing breeding populations can be difficult, expensive and time consuming. New technologies have been employed to facilitate data collection on seabirds that can reduce costs and minimize disturbance. Among these, the use of time-lapse photography is a potentially effective way to reduce researcher effort, while collecting valuable information on key ecological parameters. However, the feasibility of this approach remains uncertain. Here, we assessed the use of time-lapse photography as a tool for estimating foraging behaviour from breeding seabirds, and evaluate ways forward for this method. We deployed cameras in front of active nests at a colony of black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during two breeding seasons, 5 nests in 2013 and 5 in 2014, taking pictures every 4 minutes. A subsample of monitored individuals were also equipped with accelerometers. Approximately 100,000 frames, covering incubation and chick-rearing periods, were analysed. Estimates of foraging trip duration from images were positively correlated with accelerometry estimates (R2 = 0.967). Equal partitioning of effort between pairs, predation events, nest attendance patterns and variation in trip metrics with breeding stage were also identified. Our results suggest that time-lapse photography is potentially a useful tool for assessing foraging trip duration and other fine-scale nesting ecology parameters as well as for assessing the effect of bio-logging devices on seabird foraging behaviour. Nevertheless, the time investment to manually extract data from images was high, and the process to set up cameras was not straightforward. To encourage wide use of time-lapse photography in seabird ecology, we thus provide guidelines for camera deployment and we suggest a need for further development of automated approaches to allow data extraction."

https://openalex.org/W2905057183,"Heterogeneous mobile authentication is a crucial technique to securely retrieve the resource of e-healthcare cloud servers which are commonly implemented in a public key Infrastructure (PKI). Conventionally, a mobile data user can utilize a self-chosen password along with a portable device to request the access privilege of clouds. However, to validate the membership of users, a cloud server usually has to make use of a password table, which not only increases the burden of management, but also raises the possibility of information leakage. In this paper, we propose a secure heterogeneous mobile authentication and key agreement scheme for e-healthcare cloud systems. In our system structure, an e-healthcare cloud server of traditional PKIs does not have to store a password table. A legitimate data user only possesses a security token hardware and keeps an offline updatable password without using any private key. Our scheme is classified into the category of dynamic ID authentication techniques, since a data user is able to preserve his/her anonymity during authentication processes. We formally prove that the proposed mechanism fulfills the essential authenticated key exchange (AKE) security and owns lower computational costs. To further ensure the practical application security, an automatic security validation tool called AVISPA is also adopted to analyze possible attacks and pitfalls of our designed protocol."
