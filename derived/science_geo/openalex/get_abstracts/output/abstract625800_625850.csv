Marijuana from Cannabis sativa L. has been used for both therapeutic and recreational purposes for many centuries (Lemberger, 1980Lemberger L. Potential therapeutic usefulness of marijuana.Annu. Rev.

Bot. 1973; 28: 437-448Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the 1940s, chemistry based on compounds isolated from the plant (Wollner et al., 1942Wollner H.J. Matchett J.R. Levine J. Loewe S. Isolation of a Physiologically Active Tetrahydrocannabinol from Cannabis Sativa Resin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1942; 64: 26-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) produced novel biologically active molecules (Adams et al., 1948Adams R. MacKenzie Jr., S. Loewe S.

Soc. 1940; : 1121-1125Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, it was not until the 1960s that the active constituent of marijuana, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a terpenoid molecule, was isolated and characterized (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1964Gaoni Y. Mechoulam R. Isolation, Structure, and Partial Synthesis of an Active Constituent of Hashish.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1646-1647Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). This provided an early molecular foundation for medicinal chemists to develop related structural analogs and new synthetic ligands (Makriyannis and Rapaka, 1990Makriyannis A. Rapaka R.S.

Structure-activity relationships in cannabinoids.Pharmacol. Rev. 1986; 38: 75-149PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, due to their lipophilic nature, it was assumed that cannabinoids exerted their effects by perturbing the physical properties of biological membranes (Makriyannis, 2014Makriyannis A. 2012 Division of medicinal chemistry award address.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This assumption was challenged with the discovery, cloning, and expression of the first cannabinoid-specific membrane receptor, then designated as the cannabinoid receptor (CB) (Devane et al., 1988Devane W.A. Dysarz 3rd, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Determination and characterization of a cannabinoid receptor in rat brain.Mol.

With the subsequent identification of a second receptor, the designation evolved to CB1 and CB2 (Munro et al., 1993Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Molecular characterization of a peripheral receptor for cannabinoids.Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4143) Google Scholar). The discovery of the endogenous agonists to the receptors, the endocannabinoids, anandamide (Devane et al., 1992Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar) soon followed. Cannabinoid receptors belong to the class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, signal through inhibitory Gαi/o heterotrimeric G proteins (Howlett, 1985Howlett A.C. Cannabinoid inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Biochemistry of the response in neuroblastoma cell membranes.Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar), and interact with β-arrestins (Jin et al., 1999Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K. Distinct domains of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor mediate desensitization and internalization.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CB1 is the most highly expressed GPCR in the human brain and is expressed throughout the body, with the highest levels found in the central nervous system (Herkenham et al., 1990Herkenham M. Lynn A.B. Little M.D. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. de Costa B.R. Rice K.C. Cannabinoid receptor localization in brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 1932-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Cannabis has been used for centuries in many cultures to treat a wide range of medical conditions. More recently, therapeutic considerations have moved beyond the plant extract to explore and produce more pharmacologically refined compounds. CB1-selective small-molecule agonists have shown therapeutic promise in a wide range of disorders, including pain and inflammation (Cravatt and Lichtman, 2004Cravatt B.F. Lichtman A.H. The endogenous cannabinoid system and its role in nociceptive behavior.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), multiple sclerosis (Pertwee, 2002Pertwee R.G.

The first CB1-selective antagonist/inverse agonist, rimonabant (SR141716, Acomplia [Sanofi-Aventis]) (Rinaldi-Carmona et al., 1994Rinaldi-Carmona M. Barth F. Héaulme M. Shire D. Calandra B. Congy C.

Drugs. 2009; 14: 43-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Antagonists of CB1 have been explored as potential therapeutics for obesity-related metabolic disorders (Mazier et al., 2015Mazier W. Saucisse N. Gatta-Cherifi B. Cota D.

However, rimonabant and other ligands in its class were not approved in the United States due to concerns about adverse events, such as increased anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Numerous studies have investigated how ligands binding CB1 can mediate downstream signaling. While the variety of compounds exhibiting different pharmacological profiles have provided clues regarding CB1 activation, the molecular details defining the binding modes of both endogenous and exogenous ligands are still largely unknown (Guo et al., 1994Guo Y. Abadji V. Morse K.L. Fournier D.J. Li X. Makriyannis A.

Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1623-1635PubMed Google Scholar). In order to address this deficit in understanding, we have determined the crystal structure of CB1 in complex with a tight binding antagonist AM6538. In conjunction with molecular docking, the structure was used to elucidate the binding modes of a diverse set of antagonists/inverse agonists and agonists of CB1. The structural details of the cannabinoid receptor reported herein improve our understanding of how ligands engage to modulate the cannabinoid system and provide a useful model to facilitate the design of next-generation pharmaceuticals to avoid unwanted side effects. The findings provide insight into mechanisms of slow dissociation of antagonists, which may potentially translate into long acting pharmacological effects. One of the key factors facilitating the structure determination of CB1 (Figure 1) is utilization of the antagonist AM6538, the synthesis of which resulted from the strategic modification of rimonabant to enhance its ability to stabilize the ligand-receptor complex and promote CB1 crystal formation. In contrast with rimonabant, the 5-phenyl ring substituent was modified so as to introduce motifs (ex. alkyne unit) that could favor increased affinity for the CB1 receptor (Tam et al., 2010Tam J. Vemuri V.K. Liu J. Bátkai S. Mukhopadhyay B. Godlewski G. Osei-Hyiaman D. Ohnuma S. Ambudkar S.V. Pickel J. et al.Peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptor blockade improves cardiometabolic risk in mouse models of obesity.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2953-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The rimonabant analog, AM251, (1, Figure 2A) (Lan et al., 1999Lan R. Liu Q. Fan P. Lin S. Fernando S.R. McCallion D. Pertwee R. Makriyannis A. Structure-activity relationships of pyrazole derivatives as cannabinoid receptor antagonists.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), a compound that has been used extensively as a pharmacological standard CB1-selective antagonist, was used as the precursor in the AM6538 synthetic process. Synthesis of AM6538 involves the functionalization of the iodo substituent at the para position of the 5-phenyl ring in AM251 with an acetylenic chain system consisting of four carbons and substituted at the omega carbon. To this end, we initially focused on targeting cysteine residues within CB1 by introducing suitable electrophilic groups (Janero et al., 2015Janero D.R. Yaddanapudi S. Zvonok N. Subramanian K.V.

For AM6538, we introduced at this position a nitrate group (ONO2) whose role was to serve as a polar group, which may be displaced by a suitable nucleophile (e.g., thiol) (Pattison and Brown, 1956Pattison F.L.M.

In the present study, affinity mass spectrometry analysis suggests that AM6538 reacts with CB1 as an intact molecule with no evidence of covalent modification of relevant cysteine residues.Figure 2Synthesis and Characterization of AM6538Show full caption(A) Synthetic procedures for compound AM6538.(B) Saturation [3H]-CP55,940 binding assays in the absence (control) or presence of rimonabant (100 nM) or AM6538 (50 nM) demonstrates that both antagonists cause displacement of specific binding of the radioligand when present concurrently in the 1 hr binding assay.(C) Following pretreatment of membranes (37°C, 6 hr) with buffer only (none), rimonabant (100 nM), or AM6538 (50 nM); membranes were washed with buffer 3× prior to [3H]-CP55,940 binding as described for (B).(D) Percentage of remaining binding (Bmax) detected following the conditions described in (B) (concurrent) and (C) (pretreat and wash).

Under pretreatment and washout conditions, rimonabant does not affect subsequent radioligand binding, while AM6538 continues to compete despite washing of the membranes. See also Figure S1 and Table S1. AM6538 was a strong candidate for crystallographic studies of the receptor based on its high affinity and wash-resistant binding to CB1 as determined by radioligand competition assays against the tritiated agonist, [3H]-CP55,940 (Ki = 3.4 ± 1.0 nM) (Figures 2B–2D). This is in contrast to rimonabant, which can be readily washed out of membranes, permitting subsequent radioligand binding (Figures 2B–2D). Importantly, the crystallized CB1 construct (described below) has comparable affinity for AM6538 as the wild-type receptor (Ki = 5.1 ± 0.9 nM). In functional assays, AM6538 is a competitive antagonist of the effects of CP55,940 and THC on CB1-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and β-arrestin2 recruitment in overexpression systems (Figures S1A and S1B and Table S1). Competitive antagonism was confirmed by the [35S]-GTPγS binding assays performed in mouse cerebellum (Figure S1C). For comparison purposes, competitive antagonism was demonstrated for rimonabant in the same systems (Figure S1 and Table S1). To facilitate crystallization, it was necessary to modify the wild-type (WT) CB1 sequence. Construct optimization procedures (Lv et al., 2016Lv X. Liu J. Shi Q. Tan Q. Wu D. Skinner J.J. Walker A.L.

Additionally, the WT receptor was truncated on both the N and C termini by 98 and 58 residues, respectively. Finally, in order to improve the expression and thermostability of the receptor, four computationally predicted mutations (Thr2103.46Ala [D’Antona et al., 2006D’Antona A.M. Ahn K.H. Kendall D.A.

The theoretical m/z for the monoisotopic peak of AM6538 is 542.1356. Based on affinity mass spectrometry analysis, intact AM6538 is associated with the CB1 protein (Figure S3F). Electron density with three branches was observed near the orthosteric binding site and modeled as core AM6538 atoms with the terminal nitrate group omitted (Figures 3D and S3). A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the CB1-AM6538 complex with the nitrate group intact and modeled through docking analysis, and the results revealed that the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values for the nitrate group and the hinge carbon atom are higher, suggesting that the nitrate group is more mobile than other atoms in AM6538 (Figure S4B). As a modeled ligand with other possibilities to fit the electron density, further studies on ligand binding are under investigation.Figure S4MD Simulations of the Predicted Antagonists and Mutagenesis Validation of the Docking Predictions, Related to Figures 5 and 6Show full caption(A) Docking pose of AM6538 (magenta sticks) and predicted hydrogen bond (orange dashed lines) and π-π interaction (blue dashed lines) in comparison with AM6538 in crystal structure (green sticks).(B) RMSF of AM6538 in MD simulation.(C–F) AM6538 (C), rimonabant (D), otenabant (E) and taranabant (F) Central structures in MD (protein is shown in light cyan cartoon; ligands are shown in blue sticks) versus docking poses (protein is shown in white cartoon and ligands are shown in yellow sticks), and ligand RMSD (three independent runs).(G) Mutations of hCB1 at Phe170Ala or Phe174Ala disrupts the ability of AM6538 and rimonabant to displace CP55,940 while preserving its functional activity.

https://openalex.org/W2910852897,"Cannabis elicits its mood-enhancing and analgesic effects through the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the adenylyl cyclase-inhibiting heterotrimeric G protein Gi. Activation of CB1-Gi signaling pathways holds potential for treating a number of neurological disorders and is thus crucial to understand the mechanism of Gi activation by CB1. Here, we present the structure of the CB1-Gi signaling complex bound to the highly potent agonist MDMB-Fubinaca (FUB), a recently emerged illicit synthetic cannabinoid infused in street drugs that have been associated with numerous overdoses and fatalities. The structure illustrates how FUB stabilizes the receptor in an active state to facilitate nucleotide exchange in Gi. The results compose the structural framework to explain CB1 activation by different classes of ligands and provide insights into the G protein coupling and selectivity mechanisms adopted by the receptor."

The cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 serve as key components of the endocannabinoid system and are the principal targets of the widely consumed plant-derived phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). CB1 is expressed throughout the body and is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas CB2 is mainly expressed in the immune system and, to a lesser extent, in the CNS (Atwood and Mackie, 2010Atwood B.K.

Recent studies indicate that CB2 antagonists can ameliorate renal fibrosis (Zhou et al., 2018Zhou L. Zhou S. Yang P. Tian Y. Feng Z. Xie X.Q. Liu Y.

Commun. 2018; 9: 2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), indicating their potential as compounds for treating fibrotic conditions and cancer. However, CB2 has a high degree of homology and shares 44% sequence identity with CB1 (Munro et al., 1993Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Molecular characterization of a peripheral receptor for cannabinoids.Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). Many cannabinergic compounds interact with both CB1 and CB2, making it difficult to delineate the individual signaling contributions required to modulate the two receptors. In this report, we determined the crystal structure of CB2 in complex with a rationally designed CB2 antagonist. A comparative analysis of the antagonist-bound CB2 with our previously solved CB1 structures may clarify the determinants of ligand selectivity or function and will provide new insights into precise modulation of the endocannabinoid system for therapeutic applications. To facilitate the crystallization, we designed a high-affinity CB2 antagonist, AM10257, which was obtained through systematic optimization of SR141716A (Rinaldi-Carmona et al., 1994Rinaldi-Carmona M. Barth F. Héaulme M. Shire D. Calandra B. Congy C. Martinez S. Maruani J. Néliat G. Caput D. et al.SR141716A, a potent and selective antagonist of the brain cannabinoid receptor.FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), the first known CB1 antagonist (Figure 1A). In our early work, we had shown that substituting the phenyl ring at the N-1 position of SR141716A with an alkyl group imparted CB2 affinity. Further lead optimization of this template led to AM10257, in which the 5-hydroxypentyl chain at the N-1 position transformed the CB1 antagonist into a CB2 antagonist. The modified amide group with the bulkier 1-adamantyl group at C-3 further enhanced the affinity for CB2 (Figure 1A), facilitated stabilization of the ligand-CB2 receptor complex, and promoted CB2 crystal formation (Figures S1 and S2).Figure S1Characterization of the CB2-AM10257 Complex, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Analytical size exclusion chromatography profile.

AM10257 shows a high affinity (inhibition constant [Ki] = 0.08 nM for CB2), as determined by radioligand competition assays, against [3H]-CP55,940 (Kd = 0.86 nM) (Figure 1A). Importantly, the binding affinity of the crystallized CB2 construct for AM10257 is still in the sub-nanomolar range (Ki = 0.61 nM) (Figure S1F). In assays assessing the regulation of adenylyl cyclase and β-arrestin2 recruitment, AM10257 acted as an inverse agonist and competitive antagonist at CB2 (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1). To obtain crystals of CB2, we replaced residues Ser222–Ala235 in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) of the receptor with T4-lysozyme to generate a CB2-T4L fusion construct. Five mutations, Gly782.48Leu, Thr1273.46Ala, Thr1534.45Leu, Arg2426.32Glu, and Gly3048.48Glu, were introduced (Figures S1 and S3; STAR Methods) to further improve protein homogeneity and thermostability. Additionally, the N-terminal residues 1–20 and the C-terminal residues 326–360 were truncated to improve the crystal quality. Radioligand binding assays showed that these modifications had little effect on the binding affinity of CB2 toward AM10257, SR144528 (a potent and selective CB2 antagonist; Rinaldi-Carmona et al., 1998Rinaldi-Carmona M.

Crystals of CB2-T4L in complex with AM10257 were grown in a lipidic cubic phase (LCP) cholesterol mixture and diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1).Table 1Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Refinement StatisticsPDB CodeCB2-AM0257 5ZTYData CollectionNumber of crystals7Space groupP212121Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)34.29, 106.24, 183.40Number of reflections measured134,347Number of unique reflections17,142Resolution (Å)45.96–2.80 (2.90–2.80)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.Rmerge0.30 (0.97)Mean I/sI14.70 (3.31)CC1/20.99 (0.87)Completeness (%)96.93 (92.81)Redundancy7.80 (7.30)RefinementResolution (Å)45.96–2.80No. reflections16,871 (856)Rwork/Rfree (%)0.224/0.275No. of AtomsProtein3,508Ligand31Lipid and other187Average B Factors (Å)Wilson/overall76.06/95.84Protein93.71Ligand/ion112.70Water58.72RMSDsBond lengths (Å)0.01Bond angles (°)1.00Ramachandran Plot Statistics (%)Favored regions97.08Allowed regions2.92Disallowed regions0.00RMSD, root-mean-square deviation.

The overall architecture of CB2 is comprised of a 7TM bundle (helices I–VII) and an intracellular amphipathic helix VIII (Figure 2A). Although the intracellular portion adopts an inactive conformation similar to antagonist-bound CB1, the extracellular portions of antagonist-bound CB2 and CB1 are significantly different, most notably within helices I and II (Figure 2B; Figures S5A and S5B). The non-truncated part of the N terminus in CB2, in contrast to the V-shaped loop in antagonist AM6538-bound (Hua et al., 2016Hua T. Vemuri K. Pu M. Qu L. Han G.W. Wu Y. Zhao S. Shui W. Li S.

In the CB2 structure, a strong electron density was observed in the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket (Figure S1D), enabling accurate placement of AM10257. The chemical scaffold of AM10257 consists of a core pyrazole ring substituted with three groups extending in different directions (“three-arm pose”) (Figure 3A). The interactions between AM10257 and CB2 are mainly hydrophobic and aromatic, consisting of residues from ECL2 as well as helices II, III, V, and VI (Figures 3A and 3B). The core pyrazole ring of AM10257 resides among helices II, III, and VII, forming π-π interactions with Phe183ECL2 and hydrophobic interactions with Phe872.57 and Val1133.32 (the superscript denotes Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering; (Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors.Methods in Neurosciences. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). The benzene ring (“arm 1”) points downward and simultaneously engages in π-π interactions with Phe1173.36 and Trp2586.48 (Figures 3A and 3B). The 5-hydroxypentyl chain (“arm 2”) extends between helices III and V, forming hydrophobic interactions with Thr1143.33, Phe183ECL2, Ile186ECL2, and Trp1945.43, whereas the terminal hydroxy group on the alkyl chain participates in a local hydrogen bond network formed by a water molecule and the carboxy oxygen of Ser1654.57 (Figure 3B). The adamantyl group (“arm 3”) extends toward helices II and III, establishing extensive hydrophobic interactions with Phe872.57, Phe912.61, Phe942.64, His952.65, and Phe183ECL2 (Figures 3A and 3B). The residues involved in AM10257 binding are nearly identical to those identified in the CB1 agonist-binding motif (Hua et al., 2017Hua T. Vemuri K. Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutations of Phe872.57, Phe912.61, Phe942.64, and His952.65 greatly reduce the potency of the CB2 and CB1 agonist CP55,940 (Figure 3C). Although both AM10257 and AM6538 encompass the core pyrazole ring and a three-arm scaffold as in SR141716A, their binding poses in their respective receptors are quite different (Figure 4A). Instead of adopting the extended conformation of AM6538 in CB1 (Hua et al., 2016Hua T. Vemuri K. Pu M. Qu L. Han G.W. Wu Y. Zhao S. Shui W. Li S. Korde A. et al.Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB1.Cell. 2016; 167: 750-762.e14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), AM10257 assumes a more constrained binding pose in CB2 (Figures 4C and 4D). In addition, the AM10257 binding position in CB2 is more akin to those observed within the two lipid receptors, S1P1 and LPA1 bound to antagonists ML056 (Hanson et al., 2012Hanson M.A. Roth C.B. Jo E. Griffith M.T. Scott F.L. Reinhart G. Desale H. Clemons B. Cahalan S.M. Schuerer S.C. et al.Crystal structure of a lipid G protein-coupled receptor.Science. 2012; 335: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and ONO9780307 (Chrencik et al., 2015Chrencik J.E. Roth C.B. Terakado M. Kurata H. Omi R. Kihara Y. Warshaviak D. Nakade S. Asmar-Rovira G.

Compared with AM6538 in CB1, AM10257 within CB2 shifts toward helices III and IV by 6.1 Å using the pyrazole ring as reference (Figures 4A and 4B). Synergistically, the extracellular parts of helices I and II experience a movement toward the ligand binding site, and residues Phe872.57 and Phe912.61 form hydrophobic interactions with arm 3 of AM10257. In contrast to the horizontally extended arm 3 in CB1, arm 3 of AM10257 assumes a nearly vertical pose in CB2, and the adamantyl group of AM10257 overlaps with the benzene ring of Phe102N-term of CB1 in the superimposed structures. As a result, the N terminus of CB2 does not insert into the ligand-binding pocket, unlike the V-shaped loop in antagonist-bound (AM6538 or taranabant) CB1 (Hua et al., 2016Hua T. Vemuri K. Pu M. Qu L. Han G.W. Wu Y. Zhao S. Shui W. Li S.

In comparison, the molecular docking pose of SR144528 resembles the binding pose of AM10257 (Figure S6A) where the main difference is the 4-methylbenzyl of SR144528 and the alkyl chain of AM10257 in arm 2, indicating that this is probably the common binding mode for CB2 antagonists. Another key difference is the toggle switch residue Trp6.48 conformation in the antagonist-bound CB2 and CB1 structures (Figure 4B; Figure S4). Arm 1 of the three-arm scaffold antagonist AM10257 (Figure 4B) confines the side chain of Trp2586.48, a residue conserved in 68% of class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), to a relatively rare rotamer that has only appeared in muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Kruse et al., 2012Kruse A.C.

The confined Trp2586.48 conformation may restrict the outward movement of helix VI and stabilize the receptor in the inactive state. Conversely, in the AM6538-bound CB1 structure, arm 3 of AM6538 extends itself to push helices I and II outward, and, as a result, arm 1 is positioned ∼5 Å away from the toggle switch residue Trp3566.48. Here, Phe2003.36 functions as a latch to restrict the movement of Trp3566.48 and locks CB1 in the inactive state. These observations explain the high CB2 and CB1 selectivity and unprecedented high affinity of these two antagonists for their respective receptors.Figure S5Structural Comparison of Antagonist-Bound CB2 and Antagonist-Bound CB1, S1P1, and LPA1 and the Dihedral Angles’ Value Analysis of Toggle Switch Residue Trp6.48 in the Solved Class A GPCRs, Related to Figures 2 and 4Show full caption(A) Overall structure comparison of AM10257 (magenta sticks)-bound CB2 (green cartoon) and taranabant (orange sticks)-bound CB1 (yellow cartoon).

Surprisingly, our AM10257-bound CB2 structure closely resembles the agonist AM11542-bound CB1 structure (Hua et al., 2017Hua T. Vemuri K. Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) in the extracellular portion (Figure 5A), and the antagonist-binding motif in CB2 exhibits greater resemblance to the agonist-binding motif in CB1 (Figure 5B). The N termini adopt similar conformations, where each forms a short helix before Tyr24N-term of CB2 or Phe108N-term of CB1 (Figure 5A). Additionally, the volume of the CB2 antagonist-binding pocket (447 Å3) is closer to that of the agonist AM11542-bound CB1 (384 Å3) (Hua et al., 2017Hua T. Vemuri K. Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) than to the antagonist AM6538-bound CB1 (822 Å3) (Hua et al., 2016Hua T. Vemuri K. Pu M. Qu L. Han G.W. Wu Y. Zhao S. Shui W. Li S.

The parameters correlate well with the similar binding shapes of AM10257 and the CB1 agonist AM11542 as well as the nearly identical array of residues involved in AM10257 or AM11542 binding (Figure 5B). These observations inspired us to test the function of AM10257 within CB1, where we found it to behave as a CB1 partial agonist in the β-arrestin2 recruitment assay (Figure 5C). To delineate the activation mechanism of CB2, given the limited space for possible conformational changes of the ligand-binding pocket of CB2, we rationally designed two structurally related ligands, MRI2687 and MRI2594. These ligands only differ in arm 1 while featuring the extended central 6-methylbenzothiazole ring in MRI2687 and 4,5-dimethylthiazole ring in MRI2594 respectively (Figure 6A; Figure S2). Unexpectedly, MRI2687 behaves as an inverse agonist, whereas MRI2594 acts as an agonist on CB2 (Figure 6C). Molecular docking showed that these two ligands adopt similar binding poses within CB2 (Figure 6B), wherein the different central rings reside in the same position as arm 1 of AM10257. MRI2687 resembles AM10257 in the crystal structure, whereas arm 1 of MRI2687 forms π-π interactions with the side chain of Trp2586.48 and confines its conformation to a similar rotamer as in the CB2-AM10257 structure (Figure 6B). In contrast, because MRI2594 lacks a large substituent in arm 1, it does not extend sufficiently deep to constrain the conformation of Trp2586.48. This is consistent with our prediction that CP55,940 also has no moiety to constrain Trp2586.48 in CB2 (Figure S6B). Additionally, we performed molecular dynamic simulations (200 ns) of ligands used in this study (Figures S6C–S6G) and found that the rotamer of Trp2586.48 supports this conclusion.Figure S6Docking Poses of Different Antagonists and Agonists of CB2 and MD Validation, Related to Figures 4, 5, and 6Show full caption(A-B) The docking poses of SR144528 (A) and CP55,940 (B) are shown.

The above analysis indicated a critical role of the toggle switch residue Trp2586.48 during CB2 activation and an essential function of arm 1 of the ligand for CB2 antagonism. Interestingly, our functional data showed that MRI2687 also acts as a partial agonist on CB1 (Figure 6D), further supporting the notion that CB2 antagonist and CB1 agonist profiles probably occur in certain compounds (Oga"

Here, we use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to probe the changes that ligands induce in the conformational distribution of the angiotensin II type I receptor. Monitoring distances between 10 pairs of nitroxide labels distributed across the intracellular regions enabled mapping of four underlying sets of conformations. Ligands from different functional classes have distinct, characteristic effects on the conformational heterogeneity of the receptor. Compared to angiotensin II, the endogenous agonist, agonists with enhanced Gq coupling more strongly stabilize an ""open"" conformation with an accessible transducer-binding site. β-arrestin-biased agonists deficient in Gq coupling do not stabilize this open conformation but instead favor two more occluded conformations. These data suggest a structural mechanism for biased ligand action at the angiotensin receptor that can be exploited to rationally design GPCR-targeting drugs with greater specificity of action."
https://openalex.org/W2908648017,"Minimal sets of transcription factors can directly reprogram somatic cells into neurons. However, epigenetic remodeling during neuronal reprogramming has not been well reconciled with transcriptional regulation. Here we show that NeuroD1 achieves direct neuronal conversion from mouse microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Exogenous NeuroD1 initially occupies closed chromatin regions associated with bivalent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 marks in microglia to induce neuronal gene expression. These regions are resolved to a monovalent H3K4me3 mark at later stages of reprogramming to establish the neuronal identity. Furthermore, the transcriptional repressors Scrt1 and Meis2 are induced as NeuroD1 target genes, resulting in a decrease in the expression of microglial genes. In parallel, the microglial epigenetic signature in promoter and enhancer regions is erased. These findings reveal NeuroD1 pioneering activity accompanied by global epigenetic remodeling for two sequential events: onset of neuronal property acquisition and loss of the microglial identity during reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2910849968,"The angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a critical regulator of cardiovascular and renal function and is an important model for studies of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. By stabilizing the receptor with a single-domain antibody fragment (""nanobody"") discovered using a synthetic yeast-displayed library, we determined the crystal structure of active-state human AT1R bound to an AngII analog with partial agonist activity. The nanobody binds to the receptor's intracellular transducer pocket, stabilizing the large conformational changes characteristic of activated GPCRs. The peptide engages the AT1R through an extensive interface spanning from the receptor core to its extracellular face and N terminus, remodeling the ligand-binding cavity. Remarkably, the mechanism used to propagate conformational changes through the receptor diverges from other GPCRs at several key sites, highlighting the diversity of allosteric mechanisms among GPCRs. Our structure provides insight into how AngII and its analogs stimulate full or biased signaling, respectively."

By combining biochemical and genetic data, we provide an atlas for Th2 differentiation, validating known regulators and identifying factors, such as Pparg and Bhlhe40, as part of the core regulatory network governing Th2 helper cell fates. CD4+ T helper (Th) cells are a central part of the adaptive immune system. During immune response, Th cells transform from a naive state into different effector subtypes, including T helper type 1 cells (Th1), Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Treg). Different subtypes have distinct functions and molecular characteristics (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu J. Yamane H. Paul W.E. Differentiation of effector CD4 T cell populations (∗).Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 445-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Th2 cells are primarily involved in eliminating helminths and other parasites and are strongly associated with allergies. Th2 differentiation is characterized by the production of the cytokines Il4, Il5, and Il13. In vitro, Il4 is crucial for the activation of the signaling transducer Stat6 (Kaplan et al., 1996Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J.

Weinberg A.D. English M. Huston G. IL-4 directs the development of Th2-like helper effectors.J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gata3 activates Il4, forming a positive feedback loop (Zheng and Flavell, 1997Zheng W. Flavell R.A. The transcription factor GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T cells.Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Th1 cells possess an equivalent feedback mechanism for their defining transcription factor (TF), Tbx21, which represses Gata3. Gata3 is able to inhibit Ifng, the main cytokine driving Th1 differentiation. Thus, the balance of the two TFs Tbx21 and Gata3 defines the Th1-Th2 axis (Kanhere et al., 2012Kanhere A. Hertweck A. Bhatia U. Gökmen M.R. Perucha E. Jackson I. Lord G.M. Jenner R.G. T-bet and GATA3 orchestrate Th1 and Th2 differentiation through lineage-specific targeting of distal regulatory elements.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). There are, however, many genes affecting this balance, and alternative Th fates are frequently affected by overlapping sets of regulatory genes. All T cell fates require activation via the T cell receptor and a co-stimulatory molecule, for example, CD28. Additional signaling via cytokines then determines the adapted T cell fate. Therefore, a delineation of activation versus differentiation is critical for our understanding of Th subtype development. Despite the importance of different T helper subtypes, so far only the Th17 subtype has been examined systematically (Ciofani et al., 2012Ciofani M. Madar A. Galan C. Sellars M. Mace K. Pauli F. Agarwal A. Huang W. Parkhurst C.N. Muratet M. et al.A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification.Cell. 2012; 151: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Here, we dissect Th2 differentiation with a special emphasis on differentiation versus activation signals. A major challenge in performing genetic studies in primary mouse T cells is the lack of efficient genetic perturbation tools. To date, only a small-scale RNA interference screen has been performed in vivo on mouse T cells (Chen et al., 2014Chen R. Bélanger S. Frederick M.A. Li B. Johnston R.J. Xiao N. Liu Y.C. Sharma S. Peters B. Rao A. et al.In vivo RNA interference screens identify regulators of antiviral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell differentiation.Immunity. 2014; 41: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, recently developed CRISPR technology has the advantages of higher specificity and greater flexibility, allowing knockout, repression, and activation (Adli, 2018Adli M. The CRISPR tool kit for genome editing and beyond.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Currently, all existing CRISPR libraries are lentiviral-based and therefore unable to infect murine Th cells (Baumann et al., 2004Baumann J.G. Unutmaz D. Miller M.D. Breun S.K. Grill S.M. Mirro J. Littman D.R. Rein A. KewalRamani V.N. Murine T cells potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus infection.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12537-12547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, we created a genome-wide retroviral CRISPR small guide RNA (sgRNA) library. By using this library on T cells from mice constitutively expressing Cas9, we obtained high knockout efficiency. In addition, we established an arrayed CRISPR screening protocol that is scalable and cost efficient. After library transduction, we screened for and characterized genes strongly affecting Th2 differentiation and activation, with Il4, Il13, Gata3, Irf4, and Xbp1 as our primary screen readouts. Il4, Il13, and Gata3 are at the core of Th2 differentiation (Kanhere et al., 2012Kanhere A. Hertweck A. Bhatia U. Gökmen M.R. Perucha E. Jackson I. Lord G.M. Jenner R.G. T-bet and GATA3 orchestrate Th1 and Th2 differentiation through lineage-specific targeting of distal regulatory elements.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), while Irf4 and Xbp1 have been suggested to have supporting roles in keeping the chromatin accessible and in overcoming the stress response associated with rapid protein synthesis during T cell activation (Li et al., 2012Li P. Spolski R. Liao W. Wang L. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Leonard W.J.

Gata3 is involved in both activation and differentiation, as mice deficient in Gata3 are unable to generate single-positive CD4 T cells, which requires activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) (Pai et al., 2003Pai S.-Y. Truitt M.L. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Critical roles for transcription factor GATA-3 in thymocyte development.Immunity. 2003; 19: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, Gata3 also has a well-established role in regulating the Th1 or Th2 differentiation axis. Selected genes discovered by the screen were validated in individual knockouts (KOs) and assayed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). To place the discovered genes into the context of Th2 differentiation, we profiled developing Th2 cells using RNA-seq for gene expression, ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) for chromatin accessibility, and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) of three key TFs: GATA3, IRF4, and BATF. We further acquired corresponding data from human donors to study the conservation of the regulatory pathways. A genome-wide assessment of gene regulatory function was performed by combining state-of-the-art transcriptional gene regulatory network analysis, literature curation, and genome-wide screen enrichment. Selected hits were validated in individual KO and overexpression experiments. The function of key regulators of Th2 differentiation was further explored by performing additional ChIP-seq experiments. We characterize genes in terms of their impact on activation and differentiation and provide a comprehensive, multi-factor model for Th2 cell fate determination. For ease of visualization, the integrated dataset is provided online at http://www.teichlab.org/data/. Figure 1 depicts an overview of our experimental approach. First, a high-complexity retroviral sgRNA library was generated (Figure 1B). We activated naive CD4+ T cells, purified from mouse spleens, with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 together with IL4 at day 0. On day 1, T cells were transduced with the retroviral libraries and selected with puromycin from day 3. After dead cell removal, the screens were carried out on day 4. A general protocol is supplied as Data S1. Our screening strategy used two different approaches. For Il4, Il13, Xbp1, and Gata3, we used T cells from transgenic mice carrying a fluorescent reporter driven by the promoter of the respective genes. In this protocol, cell populations with high or low fluorescence were enriched with sgRNAs for genes inhibiting or promoting Th2 cell differentiation, respectively. In addition, we carried out screens in which T cells were stained with antibodies for IRF4, XBP1, or GATA3. Most CRISPR screens to date are “drop-out” screens where the sgRNAs from an early time point are compared to those in the final surviving cell population. In contrast, here we identify differentiation-related genes by comparing the sgRNAs in the selected target-high versus target-low fractions. We will refer to the most highly enriched or depleted genes (defined in more detail below) as “hits.” In total, we carried out 11 genetic screens and analyzed these using the CRISPR screen hit-calling software MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014Li W. Xu H. Xiao T. Cong L. Love M.I. Zhang F. Irizarry R.A. Liu J.S. Brown M. Liu X.S. MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and compared this method to an orthogonal hit-calling method BaIOPSE (Bayesian inference of pooled screen enrichment [Figure 2B], further described in Data S1). Qualitatively, we find that there is reasonable overlap between MAGeCK and BaIOPSE (BaIOPSE scores in Data S2). Figure 2A shows the hits in a screen using anti-Gata3 antibody staining (i.e., sgRNA for specific target genes), ranked by MAGeCK p value, against the fold change (Th2, 0 h versus 72 h, described later) of those sgRNA targeted genes. As expected, Gata3 is recovered as a top hit in its own screen. Another top hit is a known signal transducer from the IL4 receptor to Gata3, the TF Stat6. Previous work has shown Stat6 to be required for the majority of Th2 response genes in mouse and human (Chen et al., 2003Chen Z. Lund R. Aittokallio T. Kosonen M. Nevalainen O. Lahesmaa R. Identification of novel IL-4/Stat6-regulated genes in T lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3627-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Elo et al., 2010Elo L.L. Järvenpää H. Tuomela S.

This gives us confidence that relevant genes are recovered. In a gene ontology (GO) analysis of top hits from all screens (Figure 2C), the categories for calcium and MAPK signaling have the lowest p values. While BaIOPSE allows a more consistent integration of multiple screen replicates than MAGeCK, we use MAGeCK for the remainder of this paper because of its pre-existing community acceptance and because BaIOPSE relies on informative priors. In all subsequent descriptions of hits, we will refer to the expression of the targeted gene, rather than the level of sgRNA enrichment or depletion. For the sake of brevity, in this paper we will use the nomenclature X→y, when gene X is in the top 5% of hits in the screen Y, either positively or negatively enriched. If gene X falls within the top 1% of ranked hits, we denote this as X→y!. A comprehensive list of all gene hits is included in Data S2, and results are summarized in Figure 2D. Next, we identified hits that were consistent between screens (see STAR Methods for details). Some genes appear to have a particularly strong impact on Th2 development as they are seen in multiple screens. Some affect both activation regulators (Irf4, Xbp1, Gata3) and differentiation regulators (Gata3, Il4, Il13). This includes the known genes Il27ra→Il4,Il13! and Lag3→Il4,Il13,Xbp1! but also genes not previously connected to T cells, e.g., Trappc12→Il4!,Irf4,Gata3!, Mpv17l2→Il4!,Il13!,Xbp1, and the TF Pou6f1→Il4!,Gata3. The cytokine-like gene Ccdc134→Il4!,Irf4!,Gata3 is also a major hit. It has so far received little attention in the literature but has been linked to arthritis (Xia et al., 2017Xia P. Zhang T. Gong X. Xiao L. Liao Q. Qiu X. Huang J. Amelioration of adjuvant-induced arthritis in CCDC134-overexpressing transgenic mice.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 490: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and shown to promote CD8+ T cell effector functions (Huang et al., 2014Huang J. Xiao L. Gong X. Shao W. Yin Y. Liao Q. Meng Y. Zhang Y. Ma D. Qiu X. Cytokine-like molecule CCDC134 contributes to CD8+ T-cell effector functions in cancer immunotherapy.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 5734-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In short, we have discovered many genes with a broad effect on Th2 differentiation and activation that deserve further investigation. To place our hits into the context of Th2 development, we generated in vitro time course data during mouse and human Th cell activation and differentiation (Figure 3A). Mouse and human primary Th cells were isolated from spleen and cord blood, respectively, and activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Upon addition of IL4, these cells matured into Th2 cells, while absence of IL4 resulted in activated “Th0” cells, which proliferate but do not differentiate into a Th subtype. We performed time course bulk RNA-seq profiling on Th2 and Th0 and ATAC-seq at several time points during Th2 differentiation. The large number of data points allowed us to reconstruct the trajectory of Th2 differentiation by principal component analysis (PCA), using RNA-seq data or ATAC-seq data alone (Figures 3B and 3C). When carrying out differential gene expression (DE) analysis between the murine Th0 and Th2 populations, we split the time course into the early or fine-grained (0–6 h) period and a late or coarse-grained period (0 h + 6–72 h), as shown in Figure 3A. The number of DE genes is shown in Figure 3D. Importantly, a sizeable fraction of these (21%) were also identified in at least one of our genetic screens, providing orthogonal evidence for their importance (DE scores are in Data S2). We carried out an equivalent RNA-seq analysis across ten time points in cultured human primary T cells. Fewer DE genes were identified, possibly because genetic diversity between individuals may obscure some gene expression changes, but more than one-fifth of the human DE genes had direct orthologs in the mouse response (Figure 3E). We will refer to any gene being DE in either human or mouse, at any time, as simply DE. A total of 216 genes were DE in both mouse and human, either early or late (p = 10−4). DE genes that also are top hits in our CRISPR screens are shown in Figure 3D. We note the presence of the well-known cytokines Ccl17→Il4,Il13,Xbp1, Il13→Il4,Xbp1, and Il2→Irf4,Gata3 and its receptor Il2rb→Irf4 and the TFs Gata3→Xbp1!,Gata3!, Tbx21→Il13,Xbp1, and Pparg→Il13,Gata3. Several of these are canonical Th2 genes, but many other genes were also noted. Several of these are related to metabolism, such as Pparg, which is thought to signal through mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) and control fatty acid uptake (Angela et al., 2016Angela M. Endo Y. Asou H.K. Yamamoto T. Tumes D.J. Tokuyama H. Yokote K. Nakayama T. Fatty acid metabolic reprogramming via mTOR-mediated inductions of PPARγ directs early activation of T cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Another metabolic gene, related to fatty acid transport (Dean et al., 2001Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. The human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar), with a strong phenotype in our screen is Abcd3→Il13,Ir4,Gata3!, which has not yet been studied in T cells. The Th1 repressor Mapkapk3→Il4,Gata3! is also a metabolic gene (Köther et al., 2014Köther K. Nordhoff C. Masemann D. Varga G. Bream J.H. Gaestel M. Wixler V. Ludwig S. MAPKAP kinase 3 suppresses Ifng gene expression and attenuates NK cell cytotoxicity and Th1 CD4 T-cell development upon influenza A virus infection.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 4235-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other hits have more diverse functions in T cell development. Hits include the known T cell regulator Stat-inhibitor Socs1→Irf4,Xbp1. The Il13 hit Rasgrp1→Il13,Irf4 is known to be involved in T cell maturation (Priatel et al., 2002Priatel J.J. Teh S.J. Dower N.A. Stone J.C. Teh H.S. RasGRP1 transduces low-grade TCR signals which are critical for T cell development, homeostasis, and differentiation.Immunity. 2002; 17: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and links guanyl to the RAS pathway. Interestingly the guanylate-binding protein, Gbp4→Il13, is also an Il13 hit (but with higher DE p value). The Il4 candidate regulator Uhrf1bp1l→Il4 has been connected to hypomyelination but could act through the chromatin regulator Uhrf1, which is required for Treg maturation (Obata et al., 2014Obata Y. Furusawa Y. Endo T.A. Sharif J. Takahashi D. Atarashi K. Nakayama M. Onawa S. Fujimura Y. Takahashi M. et al.The epigenetic regulator Uhrf1 facilitates the proliferation and maturation of colonic regulatory T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In conclusion, a human-mouse comparison of DE genes highlights cytokines and TFs known to be important for both Th2 activation and differentiation and suggests additional hits in our screens that are likely to be of functional importance, in particular genes that act as metabolic regulators (e.g., Abcd3). To gain further insight into the regulation of gene expression, we examined chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq. We performed ATAC-seq of developing Th2 cells at 0, 2, 4 24, 48, and 72 h time points in both human and mouse (Figure 3A). The chromatin of naive T cells is condensed until activation. It has previously been shown that some TFs, for example, Stat5, can only access the promoters of its target genes after T cell activation (Rawlings et al., 2011Rawlings J.S. Gatzka M. Thomas P.G. Ihle J.N. Chromatin condensation via the condensin II complex is required for peripheral T-cell quiescence.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Th2 differentiation is classically thought to be driven by Stat6, which in turn upregulates Gata3. We examined these dynamics over the time course of the Th2 response. The ATAC peaks were first called using MACS2. Overall, there is a massive gain of chromatin accessibility from 0 to 2 h (Figure S1). After this initial opening, the chromatin appears to recondense continuously, as indicated by the reduced total number of ATAC-seq peaks at each successive time point. We speculate that the regulatory network shifts from a general T cell network to subtype-specific network and that cell identity becomes less plastic and less responsive to external perturbation over time. We next compared TF binding predictions between human and mouse. Using FIMO (find individual motif occurrences), we predicted TF-binding sites within ATAC-seq peaks. To reduce the number of potential false-positive peaks, we concentrated on ATAC peaks that are conserved between mouse and human by calculating the percentage of overlapping peaks between species (10%–15%) (Figure 3E) and used these conserved binding sites for the rest of the analysis. For different TFs, we examined how ATAC peaks, in which the relevant TF motif is found, are changing over time (Figure 3F). As expected for Th2, chromatin accessibility over GATA3 motifs increases strongly with time, correlating with the increase in GATA3 abundance (confirmed by western blot [Figure S2] and RNA-seq [Data S2]). However, the (composite) motif that is most associated with relative peak size increase is BATF::JUN. This is consistent with the suggestion that BATF can act as a pioneer factor to open chromatin (Ciofani et al., 2012Ciofani M. Madar A. Galan C. Sellars M. Mace K. Pauli F. Agarwal A. Huang W. Parkhurst C.N. Muratet M. et al.A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification.Cell. 2012; 151: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The functional importance of Baft and/or Jun is supported by our genetic screens: Jun→Il13, Fos→Irf4,Xbp1, and Fosl2→Gata3! are all associated with increasing peak height. Since Jun and/or Fos and Fosl2 all recognize the same AP-1 motif, the exact TF composition at these peaks is likely to depend on their expression level. Notably, Fosl2 expression is highest at the time points of 1 and 2 h in Th0 or Th2, with largely similar levels across Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg subtypes (Stubbington et al., 2015Stubbington M.J.T. Mahata B. Svensson V. Deonarine A. Nissen J.K. Betz A.G. Teichmann S.A. An atlas of mouse CD4(+) T cell transcriptomes.Biol. Direct. 2015; 10: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Fosl2 has been shown to block IL17A production in Th17 by competing for AP-1 sites (Ciofani et al., 2012Ciofani M. Madar A. Galan C. Sellars M. Mace K. Pauli F. Agarwal A. Huang W. Parkhurst C.N. Muratet M. et al.A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification.Cell. 2012; 151: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), but overall Fosl2 expression is low in lymphoid cells (Uhlén et al., 2015Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson Å. Kampf C. Sjöstedt E. Asplund A. et al.Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7122) Google Scholar). Fos and Jun are transiently expressed during the first 6 h. Jund, another classical AP-1 factor, displays slowly increasing expression over time. As most AP-1 factors are expressed at low levels, Batf, whose expression increases continuously, is the most likely driver behind these peaks. At the other extreme, some TF motifs are overrepresented in peaks that decrease over time, such as Hoxd9→Il4, Atf3→Gata3, Atf4→Il4!, Foxj2→Gata3, Dmbx1→Irf4, Foxa2→Il4!, Foxo3→Il4, and Foxc2→Il13!. Several of these TFs also have low or decreasing expression levels. We have previously shown that Atf3→Gata3 positively regulates Ifng (Filén et al., 2010Filén S. Ylikoski E. Tripathi S. West A. Björkman M. Nyström J. Ahlfors H. Coffey E. Rao K.V. Rasool O. Lahesmaa R. Activating transcription factor 3 is a positive regulator of human IFNG gene expression.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and promotes Th1 differentiation in humans. Atf4→Il4! has been shown to be important for Th1 function as stress regulator (Xia et al., 2015Xia R. Lu B. Yang X. ATF4 reprograms T cell metabolism in response to the environmental stress and is required for Th1 immune responses (IRM9P.459).J Immunol. 2015; 194: 130Google Scholar), but its impact on Il4 extends this claim to Th2. Foxo1→Il13!,Xbp1! is a highly expressed TF, but peaks containing this motif are also decaying. Foxo1 has recently been shown to inhibit H3K27me3 deposition at pro-memory T cell genes (Gray et al., 2017Gray S.M. Amezquita R.A. Guan T. Kleinstein S.H. Kaech S.M. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Chromatin Repression Guides Effector CD8+ T Cell Terminal Differentiation and Loss of Multipotency.Immunity. 2017; 46: 596-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Foxj2 has similar behavior to Foxo1 but has not been studied in T cells. Inferred STAT6-binding sites were also compared with previous mouse and human data (Elo et al., 2010Elo L.L. Järvenpää H. Tuomela S. Raghav S. Ahlfors H. Laurila K. Gupta B. Lund R.J. Tahvanainen J. Hawkins R.D. et al.Genome-wide profiling of interleukin-4 and STAT6 transcription factor regulation of human Th2 cell programming.Immunity. 2010; 32: 852-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2003Chen Z. Lund R. Aittokallio T. Kosonen M. Nevalainen O. Lahesmaa R. Identification of novel IL-4/Stat6-regulated genes in T lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3627-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and we found that the vast majority of the previous target genes are also DE in our time course analysis. A list of all TFs and the average height of peaks containing their cognate motif is provided in Data S2. To further characterize the dynamics of the Th2 response, we generated ChIP-seq data at several time points (Figure 3A) for the Th2 master regulator GATA3, as well as BATF and IRF4. We created a mouse strain with a 3xFLAG-mCherry GATA3 construct (T2A fusion; Figure S3) for this purpose (see STAR Methods for details). The ChIP-seq peaks for Batf and Irf4 have a large overlap as previously reported (Ciofani et al., 2012Ciofani M. Madar A. Galan C. Sellars M. Mace K. Pauli F. Agarwal A. Huang W. Parkhurst C.N. Muratet M. et al.A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification.Cell. 2012; 151: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) (Figure 3G) (Jaccard index = 0.35). However, we saw no significant overlap of these two factors with GATA3 (Jaccard index = 0.028 and 0.032), suggesting that any synergistic function between GATA3 and BATF and/or IRF4 is not due to direct protein-protein contact. MEME (multiple EM for motif elicitation) was applied to the sequences in the GATA3 peaks to find other potential binding partners, and we found enrichment of YY1→Il4,Il13,Xbp1,Gata3 (p = 2.5 × 10−58) binding motifs. This is consistent with previous reports that Yy1 is required but not sufficient for Th2 cytokine expression (Hwang et al., 2013Hwang S.S. Kim Y.U. Lee S. Jang S.W. Kim M.K. Koh B.H. Lee W. Kim J. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Lee G.R. Transcription factor YY1 is essential for regulation of the Th2 cytokine locus and for Th2 cell differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATAC-seq peaks containing the YY1 motif are stable or decrease slightly (Figure 3f). This finding, together with the identification of Yy1 as a strong hit in our screen, reiterates Yy1 as a key supporter, but not driver, of Th2 differentiation. Focusing on GATA3 with its 10,203 peaks, a GO term analysis of its nearby genes yielded “natural killer cell activation” (p = 6 × 10−3) but included few other immune-related terms. This is likely due to the fact that Gata3 has distinct roles in other cell types (Wei e"

However, there is limited information on the utility of serum zonulin to indicate gastrointestinal disease and the validity of zonulin detection in widely-used commercial assays. The current study reports differences in zonulin levels across patient groups with gastrointestinal dysfunction compared with healthy individuals, though methodological inconsistencies indicated that actual zonulin protein was not detected by the commercial assays applied. The nature of the assays’ detected antigen was investigated using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by protein staining. Top matches of the assays’ detected antigen included haptoglobin and complement C3 for the assay manufactured by CUSABIO (Wuhan, China) and complement C3 for the assay manufactured by Immundiagnostik AG (Bensheim, Germany). These findings confirm that current commercial zonulin assays are not detecting the actual protein as prehaptoglobin-2. Until assay methodology is improved, we advise the greater scientific and medical community to exercise caution in considering the measurement of serum zonulin as a marker of mucosal barrier integrity."

The interphase nucleus and mitotic spindle scale with cell size through both physical and biochemical mechanisms, but control systems that coordinately scale intracellular structures are unknown. We show that the nuclear transport receptor importin α is modified by palmitoylation, which targets it to the plasma membrane and modulates its binding to nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins that regulate nuclear and spindle size in Xenopus egg extracts. Reconstitution of importin α targeting to the outer boundary of extract droplets mimicking cell-like compartments recapitulated scaling relationships observed during embryogenesis, which were altered by inhibitors that shift levels of importin α palmitoylation. Modulation of importin α palmitoylation in human cells similarly affected nuclear and spindle size. These experiments identify importin α as a conserved surface area-to-volume sensor that scales intracellular structures to cell size."

However, the physiological role of ChIs in depression has not been characterized. Here, we show that the tonic firing rate of ChIs in NAc shell is reduced in chronic stress mouse models and in a genetic mouse model of depression. Chemogenetic inhibition of NAc ChIs renders naive mice susceptible to stress, whereas enhancement of ChI activity reverses depressive phenotypes. As a component of the molecular mechanism, we found that the expression and function of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2) are decreased in ChIs of NAc shell in depressed mice. Overexpression of HCN2 channels in ChIs enhances cell activity and is sufficient to rescue depressive phenotypes. These data suggest that enhancement of HCN2 channel activity in NAc ChIs is a feasible approach for the development of a new class of antidepressants."

Our findings provide a resource for further analysis of lncRNAs in embryonic HSC development. Sitting at the apex of hematopoietic hierarchy, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) contribute to all mature blood lineages and continuously replenish lifetime hematopoiesis. In mouse embryos, the long-term adult-repopulating HSCs first appear in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and also at other locations around embryonic day 11 (E11) (Dzierzak and Speck, 2008Dzierzak E.

As recently recognized, several specialized vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in the embryonic major arteries show the capacity to produce hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and are thus defined as hemogenic ECs (Boisset et al., 2010Boisset J.C. van Cappellen W.

This dynamic process is termed the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. More precisely, pre-HSCs are the key intermediates during stepwise HSC development, which includes two consecutive stages: CD45− type 1 and CD45+ type 2 precursors (T1 and T2 pre-HSCs) (Rybtsov et al., 2011Rybtsov S.

After E11.5, dozens of HSCs by maturation from pre-HSCs in the AGM enter the bloodstream and colonize the fetal liver (Medvinsky et al., 2011Medvinsky A. Rybtsov S. Taoudi S. Embryonic origin of the adult hematopoietic system: advances and questions.Development. 2011; 138: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, within a transient window, the dorsal aorta witnesses de novo the dramatic development of distinct HSC-competent populations, including the specification of hemogenic ECs as well as the formation and maturation of pre-HSCs, suggesting highly orchestrated intrinsic and extrinsic regulation. Accumulating evidence has documented various molecular mechanisms underlying this multi-step formation of HSCs in the AGM region. As one of the best investigated transcription factors, Runx1, is continuously expressed in the hemogenic ECs, pre-HSCs, and definitive HSCs and plays an indispensable role in the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, but not after the HSC fate decision (Chen et al., 2009Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A.

Speck N.A. The role of Runx1 in embryonic blood cell formation.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2017; 962: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As the direct downstream target of Runx1, Gfi1 specifically marks hemogenic ECs and can accelerate hematopoietic commitment by silencing the endothelial program (Lancrin et al., 2012Lancrin C.

Likewise, another Runx1 target, Spi1, is upregulated and facilitates the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (Wilkinson et al., 2014Wilkinson A.C. Kawata V.K. Schütte J. Gao X. Antoniou S. Baumann C. Woodhouse S. Hannah R. Tanaka Y.

In addition, hypomethylation of the Runx1 distal promoter is associated with its transcriptional activity and is a signature of definitive hematopoiesis (Webber et al., 2013Webber B.R. Iacovino M. Choi S.H. Tolar J. Kyba M. Blazar B.R. DNA methylation of Runx1 regulatory regions correlates with transition from primitive to definitive hematopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo.Blood. 2013; 122: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the upstream mechanism modulating the DNA methylation of Runx1 promoters in embryos remains largely unknown. Most recently, using a newly defined surface-marker cocktail and concurrent massive single-cell RNA sequencing, the rare embryonic pre-HSCs were successfully purified and the transcriptomes were comprehensively surveyed at single-cell resolution (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J. He W. Ding M. Xiong F. Zheng X. Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Relying on these valuable data, the unexpected critical role of mTOR signaling in the emergence of HSCs rather than hematopoietic progenitor cells was demonstrated, suggesting the research strategy enables in-depth characterization of key regulatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, the physiological function of non-coding genes in mammalian HSC emergence remains elusive. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts longer than 200 nt with little protein-coding potential, constitute a large proportion of the transcriptome. lncRNAs play pivotal roles in numerous biological processes (Flynn and Chang, 2014Flynn R.A.

Previously, a deep-sequencing and comprehensive analysis study identified more than 150 unannotated lncRNAs specifically enriched in adult HSCs. Among them, two lncRNAs are functionally required in HSC self-renewal and differentiation (Luo et al., 2015Luo M. Jeong M. Sun D. Park H.J. Rodriguez B.A. Xia Z. Yang L. Zhang X. Sheng K.

However, the landscape and function of lncRNAs in the formation of embryonic HSCs are still unknown. Here, using the robust and comprehensive single-cell transcriptome data of five continuous developmental HSC-related populations and adult HSCs (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J.

Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we identified ∼7,000 lncRNA genes and constructed the global lncRNA expression landscape during entire HSC ontogeny. Using bioinformatics and functional analyses, we screened for lncRNA candidates affecting embryonic hematopoiesis and further demonstrated the crucial role of H19 in the formation of HSCs in AGM region. Our findings also provide a resource for the future elucidation of other lncRNAs pivotal for embryonic HSC development. We have recently reported the single-cell transcriptome analysis of six cell populations related to HSC ontogeny, including ECs and two types of pre-HSCs from the E11 AGM region, HSCs from E12 and E14 fetal liver, and HSCs from adult bone marrow (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J. He W. Ding M. Xiong F. Zheng X. Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, to elucidate the physiological role of lncRNAs during HSC formation, we carried out systematic bioinformatics analyses and functional evaluations of candidate lncRNAs. In total, 128 single-cell lncRNA profiles involving the above six distinct cell types were obtained from the ployA+ transcriptome dataset, in which non polyadenylated lncRNAs would not be captured (Table S1) (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J. He W. Ding M. Xiong F. Zheng X. Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). By using unique whole-genome alignment (mouse genome [mm10]), 7,312 lncRNA genes, including 6,911 annotated and 401 unannotated lncRNAs, were detected as fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs mapped (FPKM) ≥1 in at least one sample (Figure 1A; Table S2). These lncRNA genes were largely devoid of protein-coding potential according to bioinformatics analysis (Figure S1A). On average, both the transcript length and the number of exons per transcript of lncRNAs were less than that of protein-coding genes (Figures S1B and S1C). The average number of mapped lncRNA genes in each cell was significantly lower than that of mRNA genes, with both of them declined gradually from embryonic ECs to adult HSCs (Figure 1B). On the other hand, the average number of both mRNA and lncRNA transcripts in each cell increased sharply from ECs to pre-HSCs and then decreased during HSC development; mRNA transcripts peaked in T1 pre-HSCs, whereas lncRNAs showed the highest expression level in T2 pre-HSCs (Figure 1C). Interestingly, unannotated lncRNAs showed a higher average expression than annotated lncRNAs and an apparent upregulation from EC to T1 pre-HSC stage (Figures S1D and S1E). Specifically, two known HSC-specific unannotated lncRNAs, lncHSC-1 and lncHSC-2 (Luo et al., 2015Luo M. Jeong M. Sun D. Park H.J. Rodriguez B.A. Xia Z. Yang L. Zhang X. Sheng K.

We found 2,865 (39.2%) of these lncRNAs overlapping with HSC-related lncRNAs recently reported in two studies (Luo et al., 2015Luo M. Jeong M. Sun D. Park H.J. Rodriguez B.A. Xia Z. Yang L. Zhang X.

More precisely, there were 208 (14.4%) bone marrow HSC-expressed lncRNAs, 213 (14.7%) fetal liver-expressed lncRNAs, and 285 (11.6%) pre-HSC-expressed lncRNAs identified in our dataset shared with the bone marrow HSC-expressed lncRNAs reported previously (Luo et al., 2015Luo M. Jeong M. Sun D. Park H.J. Rodriguez B.A. Xia Z. Yang L. Zhang X. Sheng K. Darlington G.J. et al.Long non-coding RNAs control hematopoietic stem cell function.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 426-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Figure S1H). Among the 401 unannotated lncRNAs, 314 lncRNAs demonstrated FPKM ≥1 in at least two single cells, and 84 out of the remaining 87 lncRNAs were detectable (FPKM >0) in at least two samples (Table S2). To further validate the authenticity of these unannotated lncRNAs identified here, we selected 40 of them to conduct RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The results demonstrated that 25 out of 40 unannotated lncRNAs can be amplified as expected, and 17 out of 40 amplification products showed consistent sequence with assembled lncRNA, suggesting approximately half of the unannotated lncRNAs were real (Figures S1I and S1J; Table S3). As lncRNAs can be co-regulated or mutually regulated with their neighboring genes (Engreitz et al., 2016Engreitz J.M. Haines J.E. Perez E.M. Munson G. Chen J. Kane M. McDonel P.E. Guttman M.

Bruhn L. et al.lincRNAs act in the circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation.Nature. 2011; 477: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), we then determined their genomic distribution. Among 6,911 annotated lncRNA genes, 60.11% were intergenic and 39.89% were intragenic (Figure 1D). Pairwise Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the lncRNAs showed a higher expression correlation with the closest genes rather than distal ones (Figure 1E). The co-expression pattern analysis was used to calculate trans correlations (the pairwise with a distance >5 kb) and cis correlations (the pairwise with a distance ≤5 kb) between the lncRNA and nearest gene. Notably, we found a higher proportion of positive correlations between cis pairs than trans pairs (Figures 1F and 1G). The lncRNAs involved in cis pairs were then classified into six locus biotypes according to their genomic locations relative to the neighboring protein-coding genes, including antisense lncRNA-mRNA pairs in the head-to-head (“XH”) or tail-to-tail position (“XT”), antisense lncRNAs located within (“XI”) or encompassing a protein-coding gene (“XO”), and sense lncRNAs downstream (“SD”) or upstream (“SU”) of protein-coding genes (Figure 1H). For all six biotypes, XH (55.36%) was the dominant one (Figure 1I). Consistent with previous work (Luo et al., 2016Luo S. Lu J.Y. Liu L. Yin Y. Chen C. Han X. Wu B. Xu R. Liu W. Yan P. et al.Divergent lncRNAs regulate gene expression and lineage differentiation in pluripotent cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 637-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the expression of lncRNA-mRNA pairs tended to be positively correlated for sense pairs (SD and SU) (Figures 1J, 1K, and S2; Table S4). We also analyzed the evolutionary state of these lncRNAs using the reported lncRNA repertoires of 11 tetrapod species (Necsulea et al., 2014Necsulea A. Soumillon M. Warnefors M. Liechti A. Daish T. Zeller U. Baker J.C. Grützner F. Kaessmann H. The evolution of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns in tetrapods.Nature. 2014; 505: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Among 336 annotated lncRNAs transcribed in at least one species other than mouse, lncRNAs distal from their neighboring genes (>5 kb, trans) are expressed in more species than those that are closer (≤5 kb, cis) (Figure 1L; Table S4). To explore expression characteristics of lncRNAs during HSC formation, we first identified 849 differentially expressed lncRNAs (Figures 2A and S3A; Table S5). Next, principal-component analysis (PCA) clustered 128 single cells into six distinct populations, in line with the six sample populations from different stages (Figure 2B). Of note, pre-HSCs of different types and fetal liver HSCs of different stages were better distinguished by lncRNAs than by mRNAs, suggesting that lncRNAs exhibited higher stage specificity than mRNAs during HSC development (Figures 2B, 2C, and S3B; Table S5). Furthermore, qPCR was performed for the 186 most differentially expressed lncRNAs in the six distinct sample populations, and the expression patterns were generally consistent with that of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, independently verifying the repeatability of the results (Figures 2D and S3C; Table S3). To further obtain signature lncRNAs associated with HSC potential, we compared pre-HSCs with closely related populations without pre-HSC potential as previously described (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J. He W. Ding M. Xiong F. Zheng X. Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). 71 T1 pre-HSC signature lncRNAs were specifically expressed in T1 pre-HSCs (CD31+CD45−CD41lowKit+CD201high), but not in the CD31+CD45−CD41lowKit+CD201low/− population. Similarly, 56 T2 pre-HSC signature lncRNAs were highly enriched in the functional T2 pre-HSCs (CD31+CD45+CD41lowCD201+ and CD31+CD45+c-Kit+CD201high), but not in the CD31+CD45+CD41lowCD201− population (Figure 2E; Table S5). 37 lncRNAs overlapped between T1 and T2 pre-HSCs and were designated as pre-HSC signature lncRNAs. Among them, 12 lncRNA genes shared with adult bone marrow HSCs were designated as HSC signature lncRNAs. To determine the association between 37 pre-HSC signature lncRNAs and neighboring protein-coding genes, we built a non-coding to coding network using Circos (Figure 2F; Table S5). Of note, the neighboring coding genes of 5 signature lncRNAs (Gm20467, Gm16548, Gm13571, 4930538E20Rik, and Gm28177) were also previously identified pre-HSC signature mRNA genes, namely Nkx2-3, Selp, Znf512b, Bcl11a, and Stat4, respectively (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou F. Li X. Wang W. Zhu P. Zhou J. He W. Ding M. Xiong F. Zheng X. Li Z. et al.Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2016; 533: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, some pre-HSC signature lncRNAs were located adjacent to the critical hematopoietic genes, such as Hoxb5, Meis1, Mecom, and Runx1 (Azcoitia et al., 2005Azcoitia V. Aracil M. Martínez-A C.

Med. 2011; 208: 2403-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on the correlation analysis of genomic location, the 37 pre-HSC signature lncRNAs were mainly enriched in “regulation of hematopoiesis,” “regulation of multicellular organismal development,” and “positive regulation of cell communication.” The 12 HSC signature lncRNAs were mainly enriched in “regulation of gene expression” and “developmental process” (Figure S3D; Table S5). These results suggested that the signature lncRNAs might play a role in HSC specification and function. To further obtain the dynamic profiling of lncRNAs during HSC specification, self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used as an intuitional way to spatially visualize and investigate the heterogeneous expression pattern of single-cell transcriptome data. Each cell appeared as a two-dimensional heatmap, in which a set of genes with similar expression patterns were assembled as a unit; the units were clustered and located at a fixed location across all samples. 10,241 lncRNA and mRNA genes expressed at FPKM ≥5 of the whole transcriptome were mapped onto an SOM (Figure S4A). 28 hierarchical clusters with significantly dynamic expression were found during the six developmental stages, and the functions of lncRNAs could be predicted through the protein-coding genes in the same cluster (Figures S4B and S4C; Table S5). Next, lncRNAs meeting the following three criteria were selected for further functional evaluation: (1) upregulated from the EC to T1 pre-HSC stage, (2) belonging to the pre-HSC signature lncRNAs, and (3) highly conserved in more than three species (Figure 3A). A total of 10 candidate lncRNAs were screened out, including AI662270, Gm28875, 4930538E20Rik, Gm28177, RP23-95l4.3, Gm15135, 4933439C10Rik, 1700113A116Rik, Gm17275, and H19 (Figure 3B). They belonged to seven SOM units. Six of the 10 candidate IncRNAs were classified into SOM cluster 11, showing a similar expression pattern as that of transcription factor Hoxb3 (Figures 3C and S4B). Notably, H19 was associated with Runx1 and Gfi1b in cluster 8 (Figures 3C, S4B, and S4C). In order to determine the function of candidate lncRNAs, we generated lentivirus-expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting each lncRNA to knock down their expression in E11 AGM-derived CD31+ cells, which contained nearly all of the pre-HSCs and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in addition to ECs (Figure 3D). The infection efficiency of CD31+ cells was ∼80%, and the expression of candidate lncRNAs was reduced by at least 50% (Figures S5A and S5B; Table S3). The knockdown of 6 out of 10 lncRNA candidates led to reduced hematopoietic colony formation compared to the vector controls, including H19, AI66270, 4933439C10Rik, Gm15135, Gm17275, and 1700113A16Rik. Among them, the effect of H19 knockdown was the most significant (Figure 3E), which promoted us to focus on the physiological role of H19 lncRNA in HSC development in vivo. The expression of H19 is controlled by the upstream differentially methylated region (DMR), an epigenetic regulatory element that directs H19 gene expression (Thorvaldsen et al., 1998Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S.

Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Conditional disruption of the H19-DMR with inducible Mx1-Cre in adult mice shows that H19 is pivotal for maintaining the balance of HSC quiescence and differentiation (Venkatraman et al., 2013Venkatraman A. He X.C. Thorvaldsen J.L. Sugimura R. Perry J.M. Tao F. Zhao M. Christenson M.K. Sanchez R. Yu J.Y. et al.Maternal imprinting at the H19-Igf2 locus maintains adult haematopoietic stem cell quiescence.Nature. 2013; 500: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using the same targeting strategy, we deleted the H19-DMR from the embryonic endothelial stage with Tie2-Cre transgenic mice to generate maternal allele-specific mutants (Tie2-Cre;mH19flDMR/+), in which the paternally inherited wild-type allele phenocopied the null allele due to exclusive expression of the maternal allele. No gross phenotype was observed in the E11 (41–43 somite pairs) mutant embryos, and the cellularity and cell viability in different hematopoietic tissues were comparable between mutants and littermate controls. Mutant embryos showed a normal colony-forming unit in culture (CFU-C) number in the yolk sacs (Figure 4A). Of note, the CFU-C number was significantly lower in the mutant AGM regions, suggesting that H19-DMR deletion might specifically influence HSPC generation in the AGM region (Figure 4B). As considerable hematopoietic progenitors in the mid-gestational AGM regions are derived from the yolk sac (McGrath and Palis, 2005McGrath K.E. P"
https://openalex.org/W2909088645,"Bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been recently reported to play a variety of vital roles in organ and tissue damage repair, mainly via potent paracrine activity, including secreting extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, that serve as mediators facilitating intercellular communication and reprogramming recipient cells by delivering their contents to target cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are diverse and complex, and the influencing characteristics have rarely been studied. Accordingly, we designed this study to explore the time dependence of the effects of exosomes derived from BMSCs (BMexos) on renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanisms associated with the reperfusion time. Impressively, our study is the first to find that BMexos protected against renal I/R injury in vitro and in vivo at the very early reperfusion stages, especially 4–8 h after reperfusion in vitro and 8–16 h after reperfusion in vivo. Interestingly, we simultaneously found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was significantly suppressed following the administration of BMexos in vitro and in vivo with a similar time dependence. Additionally, we discovered that miR-199a-5p, which was abundant in the BMSCs, was transferred into renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) in a time-dependent manner and significantly inhibited I/R-induced ER stress by targeting binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP). Cocultivation with miR-199a-5p-overexpressing BMSCs amplified the suppression of ER stress and further protected against I/R injury. However, coculture with miR-199a-5p-knockdown BMSCs obviously increased ER stress and reversed the BMexos-induced protection, and silencing BIP by small interfering RNA–1098 in NRK-52E inhibited these effects. This study provides evidence that administering BMexos at the very early reperfusion stages significantly protects against renal I/R injury, and ER stress is closely linked to this protection. These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy during the very early reperfusion stages of renal I/R injury.—Wang, C., Zhu, G., He, W., Yin, H., Lin, F., Gou, X., Li, X. BMSCs protect against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by secreting exosomes loaded with miR-199a-5p that target BIP to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress at the very early reperfusion stages.

However, evidence suggesting that MDT improves patient outcome is limited.We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients newly-diagnosed with HCC between 2005 and 2013 (n = 6,619). The overall survival (OS) rates between the patients who were and were not managed via MDT were compared in the entire cohort (n = 6,619), and in the exactly matched cohort (n = 1,396).In the entire cohort, the 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in the patients who were managed via MDT compared to that of the patients who were not (71.2% vs. 49.4%, P < 0.001), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.41-0.53). In the exactly matched cohort, the 5-year survival rate was higher in patients who were managed via MDT (71.4% vs. 58.7%, P < 0.001; HR [95% CI] = 0.67 [0.56-0.80]). The survival benefit of MDT management was observed in most pre-defined subgroups, and was especially significant in patients with poor liver function (ALBI grade 2 or 3), intermediate or advanced tumor stage (BCLC stage B or C), or high alphafetoprotein levels (≥200 ng/ml).MDT management was associated with improved overall survival in HCC patients, indicating that MDT management can be a valuable option to improve outcome of HCC patients. This warrants prospective evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W2910690011,"Evidence is limited regarding the effect of diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) on the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In addition, previous studies on treatment delay and CRC survival have largely grouped patients from all stages (I-IV) into one cohort. Our study provides analysis on each stage individually. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with 39,000 newly diagnosed CRC patients obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database from 2004–2010 to examine the effect of DTIs on overall survival. DTIs were divided into 3 groups: ≤ 30 days (36,115 patients, 90.5% of study patients), 31–150 days (2,533, 6.4%), and ≥ 151 days (1,252, 3.15%). Risk of death was increased for DTI 31–150 days (hazard ratio 1.51; 95% confidence interval 1.43–1.59) and DTI ≥ 151 days (1.64; 1.54–1.76) compared to DTI ≤ 30. This risk was consistent across all cancer stages. Additional factors that increased risk of death include male gender, age >75, Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥7, other catastrophic illnesses, lack of multidisciplinary team involvement, and treatment in a low volume center. From these results, we advise that the DTI for all CRC patients, regardless of cancer staging, should be 30 days or less."
https://openalex.org/W2909475727,"The world's largest macroalgal blooms caused by Ulva prolifera have occurred in the Yellow Sea for 11 consecutive years. The area covered by blooms has been approximately 500 km2 in previous years, while in 2017, the maximum area decreased significantly to 312 km2. In this study, we concluded that species competition between Ulva and Sargassum (fast rise of the golden tides), extreme high sea surface temperature and harvest for floating Ulva macroalgae were the three critical factors influencing the sharp reduction in covered area for blooms in 2017. In addition, analysis of annual variations of Pyropia aquaculture area in the Southern Yellow Sea over the past two decades revealed that a great expansion in ""Sansha"" regions was mainly responsible for the initial blooms in 2007, and that this expansion supported the great biomass of the blooms in following years. Based on these findings, we suggest comprehensive utilization of the macroalgal blooms is a feasible way to control them."

Alternative splicing (AS) plays spectacular roles in mammalian biology that are especially evident in the brain, where it can generate many variants from individual primary transcripts, facilitating a limited genome to act as a major driver of system complexity (Darnell, 2013Darnell R.B.

Subsequently, enormous diversity was discovered in Drosophila, where stochastic AS generates mutually exclusive isoforms of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D.

An unresolved question in these studies is the extent to which such regulatory factors contribute to neuronal-type-specific identity, diversity, and function within the mammalian brain. This issue has been challenging due to methodological limitations. Current techniques of dissociation and purification of individual cell types and populations, for example, by laser capture microdissection or antibody-mediated panning methods, can produce limited numbers of cells and/or neurons, astrocytes, or microglia but missing their processes, which may account for large percentages of the net volume of such cells. Moreover, although such methods and more refined methods of microfluidic single-cell purification have been used for RNA sequencing, they have not been informative about cell-type-specific protein-RNA regulation. We previously developed a means for studying RNA regulation termed CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) by purifying native protein-RNA regulatory complexes from intact flash-frozen brains (Licatalosi et al., 2008Licatalosi D.D.

We recently modified CLIP using a technology termed cTag (“conditionally” tagged)-PAPERCLIP to conditionally express AcGFP-tagged polyadenylated (poly(A))-binding protein PABPC1 in vivo in selected cell populations using Cre/Lox system (Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W.

Differential 3′ processing of specific transcripts expands regulatory and protein diversity across neuronal cell types.eLife. 2018; 7: e34042Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); after isolation of brain, CLIP, and AcGFP purification, PAPERCLIP was able to purify and differentiate all of the poly(A) RNAs that were unique to excitatory and inhibitory neurons and distinguish these from microglia and astrocytes. This led to identification of microglia-specific poly(A) changes after inflammatory brain stimulation (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) (Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I.

Here, we explore whether cTag-CLIP can be applied more generally for purification of a subset of RNA-protein regulatory interactions in specific neuronal types and populations and whether sensitivity is achievable with a single regulatory RNA-binding protein (RBP), particularly when binding to short-lived species, such as introns of nascent RNA. We developed cTag-CLIP for NOVA2, a neuron-specific RNA regulatory protein, together with its bound RNA targets. NOVA1 (Buckanovich and Darnell, 1997Buckanovich R.J. Darnell R.B. The neuronal RNA binding protein Nova-1 recognizes specific RNA targets in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and NOVA2 (Yang et al., 1998Yang Y.Y. Yin G.L. Darnell R.B.

In the latter, Nova2 haploinsufficiency leads to spontaneous epilepsy (Eom et al., 2013Eom T. Zhang C. Wang H. Lay K. Fak J. Noebels J.L. Darnell R.B. NOVA-dependent regulation of cryptic NMD exons controls synaptic protein levels after seizure.eLife. 2013; 2: e00178Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and homozygous loss of either or both NOVA isoforms leads to early postnatal death (Jensen et al., 2000Jensen K.B.

Chen Z. et al.NOVA2-mediated RNA regulation is required for axonal pathfinding during development.eLife. 2016; 5: e14371Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this study, we harnessed cTag technology to examine high-resolution maps of NOVA2-RNA interactions in vivo with neuronal cell-type- and population-specific resolution. Integrating data from NOVA2 cTag-CLIP with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in Nova2-conditional knockout (Nova2-cKO) mice in different neuronal types and populations led us to distinguish NOVA2 properties and functions on the same transcripts in different cellular contexts. These unique binding profiles have functional consequences: NOVA2 acts as an essential factor specifically for development of laminar structure in cortical excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons and for proper motor coordination and synapse formation in cerebellar Purkinje, respectively. Exploring these findings further led to the discovery of a mechanism by which NOVA2 action leads to different outcomes in different cells on the same transcripts: NOVA2 acts as a cis-acting AS element to prevent intron retention (IR), and these RNA elements can serve as scaffolds to alter the binding and actions of another trans-acting AS factor, PTBP2. The cTag CLIP platform provides a general strategy for studying RNA regulation in single cell types and populations, complementing ongoing RNA-seq studies in single cells and thereby developing insight into how RBPs mediate RNA diversity and functional complexity in complex organs, such as the brain. To first evaluate spatial and temporal AS diversity across the CNS, we re-analyzed publicly available RNA-seq datasets of multiple CNS regions and developmental stages using the Quantas pipeline (Charizanis et al., 2012Charizanis K. Lee K.-Y. Batra R. Goodwin M. Zhang C. Yuan Y. Shiue L. Cline M. Scotti M.M.

Systematic discovery of regulated and conserved alternative exons in the mammalian brain reveals NMD modulating chromatin regulators.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Over 3,000 cassette-type AS events could be identified as showing significant differences (|Δexon inclusion rate| [|ΔI|] ≥ 0.1; Ule et al., 2005bUle J. Ule A. Spencer J. Williams A. Hu J.-S. Cline M. Wang H. Clark T. Fraser C. Ruggiu M. et al.Nova regulates brain-specific splicing to shape the synapse.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) during mouse cortical development and among different adult CNS regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord), including over 1,800 AS events in the neonatal cortex and midbrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). AS events regulated by neural-enriched splicing factors, including NOVA, nSR100, PTBP2, MBNL, and RBFOX proteins, were determined by re-analyzing published RNA-seq datasets of each RBP-KO mouse. The total number of AS events changed in each RBP-KO mouse brain is shown in Figure S1C and Table S1. This analysis revealed that NOVA2 was the top ranked splicing regulator contributing to spatial and temporal AS diversity across CNS regions (Figure 1A). Neurons and glia, the main cell types in the brain, use different sets of AS exons (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. et al.An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, the extent to which AS diversity exists among individual neuronal subtypes or what might govern such regulation. As a baseline for demarcating neuronal-type regulatory factors that might govern cell-specific AS events, single-cell suspensions prepared from embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) cortex of tdTomato reporter mice (ControltdTomato) crossed with Gad2-Cre (inhibitory neuron lineage) or Emx1-Cre (cortical excitatory neuron lineage) driver mouse (ControltdTomato,Gad2-Cre or ControltdTomato,Emx1-Cre, respectively) were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA-seq analysis (Figure 1B). Cre-dependent tdTomato expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for tdTomato (Figure S1D). As anticipated, GABAergic inhibitory neuronal markers (e.g., Gad1, Gad2, and Lhx6) and glutamatergic excitatory neuronal markers (e.g., Tbr1 and Slc17a7) were significantly enriched in inhibitory neuronal lineage and excitatory neuronal lineage, respectively (Figure 1B). RNA levels of genes encoding AS regulators in each neuronal population were then assessed and found to be non-uniform, such that Nova1, Mbnl1, Elavl2, Elavl4, and Celf4 were significantly enriched in inhibitory neuronal lineage and Nova2, Rbfox1, Rbfox3, Celf2, and Celf6 tended to be enriched in excitatory neuronal lineage (Figure S1E), although these demarcations were relative, not absolute. The comparison of exon inclusion rate between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal lineage identified 1,236 significant AS changes (FDR < 0.05; |ΔI| ≥ 0.1; Figures 1B and S1F; Table S1), over two hundred of which overlapped with the NOVA2 target AS events (Figures 1B and S1C). As a quality control, we assessed the rate of contamination of non-neuronal cells in mouse E18.5 cortex and found it to be less than 4.4% (Figure S1G) and found no significant overlap with differentially regulated astrocyte-type AS events in the Emx1-Cre lineage (Figure S1H), no enrichment of glia markers in both Gad2- and Emx1-Cre lineage samples (Figure S1I), and enrichment of inhibitory and excitatory neuron markers in Gad2- and Emx1-Cre lineage samples, respectively. These datasets clearly demonstrate that contamination of non-neuronal cells to both Gad2- and Emx1-Cre lineage samples is slight and that cortical inhibitory and excitatory neurons express different exons. Taken together, these data suggest that, just as neuronal-enriched trans-acting splicing regulators show diverse expression patterns across CNS regions and neuronal types (Figure 1C), AS diversity across CNS regions and neuronal cell types may be generated by the expression and action of individual trans-acting splicing factors, such as NOVA2. NOVA was the first RBP whose in vivo RNA-binding map was generated with CLIP (Ule et al., 2003Ule J. Jensen K.B. Ruggiu M. Mele A. Ule A. Darnell R.B. CLIP identifies Nova-regulated RNA networks in the brain.Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) and high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) (Licatalosi et al., 2008Licatalosi D.D. Mele A. Fak J.J. Ule J. Kayikci M. Chi S.W. Clark T.A. Schweitzer A.C. Blume J.E. Wang X. et al.HITS-CLIP yields genome-wide insights into brain alternative RNA processing.Nature. 2008; 456: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), generating robust transcriptome-wide regulatory protein-RNA interaction maps in vivo. To generate NOVA2 CLIP maps with cell-type-specific resolution in intact CNS tissue, we generated “Nova2-cTag” mice that conditionally express AcGFP-tagged NOVA2 (NOVA2-AcGFP) in a Cre-dependent manner (Figures 2A and 2B ). A knockin strategy was employed, targeting the endogenous Nova2 locus, in order to maintain wild-type Nova2 RNA stoichiometry and regulation (Figure S2A). Nova2-cTag heterozygous and homozygous mice had no apparent phenotype. To examine the RNA targets of AcGFP-tagged NOVA2 relative to endogenous NOVA2, we first bred Nova2-cTag mice to a near ubiquitous Cre driver mouse (CMV-Cre) in mouse neurons (Nova2-cTagCMV-Cre). Immunoblot and immunofluorescent staining experiments on Nova2-cTagCMV-Cre demonstrated successful and complete Cre-dependent expression of NOVA2-AcGFP (Figures 2C and S2B) at E18.5. We then undertook a side-by-side comparison of the RNA-binding properties of native NOVA2 relative to AcGFP-tagged NOVA2. We undertook NOVA2-AcGFP HITS-CLIP (referred as NOVA2 cTag-CLIP) in the E18.5 cortex of Nova2-cTagCMV-Cre mice, using a mixture of two high-affinity monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 2D). Comparison of the results from 3 biologic replicate NOVA2 cTagCMV-Cre-CLIP experiments and endogenous NOVA2 CLIP revealed NOVA2 binding to nearly identical (R = 0.99) target transcripts with extremely similar CLIP peaks (R = 0.87, respectively; Figure S2C), including NOVA2 binding to its known YCAY motifs (Buckanovich and Darnell, 1997Buckanovich R.J.

Crystal structures of Nova-1 and Nova-2 K-homology RNA-binding domains.Structure. 1999; 7: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in CLIP peaks (Figure S2D). Taken together, these data indicate that AcGFP-tagged NOVA2 is not detectably altered in its RNA-binding properties in vivo. We next applied NOVA2 cTag-CLIP to generate NOVA2-RNA interaction maps in two major neuronal types: GABAergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory neuronal populations within E18.5 cortex. Nova2-cTag mice were crossed with cell-specific Cre drivers for inhibitory neurons (Nova2-cTagGad2-Cre) and excitatory neurons (Nova2-cTagEmx1-Cre). GFP immunofluorescent staining on these mice showed successful Cre-dependent expression of NOVA2-AcGFP in the appropriate subsets of neurons (Figure S2B). Comparing the NOVA2 cTag-CLIP in inhibitory and excitatory neurons revealed significant enrichment of NOVA2 binding in a total of 923 and 791 transcripts, with 823 and 752 CLIP peaks specifically enriched to each neuronal subtype, respectively (FDR < 0.05; |log2 fold change| ≥ 1; Figure S2E). These results indicate that NOVA2 cTag-CLIP is able to discriminate large differences in NOVA2-RNA-binding profiles between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Taken together with prior cTag-PAPERCLIP studies of PABPC1 (Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I.

To search for NOVA2 directly mediated regulation in selective neuronal populations, we first set out to define all AS events in Nova2-cKO by RNA-seq (Figures 2E and 2F). Newly generated Nova2-cKO (Figures 2E and S2F) were crossed with the cell-specific Cre drivers mentioned above, and Cre-dependent NOVA2 protein depletion from a selective neuronal population at E18.5 in Nova2-cKO mice was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining on 4 mouse lines (ControltdTomato;Gad2-Cre, Nova2-cKOtdTomato;Gad2-Cre, ControltdTomato;Emx1-Cre, and Nova2-cKOtdTomato;Emx1-Cre; Figures 2G and S2G). tdTomato-positive cells from control or Nova2-cKO crossed with Cre-driver lines were collected by FACS before subjected to RNA-seq and subsequent AS analysis (Figures 2F and S2H). 1,970 or 2,682 AS events displayed NOVA2-dependent splicing patterns in inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively (Figures 2F and S2H). The Dab1.7bc exons were previously identified as a NOVA2-dependent switch of Reelin-Dab1 signaling in cortex (Yano et al., 2010Yano M. Hayakawa-Yano Y. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Nova2 regulates neuronal migration through an RNA switch in disabled-1 signaling.Neuron. 2010; 66: 848-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, it was not known which neuronal cell subtype NOVA2 acted on to mediate this developmental switch. Accordingly, we used cTag CLIP to assess whether NOVA2 acted in either Emx-1-positive excitatory neurons, Gad2 positive inhibitory neurons, or another cell type. cTag-CLIP revealed that enrichment of NOVA2 bound to sites previously identified upstream of Dab1.7bc exons in standard whole-cortex CLIP (Yano et al., 2010Yano M.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can be curative, but suitable donors are often unavailable. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for autologous HSCT and gene therapy utilizing a lentiviral vector (LV) to restore FoxP3 expression under the control of endogenous human FOXP3 regulatory elements. Both murine transplant models and humanized mice engrafted with LV-modified HSCs show high levels of LV expression selective for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. LV transduction of scurfy (FoxP3mut) HSCs restores development of functional FoxP3+ Treg cells that suppress T cell proliferation in vitro and rescue the scurfy autoimmune phenotype in vivo. These findings demonstrate preclinical efficacy for the treatment of IPEX patients by autologous HSC transplant and may provide valuable insights into new cell therapies for autoimmunity."

Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element and is a component of several major metabolic pathways playing an important role in many physiological processes. In this study we evaluated the association between Fe concentration in serum, iron metabolism parameters and genetic variaton in 7 genes involved in iron metabolism and anti-oxidative processes with the incidence of lung cancer in Poland.The study included 200 lung cancer patients and 200 matched healthy control subjects. We analyzed serum iron concentration and iron metabolism parameters (TIBC, UIBC, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation), and genotyped seven variants in seven genes: HFE, TFR1, HAMP, TF, SOD2, CAT and GPX1.Lung cancer patients compared to their matched controls had significantly higher mean serum iron level (p = 0.01), ferritin level (p = 0.007) and TIBC (p = 0.006). Analysis revealed that higher concentration of iron and ferritin (IVth quartile) compared to the lower concentration (Ist quartile) was associated with over 2-fold increased lung cancer incidence. We also found that higher transferrin saturation (p = 0.01) and lower TIBC (p<0.01) are associated with better survival of lung cancer patients. The analysis of polymorphisms in iron related genes did not reveal a significant difference between lung cancer patients and controls. However, rs10421768 in HAMP showed a borderline statistically significant correlation with lung cancer risk (OR = 2.83, p = 0.05).The results of this case control study indicate that higher body iron represented by higher Fe and ferritin levels may be associated with lung cancer incidence. Rs10421768 in HAMP may be associated with about 3-times higher lung cancer risk. Higher Fe body content may be associated with better survival of lung cancer patients."

Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we determined the quantity and occurrence of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC), Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella spp. and total enterobacteria in river water, downstream agricultural soil, and irrigated crops, during one year of sampling. The most abundant and frequently detected genes were gapA and eltB, indicating presence of enterobacteria and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) carrying the heat labile toxin, respectively. Pathogen levels in the samples were significantly positively associated with high water conductivity and low water temperature. In addition, a set of bacterial isolates from water, soil and crops were analyzed by PCR for presence of the genes blaCTX-M, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM and blaOXA-48. Four isolates were found to be positive for blaCTX-M genes and whole genome sequencing identified them as E. coli and one Enterobacter cloacae. The E. coli isolates belonged to the emerging, globally disseminated, multi-resistant E. coli lineages ST648, ST410 and ST162. The results indicate not only a high potential risk of transmission of diarrheal diseases by the consumption of contaminated water and vegetables but also the possibility of antibiotic resistance transfer from the environment to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2910097667,"Concepts of 464 university freshmen towards Environmental Education (EE) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) were analyzed. Responses were classified into seven main categories: ‘ecological aspects’, ‘ecological problems’, ‘economical aspects’, ‘social aspects’, ‘environmental attitudes’, ‘environmental behavior’ and ‘education’. Analyses of sustainability concepts show a large discrepancy between EE and ESD, whereby the latter includes an additional sub-group: ‘the next generation aspect’. Labeling individual sources of EE in a retrospective assessment identified the family as the most important source of knowledge, followed by media, school and outreach. Further differences were detected between students’ self-perception and their ideal conception of environmental behavior, by using the scale Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS). Only some EE statements produced higher (unfulfilled) expectations ‘economic aspects’, ‘environmental behavior’ and ‘ecological problems’. In contrast fewer (unfulfilled) expectations were observed in the categories of ‘education’ and ‘ecological aspects’."
https://openalex.org/W2908863468,"Thiazolidinedione drugs (TZDs) target the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to reverse insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, but side effects limit their clinical use. Here, using human adipose stem cell-derived adipocytes, we demonstrate that SNPs were enriched at sites of patient-specific PPARγ binding, which correlated with the individual-specific effects of the TZD rosiglitazone (rosi) on gene expression. Rosi induction of ABCA1, which regulates cholesterol metabolism, was dependent upon SNP rs4743771, which modulated PPARγ binding by influencing the genomic occupancy of its cooperating factor, NFIA. Conversion of rs4743771 from the inactive SNP allele to the active one by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated editing rescued PPARγ binding and rosi induction of ABCA1 expression. Moreover, rs4743771 is a major determinant of undesired serum cholesterol increases in rosi-treated diabetics. These data highlight human genetic variation that impacts PPARγ genomic occupancy and patient responses to antidiabetic drugs, with implications for developing personalized therapies for metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2909854453,"Birds kept in commercial production systems can be exposed to multiple stressors from early life and this alters the development of different morphological, immunological and behavioural indicators. We explore the hypothesis that provision of a complex environment during early life, better prepares birds to cope with stressful events as well as buffers them against future unpredictable stressful episodes. In this study, 96 one day old pullets were randomly distributed in eight pens (12 birds/pen). Half of the chicks (N = 48) were assigned to a Complex Environment (CENV: with perches, a dark brooder etc.) the others to a Simple Environment (SENV: without enrichment features). Half of the birds from each of these treatments were assigned to a No Stress (NSTR, 33°C) or to an acute Cold Stress (CSTR, 18–20°C) treatment during six hours on their second day of life. At four weeks of age, chicks with these four different backgrounds were exposed to an Intermittent Stressful Challenges Protocol (ISCP). In an immunological test indicative of pro-inflammatory status Phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P), the response of CSTR birds was ameliorated by rearing chicks in a CENV as they had a similar response to NSTR chicks and a significantly better pro-inflammatory response than those CSTR birds reared in a SENV (five days after the CSTR treatment was applied). A similar better response when coping with new challenges (the ISCP) was observed in birds reared in a CENV compared to those from a SENV. Birds reared in the CENV had a lower heterophil/lymphocyte ratio after the ISCP than birds reared in SENV, independently of whether or not they had been exposed to CSTR early in life. No effects of stress on general behaviour were detected, however, the provision of a CENV increased resting behaviour, which may have favoured stress recover. Additionally, we found that exposure to cold stress at an early age might have rendered birds more vulnerable to future stressful events. CSTR birds had lower humoral immune responses (sheep red blood cells induced antibodies) after the ISCP and started using elevated structures in the CENV later compared to their NSTR conspecifics. Our study reflects the importance of the early provision of a CENV in commercial conditions to reduce negative stress-related effects. Within the context of the theory of adaptive plasticity, our results suggest that the early experience of the birds had long lasting effects on the modulation of their phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2908708970,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance of cancer, so successful cancer therapy may therefore require the development of drugs against CSCs or combining anti-CSCs drugs with conventional therapies. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is one of the most frequently activated signaling pathways in human cancer, playing a central role in tumorigenesis as well as the maintenance of CSCs. Here, we designed and identified B591, a dihydrobenzofuran-imidazolium salt, as a novel specific pan-PI3K inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against class I PI3K isoforms, which showed effective inhibition of cellular PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and robust antitumor activity in a set of cancer cell lines. Notably, compared with bulk tumor cell populations, B591 exhibited more potency in suppressing CSCs survival and inducing CSCs apoptosis, and presence of B591 effectively eliminated paclitaxel-enriched CSCs. B591 diminished self-renewal capacity and decreased the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of CSCs. In vivo, B591 preferentially decreased CSCs levels in mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer as evidenced especially by remarkable reduction of tumor-initiating ability. Consistent with the preferential targeting of CSCs, B591 effectively inhibited breast tumor metastasis and delayed tumor regrowth following paclitaxel treatment. Taken together, our findings establish B591, a novel PI3K inhibitor, as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation as a CSCs targeting agent."
https://openalex.org/W2908927045,"Seagrasses form one of the most productive and threatened ecosystems worldwide because of global change and anthropogenic pressures. The frequency of extreme climatic events, such as heat waves, are expected to increase and may drive even more adverse effects than gradual warming. This study explores for the first time the effects of a sudden and temporary increase of temperature in situ on carbon metabolism and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in a community dominated by a seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) during two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). Results showed a positive correlation between temperature and seagrass production between seasons, while the experimental sudden and temporary increase in water temperature did not produce significant differences in carbon community metabolism and DOC fluxes in winter. In contrast, high temperature conditions in summer enhanced significantly the net community production and affected positively to DOC fluxes. Hence, this study indicates that a sudden and temporary increase in water temperature, which characterize marine heat waves, in temperate areas may enhance the autotrophic metabolism of seagrass communities and can yield an increase in the DOC released, in contrast to previous researches suggesting solely negative effects on seagrasses."
https://openalex.org/W2908943183,"Chemical mutagenesis is a useful tool for inducing mutations in plants. Seeds are often used as the material for chemical mutagenesis. The biological effect of a chemical mutagen on seeds is determined by absorption dose (the product of mutagen concentration and acting time, which starts after the mutagen is absorbed by the seeds). In practice, however, the concept of exposure dose (the product of mutagen concentration and treating time) is usually used instead because the time for absorbing mutagen is unknown. In this study, we conducted an experiment using ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) to treat cauliflower seeds, in which five EMS concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%), three treating time lengths (4 h, 6 h and 8 h) and two pretreatments (non-presoaking and presoaking of seeds for 2 h) were set. We obtained a well-fitted nonlinear regression model for the relationship between seedling survival rate and the EMS treatment, and its marginal models for the two pretreatments. Based on the models, we determined the EMS absorption doses under the two different pretreatments and identified their 50% lethality dose (LD50). We found that presoaking could delay EMS absorption and therefore reduce the injury caused by EMS within a given treating time, but could hardly change the biological effect of EMS after it is absorbed. The conclusions about absorption dose and presoaking effect obtained in this study might be generally applicable to plant chemical mutagenesis in principle."
https://openalex.org/W2910951682,"Ocular hypertension is a primary risk factor for glaucoma and results in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Current animal models of glaucoma lack severe RGC cell death as seen in glaucoma, making assessment of physiological mediators of cell death difficult. We developed a modified mouse model of ocular hypertension whereby long-lasting elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is achieved, resulting in significant reproducible damage to RGCs.In this model, microbeads are mixed with hyaluronic acid and injected into the anterior chamber of C57BL/6J mice. The hyaluronic acid allows for a gradual release of microbeads, resulting in sustained blockage of Schlemm's canal. IOP elevation was bimodal during the course of the model's progression. The first peak occurred 1 hours after beads injection, with an IOP value of 44.69 ± 6.00 mmHg, and the second peak occurred 6-12 days post-induction, with an IOP value of 34.91 ± 5.21 mmHg. RGC damage was most severe in the peripheral retina, with a loss of 64.1% compared to that of untreated eyes, while the midperiphery exhibited a 32.4% loss, 4 weeks following disease induction.These results suggest that sustained IOP elevation causes more RGC damage in the periphery than in the midperiphery of the retina. This model yields significant and reproducible RGC degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2909042253,"During physiologic stresses, like micronutrient starvation, infection, and cancer, the cytosolic moonlighting protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and extracellular milieu (ECM). Our work demonstrates that GAPDH mobilized to the PM, and the ECM does not utilize the classic endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi route of secretion; instead, it is first selectively translocated into early and late endosomes from the cytosol via microautophagy. GAPDH recruited to this common entry point is subsequently delivered into multivesicular bodies, leading to its membrane trafficking through secretion via exosomes and secretory lysosomes. We present evidence that both pathways of GAPDH membrane trafficking are up-regulated upon iron starvation, potentially by mobilization of intracellular calcium. These pathways also play a role in clearance of misfolded intracellular polypeptide aggregates. Our findings suggest that cells build in redundancy for vital cellular pathways to maintain micronutrient homeostasis and prevent buildup of toxic intracellular misfolded protein refuse.—Chauhan, A.

https://openalex.org/W2909661883,"The Rab family of small GTPases regulate various aspects of cellular dynamics in eukaryotic cells. Membrane trafficking has emerged as central to the functions of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which is associated with inherited and sporadic forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Rabs act as both regulators of the catalytic activity and targets for serine/threonine phosphorylation by LRRK2. Rab32, Rab38 and Rab29 have been shown to regulate LRRK2 sub-cellular localization through direct interactions. Recently, Rab29 was shown to escort LRRK2 to the Golgi apparatus and activate the phosphorylation of Rab8 and Rab10. Rab32 is linked to multiple cellular functions including endosomal trafficking, mitochondrial dynamics, and melanosome biogenesis. A missense mutation in Rab32 has also recently been linked to PD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab32 directly interacts with sorting nexin 6 (SNX6). SNX6 is a transient subunit of the retromer, an endosome-Golgi retrieval complex whose Vps35 subunit is strongly associated with PD. We could further show that localization of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors, which are recycled to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by the retromer, was affected by both Rab32 and SNX6. These data imply that Rab32 is linked to SNX6/retromer trafficking at the Golgi, and also suggests a possible connection between the retromer and Rab32 in the trafficking and biological functions of LRRK2."

Our objective was to assess the compliance and discontinuation rates of fingolimod relative to other oral, injectable, and infusible DMTs available on the market at the time of the study in Canada in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).We conducted a retrospective claims analysis. Patients with RRMS with ≥ 1 prescription for each DMT were included. Compliance (medication possession ratio of ≥ 80%) and discontinuation (gap > 30 days from the end of the index prescription) were calculated at the 6-, 12- and 24-month time points. Compliance with fingolimod at the 6-, 12- and 24-month time points was 75%, 75% and 70%, respectively; compared with DMF [70% (P < 0.001), 68% (P < 0.001), and 56% (P < 0.001), respectively], and BRACE [53% (P < 0.001), 47% (P < 0.001), and 35% (P < 0.001), respectively]. Compliance with fingolimod was comparable to teriflunomide at each time point, but was higher compared to natalizumab [70% versus 57% (P < 0.001)] at the 24-month time point. At the 6-, 12- and 24-month time points, patients on fingolimod had the lowest discontinuation rate (26%, 24%, and 29%, respectively) compared to BRACE [49% (P < 0.001), 44% (P < 0.001), and 57% (P < 0.001)], respectively], and natalizumab [33% (P < 0.001), 29% (P < 0.001), and 45% (P < 0.001), respectively], and was similar to teriflunomide (26%, 25%, and 31%, respectively).The compliance rate in fingolimod treated patients at the 24 month time point was higher than that observed in natalizumab treated patients. The discontinuation rate was lower with fingolimod compared to other DMTs at all time points but was similar to teriflunomide."
https://openalex.org/W2910671327,"The Bcl-2-associated death promoter BAD is a prognostic indicator for good clinical outcome of breast cancer patients; however, whether BAD affects breast cancer biology is unknown. Here we showed that BAD increased cell growth in breast cancer cells through two distinct mechanisms. Phosphorylation of BAD at S118 increased S99 phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding and AKT activation to promote growth and survival. Through a second, more prominent pathway, BAD stimulated mitochondrial oxygen consumption in a novel manner that was downstream of substrate entry into the mitochondria. BAD stimulated complex I activity that facilitated enhanced cell growth and sensitized cells to apoptosis in response to complex I blockade. We propose that this dependence on oxidative metabolism generated large but nonaggressive cancers. This model identifies a non-canonical role for BAD and reconciles BAD-mediated tumor growth with favorable outcomes in BAD-high breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908842464,"Reducing the number of influenza A virus (IAV) infected pigs at weaning is critical to minimize IAV spread to other farms. Sow vaccination is a common measure to reduce influenza levels at weaning. However, the impact of maternally-derived antibodies on IAV infection dynamics in growing pigs is poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of maternally-derived antibodies at weaning on IAV prevalence at weaning, time of influenza infection, number of weeks that pigs tested IAV positive, and estimated quantity of IAV in nursery pigs. We evaluated 301 pigs within 10 cohorts for their influenza serological (seroprevalence estimated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test) and virological (prevalence) status. Nasal swabs were collected weekly and pigs were bled 3 times throughout the nursery period. There was significant variability in influenza seroprevalence, HI titers and influenza prevalence after weaning. Increase in influenza seroprevalence at weaning was associated with low influenza prevalence at weaning and delayed time to IAV infection throughout the nursery. Piglets with IAV HI titers of 40 or higher at weaning were also less likely to test IAV positive at weaning, took longer to become infected, tested IAV RT-PCR positive for fewer weeks, and had higher IAV RT-PCR cycle threshold values compared to piglets with HI titers less than 40. Our findings suggest that sow vaccination or infection status that results in high levels of IAV strain-specific maternally-derived antibodies may help to reduce IAV circulation in both suckling and nursery pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2910132297,"This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of low-energy lower-extremity fracture in Chinese men and women aged 50 years and above. This study was a part of Chinese National Fracture Survey (CNFS), which used the stratified multistage cluster random sampling method to recruit subjects between January and May 2015. A total of 512187 individuals participated in the CNFS and of them there were 154099 men and women aged 50 years and above included in this study for data analysis. Low-energy fracture was defined as a fracture caused by slip, trip or fall from standing height. Univariate analyses and gender-based multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify the independent risk factors. A total of 215 patients had sustained low-energy lower extremity fractures in 2014, indicating the overall incidence was 139.5 (120.9 to 158.2) per 100000 persons, with 127.8 (102.5 to 153.1) and 151.1 (123.8 to 178.5) per 100000 person-year in men and women. Over 80% of fractures occurred at home and on the common road. In men, alcohol consumption (OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.29 to 3.08), sleep duration<7h/d (OR, 2.60; 95%CI, 1.68 to 4.03) and history of past fracture (OR, 2.57; 95%CI, 1.33 to 4.95) were identified as significant risk factors associated with low-energy fractures. In women, advanced age (80+ years) (OR, 3.22; 95%CI, 1.80 to 5.75), alcohol consumption(OR, 1.72; 95%CI, 1.00 to 2.98), sleep duration <7h/d (OR, 2.11; 95%CI, 1.40 to 3.18), and history of past fracture (OR, 3.46; 95%CI, 1.97 to 6.09) were identified as significant risk factors and living in western region (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.38 to 0.94) and current weight of 50 to 59.9 kg (OR, 0.17; 95%CI, 0.04 to 0.73) were identified as protective factors for fractures. Accordingly, awareness on the importance of sleep and alcohol consumption on fragility fracture should be improved, and health policies that focus on decreasing alcohol consumption and encouraging individuals to improve their sleep quality and duration should be considered. Maintaining a healthy bodyweight for women should be specifically emphasized to prevent low-energy fractures."

However, clinical evidence for this association is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to provide epidemiologic evidence to clarify the relationship between MP and development of RA.This 13-year nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study analyzed the risk of RA in a cohort of MP patients. We cross linked and compared the database of those with catastrophic illnesses to make sure the diagnoses of RA are correctly labeled. We selected 116,053 hospitalized patients diagnosed with MP between 2000 and 2012 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and 464,212 matched controls at a 1:4 ratio by age, gender, and index year, in relation to the risk of developing RA. The follow-up period referred to the initial diagnosis of MP until the date of RA diagnosis, censoring of RA, or 31st December 2013. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the association between MP and incidence of RA among patients with different potential risks.The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incidental RA in the MP group was 1.37 (95% confidence interval CI = 0.87-2.16), compared to non-MP controls. Stratified analysis revealed that the adjusted HR was 3.05 (95% CI = 1.16-7.99, p = 0.02) in a subgroup of patients over the age of 65.The adjusted HR of RA for the MP group among aged ≦19 years and ≥ 65 years was 3.19 (95% CI = 1.04.9.76) and 4.14 (95% CI = 1.27,13.4) within the first 2 years of follow-up.This cohort study demonstrated that patients with MP had a higher risk of developing RA, especially in the first 2 years, in those aged younger than 19 and over 65."
https://openalex.org/W2910365433,"Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 μmol m-2 s-1), ER (660.2 μmol m-2 s-1), GEP (-2025.5 μmol m-2 s-1) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 μmol m-2 s-1), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 μmol m-2 s-1). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change."

We assessed the ability to recruit and retain individuals from fishing communities into an HIV vaccine preparedness cohort study in Masaka, Uganda. Methods HIV high risk, sero-negative adults (18–49 years) were identified from four fishing villages bordering Lake Victoria through door-to-door HIV counselling and testing (HCT). Interested persons were referred for screening, enrolment, and quarterly follow-up visits at a study clinic located approximately 30–40 kilometres away. Repeat HCT, HIV risk assessment, and evaluation and treatment for sexually transmitted infections were provided. Rates of and factors associated with study dropout were assessed using Poisson regression models. Results A total of 940 participants were screened between January 2012 and February 2015, of whom 654 were considered for the analysis. Over a two-year follow-up period, 197 (30.1%) participants dropped out of the study over 778.9 person-years, a dropout rate of 25.3 / 100 person-years of observation. Dropout was associated with being female (aRR = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–2.18), being 18–24 years (aRR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.03–2.60) or being 25–34 years (aRR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.04–2.55) compared to being 35+ years; having no education (aRR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.23–3.31); living in the community for less than one year (aRR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.46–3.38), or 1–5 years (aRR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16–2.45), compared to more than five years. Conclusions Our results suggest that individuals from fishing communities can be recruited and retained in longitudinal studies; however, intensified participant tracing may be necessary for women, younger volunteers, those who are less educated and new residents."

This virus, however, continues to circulate as a seasonal influenza virus and to cause illness and deaths worldwide. In this study, we describe the genetic diversity of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected between 2014 and 2016 in Cameroon. Three gene segments (HA, NA and M) of Cameroon strains were studied. The phylogenetic tree of the coding nucleotide sequences was generated by MEGA version 6.0 using a Maximum Likelihood method. The NA and M protein coding sequences were analyzed for the reported genetic markers of resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes, while predicted vaccine efficacy was estimated using the Pepitope method. Overall 39 strains were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed that Cameroon strains belonged to two major clades. The 2014 Cameroon sequences belonged to clade 6C while all sequences collected between 2015 and 2016 belonged to clade 6B. Majority of the samples had some mutations in the NA gene notably: I117M, N248D, and N369K while the amantadine-resistant M mutant, S31N, was found to be absent only in the two sequences collected in 2014. Overall, A/California/07/2009 vaccine strain showed a predicted vaccine efficacy of 24.55% to 35.77% against Cameroon A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating between 2014 and 2016. Our findings confirms the fast evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 since its first introduction and highlights on the importance of influenza vaccine in reducing the burden caused by influenza in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2909371296,"Quantitative applied linguistics research often takes place in restricted settings of an intact language classroom, workplace, phonetics laboratory or longitudinal sample. In such settings the samples tend to be small, which raises several methodological problems. The main aim of the current paper is to give a detailed explanation of methodological and practical implications inherent in a robust statistical method called bootstrapped quantile regression (BQR) analysis. Importantly for applied linguistics research, the BQR method could help to deal with methodological difficulties inherent in small sample studies. The current study employed a moderately small sample (N = 27) of students learning the Japanese language in a Malaysian public university. It examined the relationships between the students' language learning motivation (specifically, integrative orientation), the students' images or stereotypes about Japan and their global attitudes toward the target language country and its people. The findings indicated that there was a statistically significant relationship between the students' attitudes toward the target language country and their integrative orientation. In addition, these attitudes were found to be the most constant determinant of the integrative orientation. Besides the applied linguistics research, the BQR method can be used in a variety of the human sciences research where a sample size is small."
https://openalex.org/W2910729885,"Cell competition is involved in mammalian embryogenesis and tumor elimination and progression. It was previously shown that, whereas NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts expressing high levels of the yes-associated protein 1(YAP1) target TEA domain family (TEAD) transcription factors become “winners” in cell competitions, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing activated YAP1 become “losers” and are eliminated from culture monolayers. Thus, YAPl's role in cell competitions is clearly context dependent. Here, we show that keratinocytes overexpressing a constitutively activated YAP1 mutant lose in in vitro competitions with control cells conducted in standard tissue culture dishes and undergo apical extrusion. Similarly, cells in which endogenous YAP1 is activated by NF2 knockdown become losers. The YAP1-overexpressing cells exhibit a decrease in cell-matrix adhesion because of defective expression of adhesion molecules such as fibronectin-1. Cell adhesion-mediated proliferation is also impaired. However, because of intrinsic factors, YAP1-expressing cells proliferate faster than control cells when cocultured in dishes impeding cell adhesion. In vivo, Mob1a/b-deficient (YAP1-activated) epidermis, which shows decreased expression of type XVII collagen, cannot be engrafted successfully onto donor mice. YAP1-activated skin grafts shrink away from surrounding control skin, and the epidermis peels off the basement membrane.

Considering that pancreatic and colorectal tissues have the same embryonic origin, we investigated the profile of TULP3 expression in CRC hypothesizing that it may have a role in its development. We comparatively analysed TULP3 gene expression in CRC and normal adjacent colonic tissue and assessed association of expression profiles with survival and clinicopathological information, using publicly available datasets. TULP3 expression levels were increased in CRC when compared to the adjacent non-tumoral tissue. In addition, higher TULP3 gene expression was associated to lymphatic and vascular invasion in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), respectively. In summary, our results point to a possible role of TULP3 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in CRC. Additional studies are necessary to confirm these preliminary findings."
https://openalex.org/W2909048406,"Illusory face detection tasks can be used to study the neural correlates of top-down influences on face perception. In a typical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study design, subjects are presented with pure noise images, but are told that half of the stimuli contain a face. The illusory face perception network is assessed by comparing blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to images in which a face has been detected against BOLD activity related to images in which no face has been detected. In the present study, we highlight the existence of strong interindividual differences of BOLD activation patterns associated with illusory face perception. In the core system of face perception, 4 of 9 subjects had highly significant (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) activity in the bilateral occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA). In contrast, 5 of 9 subjects did not show any activity in these regions, even at statistical thresholds as liberal as p = 0.05, uncorrected. At the group level, this variability is reflected by non-significant activity in all regions of the core system. We argue that these differences might be related to individual differences in task execution: only some participants really detected faces in the noise images, while the other subjects simply responded in the desired way. This has several implications for future studies on illusory face detection. First, future studies should not only analyze results at the group level, but also for single subjects. Second, subjects should be explicitly queried after the fMRI experiment about whether they really detected faces or not. Third, if possible, not only the overt response of the subject, but also additional parameters that might indicate the perception of a noise stimulus as face should be collected (e.g., behavioral classification images)."
https://openalex.org/W2910029702,"Certain organs are capable of containing the replication of various types of viruses. In the liver, infection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the etiological factor of Hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often remains asymptomatic and leads to a chronic carrier state. Here we investigated how hepatocytes contain HBV replication and promote their own survival by orchestrating a translational defense mechanism via the stress-sensitive SUMO-2/3-specific peptidase SENP3. We found that SENP3 expression level decreased in HBV-infected hepatocytes in various models including HepG2-NTCP cell lines and a humanized mouse model. Downregulation of SENP3 reduced HBV replication and boosted host protein translation. We also discovered that IQGAP2, a Ras GTPase-activating-like protein, is a key substrate for SENP3-mediated de-SUMOylation. Downregulation of SENP3 in HBV infected cells facilitated IQGAP2 SUMOylation and degradation, which leads to suppression of HBV gene expression and restoration of global translation of host genes via modulation of AKT phosphorylation. Thus, The SENP3-IQGAP2 de-SUMOylation axis is a host defense mechanism of hepatocytes that restores host protein translation and suppresses HBV gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2803998527,"We propose an agent-based model leading to a decrease or an increase of hostility between agents after a major cultural threat such as a terrorist attack. The model is inspired from the Terror Management Theory and the Social Judgement Theory. An agent has a cultural identity defined through its acceptance segments about each of three different cultural worldviews (i.e., Atheist, Muslim, Christian) of the considered society. An agent's acceptance segment is composed from its acceptable positions toward a cultural worldview, including its most acceptable position. An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending on the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is perpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively perceived agents from this extreme cultural identity point of view tend to decrease the width of their acceptance segments in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening cultural identity. We generated a set of populations with cultural identities compatible with data from a survey on attitudes among a large sample representative of the population of France; we then simulated the reaction of these agents facing a terrorist attack from Muslim extremists. For most populations, the average attitude toward Muslims becomes more negative. However, for some specific populations, we noticed the opposite effect as the average attitude of the population toward Muslims becomes less negative. In these populations, the Muslim agents strongly differentiate themselves from the terrorists' extreme cultural identity, and the other agents are aware of these changes. These reactions are due to particular properties of their cultural identities that are identified in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2909283129,"Climate change is expected to exacerbate upwelling intensity and natural acidification in Eastern Boundaries Upwelling Systems (EBUS). Conducted between January-September 2015 in a nearshore site of the northern Humboldt Current System directly exposed to year-round upwelling episodes, this study was aimed at assessing the relationship between upwelling mediated pH-changes and functional traits of the numerically dominant planktonic copepod-grazer Acartia tonsa (Copepoda). Environmental temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, alkalinity, chlorophyll-a (Chl), copepod adult size, egg production (EP), and egg size and growth were assessed through 28 random oceanographic surveys. Agglomerative clustering and multidimensional scaling identified three main di-similitude nodes within temporal variability of abiotic and biotic variables: A) “upwelling”, B) “non-upwelling”, and C) “warm-acid” conditions. Nodes A and B represented typical features within the upwelling phenology, characterized by the transition from low temperature, oxygen, pH and Chl during upwelling to higher levels during non-upwelling conditions. However, well-oxygenated, saline and “warm-acid” node C seemed to be atypical for local climatology, suggesting the occurrence of a low frequency oceanographic perturbation. Multivariate (LDA and ANCOVA) analyses revealed upwelling through temperature, oxygen and pH were the main factors affecting variations in adult size and EP, and highlighted growth rates were significantly lower under node C. Likely buffering upwelling pH-reductions, phytoplankton biomass maintained copepod reproduction despite prevailing low temperature, oxygen and pH levels in the upwelling setting. Helping to better explain why this species is among the most recurrent ones in these variable yet productive upwelling areas, current findings also provide opportune cues on plankton responses under warm-acid conditions, which are expected to occur in productive EBUS as a consequence of climate perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2909273049,"The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence of viral encephalitis due to arbovirus infection of the Togaviridae and Flaviviridae families in São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 500 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected between August 2012 and January 2013, from patients with symptoms of acute encephalitis were analyzed. Findings suggestive of viral encephalitis—elevations in cell concentration, glucose and total protein—were observed in 234 (46.8%) samples, designated as Group 1. The remaining 266 samples comprised Group 2. All samples were tested for Flaviviruses (dengue virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, yellow fever virus and West Nile virus), Alphavirus (NS5 region) and enterovirus by RT- PCR and for herpesviruses and enteroviruses using CLART-Entherpex. A presumptive viral etiological agent was detected in 26 samples (5.2%), 18 (8.0%) in Group 1 and 8 (3.0%) in Group 2. In Group 1 human herpesviruses were detected in 9 cases, enteroviruses in 7 cases, dengue viruses (DENV) in 2 CSFs and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) in one case. In Group 2 there were 3 CSFs positive for human herpesviruses, 2 for enteroviruses, 2 for DENV and 1 for SLEV. Detection of arboviruses, even though present in a minority of infected patients, identifies these viruses as a probable etiological agent of encephalitis. This is of special concern in regions where this class of viruses is endemic and has been linked to other recent epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2910674285,"Heritability and evolvability estimates of adult traits from free-living bird populations can be used to gauge the ability of populations to respond to selection, but are rare due to difficulties in gathering detailed pedigree information. The capacity to respond to selection is particularly important for species occupying managed habitats such as agricultural grasslands because of the potential for humans to accidentally influence traits. We calculated heritability and evolvability of six morphological traits in a population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) breeding in a large agricultural landscape. We used microsatellite analysis to determine a genetic pedigree, revealing a high level of extra-pair paternity (63%) within a relatively philopatric population. For the entire population, heritabilities varied from low to high (bill width: 0.160±0.182 to tarsus length: 0.651±0.155), while evolvabilities were low across all traits (wing length: 0.035±0.013 to body mass: 0.066±0.106). Our results indicate that any directional selection from agricultural management practices will produce negligible changes in basic morphometrics of Savannah sparrow populations occupying the Champlain Valley of Vermont, USA."
https://openalex.org/W2910269540,"Multiple studies have revealed that adolescent AIDS orphans have more psychosocial problems than healthy adolescents. However, little is known about whether and how the brain structures of adolescent AIDS orphans differ from those of healthy adolescents. Here, we used magnetic resonance imaging to compare adolescent AIDS orphans reared in institutions (N = 20) with a sex- and age-matched group of healthy adolescents reared in families (N = 20) in China using a voxel-based morphometry analysis. First, we found that both total gray- and white-matter volumes did not differ between groups. Second, after correcting for age, sex, and total gray-matter volume, the AIDS orphan group demonstrated smaller hippocampal volumes, larger anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volumes, and no differences in the amygdala. Third, a whole-brain analysis identified higher gray-matter volume of the ACC in the AIDS orphan group than in the control group. The preliminary findings of this study highlight the need for future research to confirm the sensitivity of the hippocampus and ACC to early adversity."
https://openalex.org/W2908991167,"Microtubules (Mts) are dynamic cytoskeleton structures that play a key role in vesicular transport. The Mts-mediated transport depends on motor proteins named kinesins and the dynein/dynactin motor complex. The Rab7 adapter protein FYCO1 controls the anterograde transport of the endocytic compartments through the interaction with the kinesin KIF5. Rab7 and its partner RILP induce the recruitment of dynein/dynactin to late endosomes regulating its retrograde transport to the perinuclear area to fuse with lysosomes. The late endosomal-lysosomal fusion is regulated by the HOPS complex through its interaction with RILP and the GTPase Arl8. Coxiella burnetii (Cb), the causative agent of Q fever, is an obligate intracellular pathogen, which generates a large compartment with autophagolysosomal characteristics named Cb-containing vacuole (CCV). The CCV forms through homotypic fusion between small non-replicative CCVs (nrCCV) and through heterotypic fusion with other compartments, such as endosomes and lysosomes. In this work, we characterise the role of Mts, motor proteins, RILP/Rab7 and Arl8 on the CCV biogenesis. The formation of the CCV was affected when either the dynamics and/or the acetylation state of Mts were modified. Similarly, the overexpression of the dynactin subunit non-functional mutants p150Glued and RILP led to the formation of small nrCCVs. This phenomenon is not observed in cells overexpressing WT proteins, the motor KIF5 or its interacting protein FYCO1. The formation of the CCV was normal in infected cells that overexpressed Arl8 alone or together with hVps41 (a HOPS subunit) or in cells co-overexpressing hVps41 and RILP. The dominant negative mutant of Arl8 and the non-functional hVps41 inhibited the formation of the CCV. When the formation of CCV was affected, the bacterial multiplication diminished. Our results suggest that nrCCVs recruit the molecular machinery that regulate the Mts-dependent retrograde transport, Rab7/RILP and the dynein/dynactin system, as well as the tethering processes such as HOPS complex and Arl8 to finally originate the CCV where C. burnetii multiplies."
https://openalex.org/W2910845244,"Understanding whether captive-reared animals destined to reintroduction are still able to discriminate predators has important implications for conservation biology. The endangered European hamster benefits from conservation programs throughout Europe, in which several thousand individuals are released into the wild every year. Despite this, the anti-predator strategy of hamsters and their ability to maintain predator discrimination in captivity remain to be investigated. Here, we explore the predator discrimination behaviour of captive-reared European hamsters and their response to different predation cues. When first exposed to the urine of cats and goats in a Y-maze test, hamsters spent more time close to the cat scent rather than to the goat scent. In a second experiment, during which hamsters were exposed to a non-mobile European ferret (inside a cage), hamsters significantly increased the time spent close to the ferret's cage and displayed aggressive behaviour towards the ferret. Furthermore, they did not take refuge inside an anti-predation tube (APT), a device designed to upgrade wildlife underpasses and reconnect wild hamster populations. Finally, when exposed to a mobile ferret (but without physical contact), hamsters displayed mobbing and aggressive behaviours towards the ferret, before taking refuge inside the APT. Taken together, our results show that captive-reared hamsters are still able to detect and react to predation cues, but that they initially adopt an offensive strategy (grunting, spitting, mobbing) during the risk-assessment phase. After risk assessment, however, hamsters used the APT as a refuge. Our study provides important insights into the anti-predator behaviour of hamsters. Testing the efficacy of the APT, a device that will allow upgrading wildlife underpasses for the hamster and other rodents, is also of great importance and is instrumental in conservation efforts for these species."
https://openalex.org/W2910009840,"This study investigated the motor ability and working memory performance of Omani and German primary school-aged children. One hundred eighty-five children from public schools participated in a gross motor test that integrated whole body coordination, three different ball tasks, and a 20-meter run. Furthermore, they completed four working memory tests (the Digit-Span Test forward and backwards and the Corsi Block-Tapping Test forward and backwards). Two MANOVAS with the different motor and working memory tests and one univariate analysis of the general motor ability with the between-subject factors group and gender were conducted. Additionally, correlations between motor ability and working memory scores were executed. German children outperformed Omani children in the overall measurement of motor ability, (p = .01) and all aspects of working memory, (all p< .015). There were no correlations between motor and cognitive variables, when analyzing the results for the Omani and German children separately. These findings may be a result of different educational styles or socioeconomic status and must be investigated in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2910988128,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates somatic genome editing to reveal cooperative genetic interactions at the cellular level without extensive breeding between different mutant animals. Here we propose a transgenic inducible Cas9 effector-CRISPR mutagen ( ICE CRIM) mouse model in which CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic mutagenesis events can occur in response to Cre expression. The well-known tumor suppressor gene, Trp53, and 2 important DNA mismatch repair genes, Mlh1 and Msh2, were selected to be our somatic mutagenesis targets. Amplicon-based sequencing was performed to validate the editing efficiency and to identify the mutant allelic series. Crossed with various Cre lines, the Trp53 ICE CRIM alleles were activated to generate targeted cancer gene somatic or germ line mutant variants. We provide experimental evidence to show that an activated ICE CRIM can mutate both targeted alleles within a cell. Simultaneous disruption of multiple genes was also achieved when there were multiple single-guide RNA expression cassettes embedded within an activated ICE CRIM. Our mouse model can be used to generate mutant pools in vivo, which enables a functional screen to be performed in situ. Our results also provide evidence to support a monoclonal origin of hematopoietic neoplasms and to indicate that DNA mismatch repair deficiency accelerates tumorigenesis in Trp53 mutant genetic background.-Fan, H.-H., Yu, I.-S., Lin, Y.-H., Wang, S.-Y., Liaw, Y.-H., Chen, P.-L., Yang, T.-L., Lin, S.-W., Chen, Y.-T.
