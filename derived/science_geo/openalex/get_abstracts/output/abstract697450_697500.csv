https://openalex.org/W4287509839,"An electronic transition-based bare bones particle swarm optimization (ETBBPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The ETBBPSO is designed to present high precision results for high dimensional single-objective optimization problems. Particles in the ETBBPSO are divided into different orbits. A transition operator is proposed to enhance the global search ability of ETBBPSO. The transition behavior of particles gives the swarm more chance to escape from local minimums. In addition, an orbit merge operator is proposed in this paper. An orbit with low search ability will be merged by an orbit with high search ability. Extensive experiments with CEC2014 and CEC2020 are evaluated with ETBBPSO. Four famous population-based algorithms are also selected in the control group. Experimental results prove that ETBBPSO can present high precision results for high dimensional single-objective optimization problems."

Furthermore was found that among the economic indicators considered, food inflation, food imports, food exports, and extreme monetary poverty; the last one was the indicator that presented influence on the Food Production Index of both countries, during the period analyzed, showing that access was the main component that defines the food production. The results highlighted the need of integrating food security with the monetary and trade policies of these countries."
https://openalex.org/W4287577446,"Although most neoplasms result from complex interactions between the individual's genome and the environment, a percentage of cases is particularly due to inherited alterations that confer a greater predisposition to the development of tumors. Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes have a high psychosocial and economic burden, in addition to being characterized by an increased risk for one or more types of cancer, onset of malignancy at a young age, high risk of secondary malignancies, and occurrence in successive generations of the family. Personal and family history, as well as pedigree, may be useful resources to estimate the risk for developing cancer, especially in Primary Health Care settings.To identify and evaluate the evidence regarding the impact of using family history as a genomic technology for Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes screening at Primary Health Care.This systematic review protocol was elaborated in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will include all observational as well as experimental study designs published up to end of July 2022, and studies covering the impact of family history on screening for Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes in primary health care. Qualitative studies, as well as guidelines, reviews, and studies undertaken in hospitals, outpatient clinic, or medical environments will be excluded. Five databases will be searched, including MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and LILACS. Additional sources will also be retrieved, including Clinical trials.gov-NIH, The British Library, and Google Scholar. No restriction to language or date will be employed in the search strategy. Three investigators will select studies independently, perform data extraction, and conduct the critical appraisal of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected studies according to their designs. Regarding data synthesis, the study characteristics will be summarized and presented in tables and results will be presented according to the study design.

This study is expected to provide consistent evidence that will aid the primary care decision-makers regarding hereditary cancer screening, thus helping individuals and families at risk for cancer.CRD42020166211."
https://openalex.org/W4287509710,"Background Measuring height for age is one of the essential indicators for evaluating children’s growth. The study analyzes the association between maternal education and stunting among children under two years in Indonesia. Methods The study employed secondary data from the 2017 Indonesia Nutritional Status Monitoring Survey. The unit of analysis was children under two years, and the study obtained weighted samples of 70,293 children. Besides maternal education, other independent variables analyzed in this study were residence, maternal age, maternal marital status, maternal employment, children’s age, and gender. In the final stage, the study occupied a multivariate test by binary logistic regression test. Results The results show the proportion of stunted children under two years in Indonesia nationally is 20.1%. Mothers in primary school and under education categories are 1.587 times more likely than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.576–1.598). Meanwhile, mothers with a junior high school education have a chance of 1.430 times more than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.420–1.440). Moreover, mothers with education in the senior high school category have 1.230 times more chances than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.222–1.238). Conclusion The study concluded that the maternal education level was associated with stunting children under two years in Indonesia. The lower the mother’s level of education, the higher the chances of a mother having stunted children under two years."
https://openalex.org/W4287510462,"Disruptive advancements in science and technology often rely on new ideas and findings, which in turn brings us to focus on the value of novelty in scholarly activities. Using Web of Science publication data from European regions for the period between 2008 and 2017, this study examines, first, the impact of scientific collaboration on novelty of research. Here, five levels of collaboration are considered for each article-country, three levels of regions, and institutions, and novelty is measured with keywords information. Second, we investigate both the effect and moderating effect of research funding on novelty. Our findings show that there is a negative and significant relationship between scientific collaboration and novelty. Furthermore, funded papers show lower novelty than the unfunded, but funding does have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between collaboration and novelty. This study contributes by linking diverse levels of collaboration and funding sources to article's novelty and thus extending the scope of bibliometric research of publications."
https://openalex.org/W4287510059,"Elevational gradients along mountain slopes offer opportunities to study key factors shaping species diversity patterns. Several environmental factors change over short distances along the elevational gradient in predictable ways. However, different taxa respond to these factors differently resulting in various proposed models for biodiversity patterns along elevational transects. Using a multi-taxa approach, we investigated the effects of elevation, area, habitat and soil characteristics on species richness, individual abundance and species composition of six groups of ground-dwelling arthropods along four transect lines in the Swiss National Park and its surroundings (Eastern Alps). Spiders, millipedes, centipedes, ants, ground beetles and rove beetles were sampled using standardized methods (pitfall traps, cardboard traps, visual search) in 65 sites spanning an elevational range from 1800 to 2750 m a.s.l.. A total of 14,782 individuals comprising 248 species were collected (86 spider, 74 rove beetle, 34 ground beetle, 21 millipede, 19 centipede and 14 ant species). Linear mixed model-analysis revealed that rarefied species richness in five out of the six arthropod groups was affected by elevation (the quadratic term of elevation provided the best fit in most cases). We found three different patterns (linear decrease in centipedes, low elevation plateau followed by a decrease in ants and rove beetles, and midpoint peak in spiders and millipedes). These patterns were only partially mirrored when considering individual abundance. Elevation influenced species composition in all groups examined. Overall, elevation was the most important factor explaining the diversity patterns, while most local habitat and soil characteristics have little influence on these patterns. Our study supports the importance of using multi-taxa approaches when examining effects of elevational gradients. Considering only a single group may result in misleading findings for overall biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4287510394,"Urogenital schistosomiasis has been known to be endemic in several lowland areas of Ethiopia. It is caused by Schistosoma haematobium and causes considerable public health problems to schoolchildren. Ethiopia, after mapping the distribution of the disease (2013 to 2015), launched school-based mass deworming program to treat schoolchildren for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) across the country since 2015. However, there is no recent information about the prevalence of the disease among schoolchildren in the current study areas. Diagnostic performance of urine filtration method and urinalysis reagent strip is also lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in schoolchildren, and to evaluate diagnostic performance of urine filtration and urinalysis reagent strip in Amibara, Kurmuk and Abobo districts, Ethiopia.Across-sectional study was conducted involving 1,171 schoolchildren in Abobo, Amibara and Kurmuk districts from October, 2020 to January, 2021. The study participants were selected using random sampling technique. From each study participant, 10 ml urine samples were collected and examined using urine filtration method and urinalysis reagent strip. Data obtained from the survey were entered into Microsoft Excel 2010 and analysed with SPSS version 20.0. Data was summarized using descriptive statistics. Chi-square, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression and Pearson correlation test were used to measure associations between urogenital schistosomiasis, age, sex and haematuria. Odds ratio was used to measure strengths of association between variables. Agreement between urine filtration method and urinalysis reagent strip was determined using Kappa statistics. P-value < 0.05 at 95% CI was considered as statistically significant.Among the 1,171 urine samples from schoolchildren examined by urine filtration method, 143 (12.2%) were S.haematobium egg positive. Out of 143 positive children 126(88.1%) were lightly infected and 17 (11.9%) were heavily infected. Among the total of 1,171 urine samples tested by dipstick, 264(22.5%) were positive for haematuria. Prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis by both urine filtration and urinalysis reagent strip method was higher in Abobo than Hassoba (Amibara) and Kurmuk (P< 0.001). The number of egg counts (intensity of infections) were significantly correlated with intensity of haematuria (r = 0.6, P < 0.001). Egg-positive children had significantly higher risk of having haematuria compared to S. haematobium egg negative children (OR; 6.96; 95%CI: 4.98, 8.940). Compared to urine filtration method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of urinalysis reagent strip were 99.3%, 88.1%, 53.8% and 99.8%, respectively. Furthermore, its positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 8.34 and 0.008, respectively. The accuracy index and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of reagent strip were 0.89 and 1054, respectively. The agreement level between urine filtration methods and urinalysis reagent strip for detecting urogenital schistosomiasis was substantial (Kappa = 0.64).This study showed that urogenital schistosomiasis was prevalent in schoolchildren in Abobo, Hassoba and Kurmuk districts. Urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence in Hassoba-bure and Kurmuk falls under low category whereas moderate in Abobo and is almost four times compared to Kurmuk and Hassoba-bure. Chemotherapy is needed in schoolchildren in such endemic areas and other measures like access to safe water, improved sanitation, hygiene, and health education should be implemented to control and prevent schistosomiasis effectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of urinalysis reagent strip were higher and could serve as alternative for mass screening of urogenital schistosomiasis, for surveillance and evaluation of schistosomiasis intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W4287510109,"Sensorimotor-based theories of cognition predict that even subtle developmental motor differences, such as those characterizing autism spectrum disorder (ASD), impact how we represent the meaning of manipulable objects (e.g., faucet ). Here, we test 85 neurotypical participants, who varied widely on the Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a measure intended to capture variability in ASD characteristics in the general adult population (participant scores were all below the clinical threshold for autism). Participants completed a visual world eyetracking task designed to assess the activation of conceptual representations of manipulable objects. Participants heard words referring to manually manipulable objects (e.g., faucet ) while we recorded their eye movements to arrays of four objects: the named object, a related object typically manipulated similarly (e.g., jar ), and two unrelated objects. Consistent with prior work, we observed more looks to the related object than to the unrelated ones (i.e., a manipulation-relatedness effect). This effect likely reflects the overlapping conceptual representations of objects sharing manipulation characteristics (e.g., faucet and jar ), due to embodied sensorimotor properties being part of their representations. Critically, we observed—among typically developed young adults—that as AQ scores increased, manipulation-relatedness effects decreased. In contrast, in a visual control condition, in which a target object was paired with related objects of a similar shape (e.g., snake and rope ), relatedness effects increased with AQ scores. The results show that AQ scores can predict variation in how object-concept representations are activated for typically developed individuals. More speculatively, they are consistent with the hypothesis that in individuals with ASD, differences in object-concept representations emerge at least in part via differences in sensorimotor experience."
https://openalex.org/W4287510123,"We study the relationships between the real-time psychophysiological activity of professional traders, their financial transactions, and market fluctuations. We collected multiple physiological signals such as heart rate, blood volume pulse, and electrodermal activity of 55 traders at a leading global financial institution during their normal working hours over a five-day period. Using their physiological measurements, we implemented a novel metric of trader's ""psychophysiological activation"" to capture affect such as excitement, stress and irritation. We find statistically significant relations between traders' psychophysiological activation levels and such as their financial transactions, market fluctuations, the type of financial products they traded, and their trading experience. We conducted post-measurement interviews with traders who participated in this study to obtain additional insights in the key factors driving their psychophysiological activation during financial risk processing. Our work illustrates that psychophysiological activation plays a prominent role in financial risk processing for professional traders."
https://openalex.org/W4287577950,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). To prevent morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), optimization of glycemic status and minimizing CVD risk factors is essential. As Nepal has limited data on these CVD risk parameters, we assessed the prevalence of poor glycemic control, CVD risk factors, and their clustering among patients with T2DM.Using a cross-sectional study design, we collected data of 366 patients with T2DM. We applied a multistage cluster sampling technique and used the WHO STEPS tools. Binary logistic and Poisson regression was applied to calculate odds and prevalence ratio of clustering of risk factors, considering P< 0.05 statistically significant.The mean age of participants was 54.5±10.7 years and 208 (57%) were male. The prevalence of poor glycemic control was 66.4% (95% C.I: 61.5-71.2). The prevalence of smoking, alcohol users, inadequate fruit and vegetables intake and physical inactivity were 18% (95% C.I:14 to 21.9), 14.8% (95% C.I:11.1 to 18.4), 98.1% (95% C.I: 96.7-99.4), and 9.8% (95% C.I:6.7-12.8), respectively. Overall, 47.3% (95% C.I: 42.1-52.4) were overweight and obese, 59% (95% C.I: 52.9-63) were hypertensive, and 68% (95% C.I: 63.2-72.7) had dyslipidemia. Clustering of two, three, four, five and more than five risk factors was 12.6%, 30%, 30%,19%, and 8.7%, respectively. Four or more risk factors clustering was significantly associated with gender, age, level of education, T2DM duration, and use of medication. Risk factors clustering was significantly higher among males and users of anti-diabetic medications with prevalence ratio of 1.14 (95% C.I:1.05-1.23) and 1.09 (95% C.I: 1.09-1.18)], respectively.The majority of the patients with T2DM had poor glycemic control and CVD risk factors. Policies and programs focused on the prevention and better management of T2DM and CVD risk factors should be implemented to reduce mortality in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W4287578486,"Age-specific and diurnal patterns of locomotory activity, can be considered as biomarkers of aging in model organisms and vary across the lifetime of individuals. Τhe Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata , is a commonly used model-species in studies regarding demography and aging. In the present study, we introduce a modification of the automated locomotory activity electronic device LAM25system (Locomotory Activity Monitor)–Trikinetics, commonly used in short time studies, to record the daily locomotory activity patterns of adult medflies throughout the life. Additionally, fecundity rates and survival of adult medflies were recorded. Male and female medflies were kept in the system tubes and had access to an agar-based gel diet, which provided water and nutrients. The locomotory activity was recorded at every minute by three monitors in the electronic device. The locomotory activity of females was higher than that of males across the different ages. For both sexes locomotory rates were high during the first 20 days of the adult life and decreased in older ages. The activity of males was high in the morning and late afternoon hours, while that of females was constantly high throughout the photophase. Negligible locomotory activity was recorded for both sexes during the nighttime. Males outlived females. Fecundity of females was higher in younger ages. Our results support the adoption of LAM25system in studies addressing aging of insects using medfly as a model organism."
https://openalex.org/W4287509944,"The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is known to be an opportunistic generalist who feeds on a wide variety of foods. Historically, their diet has been investigated by morphological observation of undigested remains in feces, requiring specialized knowledge such as osteology, zoology, and phytology. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of vertebrate 12S rRNA gene and invertebrate 16S rRNA gene to investigate their fecal contents. Additionally, we developed a blocking oligonucleotide that specifically inhibits the amplification of the canid 12S rRNA gene. We confirmed that the blocking oligonucleotide selectively inhibit the amplification of raccoon dog's DNA without significantly changing the composition of the preys' DNA. We found that the main foods of raccoon dogs in our study area, the waterside of paddy fields in Korea, were fishes such as Cyprinidae and insects such as mole crickets, which makes sense given the Korean fauna and their well-known opportunistic feeding behaviors. As a method to conveniently and objectively investigate feeding habits of raccoon dogs, this study provided baseline information on DNA metabarcoding. By using DNA metabarcoding, it is expected that the diet habits and ecology of raccoon dogs will be better understood by future research."
https://openalex.org/W4287510061,"This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence and risk factors of malaria and anaemia as well as the impact of preventive methods among pregnant women at the Akatsi South District Hospital of Ghana.A hospital based cross-sectional study using simple random sampling technique was conducted among 200 pregnant women receiving antenatal care and laboratory services at the Akatsi District Hospital from May 2016 to July 2016. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to obtain participants' malaria preventive methods in addition to demographic and gestational details. Participants' hemoglobin and malaria status were assessed using one milliliter (1 ml) whole blood collected from each participant following standard procedures. Factors that produced a p-value of ≤0.2 from the univariate model were included in the final model. Association between potential covariates and the outcomes was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. The Clopper-Pearson test statistic was used to determine the 95% confidence intervals of the outcome variables of interest. We also estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of anaemia due to malaria by substituting the adjusted relative risk estimates (RRi) (using the adjrr command in STATA) of anaemia due to malaria into the category-specific attributable formula. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy (AiP), malaria in pregnancy (MiP) and AiP/MiP comorbidity was 63.5% (95% CI:56.4-70.2), 11.0% (96% CI:7.0-16.2) and 10.5% (95% CI:6.6-15.6) respectively. Prevalence rates of AiP (66.7%) and MiP (18.5%) predominated among pregnant women aged < 20 years. PAF of AiP due to MiP was 34.5% (95% CI:23.8-43.6). High use of IPTp-SP, 64.0% (95% CI:56.9-70.6) and LLIN, 90.0% (95% CI:85.0-93.8) was observed in this study. Only 42.0% (95% CI:35.1-49.2) used repellent. Not being on the IPTp-SP program posed a 11.70 times risk of MiP (95% CI:2.32-58.96; p = 0.003) compared to pregnant women on the IPTp-SP program. Similarly, not sleeping under LLIN posed an 8.07 times risk of MiP (95% CI:1.98-32.2; p = 0.004) compared to pregnant women who slept under LLIN. Meanwhile, being positive for MiP posed a 12.10 times risk (95% CI:1.35-85.06; p = 0.025) of AiP compared to those negative for malaria whereas failure to attend ANC as scheduled posed 6.34 times risk (95% CI:1.81-22.19; p = 0.004) of AiP among the pregnant women studied.The prevalence of MiP and AiP among pregnant women in the Akatsi South District remains a great concern. High utilization of IPTp-SP and LLIN was observed with a resultant positive effect on malaria prevalence among pregnant women. Improved access to IPTp-SP and LLIN is hence encouraged to help further diminish the risk of malaria infection amongst pregnant women in the District."
https://openalex.org/W4287510112,"This paper distinguishes between local and global risk information and disaggregates risk information dissemination in the interbank market based on specified behavioural mechanisms: information disclosure and transmission, information acquisition and decision-making. It then explores the mechanisms whereby such dissemination affects risk contagion in the interbank market and verifies through computational simulations how risk information dissemination, banks' information acquisition capability, and information disclosure strategies affect risk contagion in the interbank market. The study shows that risk information dissemination markedly increases-and greater bank information acquisition capability reduces-the scope of contagion in the interbank market. Moreover, the greater the tendency of banks is to disclose positive information, the greater the mitigating effect of this information on contagion in the interbank market. In addition, market noise has a positive effect on contagion, while the risk information transmission rate has a U-shaped influence on contagion."
https://openalex.org/W4287510387,"Understanding mosquito biting behaviours is important for designing and evaluating protection methods against nuisance biting and mosquito-borne diseases (e.g. dengue, malaria and zika). We investigated the preferred biting sites by Aedes aegypti and Anopheles arabiensis on adult volunteers in standing or sleeping positions; and estimated the theoretical protection limits affordable from protective clothing or repellent-treated footwear.Adult volunteers dressed in shorts and t-shirts were exposed to infection-free laboratory-reared mosquitoes inside screened chambers from 6am to noon (for day-biting Ae. aegypti) or 6pm to midnight (night-biting An. arabiensis). Attempted bites on different body parts were recorded. Comparative observations were made on same volunteers while wearing sandals treated with transfluthrin, a vapour-phase pyrethroid that kills and repels mosquitoes.An. arabiensis bites were mainly on the lower limbs of standing volunteers (95.9% of bites below the knees) but evenly-distributed over all exposed body surfaces when the volunteers were on sleeping positions (only 28.8% bites below knees). Ae. aegypti bites were slightly concentrated on lower limbs of standing volunteers (47.7% below knees), but evenly-distributed on sleeping volunteers (23.3% below knees). Wearing protective clothing that leave only hands and head uncovered (e.g. socks + trousers + long-sleeved shirts) could theoretically prevent 78-83% of bites during sleeping, and at least 90% of bites during non-sleeping hours. If the feet are also exposed, protection declines to as low as 36.3% against Anopheles. The experiments showed that transfluthrin-treated sandals reduced An. arabiensis by 54-86% and Ae. aegypti by 32-39%, but did not change overall distributions of bites.Biting by An. arabiensis and Ae. aegypti occur mainly on the lower limbs, though this proclivity is less pronounced in the Aedes species. However, when hosts are on sleeping positions, biting by both species is more evenly-distributed over the exposed body surfaces. High personal protection might be achieved by simply wearing long-sleeved clothing, though protection against Anopheles particularly requires covering of feet and lower legs. The transfluthrin-treated footwear can reduce biting risk, especially by An. arabiensis. These findings could inform the design and use of personal protection tools (both insecticidal and non-insecticidal) against mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4287510486,"Background Few studies have analyzed the relationship between glucose variability (GV) and adverse health outcomes in patients with differences in glycemic status. The present study tests the hypothesis that GV predicts all-cause mortality regardless of glycemic status after simple adjustment (age and sex) and full adjustment (age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, use of aspirin, statins, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors, baseline FPG and average HbA1c). Methods Prospective cohort study with 795 normoglycemic patients, 233 patients with prediabetes, and 4,102 patients with type 2 diabetes. GV was measured using the coefficient of variation of fasting plasma glucose (CV-FPG) over 12 years of follow-up. The outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Results A total of 1,223 patients (657 men, 566 women) died after a median of 9.8 years of follow-up, with an all-cause mortality rate of 23.35/1,000 person-years. In prediabetes or T2DM patients, the fourth quartile of CV-FPG exerted a significant effect on all-cause mortality after simple and full adjustment. A sensitivity analysis excluding participants who died during the first year of follow-up revealed the following results for the highest quartile in the fully adjusted model: overall, HR (95%CI) = 1.54 (1.26–1.89); dysglycemia (prediabetes and T2DM), HR = 1.41 (1.15–1.73); T2DM, HR = 1.36 (1.10–1.67). Conclusion We found CV-FPG to be useful for measurement of GV. It could also be used for the prognostic stratification of patients with dysglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W4287510501,"Background Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections remain a safety concern worldwide. The prevalence in Kenya ranges from 2.6% to 4.4% among secondary school-going voluntary blood donors. This study estimated the prevalence of occult HBV infections among school-going voluntary blood donors through donations made to Kwale Satellite Blood Transfusion Center (KSBTC). Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study on data collected by the KSBTC between January 2020 and June 2021 among secondary school-going voluntary blood donors. Data were collected in MS Excel 2013 and analyzed in Epi Info 7. Descriptive statistics were calculated and we compared donors with positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to those with negative HBsAg. Crude Prevalence Odds Ratios (cPOR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to identify factors associated with positive HBsAg. Results A total of 613 records were analyzed. The mean age of the donors was 19.1 years (± 1.8 years), there were 457 males (74.5%), 502 individuals were in the age group 18–25 years (82.3%), and the mean hemoglobin level was 14.1 g/dl (±1.6 g/dl). First-time blood donors made up 84.8% of all donors (513/605) and the mean inter-donation period was 20 months (±5.8 months) for repeat donors. The sero-positivity for HBsAg was 8.8% (54/613). Age category 16–17 years with positive HBsAg were 10.2% (11/108), femaleswere10.9% (17/156), and first-time donors were 9.4% (48/513). On bivariate analyses, first-time blood donors were 1.5 times more likely to test positive for HBsAg compared to repeat donors (cPOR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.61–3.57). Females were 1.4 times more likely to test positive for HBsAg compared to male donors (cPOR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.76–2.54). Conclusions The majority of the voluntary blood donors were males and the majority of occult HBV infections came in the first-time blood donor group. We recommend increasing targeted recruitment of repeat donors by encouraging healthy first-timer donors to be regular donors, and suggest this population should be vaccinated against HBV infections."
https://openalex.org/W4287577502,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have resorted to self-adaptive mechanisms that tailor non-pharmaceutical interventions to local epidemiological and health care indicators. These mechanisms reinforce the mutual influence between containment measures and the evolution of the epidemic. To account for such interplay, we develop an epidemiological model that embeds an algorithm mimicking the self-adaptive policy mechanism effective in Italy between November 2020 and March 2022. This extension is key to tracking the historical evolution of health outcomes and restrictions in Italy. Focusing on the epidemic wave that started in mid-2021 after the diffusion of Delta, we compare the functioning of alternative mechanisms to show how the policy framework may affect the trade-off between health outcomes and the restrictiveness of mitigation measures. Mechanisms based on the reproduction number are generally highly responsive to early signs of a surging wave but entail severe restrictions. The emerging trade-off varies considerably depending on specific conditions (e.g., vaccination coverage), with less-reactive mechanisms (e.g., those based on occupancy rates) becoming more appealing in favorable contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4287577625,"Echocardiographic measures are known predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. This study compared the predictive value of such measures to that of circulating cardiac biomarkers for a composite cardiovascular disease outcome in an aging population.In this prospective population-based cohort study, echocardiography was performed at baseline together with assessments of traditional CVD risk factors and circulating cardiac biomarkers, NT-proBNP and troponin I, in 1016 individuals all aged 70 years. Assessments were repeated at ages 75 and 80. A composite CVD outcome (myocardial infarction, heart failure or ischemic stroke) was charted over 15 years. All echocardiography variables, except for the E/A ratio, were analyzed on a continuous scale.Over 10 years, left atrial (LA) diameter, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and high E/A ratio (>1.5) increased, while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remained unchanged. Using Cox proportional hazard analyses with time-updated variables for echocardiographic measures and traditional risk factors, an enlarged LA diameter and a low LVEF were independently related to incident CVD in 222 participants. The addition of LA diameter and LVEF to traditional risk factors increased the C-statistic by 1.5% (p = 0.008). However, the addition of troponin I and NT-proBNP to traditional risk factors increased the C-statistic by 3.0% (p<0.001).An enlarged LA diameter and a low LVEF improved the prediction of incident CVD compared to traditional risk factors. However, given that troponin I and NT-proBNP improved prediction to a similar extent, the use of simple blood tests to improve clinical cardiovascular disease risk prediction is only further supported by this study."
https://openalex.org/W4287577790,"Food products are often subject to information asymmetries, which are commonly supposed to be reduced by labels and certifications. However, as the number of labels increases, consumers tend to get confused, bored or impatient and stop using them to make product choices. This study uses data from a discrete choice experiment, conducted in Germany, to analyze consumers’ preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainability indicators on products that contain palm oil as an ingredient. Since information is crucial to the assessment and awareness of, or attendance to, labels on consumer products, this study assesses the effect of factual information on preferences as well as attribute-processing strategies. We use a hybrid latent variable model that allows us to jointly examine the response to the stated choice component and the responses to attribute processing questions, thus capturing attribute non-attendance (ANA) to specific labels while controlling for heterogenous preferences. Our results reveal that the attribute ‘organic’ receives the highest monetary valuation in the overall sample as well as in the information intervention, and the no-information intervention groups. The results also show that providing additional information tends to change consumers’ non-attendance patterns as well as WTP values. In particular, the information intervention tends to increase consumers’ WTP and decreases their ANA for sustainability-indicating attributes. The findings suggest that the attribute ‘organic’ has the potential to be ranked highest across the entire latent variable structure, making it the most promising attribute for promoting sustainable palm oil use across consumer groups."
https://openalex.org/W4287577844,"Just a decade ago Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action was released, catalyzing several initiatives to transform undergraduate life sciences education. Among these was the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE), a national organization commissioned to increase the adoption of Vision and Change recommendations within academic life sciences departments. PULSE activities have been designed based on the recognition that life sciences departments and faculty are embedded within institutions of higher education which, similar to other large organizations, are complex systems composed of multiple, interconnected subsystems. The organizational change research suggests that effecting large-scale changes (e.g., undergraduate STEM education transformation) may be facilitated by applying systems thinking to change efforts. In this paper we introduce the approach of systems thinking as a professional development tool to empower individual STEM faculty to effect department-level transformation. We briefly describe a professional development experience designed to increase life sciences faculty members' understanding of systems thinking, present evidence that faculty applied a systems thinking approach to initiate department-level change, and discuss the degree to which transformation efforts were perceived to be successful. Though focused on faculty in the life sciences, our findings are broadly transferable to other efforts seeking to effect change in undergraduate STEM education."
https://openalex.org/W4287578402,"Attention is a central process of cognition and influences the execution of daily tasks. In humans, different types of work require different attentional skills and sport performance is associated with the ability to attention shift. Attention towards humans varies in dogs used for different types of work. Whether this variation is due to the recruitment of individuals suitable for specific types of work, or to the characteristics of the work, remains unclear. In the present study, we hypothesized that domestic horses ( Equus caballus ) trained for different types of work would also demonstrate different attentional characteristics but we also explored other possible factors of influence such as age, sex and breed. We exposed more than sixty horses, working in 4 different disciplines, and living in two types of housing conditions, to a visual attention test (VAT) performed in the home environment. Individual attentional characteristics in the test were not significantly influenced by age, sex, breed or conditions of life but were strongly related to the type of work. Riding school horses showed longer sequences and less fragmented attention than all other horses, including sport horses living in the same conditions. Interestingly, sport performance was correlated with attention fragmentation during the test in eventing horses, which may need more attention shifting during the competitions. Working conditions may influence attention characteristics indirectly through welfare, or directly through selection and training. Our study opens new lines of thought on the determinants of animal cognition and its plasticity and constitutes a further step towards understanding the interrelationship between working conditions and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W4287578456,"Structural biology projects are highly dependent on the large-scale expression of soluble protein and, for this purpose, heterologous expression using bacteria or yeast as host systems is usually employed. In this scenario, some of the parameters to be optimized include (i) those related to the protein construct, such as the use of a fusion protein, the choice of an N-terminus fusion/tag or a C-terminus fusion/tag; (ii) those related to the expression stage, such as the concentration and selection of inducer agent and temperature expression and (iii) the choice of the host system, which includes the selection of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell and the adoption of a strain. The optimization of some of the parameters related to protein expression, stage (ii), is straightforward. On the other hand, the determination of the most suitable parameters related to protein construction requires a new cycle of gene cloning, while the optimization of the host cell is less straightforward. Here, we evaluated a scalable approach for the screening of host cells for protein expression in a structural biology pipeline. We evaluated four Escherichia coli strains looking for the best yield of soluble heterologous protein expression using the same strategy for protein construction and gene cloning and comparing it to our standard strain, Rosetta 2 (DE3). Using a liquid handling device (robot), E. coli pT-GroE, Lemo21(DE3), Arctic Express (DE3), and Rosetta Gami 2 (DE3) strains were screened for the maximal yield of soluble heterologous protein recovery. For the genes used in this experiment, the Arctic Express (DE3) strain resulted in better yields of soluble heterologous proteins. We propose that screening of host cell/strain is feasible, even for smaller laboratories and the experiment as proposed can easily be scalable to a high-throughput approach."
https://openalex.org/W4287509949,"Multiple pregnancies pose a high risk of morbidity and mortality in both mothers and infants; thus, obtaining reliable information based on a large population is essential to improve management. We used the maternal and child health statistics, which are published annually, from the database of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. The data obtained were aggregated in 5-year intervals, and we used them to analyze the proportion of the number of births for each week of pregnancy to the total of each singleton and multiple pregnancy. For perinatal health indicators (perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality), the obtained data were calculated and plotted on graphs for each week of pregnancy. Moreover, these indicators were calculated by dividing them into first twin and second twin fetuses. Stillbirth weights were aggregated in several groups, and a histogram was displayed. Between 2000 and 2019, there were 21,068,275 live births, 67,666 stillbirths, and 16,443 early neonatal deaths, excluding 7,148 (7,104 singletons, 44 multiple births) cases, in which the exact gestational weeks at birth were unknown. More than 95% of multiple pregnancies were twin births. Perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and early neonatal mortality rates in multiple pregnancies were the lowest at approximately 37 weeks of gestation and lower than those of single pregnancies at approximately 36 weeks of gestation. Perinatal mortality and stillbirth rates were higher during the delivery of the second twins than the first-born twins, but the early neonatal mortality rate remained approximately the same during the delivery of both twins. As the data in the government database are accumulated and published continuously, indicators can be calculated in the future using the method presented in this study. Further, our findings may be useful for policymaking related to managing multiple pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W4287509998,"Using synthetic pesticides to manage pests can threaten pollination services, affecting the productivity of pollination-dependent crops such as avocado. The need to mitigate this negative externality has led to the emergence of the concept of integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) to achieve both pest and pollinator management, leading to complementary or synergistic benefits for yield and quality of the harvest. This paper aims to evaluate the potential economic and welfare impact of IPPM in avocado production systems in Kenya and Tanzania. We utilize both primary and secondary data and employed the economic surplus model. On average the potential economic gain from the adoption of IPPM is US$ 66 million annually in Kenya, with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 13:1, while in Tanzania US$ 1.4 million per year, with a BCR of 34:1. The potential benefits from IPPM intervention gains are expected to reduce the number of poor people in Kenya and Tanzania by 10,464 and 1,255 people per year respectively. The findings conclude that policies that enhance the adoption of IPPM can fast-track economic development and therefore improve the livelihoods of various actors across the avocado value chain."
https://openalex.org/W4287510026,"Monitoring specific underlying causes of death in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is important in order to identify emerging trends and health challenges. This retrospective cohort study includes all SOT recipients transplanted at Rigshospitalet between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2019. The underlying cause of death was determined using the newly developed Classification of Death Causes after Transplantation (CLASS) method. Cox regression analyses assessed risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Of the 1774 SOT recipients included, 299 patients died during a total of 7511 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) with cancer (N = 57, 19%), graft rejection (N = 55, 18%) and infections (N = 52, 17%) being the most frequent causes of death. We observed a lower risk of all-cause death with increasing transplant calendar year (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96 per 1-year increase), alongside death from graft rejection (HR 0.84 per year, 95% CI 0.74-0.95) and death from infections (HR 0.86 per year, 95% CI 0.77-0.97). Further, there was a trend towards lower cumulative incidence of death from cardiovascular disease, graft failure and cancer in more recent years, while death from other organ specific and non-organ specific causes did not decrease. All-cause mortality among SOT recipients has decreased over the past decade, mainly due to a decrease in graft rejection- and infection-related deaths. Conversely, deaths from a broad range of other causes have remained unchanged, suggesting that cause of death among SOT recipients is increasingly diverse and warrants a multidisciplinary effort and attention in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4287510238,"Although computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (A/P) can provide crucial information for managing blunt trauma patients, liberal and indiscriminant imaging is expensive, can delay critical interventions, and unnecessarily exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Currently no definitive recommendations exist detailing which adult blunt trauma patients should receive A/P CT imaging and which patients may safely forego CT. Considerable benefit could be realized by identifying clinical criteria that reliably classify the risk of abdominal and pelvic injuries in blunt trauma patients. Patients identified as ""very low risk"" by such criteria would be free of significant injury, receive no benefit from imaging and therefore could be safely spared the expense and radiation exposure associated with A/P CT. The goal of this two-phase nationwide multicenter observational study is to derive and validate the use of clinical criteria to stratify the risk of injuries to the abdomen and pelvis among adult blunt trauma patients. We estimate that nation-wide implementation of a rigorously developed decision instrument could safely reduce CT imaging of adult blunt trauma patients by more than 20%, and reduce annual radiographic charges by $180 million, while simultaneously expediting trauma care and decreasing radiation exposure with its attendant risk of radiation-induced malignancy. Prior to enrollment we convened an expert panel of trauma surgeons, radiologists and emergency medicine physicians to develop a consensus definition for clinically significant abdominal and pelvic injury. In the first derivation phase of the study, we will document the presence or absence of preselected candidate criteria, as well as the presence or absence of significant abdominal or pelvic injuries in a cohort of blunt trauma victims. Using recursive partitioning, we will examine combinations of these criteria to identify an optimal ""very low risk"" subset that identifies injuries with a sensitivity exceeding 98%, excludes injury with a negative predictive value (NPV) greater than 98%, and retains the highest possible specificity and potential to decrease imaging. In Phase 2 of the study we will validate the performance of a decision rule based on these criteria among a new cohort of patients to ensure that the criteria retain high sensitivity, NPV and optimal specificity. Validating the sensitivity of the decision instrument with high statistical precision requires evaluations on 317 blunt trauma patients who have significant abdominal-pelvic injuries, which will in turn require evaluations on approximately 6,340 blunt trauma patients. We will estimate potential reductions in CT imaging by counting the number of abdominal-pelvic CT scans performed on ""very low risk"" patients. Reductions in charges and radiation exposure will be determined by respectively summing radiographic charges and lifetime decreases in radiation morbidity and mortality for all ""very low risk"" cases.

https://openalex.org/W4287510255,"Background Star Rating Assessment (SRA) was initiated in 2015 in Tanzania aiming at improving the quality of services provided in Primary Healthcare (PHC) facilities. Social accountability (SA) is among the 12 assessment areas of SRA tools. We aimed to assess the SA performance and its predictors among PHC facilities in Tanzania based on findings of a nationwide reassessment conducted in 2017/18. Methods We used the SRA database with results of 2017/2018 to perform a cross-sectional secondary data analysis on SA dataset. We used proportions to determine the performance of the following five SA indicators: functional committees/boards, display of information on available resources, addressing local concerns, health workers’ engagement with local community, and involvement of community in facility planning process. A facility needed four indicators to be qualified as socially accountable. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine facilities characteristics associated with SA, namely location (urban or rural), ownership (private or public) and level of service (hospital, health centre or dispensary). Results We included a total of 3,032 PHC facilities of which majority were dispensaries (86.4%), public-owned (76.3%), and located in rural areas (76.0%). On average, 30.4% of the facilities were socially accountable; 72.0% engaged with local communities; and 65.5% involved communities in facility planning process. Nevertheless, as few as 22.5% had functional Health Committees/Boards. A facility was likely to be socially-accountable if public-owned [AOR 5.92; CI: 4.48–7.82, p = 0.001], based in urban areas [AOR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01–1.53, p = 0.038] or operates at a level higher than Dispensaries (Health centre or Hospital levels) Conclusion Most of the Tanzanian PHC facilities are not socially accountable and therefore much effort in improving the situation should be done. The efforts should target the lower-level facilities, private-owned and rural-based PHC facilities. Regional authorities must capacitate facility committees/boards and ensure guidelines on SA are followed."
https://openalex.org/W4287577344,"Modern slot machines are among the more harmful forms of gambling. Psychophysiological measures may provide a window into mental processes that underpin these harms. Here we investigated pupil dilation derived from eye tracking as a means of capturing changes in sympathetic nervous system arousal following outcomes on a real slot machine. We hypothesized that positively reinforcing slot machine outcomes would be associated with increases in arousal, reflected in larger pupil diameter. We further examined the contribution of game luminance fluctuations on pupil diameter. In Experiment 1A, experienced slot machine gamblers (N = 53) played a commercially-available slot machine in a laboratory for 20 minutes while wearing mobile eye tracking glasses. Analyses differentiated loss outcomes, wins, losses-disguised-as-wins, and (free-spin) bonus features. Bonus features were associated with rapid increases in pupil diameter following the onset of outcome-related audiovisual feedback, relative to losses. In Experiment 1B, luminance data were extracted from captured screen videos (derived from Experiment 1A) to characterize on-screen luminance changes that could modulate pupil diameter. Bonus features and wins were associated with pronounced and complex fluctuations in screen luminance (≈50 L and ≈25L, respectively). However, the pupil dilation that was observed to bonus features in Experiment 1A coincided temporally with only negligible changes in screen luminance, providing partial evidence that the pupil dilation to bonus features may be due to arousal. In Experiment 2, 12 participants viewed pairs of stimuli (scrambled slot machine images) at luminance difference thresholds of ≈25L, ≈50L, and ≈100L. Scrambled images presented at luminance differences of ≈25L and greater were sufficient to cause pupillary responses. Overall, pupillometry may detect event-related changes in sympathetic nervous system arousal following gambling outcomes, but researchers must pay careful attention to substantial in-game luminance changes that may confound arousal-based interpretations."

Moreover, it introduces resources and risk as two factors to form significant weights and then designs a fair profit distribution mechanism of the supply chain according to the weights. Finally, this paper solves the optimal solution of the profit distribution coefficient by using fair entropy. Research results find that the distribution according to the optimal profit distribution coefficient can maximize the profit of each actor and achieves the matching of returns and inputs. Therefore, this paper puts forward some suggestions that include establishing a precise distribution mechanism based on contracts or property rights definitions, considering the cost and importance weight of each actor’s input when formulating the profit distribution coefficient, and paying attention to information sharing."
https://openalex.org/W4287577643,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and poor nutritional status are growing health problems in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Moreover, violence against women has been shown to be associated with poor nutrition. This study investigated the relationship between IPV and nutritional status (i.e., underweight, overweight, and obesity) among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in Zimbabwe.Pooled data from the 2005/2006, 2010/2011, and 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic Health Surveys (ZDHS) on 13,008 married/cohabiting women were analysed. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between the various forms of IPV and the nutritional status of women. We further estimated the prevalence of BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 (overweight and obesity) by intimate partner violence type.The mean BMI of women was 24.3 kg/m2, more than one-fifth (24%) were overweight and about 12% were obese. Forty-three percent (43%) of women reported to have ever experienced at least one form of intimate partner violence. More than one-third (35%) of women who reported to have ever experienced at least one form of intimate partner violence had a BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 (p< 0.01). Relative to normal weight, women who had ever experienced at least one form of IPV (i.e., physical, emotional, or sexual) were more likely to be obese (aOR = 2.59; 95% CI = 1.05-6.39). Women's exposure to any form of intimate partner violence was not significantly associated with the likelihood of being underweight or overweight relative to normal weight.The study findings show that women of reproductive age in Zimbabwe are at high risk of both IPV and excess weight. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between exposure to at least one form IPV and obesity. Public health interventions that target the well-being, empowerment and development of women are needed to address the complex issue of IPV and adverse health outcomes, including obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4287577831,"Restrictions, social isolation, and uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the ways that parents and children maintain family routines, health, and wellbeing. Companion animals (pets) can be a critical source of comfort during traumatic experiences, although changes to family routines, such as those caused by COVID-19, can also bring about challenges like managing undesirable pet behaviours or pet-human interactions. We aimed to examine the relationship between pet attachment and mental health for both parents and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. A total of 1,034 parents living with a child under 18 years and a cat or dog completed an online cross-sectional survey between July and October 2020. Path analysis using multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine associations between objective COVID-19 impacts, subjective worry about COVID-19, human-pet attachment, and mental health. After adjusting for core demographic factors, stronger pet-child attachment was associated with greater child anxiety (parent-reported, p < .001). Parent-pet attachment was not associated with self-reported psychological distress (p = .42), however, parents who reported a strong emotional closeness with their pet reported greater psychological distress (p = .002). Findings highlight the role of pets during times of change and uncertainty. It is possible that families are turning to animals as a source of comfort, during a time when traditional social supports are less accessible. Alternatively, strong pet attachment is likely to reflect high levels of empathy, which might increase vulnerability to psychological distress. Longitudinal evidence is required to delineate the mechanisms underpinning pet attachment and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W4287578669,"The unintentional movement of agronomic pests and pathogens is steadily increasing due to the intensification of global trade. Being able to identify accurately and rapidly early stages of an invasion is critical for developing successful eradication or management strategies. For most invasive organisms, molecular diagnostics is today the method of choice for species identification. However, the currently implemented tools are often developed for certain taxa and need to be adapted for new species, making them ill-suited to cope with the current constant increase in new invasive species. To alleviate this impediment, we developed a fast and accurate sequencing tool allowing to modularly obtain genetic information at different taxonomical levels. Using whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing, our workflow does not require any a priori knowledge on the investigated species and its classification. While mainly focusing on harmful plant pathogenic insects, we also demonstrate the suitability of our workflow for the molecular identification of bacteria (Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli), fungi (Cladosporium herbarum, Colletotrichum salicis, Neofabraea alba) and nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis). On average, the pairwise identity between the generated consensus sequences and best GenBank BLAST matches was 99.6 ± 0.6%. Additionally, assessing the generated insect genomic dataset, the potential power of the workflow to detect pesticide resistance genes, as well as arthropod-infecting viruses and endosymbiotic bacteria is demonstrated."

This study aims to assess if gastric adenocarcinoma after treatment for HL/TC (t-GC) is molecularly different from gastric adenocarcinoma in the general population.Patients were diagnosed with t-GC ≥5 years after treatment for HL/TC. Four molecular subtypes were identified using immunohistochemical and molecular analyses: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability (MSI), aberrant p53 staining as surrogate for chromosomal instability (sCIN), and a surrogate for genomic stability (sGS) without these aberrations. Results were compared with gastric cancer in the general population (p-GC) described in literature.Molecular subtyping of 90 t-GCs resulted in 3% EBV, 8% MSI, 36% sCIN and 53% sGS. 3/6 of MSI t-GCs had MLH1 promoter methylation and 2/6 were explained by double somatic mutations in MMR genes. T-GCs were more frequently sGS than p-GCs (53% vs. 38%, p = 0.04). T-GC was more frequently sGS in HL/TC patients diagnosed before 1990, than after 1990 (63% vs. 38%, p = 0.03). T-GCs located in the antrum, an area that receives high irradiation doses, were more frequently sGS (61% vs. 28% in p-GCs, p = 0.02).Our results demonstrate that t-GCs are more frequently of the sGS subtype than p-GCs. An association of t-GC of the sGS subtype with prior anticancer treatment is suggested by the high frequency in HL/TC patients who were treated before 1990, a time period in which HL/TC treatments were more extensive."

Our results showed immunomagnetic adsorption, acted by affinity interactions with the immobilized monoclonal antibody, offered higher antigen adsorption and desorption capacities as compared with the commercially available immunoaffinity sorbents. Four different ligand densities of the Hep-1 monoclonal antibody were examined during covalent immobilization on Pyridyl Disulfide-functionalized magnetosome nanoparticles for HBsAg immunomagnetic separation. The average of adsorption capacity was measured as 3 mg/ml in optimized immunomagnetic sorbent (1.056 mg rHBsAg/ml immunomagneticsorbent/5.5 mg of total purified protein) and 5mg/ml in immunoaffinity sorbent (0.876 mg rHBsAg/ml immunosorbent/5.5 mg total purified protein during 8 runs. Immunomagnetic sorbent demonstrated ligand leakage levels below 3 ng Mab/Ag rHBsAg during 12 consecutive cycles of immunomagnetic separation (IMS). The results suggest that an immunomagnetic sorbent with a lower ligand density (LD = 3 mg Mab/ml matrix) could be the best substitute for the immunosorbent used in affinity purification of r-HBsAg there are significant differences in the ligand density (98.59% (p-value = 0.0182)), adsorption capacity (97.051% (p-value = 0.01834)), desorption capacity (96.06% (p-value = 0.036)) and recovery (98.97% (p-value = 0.0231)). This study indicates that the immunosorbent approach reduces the cost of purification of Hep-1 protein up to 50% as compared with 5 mg Mab/ml immunoaffinity sorbent, which is currently used in large-scale production. As well, these results demonstrate that bacterial magnetosome nanoparticles (BMs) represent a promising alternative product for the economical and efficient immobilization of proteins and the immunomagnetic separation of Biomolecules, promoting innovation in downstream processing."
https://openalex.org/W4287509800,"Due to the weak monitoring equipment for low- and medium-pressure gas pipelines, it is not easy to identify small flow leaks. The detection methods are mostly traditional manual inspections or night pressure-maintaining leak detection methods, which cannot be automatically monitored and sensed immediately. The abnormal fluctuations in client traffic caused by pipeline leaks studied in this paper can locate and detect leak locations more effectively. This paper analyzes the theoretical formula of leakage location based on flow data and finds out how to use the abnormal fluctuation of user-side flow to detect and locate gas pipeline leakage. First of all, this article uses the simulation software Pipeline Studio to construct the medium and low-pressure pipeline model. On this basis, 6 sets of leakage conditions were designed and simulated dynamically. Finally, the simulation results are analyzed, and the results show that: 1) The advisable monitoring period for monitoring abnormal fluctuations of user-side traffic is 10s. 2) There are two relationships between abnormal flow fluctuations and leakage position. They are: when the leakage point is at the first 40% of the relative distance from the gas source, the disturbance amplitude first increases and then decreases, and at the last 60%, it continues to decrease.; The closer the leak is to the user end, the more significant the abnormal flow fluctuations will be. On the contrary, the smaller the abnormal flow fluctuations will be; 3) No matter where the leakage occurs, the abnormal flow fluctuations in the 2nd and 3rd seconds after the leak occurs tend to be consistent. The proposal of the advisable monitoring period and the relationship between abnormal fluctuations of flow and the location of leakage provides a theoretical basis for the use of abnormal fluctuations of user-side flow for gas pipeline leakage detection and location."
https://openalex.org/W4287509808,"More than 30 types of amyloids are linked to close to 50 diseases in humans, the most prominent being Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is brain-related local amyloidosis, while another amyloidosis, such as AA amyloidosis, tends to be more systemic. Therefore, we need to know more about the biological entities' influencing these amyloidosis processes. However, there is currently no support system developed specifically to handle this extraordinarily complex and demanding task. To acquire a systematic view of amyloidosis and how this may be relevant to the brain and other organs, we needed a means to explore ""amyloid network systems"" that may underly processes that leads to an amyloid-related disease. In this regard, we developed the DES-Amyloidoses knowledgebase (KB) to obtain fast and relevant information regarding the biological network related to amyloid proteins/peptides and amyloid-related diseases. This KB contains information obtained through text and data mining of available scientific literature and other public repositories. The information compiled into the DES-Amyloidoses system based on 19 topic-specific dictionaries resulted in 796,409 associations between terms from these dictionaries. Users can explore this information through various options, including enriched concepts, enriched pairs, and semantic similarity. We show the usefulness of the KB using an example focused on inflammasome-amyloid associations. To our knowledge, this is the only KB dedicated to human amyloid-related diseases derived primarily through literature text mining and complemented by data mining that provides a novel way of exploring information relevant to amyloidoses."

Thus, body perceptions seem to play an important role for analgesia. Conversely, pain may also affect bodily perceptions. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of clinical and/or experimental pain on perceived hand size in fibromyalgia patients (FM) and healthy controls (HC).To investigate the effects of chronic and/or acute pain on size perception we compared hand size estimates of 35 HC and 32 FM patients at baseline and during tonic mechanical pain stimuli applied to one ear lobe. Mechanical stimuli were adjusted for each individual pain sensitivity to achieve a rating of 4 ± 1 VAS (0-10) units. Photographs of each subject's hands were digitally manipulated to produce a monotonic series of 5 images larger and 6 smaller than actual size which were then presented to the participants in ascending and descending order (total number of images: 12).FM and HC participants' clinical pain ratings at baseline were 3.3 (3.1) and .3 (.8) VAS units, respectively. At baseline, FM participants selected significantly smaller hand images than HC as representative of their actual size (p < .02). During application of tonic experimental pain, the image size chosen to represent their actual hand size decreased significantly in FM participants and HC (p < .001) but this decrease was not different between groups (p > .05). Hand size estimates of FM participants correlated negatively with their clinical pain ratings (p < .04).The decreased hand size perception of FM patients and HC was associated with their clinical and/or experimental pain, supporting the hypothesis that pain can result in visual body distortions."
https://openalex.org/W4287509918,"Video monitoring is a rapidly evolving tool in aquatic ecological research because of its non-destructive ability to assess fish assemblages. Nevertheless, methodological considerations of video monitoring techniques are often overlooked, especially in more complex sampling designs, causing inefficient data collection, processing, and interpretation. In this study, we discuss how video transect sampling designs could be assessed and how the inter-observer variability, design errors and sampling variability should be quantified and accounted for. The study took place in the coastal areas of the Galapagos archipelago and consisted of a hierarchical repeated-observations sampling design with multiple observers. Although observer bias was negligible for the assessment of fish assemblage structure, diversity and counts of individual species, sampling variability caused by simple counting/detection errors, observer effects and instantaneous fish displacement was often important. Especially for the counts of individual species, sampling variability most often exceeded the variability of the transects and sites. An extensive part of the variability in the fish assemblage structure was explained by the different transects (13%), suggesting that a sufficiently high number of transects is required to account for the within-location variability. Longer transect lengths allowed a better representation of the fish assemblages as sampling variability decreased by 33% if transect length was increased from 10 to 50 meters. However, to increase precision, including more repeats was typically more efficient than using longer transect lengths. The results confirm the suitability of the technique to study reef fish assemblages, but also highlight the importance of a sound methodological assessment since different biological responses and sampling designs are associated with different levels of sampling variability, precision and ecological relevance. Therefore, besides the direct usefulness of the results, the procedures to establish them may be just as valuable for researchers aiming to optimize their own sampling technique and design."

Motion capture and tracking based on an Artificial Neural Network, complemented by a Particle Image Velocimetry system to map out water velocity fields, were utilized to analyze the motion of a live specimen in a laboratory aquarium. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on flow fields and pressure fields, based on digital models of S. rhinocerous, were also performed. These simulations were compared to analogous simulations employing models of the sympatric, large-eyed troglophile cavefish S. angustiporus. Features of the cavefish swimming behavior deduced from the both live-specimen experiments and simulations included average swimming velocities and three dimensional trajectories, estimates for drag coefficients and potential lateral line sensing distances, and mapping of the flow field around the fish. As expected, typical S. rhinocerous swimming speeds were relatively slow. The lateral line sensing distance was approximately 0.25 body lengths, which may explain the observation that specimen introduced to a new environment tend to swim parallel and near to the walls. Three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that just upstream from the region under the supra-occipital horn the equipotential of the water pressure and velocity fields are nearly vertical. Results support the hypothesis that the conspicuous cranial horn of S. rhinocerous may lead to greater stimulus of the lateral line compared to fish that do not possess such morphology."

A self-administered questionnaire using a 6-point Likert scale approach was adopted to collect the responses from 176 employees. Quantitative analysis was done using SPSS, and SMART-PLS3 were used for was used to comprehend the objectives of the research. The findings indicate that age diversity, diversity beliefs, and leadership expertise have a statistically significant impact on organisational performance. Moreover, moderating variable diversity belief did not affect organisational performance, but leadership expertise plays a significant mediating role in organisational performance. Our study provides critical theoretical contributions to research diversity and organisational performance in Pakistan and examines the impact of workforce diversity on organisational performance with leadership expertise as mediator and diversity beliefs as a moderator."
https://openalex.org/W4287510401,"Portable breath ketone sensors may help people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) avoid episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis; however, the design features preferred by users have not been studied. We aimed to elucidate breath sensor design preferences of young people with T1DM (age 12 to 16) and their parents to inform the development of a breath ketone sensor prototype that would best suit their diabetes management needs.To elicit foundational experiences from which design preference ideas could be generated, two commercially available breath ketone sensors, designed for ketogenic diet monitoring, were explored over one week by ten young people with T1DM. Participants interacted with the breath ketone sensing devices, and undertook blood ketone testing, at least twice daily for five days to simulate use within a real life and ambulatory care setting. Semi-structured interviews were conducted post-testing with the ten young participants and their caregivers (n = 10) to elicit preferences related to breath sensor design and use, and to inform the co-design of a breath ketone sensor prototype for use in T1DM self-management. We triangulated our data collection with key informant interviews with two diabetes educators working in pediatric care about their perspectives related to young people using breath ketone sensors.Participants acknowledged the non-invasiveness of breath sensors as compared to blood testing. Affordability, reliability and accuracy were identified as prerequisites for breath ketone sensors used for diabetes management. Design features valued by young people included portability, ease of use, sustainability, readability and suitability for use in public. The time required to use breath sensors was similar to that for blood testing. The requirement to maintain a 10-second breath exhalation posed a challenge for users. Diabetes educators highlighted the ease of use of breath devices especially for young people who tended to under-test using blood ketone strips.Breath ketone sensors for diabetes management have potential that may facilitate ketone testing in young people. Our study affirms features for young people that drive usability of breath sensors among this population, and provides a model of user preference assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4287510443,"Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis are bacterial species which frequently co-colonise the nasopharynx, but can also transit to the middle ear to cause otitis media. Chronic otitis media is often associated with a polymicrobial infection by these bacteria. However, despite being present in polymicrobial infections, the molecular interactions between these bacterial species remain poorly understood. We have previously reported competitive interactions driven by pH and growth phase between H . influenzae and S . pneumoniae . In this study, we have revealed competitive interactions between the three otopathogens, which resulted in reduction of H . influenzae viability in co-culture with S . pneumoniae and in triple-species culture. Transcriptomic analysis by mRNA sequencing identified a central role of arginine in mediating these interactions. Arginine supplementation was able to increase H . influenzae survival in a dual-species environment with S . pneumoniae , and in a triple-species environment. Arginine was used by H . influenzae for ATP production, and levels of ATP generated in dual- and triple-species co-culture at early stages of growth were significantly higher than the combined ATP levels of single-species cultures. These results indicate a central role for arginine-mediated ATP production by H . influenzae in the polymicrobial community."
https://openalex.org/W4287577402,"Since the beginning of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a focus of research has been to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19-related outcomes, such as testing and diagnosis, and use them to build prediction models. Existing studies have used data from digital surveys or electronic health records (EHRs), but very few have linked the two sources to build joint predictive models. In this study, we used survey data on 7,054 patients from the Michigan Genomics Initiative biorepository to evaluate how well self-reported data could be integrated with electronic records for the purpose of modeling COVID-19-related outcomes. We observed that among survey respondents, self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis captured a larger number of cases than the corresponding EHRs, suggesting that self-reported outcomes may be better than EHRs for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from controls. In the modeling context, we compared the utility of survey- and EHR-derived predictor variables in models of survey-reported COVID-19 testing and diagnosis. We found that survey-derived predictors produced uniformly stronger models than EHR-derived predictors-likely due to their specificity, temporal proximity, and breadth-and that combining predictors from both sources offered no consistent improvement compared to using survey-based predictors alone. Our results suggest that, even though general EHRs are useful in predictive models of COVID-19 outcomes, they may not be essential in those models when rich survey data are already available. The two data sources together may offer better prediction for COVID severity, but we did not have enough severe cases in the survey respondents to assess that hypothesis in in our study."
https://openalex.org/W4287577422,"Metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) are essential epigenetic regulators; their molecular and pharmacological roles in medically critical diseases such as neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration, and cancer are being studied globally. HDAC2’s differential expression in the central nervous system makes it an appealing therapeutic target for chronic neurological diseases like autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we identified H3R inhibitor molecules that are computationally effective at binding to the HDAC2 metal-coordinated binding site. The study highlights the importance of pitolisant in screening the potential H3R inhibitors by using a hybrid workflow of ligand and receptor-based drug discovery. The screened lead compounds with PubChem SIDs 103179850, 103185945, and 103362074 show viable binding with HDAC2 in silico . The importance of ligand contacts with the Zn 2+ ion in the HDAC2 catalytic site is also discussed and investigated for a significant role in enzyme inhibition. The proposed H3R inhibitors 103179850, 103185945, and 103362074 are estimated as dual-active molecules to block the HDAC2-mediated deacetylation of the EAAT2 gene (SLC1A2) and H3R-mediated synaptic transmission irregularity and are, therefore, open for experimental validation."
https://openalex.org/W4287578171,"Background Patients should be active participants in the management of their condition and provided with appropriate information throughout their care pathway. We piloted an online digital platform (ODP) to deliver patient education and support (PES) for patients undergoing total hip (THR) and knee replacements (TKR). The aim of this study is to analyse the demographics of patients using the ODP, determine how and when they accessed the ODP and how different sexes and age groups interacted with the ODP. Methods Demographics and program library logs for patients registered to the ODP between 21 st September 2017 and 28 th May 2020 was obtained. Associations between age, sex, type of surgery and engagement were assessed using statistical comparisons. Results 1195 patients were registered on the ODP of which 832 (69.6%) accessed their carepacs. Patients accessed the content within their carepacs a mean of 29.1 times, spending a mean total time of 83 minutes. There was greater engagement for patients with a THR carepac (75.5%) compared to TKR (63.8%) (p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in the proportion of patients that accessed the ODP or the total time spent on the platform dependent upon age (p = 0.34). Females accessed the platform more than males (p = 0.03). The use of a computer to access the ODP increased as age increased, whereas the use of a phone was favoured by the younger age groups (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion An ODP providing information to patients regarding their surgery is effective and demonstrates high levels of patient engagement. An online resource such as this does not discriminate against age or sex in terms of accessibility and can be useful for information provision."
https://openalex.org/W4287578220,"Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) are a useful tool for making inferences about demographic history. For example, researchers typically apply BSPs to test hypotheses regarding how climate changes have influenced intraspecific genetic diversity over time. Like any method, BSP has assumptions that may be violated in some empirical systems (e.g., the absence of population genetic structure), and the naïve analysis of data collected from these systems may lead to spurious results. To address these issues, we introduce P2C2M.Skyline, an R package designed to assess model adequacy for BSPs using posterior predictive simulation. P2C2M.Skyline uses a phylogenetic tree and the log file output from Bayesian Skyline analyses to simulate posterior predictive datasets and then compares this null distribution to statistics calculated from the empirical data to check for model violations. P2C2M.Skyline was able to correctly identify model violations when simulated datasets were generated assuming genetic structure, which is a clear violation of BSP model assumptions. Conversely, P2C2M.Skyline showed low rates of false positives when models were simulated under the BSP model. We also evaluate the P2C2M.Skyline performance in empirical systems, where we detected model violations when DNA sequences from multiple populations were lumped together. P2C2M.Skyline represents a user-friendly and computationally efficient resource for researchers aiming to make inferences from BSP."
https://openalex.org/W4287578380,"Local communities’ perspectives on mining businesses are a matter of endless debate, particularly in developing countries. If misunderstood or mismanaged by authorities (local and national), these perspectives may lead to violent and deadly reactions, which are unaffordable given the tremendous contribution of mining businesses to socio-economic development. The recurrence of these violent events means that authorities and mining businesses may have been failing to understand the dynamic of local people’s expectations. Here, to explain the complexity of the interactions of local people with mine businesses, we collected socio-economic data along with data on people’s satisfaction levels towards the services delivered by a local mining business in the Mose Kotane Local Municipality in South Africa. Data collected were analyzed by fitting a Structural Equation Model (SEM). We found that only 4–8% of communities’ expectations were met by the local mine business, and that closest communities to the mine do not benefit significantly more services than away-communities (Chi-square = 2.71, df = 4, P = 0.60). However, the proportion of moderately satisfied people (in relation to the services delivered by the mine) tends to increase when moving away from the mine while the proportion of dissatisfied people decreases. Our SEM, linking socio-economic data to communities’ perspectives, shows a good fit (Fisher C value = 0; P = 1.00, n = 158). In communities away from the mine, residents who were initially happy about the establishment of the mining business tend to be satisfied with the services delivered by the mine (β = 2.69±0.41, P&lt;0.001) but these residents are likely to be employed people (P&lt;0.05). In communities close to the mine, large-sized households tend to be satisfied with the mine-delivered services (P = 0.04). This is potentially due to the fact that a large household is more likely to have at least one person working for the mine. Collectively, these findings reveal how socio-economic variables determine people’s perspectives on the mining business."
https://openalex.org/W4287578450,"Hypothesis To develop and validate the optimal design and evaluate accuracy of individualized 3D- printed surgical guides for cochlear implantation. Background Positioning and fixation of the cochlear implant (CI) are commonly performed free hand. Applications of 3-dimensional (3D) technology now allow us to make patient specific, bone supported surgical guides, to aid CI surgeons with precise placement and drilling out the bony well which accommodates the receiver/stimulator device of the CI. Methods Cone beam CT (CBCT) scans were acquired from temporal bones in 9 cadaveric heads (18 ears), followed by virtual planning of the CI position. Surgical, bone-supported drilling guides were designed to conduct a minimally invasive procedure and were 3D-printed. Fixation screws were used to keep the guide in place in predetermined bone areas. Specimens were implanted with 3 different CI models. After implantation, CBCT scans of the implanted specimens were performed. Accuracy of CI placement was assessed by comparing the 3D models of the planned and implanted CI’s by calculating the translational and rotational deviations. Results Median translational deviations of placement in the X- and Y-axis were within the predetermined clinically relevant deviation range (&lt; 3 mm per axis); median translational deviation in the Z-axis was 3.41 mm. Median rotational deviations of placement for X-, Y- and Z-rotation were 5.50°, 4.58° and 3.71°, respectively. Conclusion This study resulted in the first 3D-printed, patient- and CI- model specific surgical guide for positioning during cochlear implantation. The next step for the development and evaluation of this surgical guide will be to evaluate the method in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4287578571,"International research has shown that live sports commentary exhibits racial bias. Specifically, non-White players are more likely to be praised in terms of their physicality, while White players are more likely to be praised in terms of their intellect and character. The current study, which utilised a quantitative content analysis design, examined whether the speech of AFL commentators exhibited racial bias. The study randomly selected 50 men's AFL game quarters from the 2019 AFL season and analysed 1368 applicable statements directed at 382 unique players. Based on prior research, a coding instrument was developed that incorporated three main categories (physical, cognitive, and character attributes), and six subcategories (physical ability, appearance, cognitive ability, intelligence, general character, and hard work). In contrast to the international literature, findings revealed that there were no significant between-race differences for each main attribute category. However, non-White players received a higher proportion of statements related to their physical ability, and a lower proportion of statements related to their appearance compared to White players. Non-White players also received a higher proportion of negative statements related to their cognitive ability compared to White players. There was no evidence found to suggest that players of any race were discussed in terms of their physical ability being innate, natural, or instinctual. Given the strong, but also dated, evidence showing racial bias within both American and European sports commentary, the current study provides only weak evidence for the existence of racial bias within contemporary AFL live commentary."
