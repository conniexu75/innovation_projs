Studies of episodes of marine and terrestrial biotic interchange that have occurred during the last 20 million years show that large-scale extinction of species before the onset of interchange renders biotas especially prone to invasion. As environments and species are being exploited and eliminated on an ever increasing scale in the human-dominated biosphere, the geographical expansion of species from biotas in which evolution of high competitive, defensive, and reproductive abilities has proceeded the furthest will become more frequent. Historical events and interactions are essential ingredients for understanding the current and future structure and composition of the world's biota."

Yet because of the susceptibility of the filaments to damage from traditional methods for the preparation of ceramics, vapor-phase infiltration has become the fabrication method of choice. The chemical vapor infiltration methods for producing these composites are now being studied in earnest, with the complexity of filament weaves and deposition chemistry being merged with standard heat and mass-transport relationships. Two of the most influential effects on the mechanical properties of these materials are the adhesion and frictional force between the fibers and the matrix, which can be controlled by a tailored interface coating. A variety of materials are available for producing these composites including carbide, nitride, boride, and oxide filaments and matrices. Silicon carbide-based materials are by far the most advanced and are already being used in aerospace applications."

https://openalex.org/W1974156084,"Metallic filaments with submicrometer diametere have been fabricated. Standard diffraction techniques with conventional x-ray sources were unsuccessful in identifying the structure of these materials. However, with the use of synchrotron radiation produced on a wiggler beam line, diffraction data were obtained in measurement periods as short as 10 milliseconds. Two cylindrical single crystals of bismuth were studied, each with a diameter of 0.22 +/- 0.02 micrometer. The volume of sample illuminated for these measurements was 0.38 cubic micrometer, less than 0.5 femtoliter. The crystals are grown in glass capillaries, and, because bismuth expands on solidification, they are under a residual hoop stress. The crystallographic data indicate the presence of a linear compressive strain of about 2 percent, which is assumed to be the result of a residual stress of about 2 gigapascals."
