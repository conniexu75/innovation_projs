https://openalex.org/W2014149181,"Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal parasite and the causative agent of amoebiasis, which is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Here we present the genome of E. histolytica, which reveals a variety of metabolic adaptations shared with two other amitochondrial protist pathogens: Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis. These adaptations include reduction or elimination of most mitochondrial metabolic pathways and the use of oxidative stress enzymes generally associated with anaerobic prokaryotes. Phylogenomic analysis identifies evidence for lateral gene transfer of bacterial genes into the E. histolytica genome, the effects of which centre on expanding aspects of E. histolytica's metabolic repertoire. The presence of these genes and the potential for novel metabolic pathways in E. histolytica may allow for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. The genome encodes a large number of novel receptor kinases and contains expansions of a variety of gene families, including those associated with virulence. Additional genome features include an abundance of tandemly repeated transfer-RNA-containing arrays, which may have a structural function in the genome. Analysis of the genome provides new insights into the workings and genome evolution of a major human pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2044886875,"Development of immature T-cell precursors (thymocytes) to either the CD4 helper or CD8 killer T-cell lineages correlates precisely with their T-cell receptor specificity for major histocompatibility complex class II or class I molecules, respectively, indicating that the process is carefully regulated. Although intensively studied owing to its importance in determining the composition of the mature T-cell compartment and as a general model of binary lineage decisions, the underlying molecular pathways remain obscure. We have previously reported a spontaneous mouse mutant (HD (helper deficient) mice) in which lineage commitment is specifically perturbed without affecting positive selection. Here we show that a point mutation in the zinc finger transcription factor Th-POK (T-helper-inducing POZ/Krüppel-like factor) is responsible for redirection of class-II-restricted thymocytes to the CD8 lineage in HD mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that constitutive expression of this factor during thymic development leads to redirection of class-I-restricted thymocytes to the CD4 lineage, indicating that Th-POK is a master regulator of lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2160194426,"Covalent bonding is commonly described by Lewis's theory1, with an electron pair shared between two atoms constituting one full bond. Beginning with the valence bond description2 for the hydrogen molecule, quantum chemists have further explored the fundamental nature of the chemical bond for atoms throughout the periodic table, confirming that most molecules are indeed held together by one electron pair for each bond. But more complex binding may occur when large numbers of atomic orbitals can participate in bond formation. Such behaviour is common with transition metals. When involving heavy actinide elements, metal–metal bonds might prove particularly complicated. To date, evidence for actinide–actinide bonds is restricted to the matrix-isolation3 of uranium hydrides, including H2U–UH2, and the gas-phase detection4 and preliminary theoretical study5 of the uranium molecule, U2. Here we report quantum chemical calculations on U2, showing that, although the strength of the U2 bond is comparable to that of other multiple bonds between transition metals, the bonding pattern is unique. We find that the molecule contains three electron-pair bonds and four one-electron bonds (that is, 10 bonding electrons, corresponding to a quintuple bond), and two ferromagnetically coupled electrons localized on one U atom each—so all known covalent bonding types are contributing."
https://openalex.org/W2124241220,"Presynaptic, plasma membrane serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) transporters (SERTs) clear 5-HT following vesicular release and are regulated through trafficking-dependent pathways. Recently, we (Zhu, C.-B., Hewlett, W. A., Feoktistov, I., Biaggioni, I., and Blakely, R. D. (2004) Mol. Pharmacol. 65, 1462–1474) provided evidence for a trafficking-independent mode of SERT regulation downstream of adenosine receptor (AR) activation that is sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibitors. Here, we probe this pathway in greater detail, demonstrating elevation of 5-HT transport by multiple p38 MAPK activators (anisomycin, H2O2, and UV radiation), in parallel with p38 MAPK phosphorylation, as well as suppression of anisomycin stimulation by p38 MAPK siRNA treatments. Studies with transporter-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells reveal that SERT stimulation is shared with the human norepinephrine transporter but not the human dopamine transporter. Saturation kinetic analyses of anisomycin-SERT activity reveal a selective reduction in 5-HT Km supported by a commensurate increase in 5-HT potency (Ki) for displacing surface antagonist binding. Anisomycin treatments that stimulate SERT activity do not elevate surface SERT surface density whereas stimulation is lost with preexposure of cells to the surface-SERT inactivating reagent, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methane thiosulfonate. Guanylyl cyclase (1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one) and protein kinase G inhibitors (H8, DT-2) block AR stimulation of SERT yet fail to antagonize SERT stimulation by anisomycin. We thus place p38 MAPK activation downstream of protein kinase G in a SERT-catalytic regulatory pathway, distinct from events controlling SERT surface density. In contrast, the activity of protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors (fostriecin and calyculin A) to attenuate anisomycin stimulation of 5-HT transport suggests that protein phosphatase 2A is a critical component of the pathway responsible for p38 MAPK up-regulation of SERT catalytic activity.

In humans, altered SERT gene expression and/or transport function have been linked to multiple disorders including autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and suicide (6Cook E.H.

Previous studies have demonstrated that both genetic and posttranscriptional processes regulate SERT activity (12Lesch K.P. Bengel D. Heils A. Sabol S.Z. Greenberg B.D. Petri S. Benjamin J.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SERT activity in native cells and transfected models can be rapidly (in minutes) modulated by multiple signaling pathways (14Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Schroeter S. Qian Y. Apparsundaram S. Galli A.

Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 1-23Google Scholar). Observations with transfected HEK cells expressing human SERT (hSERT) demonstrated that protein kinase C activators or protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors trigger hSERT phosphorylation and a parallel decrease in hSERT cell surface density, effects that can be attenuated by SERT substrates (16Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A and protein kinase G (PKG) activation can also trigger SERT phosphorylation (17Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), although the functional consequences of these stimuli are only beginning to be appreciated. SERTs appear to form homomultimers at the plasma membrane (19Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and also interact with a growing list of associated proteins, including syntaxin 1A (20Haase J. Killian A.M. Magnani F. Williams C.

Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, syntaxin 1A and PP2A/SERT interactions are destabilized by protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters as well as by protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors, such as okadaic acid and calyculin A, suggesting that signaling networks converge on SERT protein complexes to influence plasma membrane transport capacity. Whereas important observations of SERT regulation have arisen using heterologous expressed SERTs, reports of receptor-linked modulation of native SERT activity provide important evidence of physiologically relevant SERT regulation. For example, in neurons, acute modulation of presynaptic 5-HT1-class receptors alters hippocampal 5-HT clearance in vivo (24Daws L.C. Gould G.G. Teicher S.D. Gerhardt G.A. Frazer A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have described rapid down-regulation of SERT in brain preparations in vitro and in vivo following treatments with the α2-adrenergic agonist, UK14304 (25Ansah T.A. Ramamoorthy S. Montanez S. Daws L.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) (26Miller K.J. Hoffman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27351-27356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in platelets (27Launay J.M. Bondoux D. Oset-Gasque M.J. Emami S. Mutel V. Haimart M. Gespach C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R526-R536PubMed Google Scholar), adenosine receptors (ARs) and histamine receptors, respectively, induce a cGMP-linked increase in 5-HT transport. In examination of the RBL-2H3 cell model, as well as AR/SERT co-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Blakely R.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 504: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) recently defined SERT stimulation as supported by distinct trafficking-dependent and -independent pathways, activated downstream of AR-triggered guanylyl cyclase and PKG activation. Specifically, we found that in addition to activating PKG, the adenosine receptor agonist, 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), also stimulates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Whereas p38 MAPK inhibitors block NECA stimulation of SERT activity, they fail to blunt NECA-induced increases in surface-SERT density (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These studies, reminiscent of p38 MAPK involvement in the catalytic modulation of NET and GLUT4 proteins by insulin (30Apparsundaram S. Sung U. Price R.D. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 666-677PubMed Google Scholar, 31Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggest the existence of a conserved p38 MAPK pathway in support of a trafficking-independent mode of SERT regulation. To clarify a role for p38 MAPK in regulation of SERT activity, we sought evidence of SERT modulation triggered by p38 MAPK activation. We asked whether SERT, expressed in native or transfected model systems, is sensitive to stimuli (anisomycin, H2O2, and UV irradiation) known to trigger both p38 MAPK phosphorylation and activation and whether ensuing modulation of 5-HT transport parallels p38 MAPK activation and is sensitive to specific p38 MAPK inhibitors. Using transfected cells, we asked whether SERT regulation is shared by the homologous biogenic amine transporters, NET and DAT, or exhibits transporter specificity. Using RBL-2H3 cells, as well as the serotonergic neuroblastoma RN46A (32Eaton M.J. Whittemore S.R. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 140: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we asked whether p38 MAPK-linked SERT regulation arises from catalytic modulation, changes in transporter surface density, or both and, by using competition binding assays, whether 5-HT affinity is altered. To test an emerging model favoring p38 MAPK as downstream of PKG activation where p38 MAPK may be capable of targeting surface-inserted SERTs, we tested the sensitivity of anisomycin modulation of SERT activity to PKG inhibitors and explored the impact on regulation of surface SERT-inactivating methanethiosulfonates, respectively. Finally, we sought to determine whether the SERT-associated phosphatase PP2A, whose inhibitors block AR stimulation of 5-HT uptake (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), contributes to SERT exocytosis versus catalytic activation. We discuss our findings with respect to a model for acute SERT regulation dictated by complementary yet resolvable pathways that differentially impact SERT trafficking and catalytic activity.

Antibodies to β-actin were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—RBL-2H3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C in MEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (l-Gln), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RN46A cells (provided by Dr. Whittemore, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL) were cultured at 33 °C with Dulbecco's MEM/F-12 (1:1 in volume) containing 250 mg/liter G418, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-Gln, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (32Eaton M.J. Whittemore S.R. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 140: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CHO cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-Glu, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For comparison of the response of monoamine transporters to p38 MAPK activation, CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs for hSERT, hDAT, or hNET (100 ng/well for a 24-well plate). Transfections of CHO cells were performed using TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol (0.3 μl/well). hSERT, hDAT, or hNET cDNAs were preincubated with the reagent at ambient temperature for 30 min before being added to plated CHO cells. Cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection. The transfection mixture was removed just prior to assay. 5-HT Transport Assays—[3H]5-HT transport activity was assayed as described previously (16Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-2H3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (40,000 cells/well) 24 h prior to the 5-HT uptake assay. CHO cells were plated at 20,000 cells/well 16–24 h before transfection, and the uptake assay was performed 24 h following the transfection. RN46A cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well 24 h before the 5-HT uptake assay. Medium was removed by aspiration, and cells were washed once with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated in triplicate at 37 °C in KRH buffer (0.2 ml/well) containing 100 μm pargyline, 100 μm l-ascorbic acid, and/or 1.0 mm tropolone (Sigma), with or without modifiers. After a 10-min incubation with [3H]5-HT (100 nm for RBL-2H3 and RN46A cells, 20 nm for SERT-transfected CHO cells), [3H]DA (50 nm), or [3H]NE (50 nm) at 37 °C, buffer was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold KRH buffer. Cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of Microscint 20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and tritium-labeled monoamine accumulation was quantitated using a TopCount plate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific 5-HT, DA, and NE uptake was determined by subtracting the amount of [3H]5-HT, [3H]DA, and [3H]NE accumulated in the presence of 10 μm paroxetine, GBR 12935, and desipramine, respectively. 5-HT saturation kinetics in RBL-2H3 and RN46A cells were defined as described for standard transport assays, using varying concentrations of [3H]5-HT (brought to 0.5 Ci/mmol using unlabeled 5-HT), and again, nonspecific uptake was defined with 10 μm paroxetine. For studies seeking to inactivate surface SERTs in RBL-2H3 cells, we treated cells with the membrane-impermeant, cysteine-specific alkylating reagent MTSET (36Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as previously described (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were treated either with vehicle or MTSET (10 mm) for 10 min on ice prior to washing, and cells were then re-equilibrated in normal medium at 37 °C with anisomycin-stimulated 5-HT transport determined as described above. Platelet Isolation and Transport Assays—Human platelet-rich plasma was obtained from the American Red Cross. Approximately 2 × 109 platelets were incubated with the appropriate pharmacological reagents for 10 min at 37 °C and collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Platelets were then washed twice with 1× PBS and resuspended in KRH buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm pargyline, 100 μm ascorbic acid, and 1 mm tropolone. After a 5-min incubation with 50 nm [3H]5-HT, uptake was terminated by filtration through GF/B Whatman paper. Filters were washed three times with ice-cold KRH buffer, immersed in scintillation liquid for 8 h, and counted by scintillation spectrometry. The counts obtained from the filtered samples were corrected for the nonspecific binding/uptake obtained using parallel samples incubated with paroxetine (1 μm). Experiments were performed in duplicate and replicated at least three times. [125I]RTI-55 Binding Assays—To assess SERT surface density, we quantitated the binding of the high affinity cocaine analog [125I]RTI-55 (5 nm) to intact cells at 4 °C for 45 min in PBS/CM buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2) in the presence or absence of a membrane-permeant (1 μm paroxetine) or membrane-impermeant (100 μm 5-HT) displacer, defining total and surface-specific binding, respectively (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Binding was terminated by two rapid washes with ice-cold PBS/CM. Cells were solubilized with 1% SDS, and [125I]RTI-55 bound was quantified using a Gamma 4000 counter (Beckman Instruments). Assays to assess 5-HT potency for inhibition of [125I]RTI-55 binding were performed as described above, except with the inclusion of varying concentrations of unlabeled 5-HT. Assays of p38 MAPK Activation—To monitor activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin in intact cells, RBL-2H3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well) and cultured in MEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. Medium was removed by aspiration, and cells were washed once with KRH buffer and then incubated in triplicate at 37 °C in KRH buffer with or without p38 MAPK activators for 5–10 min. Assay buffer was removed, and cells were immediately fixed with fresh 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and washed four times with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) (5 min per wash) prior to 1 h of blocking with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). RBL-2H3 cells were subsequently probed with dual phosphorylated (Thr(P) and Tyr(P)) p38 MAPK polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:400) in Odyssey blocking buffer with gentle mixing for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed four times with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 5 min. Bound antibody was detected with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody-Alexa Fluor® 680 (avoiding exposure to light; 1:200 in Odyssey Blocking Buffer, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h. After four washes with 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the plate was scanned, and the captured image of the signal was processed and quantified with the Odyssey™ Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). For UV radiation to activate p38 MAPK, plates seeded with cells were placed in a UV source (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that was preset to deliver 4 × 104 μJ/cm2 at room temperature. Assay for p38 MAPK Suppression by RNA Interference—To further evaluate the role of p38 MAPK in anisomycin-stimulated SERT activity, RBL-2H3 cells (seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were transfected with 100 nm siRNA SMARTpool® for rat p38 MAPK-α by using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SERT activity was tested 48 h after transfection, and p38 MAPK protein levels were assessed using anti-p38 MAPK antibodies. As controls, cell culture medium alone or/and transfection reagent (Trans-IT) without siRNA was tested in parallel with the siRNA transfection. Anti-β-actin antibodies were used to reprobe the membrane for equal blot loading. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses, comparing base-line and compound-modified uptake, antagonist binding, or p38 MAPK activation, were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) using one- and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent planned comparisons (Dunnett, Bonferroni) as well as t tests as noted in the legends to Figs. 5 and 6. Saturation kinetic and competition binding data were fit using GraphPad Prism (rectangular hyperbola, one-site binding isotherm).Fig. 6Saturation kinetic and competition binding analyses of anisomycin stimulation.A, RN46A cells were treated with anisomycin (1 μm) or with vehicle for 10 min prior to transport assays. B, RBL-2H3 cells were treated with anisomycin (1 μm) or with vehicle for 10 min prior to transport assays. C, RBL-2H3 cells were treated with vehicle, SB203580 (10 μm), or anisomycin (1 μm) for 10 min prior to the RTI-55 binding assay. 5-HT at varying concentrations as indicated in the figure was used to compete with surface binding of RTI-55. Data were fit in both A and B to a Michaelis-Menten equation (single binding site) to derive 5-HT Km and Vmax values and fit in C to a single competition site equation to derive Ki. Values are expressed as mean values (n = 3) ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test).

Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar findings were obtained with AR/hSERT co-transfected CHO cells. These results, as well as the novelty of drug-modulated SERT catalytic function, warranted a more in depth evaluation of p38 MAPK-dependent SERT stimulation. To accomplish this, we first explored the effects of the p38 MAPK activator, anisomycin (37Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), on 5-HT uptake in RBL-2H3 cells. In these experiments (Fig. 1, A and B), we found that anisomycin exerts a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of 5-HT transport activity. At 1 μm, anisomycin stimulation of 5-HT transport was transient, peaking at 10 min and declining to basal levels by 30 min. Using a 10-min pretreatment, anisomycin stimulation peaked at 1 μm and became inhibitory at 25 μm, effects that could represent toxicity, although this was not pursued further. Consistent with previous findings (28Zhu C-B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the effects of anisomycin on 5-HT uptake were blocked by preincubation with the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the effects of anisomycin could be mirrored by other p38 MAPK activators. Reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, and UV radiation are known to trigger p38 MAPK activation in a wide range of cells (38Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E.

Med. 1998; 8: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both H2O2 (20 μm) and UV light (4 × 104 μJ/cm2) stimulated 5-HT transport to a level comparable with 1 μm anisomycin, and as with anisomycin, these effects were abolished by SB203580 (Fig. 1C). Additionally, other potent p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB202190 and PD169316 (data not shown), also blocked anisomycin stimulation of SERT, whereas the inactive analog, SB202474, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitor, curcumin, lacked antagonistic activity (Fig. 1D). PD98059 (10 μm), a selective inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, however, failed to block anisomycin-stimulated SERT activity (data not shown). p38 MAPK must be dually phosphorylated to achieve catalytic activation (39New L.

An increasing number of these proteins have been discovered over the last decade, and a large body of research is now devoted to these proteins and their different roles in various diseases. ATs have evolved a unique export mechanism, the type V pathway (1Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Initially the protein is synthesized with an N-terminal leader peptide directing the protein to the periplasm via the signal recognition particle (SRP) (3Sijbrandi R.

Once across the inner membrane, the C-terminal domain forms a β-barrel structure within the outer membrane, allowing the passenger domain to escape to the external medium, where it is released proteolytically from the cell (4Klauser T.

Recently the crystal structure of a translocator (membrane) domain of an AT has been solved (7Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). AT passenger domains are generally more than 100 kDa in size and vary widely in sequence and function but include a group of closely related serine proteases, the SPATE family (serine protease autotransporters of the Enterobacteriaceae). These proteins are found only in pathogenic bacteria, but their precise roles remain unknown (8Henderson I.R. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The SPATE family includes EspC from enteropathogenic E. coli (10Stein M. Kenny B. Stein M.A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EspP from enterohemorrhagic E. coli (11Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These AT proteins are associated with a number of serious, possibly life-threatening diseases affecting millions world-wide. Tsh and Vat are essential virulence factors in avian diseases that cost the poultry industry millions of dollars annually. SPATE proteins do not appear to have conserved or even related functions (8Henderson I.R. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Vat has vacuolating activity, and Pet enters eukaryotic cells to disturb the cytoskeletal system. As essential proteins in pathogenesis, SPATE proteins are key drug targets and potential routes to vaccines. Knowledge of the molecular structure is a first step toward understanding their mechanisms and hopefully how they may be inactivated. We have solved the crystal structure of the passenger domain of heme binding hemoglobin protease (Hbp), an AT involved in bacterial synergy in the development of peritonitis.Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneal cavity and may develop into a life-threatening condition through the formation of persistent abscesses, which leak pathogenic bacteria into the general circulation (18Farthmann E.H. Schoffel U. Infection. 1998; 26: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Aldridge K.E. Am. J. Surg. 1995; 169: 2S-7SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This common complication of invasive surgery then results in septic shock and multiorgan failure with mortality rates well in excess of 50%. These abscesses are difficult to treat with antimicrobial therapy, and usually require surgical intervention. It is frequently found that pathogenic E. coli and the strictly anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis occur together in intra-abdominal abscesses, the combination surviving better than either species alone (20Rotstein O.D. Kao J. Houston K. J. Med. Microbiol. 1989; 29: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Dozois C.M. Luirink J. Oudega B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). B. fragilis is a common member of the normal human gut flora, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen (18Farthmann E.H. Schoffel U. Infection. 1998; 26: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Aldridge K.E. Am. J. Surg. 1995; 169: 2S-7SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It promotes fibrin deposition by the host, which localizes the bacteria and prevents systemic spread, but also provides an environment where the bacteria can escape attack by the immune system. In return, E. coli helps to supply both species with heme scavenged from hemoglobin (Hb). Hbp was discovered as the protease secreted by E. coli, which degrades Hb and binds heme (21Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Dozois C.M. Luirink J. Oudega B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The hbp gene is located on a large episome, pColV-K30, which also encodes an aerobactin-dependent iron uptake system (23Williams P.H. Infect. Immun. 1979; 26: 925-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hbp is highly expressed by E. coli during peritonitis and plays a key role in bacterial synergy with B. fragilis. Adding Hbp and heme to cultures of B. fragilis was shown to stimulate growth, and mice immunized with Hbp showed no abscess formation when subsequently challenged with mixed E. coli/B. fragilis cultures. Hbp therefore appears to be a useful target in the treatment and prevention of peritonitis. We have determined the crystal structure of Hbp with the longer term view of producing inhibitors, vaccines, or other treatments for peritonitis and other diseases caused by SPATE proteins. From this first molecular model of an AT, we have constructed homology models of other ATs to observe both common and unique features of these proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification and Crystallization—The cloning of Hbp has been described previously (22Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α harboring plasmid pACY-CHbp was grown to an A600 of 0.6 in MA medium, and the supernatant was collected and concentrated. Following 1000-fold concentration by ultrafiltration, the protein was purified by gel filtration in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride. Apo-Hbp was crystallized by the published method (24Tame J.R.H. van Dooren S.J. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 4 mg/ml protein was crystallized using the hanging drop method using 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, and 15–20% polyethylene glycol 6000.Data Collection and Processing—Multi-wavelength x-ray data were collected at beam line 45XU-PX, SPring8, Harima, Japan. Native data were collected at beam line BL5 of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, to a resolution of 2.2 Å. All data were indexed and integrated using HKL2000 and scaled with the program SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The crystals are in space group P6122 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 114.86 Å, c = 437.05 Å, with one molecule per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 65%.Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of Hbp was solved by MAD (multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion) using selenomethionine-containing protein. Phase determination and refinement were performed using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). 12 Se sites were located out of 14 expected. The 3.0-Å resolution electron density map obtained from RESOLVE was of sufficient quality to permit unambiguous chain tracing without further refinement of the heavy atom sites. After model building using the programs O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and Turbo (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar), initial refinement was carried out with XPLOR (30Brunger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.85.

Solvent molecules were placed at positions where spherical electron-density peaks were found above 1.5 σ in the 2Fo – Fc map and above 3.0 σ in the Fo – Fc map and where stereochemically reasonable hydrogen bonds were allowed. The final model extends from the N terminus (residue 1 of the mature protein) to residue 1048, the C-terminal residue of the passenger domain. The Ramachandran plot has 86% of the residues in the most favorable regions and none in disallowed regions. A summary of the data collection and refinement statistics is given in Table I.

The most striking feature is the right-handed β-helical C-terminal tail, which extends from residue 260 onwards, forming three parallel β sheets. This is highly similar to pertactin (PDB 1DAB) (33Emsley P. Charles I.G. Fairweather N.F. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and the N terminus of filamentous hemagglutinin (PDB 1RWR) (34Clantin B. Hodak H. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F.

Pertactin is the only AT structure refined to date, one of only a dozen or so right-handed parallel β helix protein structures so far solved. The first was the pectate lyase PelC (PDB 1AIR), and a number of different pectate lyase structures are now known (35Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The pectate lyase superfamily members are a functionally eclectic mix, including P22 tailspike protein (PDB 1TYU), chondroitinase B (PDB 1DGB), and insect cysteine-rich antifreeze protein (PDB 1EZG). All share a similar pattern of repeats of about 25 amino acid residues, which form one turn of the right-handed helix. Each turn creates three β strands that form extended β sheets with neighboring turns. The core of this region is generally but not exclusively hydrophobic. The leucine-rich repeat family is another group of protein structures formed from repeated sequence motifs, but these include an α helix in each turn and are found to be highly curved into horseshoe shapes. The pectate lyase superfamily forms a much straighter superhelix. The shape of Hbp was previously determined to low resolution using a combination of small-angle x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation (36Scott D.J. Grossmann J.G. Tame J.R. Byron O.

The crystal structure shows a slightly straighter structure than the model from small-angle x-ray scattering, possibly due to greater flexibility in solution.The Hbp model includes 24 turns of right-handed β helix, compared with 16 in pertactin, the longest parallel β-helix known to date. Hbp is highly reminiscent of pertactin, but less regular and slightly kinked in the center. It also has a large N-terminal globular domain and a smaller domain of 75 residues (481–556) about half-way along the β-helix, as well as decorative loops where the polypeptide chain departs from the helical stem. The extra surface features make the length of Hbp (1048 residues) almost twice that of pertactin (539 residues). The extended hydrophobic core is largely but not exclusively filled with aliphatic side chains (Fig. 2, top and bottom). The N-terminal region close to the serine protease domain has a higher proportion of buried aromatic residues. Very few polar residues point into the hydrophobic core, but Ser780 is one exception (Fig. 2, bottom). Other SPATE proteins generally have threonine at this position. Unlike the pectate lyases there are no regular “stacks” of identical residues packed in layers within the core, but a row of asparagine residues is found forming an extended hydrogen bonding chain on the surface of the β helix (Fig. 3). Overall the electron density for the model is very clear, but model building became increasingly difficult toward the C terminus. LAFIRE, a model fitting and rebuilding program using local correlation of electron density, 2M. Yao, unpublished program. was essential in assembling the last 100 residues of the model. Details of the program may be found at: altair.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/g6/Research/Lafire_English.html. There are several breaks in the final electron density maps in this region where short loops cannot be modeled. The C-terminal region from residue 950 to the end is a conserved domain found among AT proteins believed to assist folding after passage through the C-terminal pore domain (37Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1367-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Top, a slice through the β helix showing the hydrophobic core.

These asparagines are not conserved among AT sequences, which have a variety of hydrophilic side chains at equivalent positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Residues 1–256 of the model form a clearly separate domain (domain 1 in Fig. 1), including six β strands rolled into a barrel-like structure, with several long β hairpins over its surface. The N-terminal glycine residue is deep within the structure, close to the bottom of the barrel. Folding of the domain can clearly only occur after the signal peptide has been removed. The glycine N atom hydrogen bonds to Asp206, which also interacts with Arg140 and the main-chain of Gly144. An α-helix (Leu245-Asp255) connects this domain to the β helical stem. Searching the PDB for structural homologues with DALI (38Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 39Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar) revealed that the N-terminal domain is highly similar to bovine trypsin (PDB 5PTP), which gave a Z-score of 17.5 (scores above 2.0 are considered significant). The 162 residues matched showed 20% sequence identity to Hbp and could be fitted with root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å over the main chain. The Cα traces are overlaid in Fig. 4, top. Other proteases gave rather poorer scores. Overlaying trypsin on the model of Hbp gave an excellent match of the catalytic triad (Ser195, His57, and Asp102) of trypsin with Ser207, His73, and Asp101 of Hbp (Fig. 4, bottom). Comparing the active sites, Hbp misses a loop (Ser93 to Asp101 in trypsin) just prior to the essential aspartate. In trypsin this loop includes Leu99, which contacts Trp215, one of the residues that forms antiparallel-β sheet interactions with the substrate polypeptide. Trp215 in trypsin is changed to alanine (Ala229) in Hbp, making the active site of Hbp much more open. At the bottom of the specificity pocket, which accommodates the residue preceding the scissile bond, trypsin has an aspartate (Asp189), which leads to the preference for Lys and Arg residues at the S1 position. Chymotrypsin and elastase have serine in this position, but Hbp has tyrosine (Tyr201). Among the trypsin/chymotrypsin family, Pro225 is very highly conserved from bacteria to man, but Hbp misses a loop just before this residue, and the nearest equivalent is Gly237. Hbp is also unusual in having an asparagine residue at the position equivalent to glycine 226 in trypsin. Thus, although the fold of the N-terminal domain is close to trypsin, it also has unique features not seen in other serine proteases. The active site suggests broad substrate specificity with a preference for hydrophobic side chains in the specificity pocket. The very open active site presumably helps Hbp to attack folded globular proteins such as Hb, but more work is required to determine its functional properties as a protease. Low resolution electron density maps calculated using data collected with crystals soaked with two serine protease inhibitors, tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone, show peaks of density close to the active site serine, suggesting the protease is still active at pH 4.6 (data not shown).Fig. 4Top, a stereo overlay of the Cα trace of bovine trypsin (blue) and the serine protease domain of Hbp (red). The Cα of the catalytic serine (Ser207) is shown as a green sphere. Trypsin (PDB 5PTP) was matched to HBP by least-squares fitting residues 16–19 (1–4), 21–24 (15–18), 26–32 (49–55), 42–60 (58–76), 63–69 (78–84), 79–93 (85–99), 101–114 (100–113), 118–127 (114–123), 129–132 (128–131), 134–146 (136–148), 147–152 (156–161), 153–165 (163–175), 176–183 (177–184), 184–187 (186–189), 188–202 (200–214), 224–231 (236–243), and 234–245 (244–255). These 648 main-chain atoms selected by DALI have a root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å, and a maximum deviation of 8.2 Å. Bottom, the 2mFo – DFc electron density map contoured at 1.3 σ over the catalytic site of the serine protease domain, showing the catalytic serine (Ser207) and a water molecule hydrogen bonded to it.

Gyles C.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but it maintains both the active site serine (Ser207) and Ser209, which hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Asp206 to make the turn carrying Ser207. The N-terminal Gly1 lies close to the active site serine and hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asp206. This strongly suggests the enzyme can only become active after the leader peptide is removed. All SPATE proteins tested show proteolytic activity, but with different substrate specificities, suggesting different functions (9Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Replacement of the active site serine of Pet (a SPATE from enteroaggregative E. coli) with isoleucine did not prevent release of the passenger domain from the C-terminal pore, but did eliminate all cytotoxic effects (40Navarro-Garcia F. Canizalez-Roman A. Luna J. Sears C. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Comparing the sequences of various ATs shows that Tyr201 in the specificity pocket of Hbp is preserved in Pic and SepA, whereas Pet and Sat have leucine (Fig. 5). The sequence alignment also suggests that EspC has glutamate at this position, which presumably would affect substrate preference strongly. Using the N domain structure of Hbp, a homology model of Pet protease domain was built using SwissModel (41Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Research. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). From this a second homology model of Sat protease domain was also constructed. The weaker sequence conservation between Hbp and Sat prevented a model of the latter being built more directly. These homology models show no unexpectedly loose packing or unfavorable geometry, indicating that each protein has identical connectivity, with minor differences in loop regions, in the N-terminal protease domain.Fig. 5A sequence alignment of Hbp with other members of the SPATE family, covering the N-terminal protease domain. Conservative mutations are shown in red, and residues common to all of the six compared sequences are shown in white on red. The UNIPROT reference numbers for the sequences are O88093 (Hbp), Q8CWC7 (Pic), Q8VSL2 (SepA), P77070 (EspC), Q6KD43 (Sat), and O68900 (Pet). Secondary structure elements of Hbp are shown over the alignment. The conserved regions show strong correlation to these structural elements, with the exception of the catalytic region GDSGS. The side-chain four residues upstream from this sequence sits in the specificity pocket (Tyr201 in the case of Hbp).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal domain makes extensive contact with the β-helical stem of Hbp, but given its globular shape the contact region with the roughly cylindrical β helix is long and narrow. Many N domain contacts are found between Asp108 and Val114. Arg106 makes buried hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asn301 and Gly303. The main hydrophobic contact is provided by Leu110, which is buried at the interface. Arg106 and Lys109 are very strongly conserved among ATs, the latter forming a salt bridge with Asp367.

https://openalex.org/W2116961945,"Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for brain development. However, information on if and how this key endocrine factor affects adult neurogenesis is fragmentary. We thus investigated the effects of TH on proliferation and apoptosis of stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ), as well as on migration of transgene-tagged neuroblasts out of the stem cell niche. Hypothyroidism significantly reduced all three of these processes, inhibiting generation of new cells. To determine the mechanisms relaying TH action in the SVZ, we analyzed which receptor was implicated and whether the effects were played out directly at the level of the stem cell population. The alpha TH receptor (TRalpha), but not TRbeta, was found to be expressed in nestin positive progenitor cells of the SVZ. Further, use of TRalpha mutant mice showed TRalpha to be required to maintain full proliferative activity. Finally, a direct TH transcriptional effect, not mediated through other cell populations, was revealed by targeted gene transfer to stem cells in vivo. Indeed, TH directly modulated transcription from the c-myc promoter reporter construct containing a functional TH response element containing TRE but not from a mutated TRE sequence. We conclude that liganded-TRalpha is critical for neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain."

Approximately one-third of all proteins in eukaryotic cells are phosphorylated on either serine, threonine, or tyrosine, a reaction that is catalyzed by members of the protein kinase superfamily (1Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Over 500 protein kinases comprise the human Kinome, and they fall into seven distinct families (2Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). The identification of protein substrates of distinct protein kinases lags significantly behind knowledge of their regulatory mechanisms. However, recent technological advances in the identification of phosphorylation sites, such chemical genetics as well as mass spectrometry, have enabled progress in this area (3Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Science's STKE 2002. 2002; : PE49Google Scholar). In addition, the advent of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies which recognize phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in a sequence-specific context has provided much needed insight into the specific function of many protein kinases (4Czernik A.J. Girault J.A. Nairn A.C. Chen J. Snyder G. Kebabian J. Greengard P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 264-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A more recent application of this technique is the development of substrate-directed phospho-specific antibodies that recognize the optimal consensus motif of a specific protein kinase or family of kinases (5Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This has been possible through the identification of consensus phosphorylation motifs by degenerate peptide library approaches, such that the knowledge that many kinases prefer to phosphorylate, for example, basophilic, acidophilic, or Ser-Pro-directed motifs has been further refined to obtain a specific consensus for amino acids surrounding the phosphorylatable Ser or Thr (6Songyang Z. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As an example, identification of the consensus motif phosphorylated by Akt/PKB, an AGC kinase, enabled the development of an antibody which recognizes this motif and which was used to identify novel Akt/PKB substrates, such as the TSC2 gene product, tuberin (5Zhang H.

Based on sequence similarities, PKDs are now grouped into the CAMK (calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinases) family of kinases. PKDs regulate a plethora of cellular responses, ranging from cell growth, cell survival, Golgi organization, and trafficking and immune cell responses in B cells (reviewed in Ref. 9Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similarly, the regulation of PKD catalytic activity by cellular location, binding to adapter proteins, and by phosphorylation is also well documented. What has remained elusive, however, is the identification of specific protein substrates of PKD, which relay the signal to downstream responses. Notable exceptions are Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa), a neuronal PKD substrate protein (10Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), RIN1, a PKD substrate involved in the modulation of Ras signaling (11Wang Y. Waldron R.T. Dhaka A. Patel A. Riley M.M. Rozengurt E. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and HDAC5 (histone deacetylase 5), a class II deacetylase implicated in suppression of cardiac hypertrophy (12Vega R.B.

Clearly, numerous other PKD substrates must exist given the large number of cellular responses attributed to this protein kinase. We took advantage of the known optimal consensus phosphorylation motif preferred by PKD to develop a substrate-directed, phospho-specific antibody that is immunoreactive against proteins phosphorylated by PKD in cells. Using this antibody, we have detected multiple phosphoproteins in stimulated cells and have used it to identify a previously unidentified PKD substrate, the heat shock protein Hsp27. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and cDNA Expression Plasmids—The HeLa and HEK293E cell lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The anti-PKD (C-20) and anti-Hsp27 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (M2), and anti-actin from Sigma. Anti-HDAC5, anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt/PKB substrate antibody (Akt/PKB pMOTIF), and anti-phospho-Hsp27 (pSer82) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-RIN1 and RIN1 expression plasmids were generous gifts of J. Colicelli and are published (11Wang Y. Waldron R.T. Dhaka A. Patel A. Riley M.M. Rozengurt E. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pervanadate was prepared as described previously (13Storz P. Doppler H. Johannes F.J. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17969-17976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). H2O2 (30%) was from Fisher Scientific. PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), bombesin, and bradykinin were from Sigma, and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant PKD was expressed in insect cells after infection with baculovirus harboring hemagglutinin-tagged PKD in pFAST-Bac (Invitrogen) and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The vector-based PKD1 and PKD2 RNAi in the pSUPER expression vector have been described (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Storz P.

TransIT HeLa Monster reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) was used for all transient transfections according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stimulated or harvested 24 h after transfection. A GST-Hsp27 fusion protein was obtained by cloning Hsp27 cDNA into pGEX-4T1 using the following oligonucleotide primer pair for PCR: 5′-GCGGGATCCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTCCCCTTC-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTACTTGGCGGCAGTCTCATCGGA-3′. The S15A and S82A mutations were introduced using the following oligonucleotide primer pair: 5′-TCGCTCCTGCGGGGCCCCGCCTGGGACCCCTTCCGCGAC-3′and 5′-GTCGCGGAAGGGGTCCCAGGCGGGGCCCCGCAGGAGCGA-3′ for S15A and 5′-GCGCTCAGCCGGCAACTCGCCAGCGGGGTCTCGGAGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCTCCGAGACCCCGCTGGCGAGTTGCCGGCTGAGCGC-3′ for S82A. Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange strategy (Stratagene), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibody Production—The PKD pMOTIF antibody was raised against a synthetic phosphopeptide antigen CXXXLXR(Q/K/E/M)(M/L/K/E/Q/A)S*XXXX, where X represents a position in the peptide synthesis where a mixture of all 20 amino acid (excluding C and W) were used, and where S* represent phosphoserine. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. Phosphopeptide-reactive rabbit antiserum was first purified by protein A chromatography. Further purification was carried out using immunodepletion by non-phosphopeptide resin chromatography, after which the resulting eluate was chromatographed on a phosphopeptide resin. The antibody specificity of the resulting fractions was tested for specificity toward optimal PKD substrate sequences by ELISA, immunoblotting, and peptide arrays (see below). Peptide Arrays—Covalent membrane-bound phosphopeptide libraries were synthesized directly on nitrocellulose membrane by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory. For antibody specificity determination, the parental peptide library for the array was XXLXRXXS*XXXX. The library was arrayed such that each row represents a fixed position in the indicated library, and this position was systematically fixed with a specific amino acid as indicated in single amino acid letter code above each column. The first column from the left is the parental peptide library (Fig. 1C). The purified antibody fractions eluting from the phosphopeptide chromatography were tested against this array by incubating the antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 with membranes for 4 h at room temperature in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS + 0.2% Tween 20), followed by three washes with PBST. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was incubated at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBST the signal was revealed by Lumiglo (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were stimulated or harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were used either for immunoblot analysis or proteins were immunoprecipitated by a 1-h incubation with the respective antibody (2 μg), followed by a 30-min incubation with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed three times with TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and resolved by SDS-PAGE or subjected to kinase assays. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For kinase assays with GST fusion proteins or immunoprecipitated substrates, the reaction was carried out by adding 0.5 μg of purified PKD to 2 μg of purified protein in a volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was started by adding 10 μl of kinase substrate mix (100 μm ATP (cold assay) or 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer) and was carried out for 30 min at room temperature. To terminate the kinase reaction, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. RNA Interference—RNAi plasmids for PKD1 and PKD2 silencing have been described (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To silence human Hsp27 the following oligonucleotide sequences were cloned in pSUPER: 5′-GATCCCCGGATGGCGTGGTGGAGATCTTCAAGAGAGATCTCCACCACGCCATCCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGATGGCGTGGTGGAGATCTCTCTTGAAGATCTCCACCACGCCATCCGGG-3′. HEK293E and HeLa cells were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-RNAi using the TransIT HEK293 or HeLa-Monster reagents, respectively (Mirus). In all experiments the cells were transfected at 30% confluence. Transfection efficiencies (80–90%) were controlled using a green fluorescent protein expression vector. Reduced expression of target proteins was evaluated by immunoblotting. ELISA—ELISA was performed according to established protocols (16Perlmann H. Perlmann P. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μlof1 μm synthetic phospho- and non-phosphopeptides were used to coat each well in 96-well plates. Coating was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Phospho-PKD substrate antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after addition of primary antibody. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as a secondary antibody, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) was used for color development. Absorbance at 405 nm was read on an ELISA plate reader. To develop an antibody-based method for PKD substrate identification, we first considered the optimal substrate phosphorylation motif of PKD. An oriented degenerate peptide library approach originally devised by Cantley and colleagues (17Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) revealed that PKD strongly selects for aliphatic residues (leucine, valine, and isoleucine) at the –5 position relative to the phospho-acceptor. In this original study, arginine was locked at the –3 position to orient the library, but a more recent application of this technique made use of a positional scanning peptide library to reveal that, in fact, PKD does strongly select arginine at –3 (18Hutti J. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these findings using an immobilized degenerate peptide library array, which was phosphorylated by purified, recombinant PKD. The library was arrayed such that each row represents a fixed position in the library, and this position was fixed with each of the 20 proteogenic amino acids (Fig. 1A). The results confirmed that PKD strongly prefers aliphatic residues, particularly leucine, at –5, and arginine at –3. Other selectivities included basic and aliphatic amino acids at –4, and neutral non-polar amino acids at –2. Relatively minor selectivity was observed at +1, although there was a preference for hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, three independent studies have defined the optimal consensus phosphorylation motif preferred by PKD. We used this information to raise an antibody, which we term anti-PKD pMOTIF, against a synthetic phosphopeptide according to the PKD motif (Fig. 1B). Epitope mapping of the antibody was first determined by ELISA with various synthetic phospho- and non-phosphopeptides. ELISA reactivities relative to the parental phosphopeptide are shown in Table I. Non-phospho control peptides scored in the 3–5% range of control phosphopeptide, revealing that the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody only bound to phosphopeptides. Strongest antibody binding was detected when both leucine at –5 and arginine at –3 were present, consistent with the selectivity of PKD for these residues. If leucine at –5 was absent, relatively poor binding was observed. Similarly, peptides with leucine, valine, or isoleucine at –5, but lacking arginine at –3, revealed no detectable binding above control.Table ISpecificity of the PKD pMOTIF antibody using various phospho- and non-phosphopeptides containing different versions of the consensus PKD substrate pMOTIF as determined by ELISAPeptide no.Peptide sequence% pMOTIF1CXXXLXR(Q/K/E/M)(M/L/K/E/Q/A)sXXXX1002CXXXLXR(Q/K/E/M)(M/L/K/E/Q/A)SXXXX3.83CXXXLXRXXtXXXX824CXXXLXRXXTXXXX3.75CXXXXXRRXtXXXX34.46CXXXXXXLtQ(DE)XXXXX4.67CXXXRR(S/G)s(K/L/D)XXX13.78CXXXRR(L/R)s(K/L/D)XXX10.69CXXXRXRXXtXXXX28.110CXXRXRX(L/A)s(R/F)XXX34.311CXXRXRX(R/E)s(R/F)XXX24.712CXXRXRX(L/A)s(V/A/T)XXX37.613CXXRXRX(R/E)s(V/A/T)XXX42LXRXXs/t peptides14CGLPRPKsAGTAT4.815CGLPRPKSAGTAT3.616CGLYRSPsMPENLNRPRL66.617CGLYRSPSMPENLNRPRL418CSPALKRSHsDSLD7.619CSPALKRSHSDSLD3.620CQRLFRSPsMP72.421CQRLFRSPSMP3.422CFLQRYssDPTGAL7.723CFLQRYSSDPTGAL4.224CPLGRTQsAPLP5.125CPLGRTQSAPLP3.926CPLNRTQsAPLP26.127CPLNRTQSAPLP428CRRVPFSLLRGPsWDPF5929CRRVPFSLLRGPSWDPF3.430CLMRRNsVTPLAS26.931CLMRRNSVTPLAS3.732CRRAHQLFRGFsFVAIT21.733CRRAHQLFRGFSFVAIT4.234CLQRRLsVYRQIV40.735CLQRRLSVYRQIV3.836CHKVLPRGLsPARQLL3.937CHKVLPRGLSPARQLL3.538CGLKRSLsEMEIG11.139CGLKRSLSEMEIG3.640CKINRSAsEPSLH8.941CKINRSASEPSLH3.942CVPRRKsLVGTPY25.143CVPRRKSLVGTPY3.944CTPKKPGLRRRQt30.745CTPKKPGLRRRQT3.946CVASMMHRQEtVE7.447CVASMMHRQETVE4RXXs/t peptides48SSRRTtLCGTLD6.349SSRRTTLCGTLD3.650CIPTRRHtFRRQNV12.251CIPTRRHTFRRQNV3.352CTIPRRNtLPAMDNS3.853CTIPRRNTLPAMDNS3.5RXXRXs/t peptides54CLKRKRRPtSGLHPED29.255CLKRKRRPTSGLHPED3.156CVEMIRRRRPtPAML3.557CVEMIRRRRPTPAML2.958SRPRSCtWPLPREI3.659SRPRSCTWPLPREI360CARGRFAtVVEEL6.161CARGRFATVVEEL2.962CIRGRKRtVWGAKQI22.863CIRERKRTVWGAKQI3.264CTRDRVPtYQYNM16.365CTRDRVPTYQYNM366CIRDRNGtHLDAGAL3.467CIRDRNGTHLDAGAL3.168CMRERLGtGGFGNV3.569CMRERLGTGGFGNV3.8V/L/IXXXXs/t peptides70VLSPLPsQAMDDLLC3.171CELQTDGsQASRS3.172CLEQHGsQPSNSYPSI3.173CVKYSSsQPEPRTG374CPEVPAERsPRRRSIS3.175CEEVAAKKsPVKATAP3.176VIPPHtPVRTVMNTC377GLGPSLtEDQPGPYLAPGLLGSNIHQQGR3.478CFGLSVQMtEDVY4.479CLGMTDsEEDLDPM3.380IGLDCASsEFFK3.181CSEKLFQGYsFVAPS4.282CLLTTGGtLKISDL3.283CLEPQKsLGDEG2.984CILLSELsRRRIRS2.9 Open table in a new tab To further investigate the selectivity of anti-PKD pMOTIF, we used a membrane-bound peptide array that was incubated with purified antibody to evaluate relative selectivity at each individual position (Fig. 1C). In the array, each spot represents a peptide based on the parental library, with each degenerate position represented by one amino acid, except the –5 and –3 positions where leucine and arginine were locked, respectively. In addition, peptides were generated that had either phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine at each of the fixed positions. The results reveal that anti-PKD pMOTIF has modest selectivity for amino acids at the –7 and –6 positions, although methionine and tryptophan showed some selectivity at –7, whereas histidine, asparagine, and proline were preferred at –6. As expected, only leucine was selected at –5. Although in the immunizing peptide the –4 position was left degenerate, the antibody preferentially bound basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine, as well as isoleucine, leucine, and methionine. This conforms well to aliphatic and basic amino acids preferred by PKD (Fig. 1C). As expected, peptides with arginine revealed the strongest binding at –3. At –2, glutamate, lysine, methionine, and, to a lesser extent, glutamine were preferred. Anti-PKD pMOTIF selected phosphoserine at the phospho-acceptor position, and, to a lesser extent, phosphothreonine. There was no detectable binding of phosphotyrosine or any other amino acid at this position. Carboxyl-terminal to the phospho-acceptor, there was modest selectivity for hydrophobic amino acids at +1 and +2. Taken together, these results show that anti-PKD pMOTIF binds to phosphopeptides, which accurately reflect the optimal PKD consensus motif. We next evaluated the ability of this antibody to detect putative PKD substrates in cells. PKD is activated in response to a wide variety of agonists that stimulate activation of PKC, which in turn phosphorylates and activates PKD (19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were stimulated with either bombesin, bradykinin, or PDGF. We also used PMA and pervanadate, which are well known activators of PKD. In response to all of these agonists, increased phosphorylation of a number of putative PKD substrates was detected (Fig. 2A). Specifically, three proteins of ∼85, 100, and 150 kDa were detected in fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF, PMA, and pervanadate. A strong immunoreactive band was also detected at ∼45 kDa. Two immunoreactive bands at 25 and 27 kDa were also detected in response to all agonists. These data show that the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody is immunoreactive against proteins in cells stimulated with agonists that are known to activate PKD. Because several other proteins were detected by this antibody even in unstimulated cells, probably reflecting nonspecific immunoreactivity, we next determined whether any of these putative substrates could be directly attributed to PKD activity. To achieve this, we reduced endogenous PKD expression in HEK293 cells with RNAi. Cells were stimulated with either pervanadate or H2O2, as studies have shown that exposure of cells to oxidative stress such as H2O2 potently activates PKD (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The same range of phosphoproteins revealed by the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody in fibroblasts were also detected in control HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). In cells transfected with PKD RNAi, there was a marked reduction in the immunoreactivity of several proteins, most notably at 27 kDa. Because the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody is phospho-specific we conclude that these may represent novel PKD substrates. To further validate the specificity of the PKD pMOTIF antibody, we next compared the immunoreactivity of this antibody with the Akt/PKB substrate-directed antibody, which recognizes the optimal consensus sequence RXRXXS*/T*ψ (5Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Stimulation of serum-starved HeLa cells with IGF-1, a potent agonist of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt/PKB signaling pathway, resulted in the phosphorylation of a number of proteins detected by the Akt/PKB substrate antibody (Fig. 2C, left panel). These bands were not detected in cells stimulated with PMA, which does not activate Akt/PKB. Conversely, PMA, a potent stimulus for PKD, induced the phosphorylation of a distinct subset of proteins as measured by PKD pMOTIF immunoreactivity (Fig. 2C, right panel). Stimulation of cells with IGF-1, which does not activate PKD, did not induce the phosphorylation of the same subset of proteins. Note, however, that both antibodies did detect some proteins in cells stimulated with both agonists, and these are likely to represent neither Akt/PKB nor PKD substrates. Finally, we determined whether the PKD pMOTIF antibody is immunoreactive against known PKD substrates. To this end, RIN1, a neuronal PKD substrate, was detected by PKD pMOTIF in transfected HeLa cells stimulated with PMA (Fig. 2D). Similarly, endogenous HDAC5, also a known PKD substrate, was detected by this antibody, again in response to PMA stimulation of HeLa cells. Therefore, PKD pMOTIF detects both putative and known PKD substrate proteins. To further demonstrate the feasibility of this antibody to discover novel PKD substrates, we performed a protein BLAST search on the Swiss-Prot data base using the peptide sequences from the ELISA screen. The search consistently returned the heat shock protein Hsp27 with the highest score for a protein containing the PKD consensus phosphorylation motif. We noted that one of the most prominent immunoreactive bands in Fig. 2B migrated at 27 kDa. To validate that this indeed represents Hsp27, we first reduced expression of endogenous Hsp27 using RNAi, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKD pMOTIF. As predicted, immunoreactivity of the 27-kDa band was significantly reduced following H2O2 stimulation of HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the Hsp27 amino acid sequence reveals two optimal putative PKD phosphorylation sites at Ser15 and Ser82 (Fig. 3B). Shown for comparison is the minimal PKD consensus phosphorylation sequence and the PKD phosphorylation sites in RIN1 and HDAC5. Next, we evaluated immunoreactivity of Hsp27 in cells transfected with PKD RNAi. There was a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of the 27kDa band as detected by immunoblotting total cell lysates with anti-PKD pMOTIF, whereas total Hsp27 levels were unaffected (Fig. 3C, left panel). That this band represents Hsp27 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Hsp27, followed by immunoblotting with PKD pMOTIF, and again there was a reduction in immunoreactivity in cells transfected with PKD RNAi (Fig. 3C, right panel). Because this antibody is phospho-specific, we conclude that PKD activation leads to the phosphorylation of Hsp27, which is detected by PKD pMOTIF. Next, we investigated on which residue Hsp27 is phosphorylated by PKD. GST-Hsp27 fusion proteins, either wild-type, Ser15 → Ala, or Ser82 → Ala mutations, were incubated with purified, recombinant PKD in in vitro kinase assays. Both wild-type and Ser15 → Ala GST-Hsp27 were efficiently phosphorylated by PKD, whereas the Ser82 → Ala mutant showed no detectable phosphorylation (Fig. 3D, left panel). This was confirmed by immunoblotting separate in vitro kinase assays either with anti-PKD pMOTIF or with a phospho-antibody specific to Ser82 in Hsp27. Both antibodies recognized wild-type Hsp27, wheras Ser82 → Ala Hsp27 immunoreactivity was reduced (Fig. 3D, right panel). These results demonstrate that: (i) PKD directly phosphorylates Hsp27 and that (ii) Ser82, and not Ser15, is the relevant site, at least in vitro. This is also true in cells, because both wild-type and Ser15 → Ala Hsp27 are efficiently detected by anti-PKD pMOTIF upon stimulation with H2O2, whereas no appreciable immunoreactivity was evident with the Ser82 → Ala mutant (Fig. 3E, top panel). Again, the same result was obtained by immunoblotting with anti-pSer82 (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). We therefore conclude that Hsp27 is phosphorylated at Ser82 by PKD in stimulated cells. Although much is known about the mechanisms of regulation of PKD and its importance in cell biology, the identification of specific protein substrates that relay the PKD signal has remained elusive. Here we have used an antibody-based method, which we speculate will aid in the identification of such substrates. We have shown that the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody reacts with peptides that conform to the preferred phosphorylation motif of this kinase and furthermore validate its use and show that the Hsp27 protein is a previously unidentified in vivo PKD substrate. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 at Ser15 and Ser82 has previously been demonstrated in response to treatment of cells with a variety of stresses such as oxidative stress and heat shock (21Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the MAPKAP kinases 2/3 have been shown to phosphorylate Hsp27 in vitro (21Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identity of the physiological kinase(s) for Hsp27 phosphorylation at these residues has not been determined. Using a combination of the anti-PKD pMOTIF antibody, PKD-specific RNAi, and in vitro kinase assays, we show that PKD is the relevant kinase for Hsp27 phosphorylation at Ser82. Hsp27 phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser82 modulates oligomerization and chaperone function, leading to protection of cells from injury due stress (23Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Because PKD plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we further speculate that Hsp27 phosphorylation by PKD may play a key role in this response. The use of the PKD pMOTIF antibody in combination with proteome-wide screens should yield much needed information concerning the identify of additional PKD substrates. Because other kinases in the human Kinome may reveal optimal phosphorylation motifs similar to that of PKD, it will be important to perform combinatorial screens with PKD-specific RNAi, as shown here. Additional in vitro validation by direct phosphorylation of identified putative PKD substrates will also be important to confirm the newly identified substrate. Given the present lack of any other rapid, substrate-directed methods to discover substrates of PKD in cells, this method should be well suited for analysis of PKD signaling in cells.

However, the mechanism of Rac activation induced by S1P stimulation remains unclear. In live endothelial cells expressing GFP-Rac, we observed that S1P induced the translocation of Rac to intercellular junctions, resulting in junctional sealing. We investigated the role of intracellular Ca2+ in signaling Rac activation and the enhancement of endothelial barrier function. We observed that S1P activated the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores, and subsequent Ca2+ entry via lanthanum-sensitive store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC) after store depletion. Inhibition of Gi, phospholipase C, or inositol trisphosphate receptor prevented the S1P-activated increase in intracellular Ca2+ as well as Rac activation, AJ assembly, and enhancement of endothelial barrier. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA blocked S1P-induced Rac activation, indicating the requirement for Ca2+ in the response. Inhibition of SOC by lanthanum or transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1), a SOC constituent, by TRPC1 antibody, failed to prevent S1P-induced Rac translocation to junctions and AJ assembly. Thus, our results demonstrate that S1P promotes endothelial junctional integrity by activating the release of endoplasmic reticulum-Ca2+, which induces Rac activation and promotes AJ annealing.

We therefore surmised that S1P induces an increase in [Ca2+]i leading to Rac activation, thereby serving as a critical intermediate signal by which Gi promotes junctional stability.

Endothelial Cell Cultures—HPAE or HUVE cells were cultured in a T-75 flask coated with 0.1% gelatin in EBM-2 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until they formed a confluent monolayer. Cells from each of the primary flasks were detached with 0.025% trypsin/EDTA and plated on 100-mm dishes for the Rac pull-down assay, 8-well electrodes for electrical resistance measurements, LabTEK chambers for live cell confocal imaging, or 12-mm coverslips for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. In all experiments, the monolayer of HPAE was incubated for 1–2 h in MCDB 131 serum-free medium before treatment with inhibitors or agonists. In all experiments, cells were used between passages 4 and 8. Cell Transfection—The EGFP vector containing wild-type Rac was a generous gift from Dr. M. Philips (New York University School of Medicine, New York), pCMV5 vector and vectors containing dominant negative Rho mutant (N19Rho) or dominant negative Rac mutant (N17Rac) were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kozasa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). The DNA was purified using the Endo-free Qiagen kit. For cell transfection, HPAE cells were trypsinized, mixed with DNA of interest and salmon sperm DNA in 0.4-cm cuvettes, followed by electroporation at 950 microfarads and 180 mV using the Bio-Rad electroporator. The cells were used at 24 h after transfection when there was evidence of the expression of protein. Immunofluorescence and Live Cell Imaging—Cells were stimulated with S1P (1 μm) for the indicated times, rinsed quickly with ice-cold HBSS, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in HBSS followed by incubation for 20 min with 1% ovalbumin. Cells were then incubated with anti-VE-cadherin, anti-β-catenin, or anti-p120-catenin Abs. Following incubation, cells were rinsed and incubated with appropriate Alexa-labeled secondary Abs. Cells were then rinsed 6 times with HBSS and mounted with anti-fade media. Cells were viewed using a 63 × 1.2 NA objective Zeiss LSM-510 META confocal microscope using appropriate filters. For live cell imaging, cells transfected with EGFP-Rac were washed with HBSS supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and placed on confocal microscope.

For loading cells with fura 2-AM, cells grown on 25-mm coverslips were incubated with 3 μm fura for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 2 times with HBSS and imaged using an Attoflor Ratio Vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope and a F-Fluar ×40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Regions of interest in individual cells were marked and excited at 334 and 380 nm with emission at 520 nm. The 334/380-excitation ratio, which increased as a function of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, was captured at 5-s intervals. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recording in Endothelial Cells—Patch clamp recording in the whole cell configuration was performed as described on HPAE cells attached to a coverslip (17Nilius B. Droogmans G.

SOC currents were measured at the holding potential (–50 mV) following application of S1P. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Western Blotting—HPAE or HUVE monolayers were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS sample buffer. Proteins from each lysate were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with Edg-1 or actin Abs. Rac Activity Assay—pGEX-2T containing PAK binding domain was kindly provided by Dr. I. Lopez (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Bacterial expressed glutathione S-transferase-PAK binding domain was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranozide (1 mm)-induced DH5α cells previously transformed with the appropriate plasmid as described (24Kouklis P. Konstantoulaki M. Vogel S. Broman M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Confluent HPAE cells grown in 100-mm dishes were stimulated for the indicated times with 0.1 to 1 μm S1P. Cells were then quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m NaCl, 2% Igepal, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-PBD beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Rac bound to beads was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-Rac Ab. In addition, cell lysate from each sample was Western blotted with anti-Rac Ab to confirm equal protein loading in each lane. Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement—The time course of endothelial cell retraction, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was assessed by recording transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) as described (25Tiruppathi C.

Briefly, HPAE cells grown on the electrodes were serum-deprived for 1 h and then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of S1P to determine the TER across the monolayer. The small electrode and larger counterelectrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was supplied by a 10-V 4 KHz alternating current connected serially to a 1 mΩ resistor between the small electrode and larger counterelectrode. The voltage between the small and large electrodes was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a PC. Data are presented as percentage change in their resistive (in-phase) portion of impedance normalized to its initial value at time 0. Statistical Analysis—Comparison between experimental groups was made using paired t test using SigmaPlot software. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. S1P-induced Increase in Intracellular Ca2+Is Associated with Increased Rac Activity and Enhancement of Endothelial Barrier Function—Studies show that S1P enhances barrier function via Edg-1 receptor-mediated activation of Gi signaling (6Garcia J.G.

In other studies, S1P has been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ (14Young K.W. Nahorski S.R. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Muraki K. Imaizumi Y. J.

We therefore determined the effects of S1P on intracellular Ca2+, Rac activity, and barrier function in HPAE cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Edg-1 receptor is expressed in HPAE cells. In fura 2-loaded HPAE cells, S1P increased intracellular Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We show using the glutathione S-transferase-PAK binding domain that S1P induced the activation of Rac within 2 min, in agreement with previous findings (6Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A.

Physiol. 2003; 94: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the response was sustained for up to 20 min (Fig. 1C). Maximum increase in Rac activity was observed at the S1P concentration of 1 μm. S1P in a dose-dependent manner rapidly enhanced endothelial barrier function as reflected by an increase in TER (Fig. 1E). The possibility that the effect of S1P on barrier stabilization is not the result of S1P metabolites such as SPH, we determined the response to SPH on TER across the monolayer. In contrast to S1P, 1 μm SPH slowly increased TER, which at 12 min was only 17% of 1 μm S1P-induced TER (Fig. 1E). Thus, the S1P-induced increase in endothelial barrier function is not the result of S1P metabolism into SPH. As the maximum increase in intracellular Ca2+, Rac activity, and barrier function was observed at 1 μm S1P, we used 1 μm S1P in all subsequent experiments to address the role of intracellular Ca2+ in regulating the S1P-mediated increase in Rac activity and barrier enhancement. S1P Induces Rac-dependent Assembly of Endothelial Junctions and Barrier Enhancement—We investigated the dynamics of Rac using time-lapse imaging of GFP-Rac to determine the effects of S1P in translocating Rac to the inter-endothelial junctions and junctional sealing. We used HPAE cells expressing low levels of GFP-Rac for the imaging studies. In unstimulated cells, Rac was primarily localized near the perinuclear area with some present at the cell contact sites (Fig. 2A). Application of S1P resulted in redistribution of Rac to cell junctions within minutes, in association with forming intercellular junctions (arrow shows the loss of interjunctional gaps following addition of S1P) (Fig. 2A). We next determined the effects of S1P in inducing adherens junction assembly. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with S1P and then they were fixed and stained with β-catenin or VE-cadherin Abs. As shown in Fig. 2B, S1P promoted the assembly of β-catenin and VE-cadherin in junctions in the form of a thick band, which effectively sealed the junctions. We contrasted the roles of Rho and Rac in S1P-induced enhancement of the endothelial barrier by determining TER. HPAE cells transfected with vector, N17Rac (dominant negative Rac), or N19Rho (dominant negative Rho) were seeded onto gold-plated electrodes, and then stimulated with S1P. S1P failed to promote the endothelial barrier in cells overexpressing dominant negative Rac mutant (Fig. 2, C and D). However, S1P-induced barrier enhancement was not affected in cells expressing dominant negative Rho mutant (Fig. 2, C and D). Altogether, these findings indicate that Rac is involved in signaling S1P-induced endothelial barrier enhancement by promoting assembly of AJs. Role of Ca2+Signaling in S1P-induced Endothelial Barrier Enhancement—Studies show that S1P induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by a Gi-PLC-mediated pathway (14Young K.W. Nahorski S.R. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Muraki K. Imaizumi Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18997-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the possibility that a rise in intracellular Ca2+ is responsible for signaling Rac activation, and thus promotes endothelial barrier enhancement in response to S1P. We pretreated HPAE cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), to block Gi activation, and stimulated cells with S1P and determined the changes in TER, cytosolic Ca2+, and Rac activity. S1P failed to increase intracellular Ca2+ in PTX-pretreated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Also inhibition of Gi prevented the increase in Rac activity and TER in response to S1P (Fig. 3, C and E). To determine the role of PLC in mediating the S1P response, we used U73122, an inhibitor of PLC (27Thompson A.K. Mostafapour S.P. Denlinger L.C. Bleasdale J.E. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23856-23862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that pretreatment with U73122 prevented the S1P-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A and B). PLC inhibition also prevented Rac activation in response to S1P (Fig. 3D) and barrier function enhancement (Fig. 3F). We also observed that the basal activity of Rac was reduced in HPAE cells pretreated with either PTX or U73122 (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that normal Gi and PLC activity is required for maintaining Rac activity under basal conditions. Thus, S1P activates endothelial barrier enhancement via a pathway involving Gi, PLC, increase in intracellular Ca2+, and this in turn leads to Rac activation. To determine the possibility that S1P-activated Ca2+ mobilization and Rac-mediated enhancement of barrier function are casually related, we used the membrane permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-2AM. Fig. 4, A and B, shows the effects of BAPTA-AM on S1P-induced Rac activation and adherens junction assembly. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM alone interfered with Rac activity and disassembly of adherens junctions. S1P failed to induce Rac activation and assembly of AJs in this experiment (Fig. 4A). Simultaneous measurement of intracellular Ca2+ confirmed that BAPTA-AM effectively blocked the S1P-induced intracellular Ca2+ rise (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the results show that intracellular Ca2+ is required for S1P-mediated Rac activation and enhancement of endothelial barrier function. Ca2+Release from Stores Is a Requirement for S1P-induced Endothelial Barrier Enhancement—S1P may increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration by mobilizing the release of Ca2+ from ER stores and subsequently activating membrane Ca2+ entry through non-selective cation"
https://openalex.org/W1983957728,"Vinculin is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction that masks binding sites for talin and F-actin. Although a recent structural model explains autoinhibition solely in terms of the interaction between vinculin tail (Vt) and residues 1–258 (D1), we find an absolute requirement for an interface involving the D4 domain of head (Vh residues 710–836) and Vt. Charge-to-alanine mutations in Vt revealed a class of mutants, T12 and T19, distal to the V-(1–258) binding site, which showed increases in their Kd values for head binding of 100- and 42-fold, respectively. Reciprocal mutation of residues in the D4 domain that contact Vt yielded a head-tail interaction mutant of comparable magnitude to T19. These findings account for the approximately 120-fold difference in Kd values between Vt binding to V-(1–258), as opposed to full-length Vh-(1–851). The significance of a bipartite autoinhibitory site is evidenced by its effects on talin binding to Vh. Whereas Vt fails to compete with the talin rod domain for binding to V-(1–258), competition occurs readily with full-length Vh, and this requires the D4 interface. Moreover in intact vinculin, mutations in the D4-Vt interface stabilize association of vinculin and talin rod. In cells, these head-tail interaction mutants induce hypertrophy and elongation of focal adhesions. Definition of a second autoinhibitory site, the D4-Vt interface, supports the competing model of vinculin activation that invokes cooperative action of ligands at two sites.

Several functions, mostly related to cell adhesion and motility processes, have been ascribed to vinculin. Disruption of vinculin expression in mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype, with severe cardiac and brain abnormalities (1Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D.

However, the binding of intact vinculin to these potential ligands is highly restricted by conformational regulation of vinculin structure. An autoinhibitory interaction between the vinculin head and tail domains directly masks binding sites for talin (18Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This has led to a proposed model of vinculin function in which cell adhesion transduces a signal that disrupts the autoinhibitory interaction and permits engagement of the vinculin cytoskeletal targets within the focal adhesion (17Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies on the autoinhibited conformation of vinculin have revealed that the principal binding site for head-tail interaction is comprised of a large hydrophobic interface between the D1 domain of vinculin (residues 1–258) and the top of the five helix bundle structure comprising the vinculin tail (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Izard T.

Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Importantly, this interface is disrupted upon binding of a talin-derived peptide (VBS3) to the D1 domain. Binding of VBS3 to D1 results in a dramatic conformational change, termed helical bundle conversion, which cannot be competed by the addition of excess tail domain (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This observation led to a proposed mechanism for vinculin activation in which binding of talin serves as the driving force behind conformational change (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol.

Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but only at concentrations of 500–1000-fold molar excess to vinculin. In light of the fact that the D1-Vt interface is nearly identical in the bimolecular complex (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and in the structure of full-length vinculin (21Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Izard T.

Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of intact vinculin led us to speculate that the high affinity autoinhibited state derived either from the intramolecular nature of the D1·Vt complex, or from cooperativity between multiple interdomain interaction sites, but we previously could not assess the relative contribution of these two factors. Here we present results of biochemical and mutagenesis studies that support a model in which the autoinhibited state of vinculin is achieved by two separate interfaces; one of these comprises the D1-Vt interface seen in the structures of chicken and human vinculin (22Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 21Borgon R.A.

We find that D1 binds weakly to Vt in solution, with a Kd near 10 μm, whereas Vh-(1–851) binds with a Kd of ∼0.1 μm.We then show that the increased affinity of the autoinhibitory complex is attributable to the D4-Vt interface. This analysis redefines the autoinhibitory Vh domain as D1-D4, rather than D1 (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or D1-D3 (22Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and enables us to provide a detailed model for autoinhibition that accounts for the functional insufficiency of talin for activating native vinculin (22Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Expression Constructs—Vt-(884–1066) was cloned into the pET15b expression vector as previously described (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). pET15b/V-(1–258) and pET15b/Vh-(1–851) were constructed as follows. Using in-frame primers containing 5′-NdeI and 3′-XhoI sites, appropriate regions of the chicken vinculin cDNA sequence (26Coutu M.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), followed by addition of 3′-adenosine overhangs with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The PCR products were ligated into the TOPO II plasmid (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pET15b His tag expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using NdeI and XhoI digestion of the multiple cloning site. To generate fluorescently tagged expression vectors, we cloned the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) cDNA using a similar strategy as outlined above. Briefly, the YFP cDNA was amplified by PCR using the pEYFP vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as template and in-frame primers containing 5′- and 3′-NdeI sites. Nde-flanked YFP was subcloned into pET15b/V-(1–851) or pET15b/V-(1–258) to yield pET15b/YFP/V-(1–851) and pET15b/YFP/V-(1–258), respectively. pEGFP/vinculin was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-flanked vinculin cDNA from p1005 (26Coutu M.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) into the pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech). pEGFP and pET15b/YFP vinculin plasmids contain a 12-residue spacer between the EGFP and vinculin. pET30a/talin rod-(397–2541) was a generous gift from Drs. Baodong Xing and Stephen Lam. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The clustered charge-to-alanine mutations in pET15b/Vt and the N773A;E775A mutations in pET15b/Vh-(1–851) were introduced by QuikChange PCR (Stratagene) per the manufacturer's instructions. QuikChange PCR was also utilized to introduce the T12, T8/19, and N773;E775A mutations into pEGFP/vinculin. The entire vinculin cDNA coding region in these plasmids was then verified to ensure that only the desired mutations were introduced. Protein Expression and Purification—pET expression vectors were transformed into either BL21(DE3) Gold or RIL(DE3) Codon Plus competent cells (Stratagene). For expression of YFP-tagged proteins, bacterial cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium + 1% glucose at 37 °C, and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 20 °C. His-tagged YFP-Vh, YFP/V1–258, and Vt were isolated using nickel affinity chromatography with His-Bind resin (Novagen) as described previously (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). YFP fusion proteins were cleaved with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) to remove their N-terminal His6 tags. Proteins were dialyzed into Fusion Protein Storage (FPS) buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.02% azide, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (PICS) (27Siliciano J.D. Craig S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and stored at 4 °C. Proteolytic Vh derived from V8 cleavage of chicken gizzard vinculin was prepared as described previously (18Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged talin rod was purified as described previously (28Xing B. Jedsadayanmata A. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44373-44378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To enrich for full-length talin rod, the eluate from the His-Bind column was purified over DE52 resin using conditions described for purification of native talin from chicken gizzard (29O'Halloran T. Molony L. Burridge K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Screen for Head Binding Mutants in Vt—Binding of proteolytic Vh to recombinant His-tagged Vt mutants, 0.1 μm each, was assayed as described in the figure legends. Vt was recovered quantitatively on His-Bind resin, and the Vh remaining in the supernatant determined by Micro-BCA (Pierce). YFP Fluorescence Supernatant Depletion Assay—YFP fusion protein (Vh or D1) at 0.2 μm was incubated with His-tagged Vt as indicated in the figure legends. Complexes were bound to NTA beads, and the fluorescence remaining in the supernatant was assayed by fluorometry. Fluorometry and Data Analysis—Fluorescent samples were assayed on a FluoroMax-3 fluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) equipped with a thermoregulated sample compartment (21C). YFP was excited at 490 nm, and peak emission monitored at 527 nm, with excitation and emission slit widths of 3 and 5 mm, respectively. The fraction of YFP-Vh or YFP-D1 bound was measured as a function of change in the 527-nm emission relative to the maximum fluorescence observed in mock Vt-treated controls. Free Vt concentrations were calculated from the total Vt concentration less the concentration of Vh or D1 bound (autoinhibitory complexes have a 1:1 stoichiometry). Bound Vh was plotted against free Vt concentrations in Kaleidograph and Kd values computed by non-linear fitting of the Scatchard equation: Fraction Bound = [Free Vt]/([Free Vt] + Kd). Actin Binding Assay—G-actin was purified as described (30Spudich J. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Vt binding to F-actin was assayed by a cosedimentation assay as described in the figure legends. Complexes were separated on 15% acrylamide, 0.8% bis-acrylamide Laemmli gels, and Vt in the pellet fractions quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue staining. Ternary Complex Pull-down Assay—Complex formation between Vt-(884–1066), D1-(1–258), and V-(259–850) was screened with a His-Bind resin pull-down assay as described in the figure legends. Bound material was eluted from the resin in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Pellet and supernatant fractions were assayed on 12% acrylamide, 0.8% bis-acrylamide SDS gels, and proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Native Gel Assay—Vt was assayed for the ability to disrupt preformed complexes of YFP-Vh (WT or N773;E775A mutant) and talin rod, as described in the figure legends. Complexes were resolved on a 7.5% acrylamide native gel, using a 40 mm triethanolamine, 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, running buffer. YFP fluorescence was then imaged on the Alpha Innotech system (Alpha Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA) and intensity measurement and analysis performed in NIH Image software. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were provided by Dr. Peter Devreotes at Johns Hopkins University. Vinculin-null cells were a generous gift from Dr. Eileen Adamson, The Burnham Institute. Both cell lines were cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). For transfection, HEK293 cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 cells on gelatin coated 10-cm culture dishes and grown overnight. Each plate was transfected with 3 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM for 4 h. Vinculin-null cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin at 0.25 × 106 cells. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus in serum-free DMEM for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were briefly rinsed with DPBS and refed with growth media for 24–48 h. Pull-down Assays in Cell Lysates—Hypotonic lysates of HEK293 expressing GFP-vinculin (WT or mutant) were assayed for binding to talin rod or F-actin as described in the figure legends. Pellet fractions were resolved on a 7.5% acrylamide, 0.8% bis-acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Immunoblotting—Western blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. 8d4 antitalin, hVin1 anti-vinculin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG antibodies were obtained from Sigma. C4 anti-actin was a gift from Dr. Jim Lessard. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Vt (Cottontail sera) was raised against His-tagged chicken Vt-(884–1066). All monoclonal antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution. Anti-Vt was used at 1:2500. Microscopy—Transfected cells were fixed as described in the figure legends. Coverslips were mounted in an anti-fade solution containing 12% (w/v) Elvanol and 0.12% paraphenylenediamine. Images were acquired on an upright Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Germany) microscope attached to a SensiCam (CookeCorp, Tonawanda, NY) CCD camera using the IPLab software package from Scanalytics (Fairfax, VA). Digital images were imported into Adobe Photoshop for figure preparation. Screen for Head Binding Mutants of Vt—Prior to determination of three-dimensional structural models, analysis of the vinculin primary sequence suggested a role for electrostatic interactions in the head-tail interaction. First, the pIs of the head and tail domains, 5.5 and 9.6, are complementary in nature, and second, a high proportion of lysine and arginine residues in vinculin tail are conserved evolutionarily. Based on these observations, we screened for head binding mutants of Vt using a charge-to-alanine mutagenesis scheme outlined in Fig. 1B. Twenty charge-to-alanine mutations were designed in windows of five to seven amino acids along Vt and introduced into pET15b/V-(884–1066). The ability of the tail mutants to bind Vh-(1–851) was screened in pull-down experiments measuring loss of Vh in response to His-tagged tail domains immobilized on nickel-charged agarose beads (Fig. 2A). The large majority of mutations had little or no effect on head binding, suggesting that the mutations were not globally disruptive to tail structure and that specific side chain interactions played a more important role than overall charge character of Vt. The mutagenesis was highly successful in defining a subset of mutants affecting head binding, namely T8 (K944;R945A), T12 (D974;K975;R976; R978A), T14 (K996;K1002A), and T19 (K1047;R1049;D1051A). When the structure of Vt was determined (32Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we saw that these mutations implicate two structurally distinct head binding regions on Vt (Fig. 2B); namely a basic patch at the base of the helical bundle, defined by T12 and T19, and a cluster on the faces of helices 3 and 4 comprised of T8 and K996 of T14 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we also found that the effect of combining mutations from these two candidate head binding sites, such as in the T8/19 double mutant, potentiated the head binding defect, consistent with biochemically distinct contributions of the two interaction surfaces (Fig. 2A). These mutations appear to define specific residues involved in the head-tail binding site, as they have only minimal effects on the ability of Vt to cosediment with F-actin filaments (Fig. 2C). Quantitative Dissection of the Head-Tail Interaction Surface—The clustering of strong head-tail interaction mutations at the base of Vt is unexpected given the recently proposed structural model for the autoinhibitory head-tail interaction, in which the top of the Vt bundle exclusively contacts the D1 domain in vinculin head, and this interaction is proposed to account for the high affinity, autoinhibited state of vinculin (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of the head binding mutants of Vt, we decided to compare the D1 domain (residues 1–258) with Vh-(1–851) for binding to Vt. We developed a quantitative, solution phase assay to measure Kd values for head-tail interaction, using a fluorescent supernatant depletion of YFP-tagged Vh by His-tagged Vt. The results show that the interaction between D1 and Vt is relatively weak in solution, with a Kd of 11.5 μm (Fig. 3B). In stark contrast, the observed Kd for YFP-Vh is 93 nm (Fig. 3A), slightly above the 50 nm binding reported for proteolytic Vh (18Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of a YFP tag has only modest effects on head-tail binding. Although it has been reported that D1 binds Vt with nanomolar affinity in a solid-phase binding assay (33Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), such assays introduce systemic error in Kd measurement by failing to account for the high local concentration effect of ligand immobilization. Also, solid phase assays can increase apparent affinities of protein-protein interactions by reducing protein flexibility upon immobilization, thus lowering entropic costs of binding. The 120-fold difference in Kd observed between the D1·Vt (11.5 μm) and Vh·Vt (93 nm) complexes is best reconciled by the existence of an auxiliary head-tail interaction site. Therefore, we tested whether the T12-T19 surface on Vt could account quantitatively for the additional binding energy manifest in the full-length Vh·Vt complex. Using the fluorescence supernatant depletion assay, we measured the binding affinities of the tail mutants for Vh. As shown in Table I, the T19 and T12 mutations increase the Kd for head binding by factors of 42- and 100-fold, respectively. In the case of the most severe mutant, T12, the overall loss of affinity closely predicts the difference in Kd values observed in Fig. 3B between D1 and full-length Vh. Single mutations in the T12 cluster, R976A and R978A have intermediate effects on binding to Vh (Table I). In contrast, the T8 and T14 mutations, which cluster near the structurally defined D1-Vt interaction site, exert relatively mild effects of 6–8-fold increases in the observed Kd for Vh binding. This result is consistent with the overall hydrophobic character of this interface as described in the co-crystal of D1 and Vt (20Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and establishes function for the contacts noted between Lys944, Arg945 (T8), and D1 in that structure.Table ISummary of Kd measurements for Vt mutants affecting the head-tail interactionVt sampleKdFold increaseμmWT0.091T80.556T140.778.3R976A0.758.1R978A0.677.2T12>10>100T193.942T8/199.298 Open table in a new tab Definition of the Role of the D4 Domain in Head-Tail Interaction—The mutagenic studies predicted the existence of an auxiliary tail binding site in Vh that would make specific contacts with the T12/T19 surface on Vt.

https://openalex.org/W2164945201,"Increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression is associated with intimal hyperplasia in saphenous vein (SV) bypass grafts. Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can prevent the progression of vein graft failure. Here we investigated whether statins inhibited MMP-9 secretion from cultured human SV smooth muscle cells (SMC) and examined the underlying mechanisms. SV-SMC from different patients were exposed to phorbol ester (TPA) or PDGF-BB plus interleukin-1alpha (IL-1). MMP-9 secretion and mRNA expression were analyzed using gelatin zymography and RT-PCR, respectively. Specific signal transduction pathways were investigated by immunoblotting and pharmacological inhibition. Simvastatin reduced TPA- and PDGF/IL-1-induced MMP-9 secretion and mRNA levels, effects reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and mimicked by inhibiting Rho geranylgeranylation or Rho-kinase (ROCK). MMP-9 secretion induced by PDGF/IL-1 was mediated via the ERK, p38 MAPK, and NFkappaB pathways, whereas that induced by TPA was mediated specifically via the ERK pathway. Simvastatin failed to inhibit activation of these signaling pathways. Moreover, simvastatin did not affect MMP-9 mRNA stability. Together these data suggest that simvastatin reduces MMP-9 secretion from human SV-SMC by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway and decreasing MMP-9 mRNA levels independently of effects on signaling pathways required for MMP-9 gene expression."

These results represent the first direct identification of multiple sites of O-glycan attachment in IgA1 hinge region by mass spectrometry, thereby enabling future characterization at the molecular level of aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 in diseases such as IgA nephropathy. Several human diseases of autoimmune or chronic inflammatory character exhibit abnormal glycosylation of serum proteins, including immunoglobulins (1Rudd P. Elliott T. Cresswell P. Wilson I.A.

The Gal-deficient IgA1 in the circulation is exclusively present in circulating immune complexes and is mostly a J-chain-containing polymer (20Tomana M. Novak J. Julian B.A. Matousovic K. Konecny K. Mestecky J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the absence of Gal, the terminal sugar is GalNAc (19Tomana M. Matousovic K. Julian B.A. Radl J.

It is hypothesized that these Gal-deficient IgA1-containing circulating immune complexes are not efficiently cleared in IgAN patients and thus deposit in the mesangium where they bind to and activate the resident mesangial cells, inducing cellular proliferation and matrix overproduction (9Novak J.

Hypertens. 2004; 13: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In fact, these Gal-deficient IgA1-containing complexes bind to mesangial cells more efficiently than uncomplexed IgA1 or similarly sized IgA1-containing complexes from healthy controls (25Novak J.

Characterization of a carbohydrate or glycopeptide species is done tandem-in-time by isolation of a given precursor ion followed by fragmentation and detection of the resulting fragment (product) ions.

These studies suggest ECD FT-ICR MS could be a valuable tool for the analysis of Gal-deficient IgA1 HR. Here we analyze O-glycans of synthetic IgA1 HR and a naturally Gal-deficient polymeric (p) IgA1 myeloma protein. We have shown previously (20Tomana M. Novak J. Julian B.A. Matousovic K. Konecny K. Mestecky J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) that this IgA1 can inhibit re-association of IgA1-containing immune complexes, suggesting that this IgA1 protein has properties similar to the aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 present in the circulation of IgA nephropathy patients. We observed a heterogeneous population of glycosylated IgA1 HR as in prior studies (15Novak J. Tomana M. Kilian M. Coward L. Kulhavy R. Barnes S. Mestecky J. Mol.

Four and five glycan chains composed of either a GalNAc-Gal disaccharide or a GalNAc monosaccharide were localized to 5 of the 10 possible sites of O-glycosylation in the myeloma IgA1 HR. These analytical approaches will be used in the future for characterization of O-glycans in IgA1 from IgAN patients. Synthesis of IgA1 HR Peptide and Glycopeptide Variants—A panel of 19-mer hinge region peptide and glycopeptides, with an α-O-linked GalNAc residue, corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the human IgA1 HR were synthesized by and purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Purity and molecular weight of the preparations were confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The following HR peptide and glycopeptides used: HP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPS; 4-HP (GalNAc attached to Thr4 and so on), VPS-(GalNAc)TPPTPSPSTPPTPSPS; 7-HP, VPSTPP-(GalNAc)TPSPSTPPTPSPS; 9-HP, VPSTPPTP-(GalNAc)SPSTPPTPSPS; 11-HP, VPSTPPTPSP-(GalNAc)STPPTPSPS; 15-HP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPP-(GalNAc)TPSPS; 4-15-HP, VPS-(GalNAc)TPP-(GalNAc)TP-(GalNAc)SP-(GalNAc)STPP-(GalNAc)TPSPS. Isolation of IgA1 HR Glycopeptide from a Myeloma IgA1 (Mce)—HR from pIgA1 myeloma protein (Mce) was isolated as a tryptic-peptic fragment following the procedure described by Wolfenstein-Todel and co-workers (48Wolfenstein-Todel C.

Monosaccharide Compositional Analysis—The monosaccharides from purified myeloma IgA1 HR were determined as trifluoroacetates of methylglycosides by gas chromatography as described previously (50Tomana M. Prchal J.T. Garner L.C. Skalka H.W. Barker S.A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1984; 103: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar).

About 10 μg of HR glycopeptide was used for the analysis.

We focused on the effects of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation during cardiac hypertrophy on the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ, which is the predominant PPAR subtype in cardiac cells and plays a prominent role in the regulation of cardiac lipid metabolism. Phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes caused a reduction in the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), a target gene of PPARβ/δ involved in fatty acid utilization, and a fall in palmitate oxidation that was reversed by NF-κB inhibitors. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of NF-κB in embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 myotubes, which only express PPARβ/δ, caused both a reduction in Pdk4 expression and DNA binding activity of PPARβ/δ to its response element, effects that were reversed by NF-κB inhibitors. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide strongly stimulated the physical interaction between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and PPARβ/δ, providing an explanation for the reduced activity of PPARβ/δ. Finally, we assessed whether this mechanism was present in vivo in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In hypertrophied hearts of banded rats the reduction in the expression of Pdk4 was accompanied by activation of NF-κB and enhanced interaction between p65 and PPARβ/δ. These results indicate that NF-κB activation during cardiac hypertrophy down-regulates PPARβ/δ activity, leading to a fall in fatty acid oxidation, through a mechanism that involves enhanced protein-protein interaction between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and PPARβ/δ.

Cardiac hypertrophy is a response of the heart to a wide range of extrinsic stimuli, such as arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy. Although this process is initially compensatory for an increase in workload, its prolongation frequently results in congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death (1Levy D. Garrison R.J.

Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an increase in glucose utilization and a decrease in fatty acid oxidation, which is characteristic of the fetal heart (3Taegtmeyer H. Overturf M.L. Hypertension. 1988; 11: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S.H. Bastin J. Mccune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is still a matter of controversy whether changes in intracellular substrate and metabolite levels in cardiomyocytes are a consequence or the reason for cardiac hypertrophy. However, several factors support a role for cardiac metabolism in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes cause childhood hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5Kelly D.P. Strauss A.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and perturbation of fatty acid oxidation in animal models causes cardiac hypertrophy (6Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Chiu H.C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), demonstrating that substrate utilization is important in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy. Nonetheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms linking cardiac hypertrophy and the fall in the expression of genes involved in cardiac fatty acid metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response elements; NF, nuclear factor; PE, phenylephrine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; APRT, adenosyl phosphoribosyl transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response elements; NF, nuclear factor; PE, phenylephrine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; APRT, adenosyl phosphoribosyl transferase. are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and oxidation, lipid metabolism, and inflammation (8Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). The PPAR subfamily consists of three subtypes, PPARα (NR1C1 according to the unified nomenclature system for the nuclear receptor superfamily), PPARβ/δ (NR1C2), and PPARγ (NR1C3) (9Auwerx J. Baulieu E. Beato M. Becker-Andre M. Burbach P.H. Camerino G. Chambon P. Cooney A. Dejean A. Dreyer C. Evans R.M. Gannon F. Giguere V. Gronemeyer H. Gustafson J.A. Laudet V.

PPARα is expressed primarily in tissues that have a high level of fatty acid catabolism such as liver, brown fat, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle (10Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). PPARβ/δ is ubiquitously expressed, and PPARγ has a restricted pattern of expression, mainly in white and brown adipose tissues, whereas other tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart contain limited amounts. To be transcriptionally active, PPARs need to heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (NR2B). PPAR-retinoic acid receptor heterodimers bind to DNA-specific sequences called peroxisome proliferator-response elements (PPREs), consisting of an imperfect direct repeat of the consensus binding site for nuclear hormone receptors (AGGTCA) separated by one nucleotide (DR-1). These sequences have been characterized within the promoter regions of PPAR target genes. However, the regulation of gene transcription by PPARs extends beyond their ability to transactivate specific target genes. PPARs are also able to regulate gene expression independently of binding to DNA through a mechanism termed receptor-dependent trans-repression (11Daynes R.A. Jones D.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). One of these mechanisms involves a physical interaction of PPARα with nuclear factor (NF)-κB, that may lead to suppression activity of the former (12Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NF-κB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the hypertrophic growth of the myocardium and its inhibition blocks or attenuates the hypertrophic response of cultured cardiac myocytes (13Purcell N.H.

Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes as well as the embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells, clearly demonstrated that PPARβ/δ is the predominant PPAR subtype in cardiac cells and plays a prominent role in the regulation of cardiac lipid metabolism, we focused on the effects of NF-κB activation during cardiac hypertrophy on PPARβ/δ activity. Furthermore, to avoid interference of the other PPAR subtypes we took advantage of the use of the embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 myotubes, which only express PPARβ/δ. Our findings indicate that NF-κB activation down-regulates PPARβ/δ activity, leading to a fall in fatty acid oxidation through a mechanism involving enhanced protein-protein interaction between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and PPARβ/δ. Cell Culture—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (18Kimura Y. Otsu K. Nishida K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1145-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The media was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with transferrin (10 μg/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), and bromodeoxyuridine (0.1 mmol/liters) 24 h before treatments. In this study phenylephrine (PE) was used to stimulate neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in the absence or presence of 10 μmol/liter parthenolide for the last 6 h. Animal handling and disposal were performed in accordance with law 5/1995, 21st July, of the Generalitat de Catalunya. The embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells (ATCC) were maintained in growth medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H9c2 cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 and allowed to proliferate in growth medium. Medium was changed every 3 days. To induce differentiation of H9c2 myoblasts into myotubes, growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum) when cells had reached near confluence. For mRNA analysis H9c2 cells were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μmol/liter parthenolide for the last 6 h. Incorporation of [3H]Leucine—To examine the effect of PE on protein synthesis, the incorporation of [3H]leucine was measured essentially by the method of Thaik et al. (19Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were treated with PE in the presence or absence of pathenolide and coincubated with [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min to precipitate the protein. The precipitates were then dissolved in NaOH (0.25 n). Aliquots were counted with a scintillation counter. Fatty Acid Oxidation—Experiments to determine the oxidation capacity of 9,10-[3H]palmitate (Amersham Biosciences) oxidation were performed as previously described (20Cabrero A. Alegret M. Sanchez R.M. Adzet T. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Pressure Overload-induced Cardiac Hypertrophy—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225 to 250 g) were maintained under standard conditions of illumination (12-h light/dark cycle) and temperature (21 ± 1 °C). They were fed a standard diet (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) for 5 days before the studies began. The animals were randomly distributed into two groups: sham-operated rats and pressure overloaded rats. Pressure overload was induced by constriction of the abdominal aorta at the suprarenal level with 7-0 nylon strings by ligation with a blunted 25-gauge needle, which was then pulled out. For the age-matched sham operation, the identical procedure was performed except that the suture was not tied around the aorta. Hearts were harvested 15 days after the surgical operation. The heart weight/body weight ratio was calculated and the heart samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C. Animal handling and disposal were performed in accordance with the law 5/1995, 21st July, from the Generalitat de Catalunya. RNA Preparation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by using the Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx, Houston). The total RNA isolated by this method is undegraded and free of protein and DNA contamination. Relative levels of specific mRNAs were assessed by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as previously described (21Cabrero A. Alegret M. Sanchez R.M. Adzet T. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10100-10107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The sequences of the sense and antisense primers used for amplification were: Anf, 5′-TCCTCTTCCTGGCCTTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-AGACGGGTTGCTTCCCCAGTC-3′; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (Mcp-1), 5′-GGGCCTGTTGTTCACAGTTGC-3′ and 5′-GGGACACCTGCTGCTGGTGAT-3′; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), 5′-GAACACCCCTTCCGTCCAGCT-3′ and 5′-TGTGCCATCGTAGGGACCACA-3′; and Aprt (adenosyl phosphoribosyl transferase), 5′-GCCTCTTGGCCAGTCACCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCTCACACACTCCACCA-3′. Amplification of each gene yielded a single band of the expected size (Anf, 234 bp; Mcp-1, 157 bp; Pdk4, 168 bp; and Aprt, 329 bp). The results for the expression of specific mRNAs are always presented relative to the expression of the control gene (Aprt). Immunoblotting—Cell lysates and nuclear extracts from H9c2 cells were obtained as previously described (21Cabrero A. Alegret M. Sanchez R.M. Adzet T. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10100-10107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% separation gels and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), PPARβ/δ (gift of Dr. Walter Wahli), and β-tubulin (Sigma). Detection was achieved using the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek Ltd., Ashrat, Israel). Size of detected proteins was estimated using protein molecular mass standards (Invitrogen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—H9c2 cells were pretreated with inhibitors of NF-κB, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (5 mm), parthenolide (10 μm), or the PPARβ/δ activator L-165041 (10 μm) 24 h before LPS (10 ng/ml) stimulation for 1 h. Isolation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as previously described (21Cabrero A. Alegret M. Sanchez R.M. Adzet T. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10100-10107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation—Cell nuclear extracts were brought to a final volume of 0.5 ml with buffer containing 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 8.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg/ml nonfat milk for 6 h at 4 °C, and incubated with 4 μg of anti-p65. Immunocomplex was captured by incubating the samples with protein A-agarose suspension overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. After microcentrifugation, the pellet was washed with 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against PPARβ/δ. Statistical Analyses—Results were obtained from at least four independent experiments and presented as mean ± S.D. Significant differences were established by Student's t test or analysis of variance, according to the number of groups compared. When significant variations were found, the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was performed (GraphPad Software version 2.03) (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Down-regulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation in Hypertrophied Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes Is Reversed by NF-κB Inhibitors—Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by increased protein content (e.g. [3H]leucine uptake) and induction of fetal-type genes (e.g. Anf). PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy enhanced [3H]leucine incorporation (1.6-fold, p < 0.001) and mRNA levels of Anf in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (∼2-fold induction, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we evaluated whether induction of cardiac hypertrophy led to a reduction in the expression of cardiac genes involved in lipid metabolism. We examined the expression of the PPARβ/δ target gene (22Tanaka T. Yamamoto J. Iwasaki S. Asaba H. Hamura H. Ikeda Y. Watanabe M. Magoori K. Ioka R.X. Tachibana K. Watanabe Y. Uchiyama Y. Sumi K. Iguchi H. Ito S. Doi T. Hamakubo T. Naito M. Auwerx J. Yanagisawa M. Kodama T. Sakai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15924-15929Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) Pdk4, which suppresses glucose oxidation by its inhibitory effect on the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex leading to an increase in fatty acid utilization (23Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A1355Google Scholar). Induction of cardiac hypertrophy by PE led to a reduction in the transcript levels of Pdk4 (30%, p < 0.05). Because it has been previously demonstrated that PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy involves NF-κB activation (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we confirmed NF-κB activation by measuring in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the mRNA levels of Mcp-1, a gene under the transcriptional control of NF-κB (24Shin W.S. Szuba A. Rockson S.G. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 160: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PE stimulation enhanced 2-fold (p < 0.01) the expression of this gene (Fig. 1C). These findings indirectly suggested a link between activation of NF-κB and reduction in the expression of genes involved in cardiac fatty acid metabolism during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To clearly demonstrate this relationship we assessed the effects of NF-κB inhibitors on the expression of these genes and in palmitate oxidation. The changes in Pdk4 and Mcp-1 mRNA levels in PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy were prevented when cardiomyocytes were incubated with parthenolide, which specifically inhibits activation of NF-κB by preventing IκB degradation (27Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Thus, the 33% reduction (p < 0.05) observed in the transcript levels of Pdk4 after PE stimulation was prevented by parthenolide treatment and even a 5-fold induction was observed compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the 1.8-fold induction (p < 0.05) in Mcp-1 mRNA levels assessed by PE was prevented when cells were incubated with parthenolide (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we determined whether these changes affected the palmitate oxidation rate in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes either in the absence or presence of NF-κB inhibitors such as parthenolide and SN-50, a cell-permeable peptide highly selective against NF-κB (25Maggirwar S.B.

PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy led to a 44% reduction (p < 0.001) in palmitate oxidation compared with untreated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2C). In contrast, when PE-treated cardiomyocytes were coincubated with either parthenolide or SN-50, statistically significant increases were observed in palmitate oxidation compared with cardiomyocytes treated only with PE.Fig. 2Down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation in PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is reversed by NF-κB inhibitors.

However, because PPARα and PPARβ/δ are expressed in neonatal and adult heart (17Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A.J.M. Willemsen P.H.M. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) it is difficult to discard the potential involvement of the former in the changes reported. Thus, to clearly establish the role of PPARβ/δ in the changes observed we used H9c2 myotubes, which only express the PPARβ/δ subtype (17Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A.J.M. Willemsen P.H.M. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), whereas PPARα is undetectable. To activate NF-κB, H9c2 myotubes were stimulated for 1 h with LPS, which has been reported to activate NF-κB in cardiomyocytes (28Takano H. Nagai T. Asakawa M. Toyozaki T. Oka T. Komuro I. Saito T. Masuda Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LPS-induced activation of NF-κB in H9c2 myotubes was confirmed by EMSA and by assessing the expression of Mcp-1. EMSA showed that the NF-κB probe formed three complexes with cardiac nuclear proteins (Fig. 3B, complexes I to III). Specificity of the three DNA-binding complexes was assessed in competition experiments by adding an excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide to incubation mixtures. NF-κB binding activity, mainly of specific complex II, increased in cells stimulated with LPS for 1 h. Characterization of NF-κB was performed by incubating nuclear extracts with an antibody directed against the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Addition of this antibody to incubation mixtures resulted in complete supershift of complex II, demonstrating that this complex contained p65. As expected, a robust induction (7-fold, p < 0.001) was observed in the mRNA levels of the NF-κB target gene Mcp-1 after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3B). This increase was significantly reduced in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor, parthenolide. Furthermore, stimulation of H9c2 myotubes with LPS also caused a 40% reduction in the mRNA levels of Pdk4 that was completely prevented in the presence of parthenolide (Fig. 3C). Therefore, two different stimulus leading to NF-κB activation caused a reduction in the expression of Pdk4 in cardiac cells, strengthening the correlation between both processes. We next sought to determine the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB activation leads to reduced expression of PPARβ/δ target genes, such as Pdk4. EMSA were performed to examine the interaction of PPARs with its cis-regulatory element using a 32P-labeled PPRE probe and cardiac nuclear extracts from H9c2 myotubes stimulated with LPS for 1 h. The PPRE probe formed two main complexes with cardiac nuclear proteins (Fig. 3E, complexes I and II). Competition studies performed with a molar excess of unlabeled probe revealed that both complexes represented specific PPRE-protein interactions. Supershift studies performed using an antibody against PPARδ/β demonstrated that complex I contained this PPAR subtype. In nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated H9c2 myotubes a significant reduction was observed in the binding activity of complex I compared with nuclear extracts from control cells (Fig. 3F). In contrast, this binding activity was restored when LPS-stimulated H9c2 myotubes were coincubated with two inhibitors of NF-κB, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and parthenolide. Nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated H9c2 cells incubated with the selective PPARβ/δ activator L-165041 were used as a positive control to demonstrate that enhanced complex I binding activity was because of increased PPARβ/δ activity. These results clearly indicate that NF-κB activity regulates the binding activity of PPARβ/δ to its cis-regulatory element. NF-κB Activation Enhances the Interaction of p65 with PPARβ/δ—The reduction in the DNA binding activity of PPARβ/δ after LPS treatment may result from different molecular mechanisms. First, these changes may be caused by a reduction in the expression of PPARβ/δ. However, this possibility is unlikely because no significant changes were observed in the protein expression of either PPARβ/δ or the p65 subunit of NF-κB after LPS stimulation (Fig. 4A). In addition, the p65 subunit of NF-κB may interact physically with PPARs. This association has been described for PPARα and prevents this nuclear receptor from binding to its response element and thereby inhibits its ability to induce gene transcription (12Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). It is not known yet if a similar mechanism may affect PPARβ/δ in cardiac cells. To evaluate this possibility we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies with isolated nuclear extracts using antibodies against the p65 subunits of NF-κB and PPARβ/δ. Data shown in Fig. 4B demonstrate that LPS stimulation strongly enhanced the physical interaction between p65 and PPARβ/δ, suggesting that increased association between these two proteins is the mechanism through which PPARβ/δ activity is reduced after LPS stimulation. Enhanced p65-PPARβ/δ Interaction in Pressure Overload-induced Cardiac Hypertrophy—Finally, we wanted to evaluate whether the mechanism proposed was also observed in vivo in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by measuring the heart weight/body weight ratio. This parameter significantly increased (1.35-fold, p < 0.001) after aortic constriction compared with sham-operated rats (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, pressure overload also led to ∼2-fold induction in the mRNA levels of Anf compared with sham-operated rats (data not shown). In the heart of banded rats Pdk4 mRNA levels were down-regulated by 35% (p < 0.01) compared with sham-operated rats (Fig. 5B), which is in agreement with the reduction in fatty acid oxidation during the development of cardiac hypertrophy (3Taegtmeyer H. Overturf M.L. Hypertension. 1988; 11: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S.H. Bastin J. Mccune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We also performed EMSA to demonstrate NF-κB activation in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These studies showed that the NF-κB probe formed four main specific complexes with cardiac nuclear proteins (Fig. 5C, complexes I to IV), based on competition experiments performed by adding an excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide to incubation mixtures. NF-κB binding activity increased in banded rats, especially complex III, compared with sham-operated rats. Characterization of NF-κB was performed by incubating nuclear extracts with an antibody directed against the p65 subunit of this transcription factor (Fig. 5D). No changes were observed in the DNA binding of cardiac nuclear proteins to an Oct-1 probe, indicating that the increase observed for the NF-κB probe was specific (Fig. 5E). Finally, we evaluated whether the impairment in the expression of PPARβ/δ target gene Pdk4 observed during cardiac hypertrophy may result from enhanced p65-PPARβ/δ interaction. Nuclear extracts isolated from hearts were immunoprecipitated using anti-p65 antibody coupled to protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PPARβ/δ antibody. Data shown in Fig. 5F demonstrate that pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy enhanced the physical interaction of p65 with PPARβ/δ, suggesting that increased association between these proteins is a mechanism contributing to the reported reduction in the expression of PPARβ/δ target genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Fuel generation in the adult myocardium relies on the oxidation of long chain fatty acids by the mitochondria for production of energy. Development of cardiac hypertrophy is associated with a suppression of fatty acid oxidation and metabolic reversion of the heart toward increased glucose utilization, which is characteristic of fetal heart (3Taegtmeyer H. Overturf M.L. Hypertension. 1988; 11: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S.H. Bastin J. Mccune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present, however, which consequences might result from impaired oxidation of fatty acids in the heart, but several studies have demonstrated that substrate utilization is important in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy (5Kelly D.P. Strauss A.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J.

Investig. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is one of the most important signal transduction pathways involved in the hypertrophic growth of the myocardium, may also be involved in the down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB activation during cardiac hypertrophy may also ameliorate cardiac fatty acid oxidation, achieving a better improvement in the prevention or inhibition of this pathological process. Furthermore, these data may also contribute to explain how, given the complexity of the hypertrophic response, inhibition of NF-κB may be sufficient to prevent cardiac hypertrophy (29Force T. Haq S. Kilter H. Michael A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Barger et al. (30Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) demonstrated that during hypertrophic growth cardiac PPARα gene expression fell and its activity was altered at the post-transcriptional level via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, nothing was known until now about the effects of cardiac hypertrophy on PPARβ/δ activity. Gilde et al. (17Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A.J.M. Willemsen P.H.M. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) recently suggested that PPARβ/δ plays an important function in the heart. In fact, these authors show that both PPARα and PPARβ/δ were expressed in comparable levels in the heart, whereas PPARγ was barely detectable. Furthermore, PPARβ/δ was fatty acid inducible and activated the expression of PPARα target genes involved in fatty acid utilization in cardiac myocytes. The authors of this study suggested that PPARα and PPARβ/δ shared similar functions in cardiac cells regarding cardiac fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with this idea, Muoio et al. (31Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) have shown that fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle of PPARα–/– mice was not impaired, probably because of PPARβ/δ compensated for the lack of PPARα in these mice. In the present study stimulation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes with PE, which leads to NF-κB activation (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), caused cardiac hypertrophy that was accompanied by a fall in the expression of Pdk4, a PPARβ/δ target gene involved in fatty acid metabolism (22Tanaka T. Yamamoto J. Iwasaki S. Asaba H. Hamura H. Ikeda Y. Watanabe M. Magoori K. Ioka R.X. Tachibana K. Watanabe Y. Uchiyama Y. Sumi K. Iguchi H. Ito S. Doi T. Hamakubo T. Naito M. Auwerx J. Yanagisawa M. Kodama T. Sakai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15924-15929Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fall in fatty acid oxidation observed in PE-stimulated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was restored by NF-κB inhibitors. These data pointed to the involvement of NF-κB in the down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. However, given that both PPARα and PPARβ/δ are expressed in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (17Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A.J.M. Willemsen P.H.M. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), this could lead to a potential interference caused by PPARα in the changes observed. This possibility was avoided by using H9c2 myotubes, which only express the PPARβ/δ subtype (17Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A.J.M. Willemsen P.H.M. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circulation Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Stimulation of H9c2 myotubes with LPS, which has been reported to activate NF-κB in cardiomyocytes (28Takano H. Nagai T. Asakawa M. Toyozaki T. Oka T. Komuro I. Saito T. Masuda Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), also lead to the reduction in the expression of Pdk4, supporting a link between NF-κB activation and the reduced expression of PPARβ/δ target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. All these findings suggest that the impairment of PPARβ/δ activity plays an important role in the fall of myocardial fatty acid oxidation during cardiac hypertrophy. In agreement with this idea, a recent study demonstrated that cardiomyocyte-restricted PPARβ/δ deletion reduced myocardial fatty acid oxidation and the mRNA expression of genes involved in this process, such as Pdk4, and led to cardiomyopathy (32Cheng L. Ding G. Qin Q. Huang Y. Lewis W. He N. Evans R.M. Schneider M.D. Brako F.A. Xiao Y. Chen Y.E. Yang Q. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which activation of NF-κB results in reduced expression of PPARβ/δ target genes seems to involve reduced interaction of this PPAR subtype with its cis-regulatory element, because exposure of cardiac cells to LPS caused a dramatic reduction in the binding of PPARβ/δ protein to the PPRE probe. This reduction was partially reversed by coincubation of the cells with NF-κB inhibitors, confirming the involvement of this transcription factor in the changes observed. Therefore, the reduced binding activity of PPARβ/δ seemed to be related to the activation of NF-κB in cardiac cells. However, it remained to establish through which mechanism NF-κB activation avoided the interaction of PPARβ/δ with its response element. NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm as an inactive heterodimer, consisting of the p50 and p65 subunits. However, after activation this heterodimer translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune processes. Our results indicate that once the p65 subunit of NF-κB reaches the nucleus it interacts with PPARβ/δ. This association prevents PPARβ/δ from binding to its response element and thereby inhibits its ability to induce gene transcription, leading to a reduction in the expression of Pdk4. These findings are in concordance with the results reported by Westergaard et al. (33Westergaard M. Henningsen J. Johansen C. Rasmussen S. Svendsen M.L. Jensen U.B. Schroder H.D. Staels B. Iversen L. Bolund L. Kragballe K. Kristiansen K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1104-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who showed that PPARβ/δ physically interacts with p65 in psoriatic lesions. Furthermore, they showed a p65-dependent repression of PPARβ/δ, but not of PPARα or PPARγ. In summary, in the present study we show that the NF-κB signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in the hypertrophic growth of the myocardium, down-regulates PPARβ/δ activity in vitro and in vivo through a mechanism that involves enhanced protein-protein interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-κB with this PPAR subtype. These data link NF-κB activation during the development of cardiac hypertrophy with the fall in fatty acid oxidation.

Collagen structural defects, which are usually glycine substitutions or exon skipping defects, have a dominant negative mechanism.

A small number of mutations at the amino end of the helical region of α2(I) collagen have been noted to cause a combination of EDS and OI symptoms. These mutations include two cases with exon 9 skipping, a case with exon 11 skipping, and a large duplication of E12–32 (24Raff M.L. Craigen W.J. Smith L.T. Keene D.R. Byers P.H. Hum.

All have bilateral hip dislocations and marked laxity of large joints. Two had shoulder joint dislocations and hernias (24Raff M.L. Craigen W.J. Smith L.T. Keene D.R. Byers P.H. Hum.

Only the child with duplication of E12–32 had a single tibial fracture. We describe here a group of seven patients with mutations in the α1(I) chain who have a distinct OI/EDS phenotype, in which the symptoms of OI are more prominent and the EDS less severe than in the OI/EDS mutations in α2(I). The α1(I) OI/EDS mutation cluster is located in a high stability folding region at the amino end of the type I collagen helix. These mutations interfere with removal of the N-propeptide, although the N-proteinase site in exon 6 is intact. Thus, OI/EDS and EDS VII are shown to have a common mechanism for EDS symptoms. Cell Culture—Skin fibroblast cultures were established from dermal punch biopsies. Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in the presence of 5% CO2. Osteoblast primary cultures were established from surgical bone chips using the method of Robey and Termine (29Robey P.G. Termine J.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In brief, osteoblasts were released from bone chips by digesting for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.3 units/ml collagenase P in serum-free medium, and grown in 45% low-calcium DMEM, 45% low-calcium Ham's F-12 Kinase medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), 25 μg/ml ascorbate, and 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 8% CO2. Steady State Collagen Synthesis—To label procollagens, confluent fibroblast cultures of probands and control cells (ATCC 2127, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, followed by incubation with 260 mCi/ml of 3.96 TBq/mmol l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline in serum-free medium for 16 h. Procollagens were harvested from media and cell layer and precipitated with ammonium sulfate; collagens were prepared by pepsin digestion (50 μg/ml) of procollagen samples, as previously described (30Bonadio J. Holbrook K.A. Gelinas R.E. Jacob J. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1734-1742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation Identification—Total RNA was isolated from cultured fibroblasts of patient and control cell lines using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's directions (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). The region of the α1(I) collagen mRNA corresponding to exons 5–12 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (32Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with 50 units of murine leukemia virus RT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 813–842 of the cDNA sequence (GenBank™ AF017178) in exon 12 (5′-CCAGCAGGACCAGCATCTCCCTTGGCACCA-3′). The RT reaction was used as a template for PCR with a sense primer corresponding to nucleotides 377–406 of cDNA sequence and located in exon 5 (5′-CTGGCCGAGATGGCATCCCTGGACAGCCTG-3′). PCR used 0.1 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of Amplitaq, and 1× PCR Buffer II (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; then 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C; and finally 7 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR products were sequenced directly on a Beckman Coulter CEQ2000 DNA Sequencer (Beckman Fullerton, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pericellular Processing—Processing of procollagens secreted by fibroblasts was examined by labeling confluent cells from probands and control with 260 mCi/ml of 3.96 TBq/mmol [3H]proline for 24 h and then replacing the media with DMEM containing 2 mm non-radioactive proline and 10% fetal bovine serum. Media from independent wells were harvested at 24-h intervals over a 5-day period as previously described (25Nicholls A.C. Oliver J. Renouf D.V. Heath D.A. Pope F.M. Hum. Genet. 1992; 88: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Media procollagen samples from fibroblasts were precipitated with ammonium sulfate and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide-urea-SDS gels. Matrix Deposition—Proband and control fibroblasts and osteoblasts were grown to confluence and stimulated every other day for 11 days (fibroblasts) or 9 days (osteoblasts) with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Cultures were then incubated for 24 h with 260 mCi/ml of [3H]proline in serum-free medium. Medium was collected and procollagens were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Matrix collagens were serially extracted at 4 °C as previously described (34Bateman J.F. Golub S.B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, newly synthesized collagens were extracted for 24 h with neutral salt (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide), separated from matrix by centrifugation, and precipitated with 2 m NaCl. Collagens with acid-labile cross-links were extracted from the matrix for 24 h with 0.5 m acetic acid and precipitated with 2 m NaCl. Collagens with mature cross-links were extracted by pepsin digestion (0.1 mg/ml) for 24 h and precipitated with 2 m NaCl. All fractions were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide-urea-SDS gels. Transmission Electron Microscopy of Proband Dermal Fibrils—A dermal punch biopsy was obtained from each proband and from a control matched for age and race. The samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by en bloc staining with 2% uranyl acetate. After dehydration, the tissue was infiltrated with Spurr's plastic resin. 600–800-Å sections were obtained with an AO Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome mounted on copper grids and stained with lead citrate. The stained grids were examined in a Zeiss EM10 CA transmission electron microscope and representative areas were photographed (JFE Enterprises, College Park, MD). Preparation of Proband Secreted Procollagens—Proband and control fibroblasts were grown to confluence at 37 °C. Culture medium was removed and fresh serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 50 μg/ml ascorbate was added to the cell cultures. For procollagens used in calorimetry and N-propeptide processing studies, medium was harvested at 24-h intervals for 2 days and fresh medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbate was replenished daily. Medium was buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and cooled to 4 °C. Protease inhibitors were added to obtain the following final concentrations: 250 mm EDTA, 0.2% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide. Procollagen was precipitated by gradual addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 176 mg/ml and incubation at 4 °C overnight, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 h. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC scans from 10 to 50 °C were performed at 0.125 and 1 °C/min heating rates in a Nano II DSC instrument (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation, Lindon, UT). To prevent fibrillogenesis of collagen, 0.1–0.3 mg/ml protein solutions in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4, were used. The denaturation temperature (Tm) in phosphate/glycerol buffers depends linearly on the concentration of all buffer components and the corresponding proportionality coefficients do not depend on the scanning rate, allowing extrapolation of Tm to physiological conditions (35Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). N-proteinase Cleavage—Ammonium sulfate procollagen precipitates were redissolved in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 9.3, labeled by covalent attachment of Cy2 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and transferred into 50 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% Brij 35, pH 8, as described (36Cabral W.A.

Procollagen concentration was measured by Sircol assay (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland) and adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml. Binary mixtures of procollagens, one labeled by Cy5 and one labeled by Cy2, were prepared so that two different procollagens could be co-processed by an enzyme in the same sample tube and, therefore, under completely identical conditions. Procollagen N-proteinase (ADAMTS-2) was purified from fetal calf skin as described (37Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and stored in 5-μl aliquots in 50 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35, pH 7.6, at -80 °C. Enzyme was added to each collagen mixture on ice for an enzyme:substrate ratio of 15 units of enzyme/mg of substrate. Reactions were incubated at 34 °C to avoid partial denaturation of low-stability procollagens containing structural defects. Sample aliquots were collected at the indicated times after the start of the reaction, mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate gel sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with added EDTA (to stop enzymatic cleavage) and dithiothreitol. The samples were denatured and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on pre-cast 6% Tris/glycine minigels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gels were scanned on an FLA3000 fluorescence scanner (FUJI Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Intensity profiles for each lane were extracted using ScienceLab software supplied with the scanner. Quantitative analysis of band intensities and deconvolution of overlapping bands were performed using PeakFit software (Systat, Point Richmond, CA). Phenotype of OI/EDS Patient Group—The seven probands in this study have a distinct OI/EDS phenotype (Table I). All seven first came to medical attention for symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta. All have types III or IV OI, with multiple fractures of long bones; the children with G25V, G76E, and G88E had bone deformity sufficient to require osteotomy procedures. Their L1–L4 DEXA z-scores range from -3.0 to -5.2. All have the significant short stature of OI and a height age that ranges from 20 to 80% of the mean height for their chronological age. Also characteristic of the relatively shorter lower extremities in OI, most have arm span significantly greater than length. All probands have strikingly blue sclerae.Table IClinical characteristics of OI/EDS subjectsOI characteristicsEDS characteristicsSexCAaChronological age (years)OI typeHAbHeight age (years); age for which the height is at the 50th percentileProportionsDEXA ZeAge matched z-score (S.D. units) for bone density at the lumbar spine (L1–L4)ScleraefSclerae are scored on a scale from 1 (tinge blue) to 4 (dark blue)Beighton scoregBeighton score of joint hyperextensibility ranges from 1 to 9; (a) passive apposition of the thumb to the flexor aspect of the forearm (1 point each thumb), (b) passive dorsiflexion of the fifth finger beyond 90° (1 point each hand), (c) hyperextension of the elbow beyond 10° (1 point each elbow), (d) hyperextension of the knee beyond 10° (1 point each knee), (e) forward flexion of the trunk with knees fully extended so that palms of the hands rest on the floor (1 point)Scoliosis (degree)hDegree of thoracolumbar scoliosis as measured on AP radiographSpinal fixationUS: LScUpper segment (trunk, crown to pubis) to lower segment (legs, pubis to heel) ratioSpan:HtdArm span to height ratio1Exon 7 skippingM23IV12.34Large jointsSevereBraced2G13DF15.75IV101:1.341:0.91–4.94945,90iPatient has had 2 fusion/fixation surgeries with hardware placement.

At this time, the second fusion/fixation is holding Open table in a new tab The symptoms of EDS are notably more severe than the mild to moderate joint hyperextensibility frequently found in OI. In addition to significant hyperextensibility of large and small joints (Fig. 1), these probands have laxity of paraspinal ligaments. This results in early scoliosis without vertebral compressions. The scoliosis is rapidly progressive and unresponsive to bracing. Spinal fixation has been required by the mid-teenage years. Collagen Biochemistry and Mutation Detection—Because the probands have clinically significant osteogenesis imperfecta, we examined the type I collagen synthesized by their dermal fibroblasts electrophoretically on SDS-urea-PAGE. Proband steady state media and cell layer collagen did not have delayed electrophoretic migration, as would be expected with the well known overmodification of type I collagen chains frequently seen in OI (Fig. 2A). Proband 1 had a leading edge in both media and cell layer α2(I) bands and proband 2 had a leading edge in the α2(I) band isolated from the cell layer. The normal collagen electrophoresis results prompted us to screen these patients for collagen mutations at the amino end of the helical region of either α1(I) or α2(I), which would not be expected to cause overmodification. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products spanning exons 5–12 of both α chains revealed that all 7 probands had mutations located in exons 7–11 of COL1A1 (Fig. 2B), causing structural abnormalities in the 90 residues at the amino end of the α1(I) protein chain. Proband 1 has a mutation (IVS7 + 4 A > T; g.3756A>T) that causes skipping of exon 7 from the mutant transcript. The leading edge seen after pepsin digestion on SDS-PAGE is most likely the consequence of normal length α2(I) chain looping out of helices containing a shorter mutant α1(I) chain(s). The remaining 6 probands are heterozygous for glycine substitution mutations, located at Gly13, Gly25 (2 patients), Gly34, Gly76, and Gly88, respectively. The G13D substitution presumably disrupts the collagen helix sufficiently to expose the amino end of the α2(I) chain to pepsin digestion, generating the leading edge seen on the α2(I) band. Only RT-PCR products of the expected size were obtained from both α1(I) and α2(I) transcripts in the G13D case; sequencing ruled out a second mutation or use of a cryptic splice signal. Mutations Interfere with in Vitro and Pericelluar NH2-terminal Processing—The mutations causing OI/EDS interfere with in vitro processing of the N-propeptide of proband procollagen by purified N-proteinase (Fig. 3), although the sequence of the N-proteinase cleavage site in exon 6 is intact in all cases. Because of random association of pro-α chains during procollagen assembly, heterozygous patients generate 25, 50, and 25%, respectively, of procollagen molecules containing two, one, and no mutant pro-α1(I) chains. From probands heterozygous for mutations in exon 7 (ΔE7 and G13D), only about 25% of pro-α1(I) chains were processed in vitro. Apparently, these mutations prevent processing of the N-propeptide from all helices that contain one or two copies of the mutant pro-α1(I) chain, and only the 25% of helices with two normal pro-α1(I) chains could be processed. The procollagens with mutations in exons 8–11 (G25V, G34R, and G76E) underwent 70–88% cleavage, suggesting that helices with one or two normal pro-α1(I) chains were processed, whereas the 25% of helices containing two mutant chains could not be cleaved. The procollagen containing the G88E substitution was completely cleaved, but at a reduced rate compared with normal procollagen. Mutations located more distal to the cleavage site, at G121D and G136R, had complete in vitro cleavage with normal kinetics. We also examined the conversion of procollagen to collagen by the pericellular processing enzymes in a cell culture assay, by following the conversion of a pulse of [3H]procollagen to collagen over 5 days (data not shown). The procollagen secreted by all seven of the OI/EDS probands showed delayed processing to collagen by the pericellular enzymes, consistent with the in vitro processing results. In comparison with processing of normal control procollagen, amino propeptide processing is substantially delayed in probands 1 and 2 (exon 7 mutations), delayed to a lesser extent in probands 3 and 5 (exon 8 mutations), and only modestly delayed in probands 6 and 7 (exon 11 mutations). pN-collagen Deposited in Matrix in Fibroblast and Osteoblast Cultures—The pN-collagen present in the media of cultured fibroblasts and osteoblasts is incorporated into the matrix deposited by those cells (Fig. 4). In each proband, we see a substantial increase of pN-collagen in these fractions, as compared with control. For mutations in exon 7 (ΔE7 and G13D), the amount of pN-α1(I) is equivalent to the amount of fully pro"
https://openalex.org/W2104465349,"Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is highly expressed in osteocytes and is mechanically responsive. To study osteocyte-specific and mechanically regulated DMP1 gene expression, the transcriptional activity of three cis-regulatory regions was first examined in an osteoblast differentiation model in vitro using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Expression of the -9624 to +1996 bp (10 kb) and -7892 to +4439 bp (8 kb) DMP1 cis-regulatory regions dramatically increased in areas of mineralized matrix, in dendritic, osteocyte-like cells. Mineralizing cultures expressing the 8-kb construct show dramatic GFP increases in response to loading in cells with a dendritic morphology. Transgenic mice expressing the 8-kb DMP1-GFP and -2433 to +4439 bp (2.5 kb) DMP1-LacZ were generated. Osteocyte-specific expression was found with the 8 kb but not with the 2.5 kb in postnatal animals. However, the 2.5 kb could support expression in rapidly forming osteoblasts and pre-osteocytes in the embryo. Primary calvarial osteoblast cultures demonstrated that the 2.5 kb supports weak expression in a subset of osteoblasts and pre-osteocytes, but not in mature osteocytes. However, the 8 kb supports robust expression in primary bone marrow cultures. Therefore the region -7892 to -2433 bp, termed a 5.5-kb “Osteocyte Enhancer Module,” appears to be required for osteocyte specificity. Ulnae of mice with the 8-kb DMP1-GFP were subjected to mechanical loading where GFP expression increased selectively and locally in osteocytes, distal to the mid-shaft and near the surface of the bone. Thus, the 8-kb region of the DMP1 gene is a target for mechanotransduction in osteocytes, and its cis-regulatory activity may be correlated to local strain in bone.

Osteocytes are terminally differentiated cells derived from osteoblasts which first become embedded and surrounded by osteoid matrix that subsequently mineralizes (1Marotti G. Ferretti M.

The large cuboidal osteoblasts begins to produce the stellate shape of the osteocyte and produce large numbers of long cell processes that are in the 5- to 30-μm length range. In parallel the preosteocyte is being surrounded by an osteoid matrix and begins production of its own local matrix that is rich in molecules that will later prevent the osteocyte and its processes from direct contact with mineral and define the structure of the osteocyte lacunae and canalicular walls, pericellular matrix, and the unique cytoskeleton in the cell processes of the osteocyte (5Tanaka-Kamioka K.

Calcif Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 11Cheng B. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. J. Bone Miner Res. 2001; 16: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is well known that bone tissue has the capacity to alter its mass and structure in response to mechanical strain. Osteocytes are regarded as the mechanosensory cells that send signals to other bone cells to initiate bone formation and remodeling (12Burger E.H. Klein-Nulend J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S101-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 13Huiskes R. Ruimerman R. van Lenthe G.H. Janssen J.D. Nature. 2000; 405: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone, but unique regulatory pathways controlling osteocyte biology have not been identified. Also, little is known of the processes responsible for osteocyte differentiation and formation from a mature osteoblast. DMP1 1The abbreviations used are: DMP1, dentin matrix protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BMP2, bone morphogenic protein 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dpc, days postcoitum; NLS, nuclear localization signal peptide. 1The abbreviations used are: DMP1, dentin matrix protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BMP2, bone morphogenic protein 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dpc, days postcoitum; NLS, nuclear localization signal peptide. is an osteocyte-selective, extracellular matrix-associated phosphoprotein also found in other mineralizing tissues such as enamel, dentin, cementum, and bone (14George A.

Bone Miner Res. 1998; 13: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In cellular cementum, DMP1 is localized in cementocytes similar to osteocytes in bone. In odontogenesis or dentinogenesis, DMP1 is expressed in the early polarized odontoblast as the dental tubules are beginning to form (16Hao J. Zou B. Narayanan K. George A. Bone. 2004; 34: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DMP1 belongs to the SIBLING (small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein) family of extracellular matrix proteins that includes osteopontin (Spp1), bone sialoprotein (IBsp), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), and MEPE/osteogenic factor 45 (Mepe). The SIBLING genes are found in a gene cluster on human chromosome 4q21, and inclusion of DMP1 in this group supports a potential role of this molecule in the process of mineralization of dentin and bone (17Aplin H.M. Hirst K.L. Crosby A.H. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 30: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

DMP1 is highly expressed and therefore a good marker for the osteocyte lineage (21Toyosawa S. Shintani S. Fujiwara T. Ooshima T. Sato A. Ijuhin N. Komori T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 22Toyosawa S. Okabayashi K. Komori T. Ijuhin N. Bone. 2004; 34: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is specifically expressed along and in the canaliculi of osteocytes within the bone matrix suggesting a role for DMP1 in osteocyte function. The DMP1 gene is activated in response to mechanical loading in osteocytes in alveolar bone in response to tooth movement (23Gluhak-Heinrich J. Ye L. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. MacDougall M. Harris S.E. Pavlin D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Potential roles for DMP1 in osteocytes have been suggested and are related to the post-translational processing and modifications of the protein as a highly phosphorylated protein and regulator of hydroxyapatite formation (24He G. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11649-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that DMP1, depending on proteolytic processing and phosphorylation state, regulates local mineralization processes that are carried out within the lacunae and canaliculi of osteocytes in mature bone, thus keeping the lacunae and canaliculi open to allow bone fluid flow (23Gluhak-Heinrich J. Ye L. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. MacDougall M. Harris S.E. Pavlin D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Complex networks of canaliculi, containing osteocyte dendritic processes, penetrate bone; therefore, increases or decreases in canalicular volume or changes in canalicular structural integrity could alter the dynamics of fluid flow thereby altering responses of osteocytes under various physiological or pathological load conditions. A related function for DMP1 in osteocyte biology may be to define the structural, mechanical, and material properties of the canalicular and lacunae wall. The stiffness of this wall could play important roles in detecting and transmitting mechanical signals. Recently, we generated a mouse model containing a DMP1 region, -7892 to +4439 bp (8 kb), driving GFP and thus directing expression to osteocytes (30Kalajzic I. Braut D. Guo D. Jiang X. Kronenberg M.S. Mina M. Harris M.A. Harris S.E. Rowe D.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that a limited region of the DMP1 gene contains an early and late osteocyte-specific control module that also regulates responses to mechanical loading in an osteocyte-specific manner. Mechanical stimulation of mouse bones will activate the endogenous DMP1 gene through the cis-regulatory region containing the osteocyte-specific control regions. Moreover, osteoblasts containing the 8-kb DMP1 region driving a reporter, such as GFP or LacZ, should become active as they begin to differentiate into osteocytes and produce stellate morphology. Culture of Osteoblast 2T3 Cells—The osteoblast 2T3 cell line used in these experiments (25Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Harris M.A. Guerrero D.L. Wozney J.M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) is BMP2-responsive and produces a well organized mineralized matrix. The structure and mineral composition of the mineralized bone matrix produced by 2T3 cells is similar to that of normal woven bone and to mineralized bone matrix produced by primary cultures of fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts (27Bonewald L.F. Harris S.E. Rosser J. Dallas M.R. Dallas S.L. Camacho N.P. Boyan B. Boskey A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 72: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). 2T3 cells were plated into T-150 flasks (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 for RNA extraction or plated on 6-well plates (Costar Corp.) at density of 12 × 104 cells per well for matrix formation studies. These cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 7% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Differentiation media, added at day 0 or at confluency, contained 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (glycerol 2-phosphate) and 80 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Recombinant BMP2 (human), a gift of Dr. John Wozney and the Genetics Institute, Inc./Wyeth Inc., was added at 40 ng/ml on days 0, 3, and 7 of the culture. Northern Analysis and in Situ Hybridization of the Endogenous DMP1 mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from 2T3 cells using RNAzol B reagent (Tel-test Inc., Houston, TX). Enrichment of polyadenylated RNA (poly(A)) was obtained using oligo(dT) cellulose columns. 0.5 μg of poly(A) RNA was denatured in RNA sample buffer with ethylene bromide (Sigma) and loaded onto a 1% agarose MOPS/EDTA/acetate gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The gel was transferred to a Nytran Plus filter (Schleicher & Schüll) by capillary blotting with 20 × SSC for 16 h or overnight. The filter was then cross-linked by a UV cross-linker (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 1× PE (recipe from Stratagene), and 150 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After 1–2 h of prehybridization, DNA probes (DMP1, Osteocalcin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were added to the hybridization solution. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h or overnight at 42 °C. The filters were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min each, once with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 15 min each. All washes were done at 56 °C. The filter images were collected using a Cyclone phosphor system and analyzed using Optiquant software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data were analyzed using Optiquant and transferred to Microsoft Excel for final calculation. For in situ hybridization studies, 2T3 cultures were allowed to form a mineralized matrix in the presence and absence of BMP2, as described above. Abundant mineralization occurs by 10–15 days in the BMP2-treated cultures. At different time points, the media was removed, and the cells were washed with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated PBS. The cells and matrix were allowed to remain in the PBS for 20–30 min on ice. The entire matrix and cell sheets were then gently removed from the plastic tissue culture well and placed in a 15-ml polypropylene tube with 5 ml of cold RNase-free 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After the cells and matrix were washed and centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g using cold PBS, the samples were then resuspended in 15% EDTA with 0.5% paraformaldehyde and allowed to decalcify for 3 days. The cell samples were washed with PBS, and the pellet after centrifugation was washed two times with 70% ethanol. The matrix and cells were resuspended in 70% ethanol, carried to 100% ethanol, and processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were then cut perpendicular to the plane of the matrix and cells and then processed for in situ hybridization as previously described for DMP1 (23Gluhak-Heinrich J. Ye L. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. MacDougall M. Harris S.E. Pavlin D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Stable Transfection of Cis-regulatory Regions of DMP1-GFPtopaz Constructs into 2T3 Osteoblasts—Based on DNA sequence conservation in non-coding regions of the human and mouse DMP1 genes (Fig. 2A), three constructs were designed using either GFP or LacZ as a reporter. These constructs were designed based on the hypothesis that the major cis-regulatory regions specific for osteocytes and for response to mechanical strain would be found in one or all of these DNA regions of the DMP1 gene. The constructs were: 1) -9624 bp of the 5′-flanking region, exon 1, and 1900 bp of the intron 1 (10 kb); 2) -7892 to +4439 bp, 5′-flanking region, exon 1 and having all of intron 1 and part of exon 2 (8 kb); and 3) -2433 to +4439 bp (2.5 kb). All three constructs were ligated to the pGFPtopaz reporter (28Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Construct 3 with the 2.5-kb region was also ligated to an NLS-containing LacZ reporter (20Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Construct 1 required that a splice acceptor site be placed 5′ of the GFP reporter before inserting the -9624 to +1996 bp region (10 kb) of the DMP1 gene. For comparative expression studies, we used the DMP1 knock-in mice with the LacZ reporter (20Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), as a sensitive read-out of endogenous DMP1 expression. The DMP1 -9624 to +1996 bp (10 kb), -7892 to +4439 bp (8 kb), and -2433 to +4439 bp (2.5 kb) cis-regulatory regions driving GFP in combination with a 10-fold excess pCDNA3 were stably transfected into 2T3 cells using the lipofection method (29Strauss W.M. Methods Mol Biol. 1996; 54: 307-327PubMed Google Scholar) with G418 sulfate (Geneticin, Invitrogen) selection. Cells were plated and transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were replated on culture dishes, 100 × 20 mm, at a density of 2–4 × 103 cells per dish. After 24 h, 400 μg/ml G418 was added every other day. Colonies appeared after 2 weeks in the pCDNA3 transfection group. Initially, a large number of clones where evaluated for fluorescence. Three to six clones were then selected based on detectable fluorescence expression. In some cases, to assure clonality, clones were subcloned. At least three clones with the -7892 to +4439 bp (8 kb) DMP1-GFPtopaz or the -9624 to +1996 bp (10 kb) DMP1-GFPtopaz were evaluated for changes in spatial GFP expression patterns during differentiation. A Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-Texas Red dual fluorescent filter cube was used to evaluate GFP expression and recorded by taking Fluorescent Images using a charge-coupled device camera (Optronics Co., Goleta, CA) every other day and imaged using AnalySIS software (Soft Imaging System Co., Lakewood, CO). Fluid Flow Experiments—Mineralized bone nodules form between 8 and 13 days in which GFP expression was found associated with the osteoid and mineralized matrix and presumed osteocytes at different stages of differentiation. Recombinant BMP2 was used to accelerate the formation of the mineralized structures and was added to the cultures on Days 0 and 3 at 40 ng/ml. Addition at this level of BMP2 on only these two early days rather than throughout the culture period establishes a slower rate of mineralized nodule formation and assures well organized mineralized structures. The fluid shear responses of the DMP1 cis-regulatory regions in stably transfected mineralizing 2T3 cultures were then analyzed, after exposure to 16 dynes/cm2 (1.6 pascals) shear stress for 2 h using a computer-driven Flexcell Streamer Gold strain unit (Flexcell International Co., Hillsborough, NC). Post-incubation and evaluation after the 2 h of fluid flow was at 2 and 24 h. RNA was then extracted from the cultures and prepared as described above for Northern analysis. Generation of the 8-kb DMP1-GFP Transgenic Mice—Mouse DMP1 DNA sequences were used for generation of the GFP reporter line as described and characterized previously (30Kalajzic I. Braut D. Guo D. Jiang X. Kronenberg M.S. Mina M. Harris M.A. Harris S.E. Rowe D.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Generation of the 2.5-kb DMP1-GFP Transgenic Mice—The 2.5-kb DMP1 region was ligated to a nuclear localization signal containing a β-galactosidase cassette (LacZ) (20Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The 2.5-kb regulatory sequences of DMP1, consisting of 2433-bp promoter region, 95-bp non-coding exon I, the entire 4326-bp intron I, and the first 17 bp of the exon II (4 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG) were cloned into the SalI site, upstream of the bacterial (NLS) galactosidase cDNA in pPD-LacZ-MH vector. The 2.5-kb DMP1-LacZ transgene was released by restriction endonuclease enzyme PmeI and purified by using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified transgene was microinjected into fertilized CD1 eggs to generate transgenic mice, as above. Tail DNA was isolated to screen transgenic mice by using PCR analysis (described below). The transgenic lines were maintained on a CD1 background. DMP1-LacZ Knock-in Heterozygote—An NLS LacZ cassette was inserted into the DMP1 knock-out/in allele and replaced Exon 6 as described previously (20Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The heterozygotes of these mice serve as a standard for endogenous expression of DMP1 in various embryos and tissues. PCR Genotyping—Transgenic mice/embryos and DMP1 knock-in heterozygous mice/embryos were genotyped by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail samples. For the transgenic mice, the 2.5-kb DMP1-LacZ transgene-specific primers were used. The forward primer (5′-ACCTGGCTTCTTTTTAACCTG-3′) is located at +4178∼+4198, relative to the transcription start site of DMP1 gene. The reverse primer (5′-GGCAATATCGCGGCTCAGTTC-3′) is located at +61∼+81, relative to the ATG site of the NLS-galactosidase reporter gene (LacZ). The PCR product is 364 bp long. For the DMP1 heterozygous mice, DMP1-LacZ knock-in targeting gene-specific primers were used. The forward primer (5′-CTTGACTTCAGGCAAATAGTGACC-3′) is located at +9010 to +9033, relative to the transcription start site of DMP1 gene; the reverse primer (5′-GCGGAATTCGATAGCTTGGCTG-3′) is located at the 5′-junction of DMP1-LacZ knock-in targeting gene. The PCR product is 280 bp in length. The primers for the 8-kb DMP1-GFP mice are as described in Ref. 30Kalajzic I. Braut D. Guo D. Jiang X. Kronenberg M.S. Mina M. Harris M.A. Harris S.E. Rowe D.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. LacZ Assay and Tissue Processing—LacZ staining was performed to determine the spatial and temporal activity of the transgene. To prepare the sectioned tissues from the DMP1 heterozygous and the transgenic mice, tissue samples were dissected and washed in cold PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min to 1 h. The samples were then washed three times with PBS for 15–30 min each, cryoprotected in 15% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C until they moved to the bottom, and then placed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. They were then embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT at 60 °C. Blocks were cryosectioned at 10–12 μm, collected onto positively charged slides (Shandon Microscope Slides Superfrost (Plus)), and dried for 2 to 4 h at room temperature. For 1-month-old mice, the tissue samples were decalcified in 10% EDTA, pH 7.2–7.4, at 4 °C for 7 days after fixation and then processed for frozen section as described above. The LacZ-staining procedure has been previously described (31Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Briefly, the slides were washed in PBS and then stained at 37 °C overnight (12–16 h) in freshly prepared LacZ-staining solution containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 0.5 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, Gold BioTechnology, Inc.) in PBS, protected from light. When the staining was complete, the slides were washed extensively in PBS. The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin or eosin only, mounted with Permount, and photographed under light microscopy. Bone Marrow Culture—4-week-old mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Femurs and tibiae were removed, and soft tissue was dissected away from the bone. The epiphyseal growth plates were removed, and the marrow was collected by flushing with α-minimal essential medium culture medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) with a 25-gauge needle. Cell suspensions with single or double cells were prepared by passing the cell suspension through an 18-gauge needle several times. The suspension was then filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon #2350, Fisher Scientific). Cells were plated at a density 1 × 106 cells/cm2 in 35-mm culture plates (Falcon, #3046, Fisher Scientific). Differentiation was induced as previously described (28Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Isolation and Culture of Primary Osteoblasts from 3-Day-old Mouse Calvariae—Osteoblasts from 3-day-old mice were isolated as described by Harris et al. (32Harris S.E. Feng J.Q. Harris M.A. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. Mol. Cell. Different. 1995; 3: 137-155Google Scholar), with several modifications. Briefly, the calvariae was dissected free of soft tissue and incubated in the digestion solution containing 0.1% Collagenase, type I (Sigma, C-0130) and 0.2% Dispase II (Roche Applied Science, 165-859) in PBS at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The first 5-min digest was discarded, and the following five sequential 10-min digests were combined and plated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, G9891), 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid (Sigma, A4403), and 15% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown to confluency over the next 5–6 days, trypsinized, counted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. Tail samples were then genotyped for the 2.5-kb DMP1-LacZ and the DMP1-LacZ knock-in animals. For bone nodule formation assay, the frozen cells were thawed and plated into T75 flasks and grown to confluency over the next 3 days in growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in α-minimal essential medium. The cells were then trypsinized and plated in 12-well plates at an initial density of 6 × 104 cells per well. The cells were allowed to grow to confluency over the next 4 days. The medium was then changed to differentiation medium containing 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μg/ml fresh l-ascorbic acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum in α-minimal essential medium. The media was changed every 2 days. Recombinant BMP2 was added to increase the rate of nodule formation during the first 4 days at 20 ng/ml. Mechanical Loading of 8-kb DMP1-GFP Transgenic Mice—Under avertin-induced anesthesia (0.015 ml of 2.5% avertin/g of body weight), the right forelimbs of 4- to 7-month-old female mice were subjected to axially applied compressive loads of 2.4 Newtons using a haversine waveform (peak stress of 2.4 newtons at 2 Hz for 60 cycles, 30 s). Non-invasive loading was applied such that mechanical forces were transmitted from the flexed carpus to the olecranon (elbow) process. Due to the natural curvature of the ulna, this loading protocol results in bending-induced peak compressive and tensile strains on the medial and lateral surfaces, respectively, distal to the ulna mid-shaft (33Torrance A.G. Mosley J.R. Suswillo R.F. Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). All procedures in the loading experiment were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Histological Evaluation of GFP Expression—Bone tissue from 4-week-old male mice were dissected free of surrounding tissue, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10 n NaOH) at 4 °C for 1–2 days. Bones were decalcified in 15% EDTA (adjusted to pH 7.1 with NH4OH) for 4 days and then placed in 30% sucrose overnight. Other tissues were processed in a similar manner without decalcification. The tissues were then embedded in tissue-embedding medium (Cryomatrix, Termo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) on dry ice. Bones and other tissues were cryosectioned in 5-μm-thin sections longitudinally. GFP expression in histological sections was directly observed and photographed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-Texas Red dual fluorescent filter cube of a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope and photographed by using an Axiocam digital camera. This cube allows the green GFP signal to be distinguished from the light red-yellow autofluorescent background located in the marrow space and minimizes the strong background fluorescence of decalcified bone.

https://openalex.org/W1966019688,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a major secretory product of odontoblasts and is critical for proper dentin formation. DSPP is believed to be processed into only two structural/functional domains: dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). Here we report the isolation and characterization of a third domain of DSPP, designated dentin glycoprotein (DGP). DGP was isolated from a guanidine/EDTA extract of porcine tooth dentin by ion exchange, hydroxyapatite affinity, size exclusion, and RP-HPL chromatography. Endoproteinase lysine C digestion products of DGP were characterized by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry. The porcine DGP backbone is the 81-amino acid segment of DSPP (Ser392 to Gly472) between the DSP and DPP domains. DGP has four phosphorylated serine residues (Ser453, Ser455, Ser457, and Ser462) and one glycosylated asparagine (Asn397). There are no other post-translational modifications. DGP is a stains-all positive protein with an apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of 19 kDa, which is reduced by glycopeptidase A digestion to 16 kDa. A variety of glycans can be linked to Asn397. All are complex biantennary structures with a common N-linked pentasaccharide core (mannose3-N-acetylglucosamine2), most with a fucosyl residue on the innermost N-acetylglucosamine. The α1–3 and α1–6 arms are always galactose β1–4 N-acetylglucosamine β1–2 mannose, and either or both arms can be unsialidated or monosialidated. The calculated monoisotopic molecular masses of the different glycosylated forms of the DGP phosphoprotein are: unsialidated 10,523 and 10,670, monosialidated 10,815 and 10,961, and disialidated 11,106, and 11,252 Da, with the disialidated forms being the most abundant."
https://openalex.org/W2139417344,"An age-dependent acceleration of apoptosis occurs in female germ cells (oocytes), and this requires communication between the oocyte and its surrounding somatic (cumulus) cells. Here we show in aged mice that ceramide is translocated from cumulus cells into the adjacent oocyte and induces germ cell apoptosis that can be prevented by sphingosine-1-phosphate. Trafficking of ceramide requires gap junction-dependent communication between the cumulus cells and the oocyte as well as intact lipid rafts. Further, the occurrence of the elevated incidence of apoptosis in oocytes of aged females is concomitant with an enhanced sensitivity of the oocyte to a spike in cytosolic ceramide levels, as well as increased bax mRNA and Bax protein levels. Thus, the force driving the age-related increase in female germ cell death is multifactorial, but changes in the intercellular trafficking of ceramide, along with hypersensitivity of oocytes to ceramide, are key factors in this process."

Recently, members of the RGK family of small GTPases (Rem, Rem2, Rad, Gem/Kir) have been identified as novel contributors to the regulation of L-type calcium channel activity. In this study, microarray analysis of the mouse insulinoma MIN6 cell line revealed that the transcription of Rem2 gene is strongly induced by exposure to high glucose, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and RNase protection analysis. Because elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in pancreatic β-cells is essential for insulin secretion, we tested the hypothesis that Rem2 attenuates Ca2+ currents to regulate insulin secretion. Co-expression of Rem2 with CaV 1.2 or CaV1.3 L-type Ca + channels in a heterologous expression system completely inhibits de novo Ca2+ current expression. In addition, ectopic overexpression of Rem2 both inhibited L-type Ca2+ channel activity and prevented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that Rem2 associates with a variety of CaVβ subunits. Importantly, surface biotinylation studies demonstrate that the membrane distribution of Ca2+ channels was not reduced at a time when channel activity was potently inhibited by Rem2 expression, indicating that Rem2 modulates channel function without interfering with membrane trafficking. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels by Rem2 signaling may represent a new and potentially important mechanism for regulating Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in hormone-secreting cells, including insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.

Rem, Rem2, Rad, and Gem/Kir (RGK) are members of a Ras-related GTPase subfamily, with many unique characteristics that distinguish them from other members of the Ras superfamily (1Finlin B.S.

All RGK GTPases share a common structure consisting of a conserved Ras-related guanine nucleotide binding core, a series of nonconservative amino acid substitutions within regions known to be involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, a non-CAAX-containing C-terminal extension, and large N-terminal extensions relative to other Ras family proteins. These extensions contain multiple phosphorylation sites, a C-terminal calmodulin binding domain in Rad and Gem, and 14-3-3 binding sites (6Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and each has been proposed to play a role in RGK regulation (7Ward Y. Spinelli B. Quon M.J. Chen H. Ikeda S.R. Kelly K. Mol.

The conservation of structural features within the RGK proteins suggests shared mechanisms of regulation and control of common cellular functions. However, RGK GTPases differ in their putative effector (G2) domains, suggesting that they may associate with distinct regulatory and effector proteins. In addition, each exhibits a unique, tissue-restricted, and non-overlapping expression pattern. Another distinctive characteristic is their regulation at the transcriptional level. For example, Gem is an early response gene and Rem expression is repressed by lipopolysaccharide stimulation (1Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K.

Although the cellular functions of the RGK family remain largely unknown, recent evidence suggests a role for these proteins in the regulation of both Ca2+ channel activity and cytoskeletal reorganization (7Ward Y. Spinelli B. Quon M.J. Chen H. Ikeda S.R. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Rem, Rad, and Gem have all been shown to interact with the Ca2+ channel β subunit, resulting in the down-regulation of Ca2+ channel function and either termination of Ca2+-dependent secretion (8Finlin B.S.

Res. 2004; 95: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). While direct association with Cvβ subunits appears crucial to RGK-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channel function, the nature of the regulatory mechanism remains to be determined. A model has suggested that Gem association sequesters CaVβ subunits, resulting in inhibition of CaVα expression at the plasma membrane (12Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as signal transduction, gene expression, and hormone release, and disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis readily induces cellular dysfunction (13Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Insulin release by pancreatic β-cells is a Ca2+-dependent process, which follows the sequence of closure of the ATP-dependent K+ channels, membrane depolarization, and opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. A tight coupling is believed to exist between the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules and the increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration (15Mears D. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). An uncontrolled, enhanced Ca2+ signal, however, may be detrimental to the β-cell (17Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Rorsman P. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Wahlander K. Nicotera P. Dypbukt J. Orrenius S. Hallberg A. Berggren P.O. Science. 1993; 261: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and there appears to be multiple safeguards to regulate Ca2+ levels within these cells. Indeed, it has been reported that pancreatic islets are severely impaired in their ability to secrete insulin following chronic exposure to high glucose concentrations, and that this dysfunction contributes to the development of diabetes (18Okamoto Y. Ishida H. Taminato T. Tsuji K. Kurose T. Tsuura Y. Kato S. Imura H. Seino Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this context, persistent hyperglycemia might well cause sustained elevated [Ca2+] and abnormalities in glucose-induced secretion and suggest that regulation of basal Ca2+ plays an important role in glucose-evoked insulin release. In this study we have demonstrated that exposure of pancreatic β-cells to glucose is associated with a significant increase in Rem2 expression as determined by quantitative real-time RT 3The abbreviations used are: RTreverse transcriptaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphateGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGSTglutathione S-transferase.3The abbreviations used are: RTreverse transcriptaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphateGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGSTglutathione S-transferase.-PCR and RNase protection analysis. Exogenous Rem2 inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel function when expressed in HEK293 cells, and importantly, blocks endogenous Ca2+ channel activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. In addition, Rem2-mediated inhibition of L-type channel activity occurs without altering Ca2+ channel trafficking, indicating that Rem2 utilizes a regulatory mechanism distinct from that described for Gem to acutely regulate channel function. These data clearly identify Rem2 as a novel and potentially critical mediator of Ca2+-dependent secretion in pancreatic islets. Furthermore, these data suggest that Rem2 signaling may control a previously unappreciated negative feedback regulatory cascade operating to protect pancreatic β-cells from uncontrolled Ca2+ signaling in the presence of persistent hyperglycemia. reverse transcriptase hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione S-transferase. reverse transcriptase hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione S-transferase. Cell Culture—MIN6 cells of passage 24 to 30 were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (20Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). For glucose regulation experiments, cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and grown overnight, unless otherwise indicated, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum containing the indicated glucose concentration(s). HIT-T15 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 containing 10% dialyzed horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum, whereas HEK293 cells were cultured as described (1Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Adenoviruses—The original cloning of rat Rem2ΔN69 has been described previously (2Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subsequent sequence analysis suggested that this original clone may represent a shorter N-terminal Rem2 splice variant. To isolate the longer Rem2WT cDNA, we performed PCR on mouse expressed sequence tag EST4400995 (GenBank™ AW909633) with primers that introduced a 5′ BamHI site and 3′ XhoI site to the entire putative open reading frame. In addition, PCR was performed to generate the shorter version of mouse Rem2 (Rem2ΔN69). These clones were introduced into 3xHA-pcDNA3.1 to allow expression of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged mRem2WT and mRem2ΔN69. Replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing GFP as a marker and HA-tagged rat Rem2ΔN69 were constructed and purified using the pAdTrack/AdEasy system as described (8Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis of Glucose-regulated Genes in MIN6 Insulinoma Cells—Microarray analysis was performed using RNA isolated from MIN6 cells incubated on 1 or 25 mm glucose for 16 h using a Qiagen RNeasy Maxi kit. Microarray analysis was performed at the UK Microarray facility using the mouse expression set 430 chip from Affymetrix, which covers the entire mouse genome. The microarray analysis was performed with four independent samples. The overall noise of the image was calculated using the microarray suite software (MAS 5.0, Affymetrix). The algorithms used to determine average difference expression scores (expression level) and presence/absence calls are described in the Microarray Suite 5.0 Manual and formed the basis for determining the relative abundance of transcripts. Pearson S correlation tests and analysis of variance were performed in EXCEL 9.0 on data from the MAS5 pivot table, as described previously (21Blalock E.M. Chen K.C. Sharrow K. Herman J.P. Porter N.M. Foster T.C. Landfield P.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3807-3819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIT-T15 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in F12-K media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentimicin (Invitrogen), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and 10% dialyzed horse serum (Invitrogen). RNase Protection Assays and Real-time RT-PCR—RNase protection assays were performed on 20 μg of total RNA from the indicated cell lines using the RPA III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using RNA isolated from MIN6 cells grown in 1 or 30 mm glucose as indicated using the Qiagen RNeasy® Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand synthesis was performed using the Brilliant Q-PCR RT-PCR kit (Stratagene) with 10 μg of isolated MIN6 RNA, after treatment with DNase I (Sigma). Real-time amplification of the cDNA was performed using the TaqMan Universal Master Mix (ABI) with TaqMan probes. The β-actin primers used were 5′-AGGTCATCACTATTGGCAACGA-3′ and 5′-CACTTCATGATGGAATTGAATGTAGTT-3′; and were used in combination with the β-actin probe 5′-(Cy5)-TGCCACAGGATTCCATACCCAAGAAGG-(BHQ)-3′. Rem2 was amplified using the TaqMan Assays on Demand 20× Mix kit (ABI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin Secretion Assays—MIN6 cells were infected with 1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml of the indicated adenoviruses for 16 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Insulin secretion from the infected MIN6 cells was measured by equilibrating the cells for 2 h in 1× KRBH buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgSO4, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin). Cells were then washed twice with 1× PBS and incubated for 1 h in 1× KRBH buffer containing 3 or 30 mm glucose. The insulin concentration in the media was determined using the mouse ultrasensitive insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ALPCO) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Insulin content in the cells was determined by acid-ethanol extraction of the cells. Electrophysiological Studies—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids 12–48 h before recordings as described (8Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP. HIT-T15 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes at 20,000 cells per well. The next day, the cells were infected with the indicated adenovirus at 1 × 107 adenovirus/ml. Adenovirus-infected cells were identified by GFP expression and recordings made after 22 h post-infection. The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to measure ionic current. Patch electrodes with resistances of 1–2 megohm contained (in mm): 110 K-gluconate, 40 CsCl, 3 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, and 5 Hepes, pH 7.36. The bath solution consisted of (in mm): 102.5 CsCl, 40 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride, and 5 Hepes, pH 7.4. Signals were amplified with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and 333 kHz A/D system (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were analyzed with Clampfit 9 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 7.0 statistical software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). All recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Adenoviral infected HIT-T15 cells were analyzed as above using a bath solution consisting of (in mm): 102.5 (or 140) CsCl, 40 (or 2.5) BaCl2 or CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 triethanolamine-Cl, and 5 Hepes, pH 7.4. In addition to their well characterized electrical properties (22Ashcroft S.J. Hammonds P. Harrison D.E. Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Ji J. Yang S.N.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4589-4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), viral infected HIT-T15 cells were more amenable to patch clamp analysis that viral infected MIN6 cells. Rem2-CaVβ Subunit Interactions—HA-tagged rat Rem2ΔN69 pCDNA and FLAG-CaVβ2a pCMV-T7F2, FLAG-CaVβ1b, FLAG-CaVβ4a, or pCMV-T7F2 were co-transfected into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate method (25Andres D.A. Shao H. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, placed into 1 ml of Verseen (Invitrogen), harvested, pelleted, and then suspended in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTPγS). The cells were lysed, subjected to centrifugation, and 1 mg of the supernatant incubated in a 500-μl reaction containing 10 μl of packed Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 3 h with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and 5 μl of the supernatant saved for analysis. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. The supernatant and bound fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. HA-Rem2 was detected by immunoblotting as described (8Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), except that the biotinylated HA antibody was used at 1 μg/ml, and bound protein was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at a 1:40,000 dilution. The blot was subsequently probed for FLAG-CaVβ2a by incubating the membranes with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) to confirm the efficiency of immunoprecipitation. Surface Biotinylation Studies—HIT-T15 cells were either cultured alone (uninfected control) or incubated for 24 h with CsCl-purified adenovirus expressing GFP (control) or co-expressing GFP and Rem2 (107 plaque-forming units/ml). This resulted in near complete HIT-T15 cell infection based on the analysis of GFP-positive cells (24 h post-infection). Monolayers were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, and surface proteins biotinylated using 1 mg/ml membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. Cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and harvested on ice in 1 ml of Versene (Invitrogen), pelleted by gentle centrifugation, and the Versene aspirated. RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) was added to the cell pellet, which was sonicated 2 times for 10 s (Kontes). The soluble fraction was isolated after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by adding cleared cell lysate (500 μg) to 100 μl (50% slurry) of streptavidin beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The reaction was gently rotated end over end at 4 °C for 1.5 h, resin was pelleted by centrifugation, washed two times with RIPA containing 0.3 m NaCl, 2 times with RIPA containing 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 times with wash buffer containing no detergent (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The released protein as well as 10 μg of the input was resolved using 6% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with affinity purified L-type calcium channel α-subunit polyclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) secondary antibody at 1:20,000 dilution. SuperSignal (Pierce) was used as the enhanced chemiluminescent reagent. For inhibition studies, immunoblotting was performed as above, but the α-subunit polyclonal antibody was preincubated for 1 h at 20°C with 10 μg/ml GST-fused CaV1.2 II–III loop protein. To assure that the cells remained intact throughout the surface labeling, biotinylation of GAPDH, a cytosolic protein, was analyzed by immunoblotting with GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Ambion) at 1:2000 dilution. Antibody Generation—An expression vector encoding GST-fused rabbit CaV1.2 II–III loop peptide (corresponding to residues 784–930) was generated using PCR and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-KG and recombinant GST-II–III loop fusion protein was expressed and purified by GST affinity chromatography (25Andres D.A. Shao H. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was sent to Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) for rabbit immunization and antibody production. An antibody affinity column was constructed as follows. His6-tagged CaV1.2 II–III loop was created by cloning the CaV1.2 II–III loop into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pTrcHisA and recombinant protein was expressed and purified over a nickel-chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (6Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). His6-tagged CaV1.2 II–III loop was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) in PBS and blocked with ethanolamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antiserum (10 ml) was incubated with 1 ml of resin for 2 h with rotation. The resin was washed four times with 10 ml of PBS, bound protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and purified antibody was immediately dialyzed extensively against 10% glycerol in PBS and stored at –20 °C. Expression of Rem2 Is Induced by Glucose in MIN6 Cells—The MIN6 insulinoma cell line is one of the few pancreatic β-cell lines that retain insulin secretory response to physiological concentrations of glucose and other secretagogues (20Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 26Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. 1996; 22: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar), and has been used extensively in studies of the mechanisms of insulin secretion. A major challenge in diabetes research is to understand the pleiotropic effects of glucose on pancreatic β-cells in molecular terms. To identify glucose-responsive genes, mRNA expression in MIN6 cells incubated in high or low glucose was compared using oligonucleotide arrays. Four independent sets of cells were harvested following 16 h incubation in medium containing either 1 (low) or 25 mm (high) glucose, RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized onto microarrays. These studies identified a subset of genes that differed in their expression levels in response to elevated extracellular glucose levels by 1.5-fold or greater, in all four experiments. 4S.

Many of the genes identified in this approach were not previously known to be expressed differentially in MIN6 cells in response to glucose, including the Rem2 GTPase.2 The microarray data shown in TABLE ONE indicate that exposure of MIN6 cells to high concentrations of glucose (25 mm) result in a ∼2.4-fold increase in Rem2 gene expression.TABLE ONEMicroarray data for Rem2 mRNA levels in glucose-stimulated Min6 cellsTreatmentSampleAverage (S.D.)p Value-Fold induction12341 mm Glucose43.172.843.972.958.2 (17)25 mm Glucose162.3128.1144128.8140.8 (16)2 × 10-42.42 Open table in a new tab Validation of Glucose-regulated Expression of Rem2 but Not Other RGK Proteins—To verify the observed increase in Rem2 mRNA in response to high glucose seen with microarray analysis, we quantified the Rem2 mRNA level in MIN6 cells grown on low or high glucose media using real-time RT-PCR and RNase protection analysis. RT-PCR analysis performed using cDNA from low or high glucose-induced MIN6 cells indicate a 4.1-fold increase in Rem2 mRNA levels in response to high glucose (30 mm) compared with β-actin levels used as control (Fig. 1). As a control for contamination of the cDNA with genomic DNA, we employed actin primers that give an additional larger PCR product when the sample is contaminated with genomic DNA (27Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that differences in Rem2 gene expression were because of differences in osmotic pressure between cells cultured in the presence and absence of glucose, MIN6 cells were treated with 30 mm l-glucose, a nonmetabolized glucose analog that is not transported into cells. As seen in Fig. 2A, l-glucose did not affect Rem2 gene expression. Hence, the glucose-induced increase of Rem2 gene expression was not because of an osmotic change of the culture medium. Finally, to further validate the significance of the quantitative RT-PCR analysis, ribonuclease protection analysis was used to confirm that Rem2 expression is elevated in response to high glucose concentrations (Fig. 2B). Thus, Rem2 is a glucose-responsive gene in pancreatic β-cell lines whose expression increases in response to high levels of glucose.Fig. 2Expression of RGK GTPases in the MIN6 insulinoma cell line.

Recent findings suggest anti-Aβ autoantibodies may have a role in AD pathology. However, a consensus has yet to emerge as to whether endogenous anti-Aβ autoantibodies are elevated, depressed, or unchanged in AD patients. Whereas experiments to date have used synthetic unmodified monomeric Aβ (Aβmon) to test autoimmunity, up to 40% of the Aβ pool inB AD brain consists of low molecular weight oligomeric cross-linked β-amyloid protein species (CAPS). Recent studies also suggest that CAPS may be the primary neurotoxic agent in AD. In the present study, AD and nondemented control plasma were analyzed for immunoreactivity to CAPS and Aβmon. Plasma of both nondemented and AD patients were found to contain autoantibodies specific for soluble CAPS. Nondemented control and AD plasmas demonstrated similar immunoreactivity to Aβmon. In contrast, anti-CAPS antibodies in AD plasma were found to be significantly reduced compared with nondemented controls (p = 0.018). Furthermore, age at onset for AD correlated significantly (p = 0.041) with plasma immunoreactivity to CAPS. These data suggest that autoantibodies to CAPS are depleted in AD patients and raise the prospect that immunization with anti-CAPS antibodies might provide therapeutic benefit for AD.

The principal component of extracellular β-amyloid is the β-amyloid protein (Aβ). The Aβ peptide is not directly expressed as a functional protein entity (1Citron M. Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 1993; 14: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but is released by the processing of the much larger amyloid protein precursor (APP) protein (2Tanzi R.E. Gusella J.F. Watkins P.C.

Whereas Aβ can contain between 39 and 43 amino acids, the predominant species in brain are Aβ40 (40 residues) and Aβ42 (42 residues) (7Suzuki N. Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Ihara Y.

We have previously shown that incubation of Aβ with copper generates cross-linked oligomeric species that co-migrate on SDS-PAGE with Aβ oligomers purified from AD brain (10Atwood C.S. Huang X.

Characterization studies demonstrated the redox modifications induced by incubation with copper are shared by oligomeric Aβ purified from AD brain, including covalent cross-linking (10Atwood C.S.

We have coined the term “CAPS” to describe low molecular mass (<100 kDa) cross-linked β-amyloid protein species. Covalent cross-linking of Aβ involves oxidation of the protein and is tied to the peptide's propensity to bind the redox active metals copper and iron (12Bush A.I. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7317-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Aβ neurotoxicity remains controversial. However, evidence is mounting that the most neurotoxic forms of Aβ are not mature fibrils but prefibrillar oligomers or protofibrils (13Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), which would include CAPS. Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that the most toxic CAPS may be cross-linked dimeric species of Aβ (14Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 15Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the abundance and harmful bioactivity shown for CAPS, the vast majority of currently available data has focused on nonoxidized monomeric forms of the peptide.Interest in autoimmunity to Aβ has been stimulated by recent findings that amyloid burden in transgenic animal models can be attenuated by circulating anti-Aβ antibodies (16Schenk D.

Med. 2000; 6: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). β-Amyloid deposition can be inhibited by either peripheral infusion of exogenous anti-Aβ antibodies or autoimmunity induced by immunization with synthetic Aβ peptide. Initial studies suggested that anti-Aβ antibodies aid in the clearance of amyloid by crossing the blood-brain barrier and binding directly to plaques. However, subsequent studies have suggested that antibodies (19DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2264-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and other Aβ binding agents (20Matsuoka Y. Saito M. LaFrancois J. Gaynor K. Olm V. Wang L. Casey E. Lu Y. Shiratori C. Lemere C. Duff K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 29-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may not need to cross the blood-brain barrier to be effective in inhibiting cerebral Aβ plaque formation. In this model, Aβ is bound and sequestered in the periphery and prevented from crossing back into the brain, thus promoting a net flux out of neurological tissue (19DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2264-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, the use of circulating anti-Aβ antibodies is a therapeutic strategy being actively pursued. Unfortunately, dosing in the first clinical trial using Aβ vaccination to treat AD patients was terminated in phase II because of complications associated with inflammation of the central nervous system vasculature (21Bard F. Barbour R. Cannon C. Carretto R. Fox M. Games D. Guido T. Hoenow K. Hu K. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee C. Lee M. Motter R. Nguyen M. Reed A. Schenk D. Tang P. Vasquez N. Seubert P. Yednock T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, limited data suggest that amyloid load may have been attenuated in some trial subjects by autoantibodies specific for insoluble Aβ deposited as β-amyloid (22Hock C. Konietzko U. Papassotiropoulos A. Wollmer A. Streffer J. von Rotz R.C. Davey G. Moritz E. Nitsch R.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Despite the earlier problems, clinical trials aimed at elevating anti-Aβ antibody levels in AD patients will most likely proceed. Therefore, it is imperative to advance our understanding of the autoimmune response to Aβ and its derivatives with greater alacrity.The presence of anti-Aβ immunoreactivity in human serum and CSF was first reported in 1991 by Mönning et al. (23Mönning U. Schreiter-Gasser U.C.H. König G. Mechler H. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Iqbal K. McLachlan D.R.C. Winblad B. Wisniewski H.W. Basic Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Therapeutic Strategies. Wiley, New York1991: 557-563Google Scholar). Subsequently, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells from AD patients have been shown to secrete anti-Aβ antibodies (24Gaskin F. Finley J. Fang Q. Xu S. Fu S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recently, several studies have used ELISA assays to compare anti-Aβ autoimmunoreactivity in control and AD plasma and CSF. However, a consensus has yet to emerge as to whether anti-Aβ autoantibodies are elevated (25Nath A. Hall E. Tuzova M. Dobbs M. Jons M. Anderson C. Woodward J. Guo Z. Fu W. Kryscio R. Wekstein D.

Neurol. 2001; 49: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in AD patients compared with nondemented controls. Experiments to date have used synthetic unmodified monomeric Aβ peptides to test autoimmunity. The current study is the first to test human plasma for specific anti-CAPS antibodies. Moreover, findings are consistent with an association between AD pathology and autoantibodies specific to cross-linked Aβ species.The future success of AD therapies based on anti-Aβ antibodies will require greater delineation of the naturally occurring autoantibodies to Aβ. In this study, we present data suggesting that CAPS generated by exposing Aβ to mild redox conditions may be more immunogenic than the normal unmodified, monomeric Aβ species. We also show that plasma samples taken from AD patients exhibit significantly less immunoreactivity to CAPS than do samples drawn from nondemented controls. Moreover, lower signal for anti-CAPS antibodies correlated with earlier age-at-onset (AAO) of AD.MATERIALS AND METHODSAD and Control Cases—Plasma samples were collected from patients in the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston following informed consent. Samples were collected as part of a biomarker study approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board. Participants had a diagnoses of AD (n = 59) by NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria (29McKhann G. Drachman D. Folstein M. Katzman R. Price D. Stadlan E.M. Neurology. 1984; 34: 939-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or nondemented controls (n = 59). Cognitive status of patients at the time of plasma collection was determined by the Blessed dementia scale information-memory-concentration score (30Blessed G. Tomlinson B.E. Roth M. Br. J. Psychiatry. 1968; 114: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). The Blessed dementia scale information-memory-concentration is scored from 0 to 37 mistakes, with 0–3 mistakes considered within the normal range. The demographics of the population are shown in Table I.Table IDemographic and biochemical data on nondemented control and AD cohortsControlADDemographic datan5959Age (years)70 ± 1077 ± 8Male (%)4449Duration of AD (years)5 ± 3.3Education (years)15 ± 3.213 ± 3.1Biochemical dataAβ40 (pm)45 ± 1450 ± 18Aβ42 (pm)6.2 ± 2.76.4 ± 2.8 Open table in a new tab Preparation of Stock Solutions and Buffers—Stock Aβ solutions were prepared by the addition of 30% trifluoroethanol in high pressure liquid chromatography grade water to ∼1 mg of powdered Aβ40 (synthesized by the W. Keck Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Undissolved peptide was solubilized by light sonication of the stock solution for 3 min. Following sonication, the Aβ solution was centrifuged to remove undissolved material, and peptide concentration in the supernatant was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Zn(II)-histidine buffers were prepared by combining zinc standard solution (National Institute of Standards and Technology) with 150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS), containing histidine for a final Zn(II)/histidine molar ratio of 1:6.Redox Treatment of Aβ—The method first described by Galeazzi et al. (31Galeazzi L. Ronchi P. Franceschi C. Giunta S. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used to generate cross-linked β-amyloid protein species (CAPS). Fresh Aβ40 (100 μg/ml) was incubated (2 days at 37 °C) in TBS with 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (100 μm). Following incubation, HRP in the sample was inactivated by incubation (1 h at 37 °C) with sodium azide (5%), an irreversible inhibitor of peroxidase activity. No peroxidase signal was detected in solutions of, or microplate wells coated with, HRP-treated Aβ (data not shown). Aβ oligomerization during incubation with HRP was monitored by Western blot using the polyclonal antibody (pAb) pan-Aβ raised against residues 15–30 of the Aβ peptide (Calbiochem).Anti-Aβ Antibody ELISA—Aβ was first immobilized to the solid phase. Unmodified or redox-treated peptide (100 μg/ml) was incubated in TBS (20 μl/well) in the wells of a 384-well microplate. For some experiments, unmodified Aβ was incubated in wells containing 100 μm Zn(II)-histidine buffer. Following the capture step, plates were blocked overnight at 4 °C with BSA/TBS buffer (10% bovine serum albumin in TBS). Wells were then incubated with plasma samples diluted 1:50 in BSA/TBS buffer. After washing, wells were incubated with a 1:25,000 dilution of goat anti-IgG antibody conjugated to HRP (Calbiochem). The plate was washed, and luminescence was measured after the addition of 20 μl/well Luminol solution (Pierce).Immunoblotting (Western Blotting)—Samples were first resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris gels) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween) containing 5% each skimmed milk and BSA. For detection of Aβ, membranes were first probed (2 h at room temperature) with 1:3000 dilution of pAb pan-Aβ, then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-coupled to HRP (1:10,000). For detection of Aβ immunoreactivity in human plasma, membranes blotted with Aβ were incubated (overnight at 4 °C) with plasma samples diluted 1:100 in BSA/TBST. Membranes were then washed and probed with anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate. Both Aβ detection and Aβ immunoreactivity blots were developed for exposure to ECL film with super signal ultra (Pierce). Immunoreactive bands identified by pan Aβ Western blot of CAPS samples were equivalent in apparent molecular weight and relative intensity to species stained by Coomassie Blue on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown).IgG ELISA—Plasma samples and standards of known IgG concentration were diluted (1:20) in BSA/TBS buffer and incubated (1 h at room temperature) in fresh untreated microplate wells. Following washing, wells were probed (1 h at room temperature) with anti-IgG-HRP-conjugated antibody (1:50,000) in BSA/TBS. Well chemiluminescence was then measured following the addition of Luminol.Aβ40 and Aβ42 Plasma Levels—Plasma levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were determined by sandwich ELISA as described by Fukumoto et al. (32Fukumoto H. Tennis M. Locascio J.J. Hyman B.T. Growdon J.H. Irizarry M.C. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ was captured to the solid phase using an antibody directed against residues 11–28 of the peptide (anti-Aβ11–28). Bound Aβ was detected using anti-Aβ antibodies BA27 (Aβ40 specific) or BC05 (Aβ42-specific). The three antibodies were obtained from Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan).RESULTSWe first established an ELISA to measure titers of anti-Aβ autoantibodies in human plasma. Initially, we characterized three different Aβ species employed to capture autoantibodies from human plasma. To this end, wells were coated with either unmodified monomeric Aβ (Aβmon), redox-treated peptide containing cross-linked β-amyloid protein species (CAPS), or peptide assembled into noncovalent multimers by incubation with Zn(II)/histidine (AβZn). To demonstrate that Aβmon and CAPS were captured to the solid phase, wells were extracted with SDS sample buffer, and the extracts were immunoblotted using a pAb raised against full-length Aβ peptide (pan-Aβ). Analysis of immunoblot signal confirmed that the wells contained immobilized Aβmon and CAPS (Fig. 1a). Whereas untreated Aβ and peptide immobilized in the presence of Zn(II)/histidine were monomeric, redox-treated peptide contained additional cross-linked oligomeric species. We next titrated pooled nondemented control plasma against immunoreactive signal for unmodified Aβ (Fig. 1b). Signal was blanked against signal from wells coated with BSA. Maximal signal and end point titers for Aβ-coated wells were 1:50 and 1:21,000, respectively.Next we tested the specificity of the ELISA for anti-Aβ immunoreactivity. Pooled plasma from nondemented control subjects was preincubated (30 min) with BSA, reverse Aβ peptide, soluble Aβmon, or CAPS (final peptide concentration in wells of 1 μg/ml) before being assayed. Signal from plasma preabsorbed with reverse Aβ peptide was equivalent to plasma with BSA (Fig. 1c). However, consistent with specificity for anti-Aβ immunoreactivity, signal in samples preincubated with Aβmon or CAPS was reduced for plates coated with Aβmon. Notably, a third of the signal was not absorbed out by Aβmon for wells coated with CAPS. These data suggest that plasma has specific immunoreactivity for species present in the heterogeneous CAPS preparations. No detectable attenuation of signal was observed for plasma spiked with <100 ng/ml exogenous Aβ (data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that the total pool of Aβ in undiluted human plasma is <5 ng/ml (32Fukumoto H. Tennis M. Locascio J.J. Hyman B.T. Growdon J.H. Irizarry M.C. Arch.

Thus, endogenous Aβ would be unlikely to significantly reduce assay signal by competing with immobilized peptide for autoantibody binding.The 42-residue isoform of Aβ was also tested in our ELISA. However, we were unable to reproducibly coat replicate wells with equivalent loadings of redox-treated Aβ42 peptide. This was due to the greater propensity of preparations containing Aβ42 to aggregate following redox treatment as compared with the less hydrophobic 40-amino acid isoform. Therefore, Aβ42 could not be tested in the experiments in this study.Following assay characterization experiments, plasma from nondemented control (n = 59) and AD (n = 59) subjects were compared for immunoreactivity to Aβmon,AβZn, or CAPS. Wells were coated with the various Aβ preparations, blocked, incubated with samples of diluted (1:50) plasma, and then probed for bound human IgG (Fig. 2). No significant differences were found between control and AD immunoreactivity to Aβmon or AβZn aggregates (Fig. 2, a and c). However, signal from control plasma incubated with CAPS was significantly elevated (p = 0.018 by t test) as compared with AD samples (Fig. 2b). In addition, the immunoreactivity of plasma from nondemented patients was greater for CAPS than for Aβmon.Fig. 2AD plasma has significantly reduced autoimmunity for redox-cross-linked Aβ oligomers as compared with nondemented controls. Wells were coated with BSA or Aβ that was unmodified (a), pretreated with HRP (b), or captured in Zn(II)/histidine buffer (c). Following blocking, wells were incubated with plasma from AD (n = 59) or nondemented control (n = 59) cases. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-IgG-HRP conjugate. Control plasma autoimmunity to redox-treated Aβ was significantly elevated (*, p = 0.018 by two-tailed Student's t test) compared with AD samples. All assays used 384-well plates. Well signal was determined from luminescence following the addition of Luminol. Signal from Aβ-containing wells was blanked on signal from wells preincubated with BSA. Data are shown as average sample signal (16 replicates for each plasma sample) for each test group ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a control experiment, plasma from control and AD cases was also assayed for total IgG levels.

Thus, the reduced levels of anti-CAPS antibodies we observed for AD plasma could not be attributed to a nonspecific decline in circulating IgG concentrations.Next, immunoblotting techniques were used to characterize the immunogenicity of human plasma to CAPS. For these experiments, redox-treated Aβ was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then incubated with diluted plasma and probed with goat anti-IgG-HRP-conjugated antibody. Where immunoreactivity could be unambiguously detected in plasma from nondemented controls, the signal was highest for species with apparent molecular masses of 15–35 kDa (Fig. 3). However, the sensitivity of the immunoblot assay was insufficient for discrete detection of anti-Aβ immunoreactivity in most samples in our cohort. Notably, the two samples presented in Fig. 3 that generated clear immunoblot signals also possessed the highest anti-CAPS signal by ELISA.Fig. 3Antibodies from human plasma bind redox cross-linked Aβ species (CAPS) resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Unmodified Aβ (Aβmon, lane 1) and peptide pretreated with HRP (CAPS, lanes 2–4) were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with pAb pan-Aβ (lanes 1 and 2) or diluted (1:100) human plasma from two nondemented patients (lanes 3 and 4) previously identified by Aβ autoimmunity ELISA to give the strongest signal for antibodies to redox-treated Aβ. Blots were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-human HRP-conjugated antibodies and developed for exposure to ECL-film. Signal was highest for species with apparent molecular weights corresponding to Aβ oligomers containing 4–8 cross-linked monomeric units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we compared signal for anti-CAPS antibodies to levels of soluble Aβ in plasma as determined by sandwich ELISA. Anti-CAPS antibody levels did not correlate significantly with either Aβ40 or Aβ42 concentrations or Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in control, AD, or the combined plasma samples (Table II). However, plasma immunoreactivity to CAPS was found to correlate positively (r = 0.279 with p = 0.041) with the AAO of AD; the earlier the AAO, the lower the plasma immunoreactivity toward CAPS. AD plasma immunoreactivity for Aβmon also demonstrated a trend toward positive correlation with AAO but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.136). We also tested whether plasma anti-CAPS immunoreactivity in AD patients decreased as a function of cognitive status as determined by Blessed dementia scale information-memory-concentration score (r = –0.146 with p = 0.297) or time since diagnoses (r = –0.209 with p = 0.111). Although the data are suggestive of a trend toward lower anti-CAPS signal with disease progression, correlations did not reach statistical significant with the cohort sizes used in this study. Our findings suggest that whereas lower levels of anti-CAPS antibodies are associated with diagnosis of AD, they may not be strong markers for disease severity after onset.Table IIAutoimmunoreactivity signal correlates with age at onset of AD but not plasma Aβ levelsControlADCombinedAβmonCAPSAβmonCAPSAβmonCAPSAβ40r = 0.008r = 0.072r = -0.05r = 0.123r = 0.008r = 0.091p = 0.531p = 0.584p = 0.691p = 0.324p = 0.933p = 0.327Aβ42r = 0.110r = 0.096r = 0.078r = 0.074r = 0.028r = 0.023p = 0.401p = 0.468p = 0.553p = 0.572p = 0.756p = 0.805Aβ40/Aβ42r ="

STAT5b was tyrosine-phosphorylated, in response to uPA, only in EGFR-expressing cells. uPA-induced cell proliferation was blocked by dominant-negative MEK1, dominant-negative STAT5b, and by expression of an EGFR that is mutated at Tyr-845, which is essential for STAT5b activation. In two cell culture models of uPA-stimulated breast cancer growth, MDA-MB 468 cells treated with uPA and MCF-7 cells treated with uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, proliferation was completely inhibited when EGFR expression or activity was blocked.

However, the relationship between different proteins that participate in the uPAR MSRC remains incompletely understood. It is not clear whether all of the putative co-receptors must be simultaneously present to initiate cell signaling or whether co-receptors function interchangeably. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, it is not clear whether variation in the composition of the uPAR MSRC alters cellular response to uPA.We are particularly interested in physical and functional interactions involving uPAR and the EGFR, because both receptors have been strongly implicated in breast cancer progression (22Bolla M.

When the EGFR was expressed in these cells, uPA still activated ERK; however, ERK activation was blocked by the EGFR tyrosine kinase antagonist, tyrphostin AG1478. Based on these data, we proposed a model in which the uPAR MSRC is dynamic in composition. When the EGFR is absent, alternative co-receptors function in the MSRC to activate the Ras-ERK pathway; however, when the EGFR is expressed, the EGFR assumes a dominant role and becomes essential for uPA-initiated signaling to ERK.Herein, we report that EGFR expression in CHO cells modifies the cellular response to uPA, so that uPA functions as a mitogen. Importantly, the effects of EGFR expression do not reflect a change in the kinetics of ERK activation in response to uPA. Instead, the EGFR supports uPA mitogenic activity by recruiting and activating STAT5b downstream of uPAR. STAT5b has been previously implicated in EGF-triggered cell growth (28Kloth M.T.

Our results support a model in which STAT5b and ERK function independently, but in a complementary manner, to promote cell growth. We have extended this observation to breast cancer cells and find that EGFR is uniformly necessary for uPA-induced growth. We conclude that the composition of the uPAR MSRC is critical in determining cellular response to uPA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Proteins—High molecular weight two-chain uPA was provided by Drs.

Transfected cultures were allowed to recover in serum-containing medium, according to the manufacturer's instructions.Detection of EGFR, uPAR, Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b, and Activated ERK—To detect EGFR in siRNA-treated WT-EGFR-CHO cells, cell extracts were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration of protein in each extract was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. Equal amounts of cell extract (20 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with EGFR-specific antibody. The blots were probed for total ERK as a control for load.To detect uPAR in EGFR siRNA-treated cells, cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% deoxycholic acid) containing protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from equal amounts of cell extracts (1 mg), after pre-clearing with protein G-agarose, using antibody 399R. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis for uPAR. An equivalent immunoprecipitation approach was used to detect EGFR and mutants thereof (K721A and Y845F) in transiently transfected cells. In these studies, cell extracts were prepared 24 h after introduction of the constructs. To detect phosphorylated STAT5b, cell extracts in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) were immunoprecipitated with STAT5b-specific antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis and probed with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody PY20. Blots were re-probed for total STAT5b as a control for load.To examine ERK activation, CHO-K1 and WT-EGFR-CHO cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 18 h, at which time the confluency was 80–90%. Some cultures were pre-treated with tyrphostin AG1478 for 2 h, pertussis toxin for 2 h, GM6001 for 1 h, or batimastat for 1 h, immediately prior to adding uPA or EGF for the indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared and probed for phosphorylated and total ERK.Cell Growth—Cell growth was measured by MTT assay, using the Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche Applied Science), which provides an index of viable cell number. Cells (5000/well) were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 18 h in serum-containing medium. siRNA-treated cultures were maintained in serum-containing medium for 24 h prior to transfer to 96-well plates. All cells were washed with serum-free medium and then serum-starved for 4 h. Some cultures were treated with tyrphostin AG1478 or uPAR-specific antibody 399R (25 μg/ml) for 2 h as previously described (14Ma Z. Webb D.J. Jo M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jo M. Thomas K.S. O'Donnell D.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

MTT hydrolysis was determined based on absorbance at 570 nm. Control cultures were maintained in 1% FBS-containing medium without uPA or EGF. In each experiment, MTT assays were performed to determine viable cell number prior to the 48-h incubation. The presented results show the change in cell number over the 48-h culture period.BrdUrd Incorporation—DNA synthesis was measured by BrdUrd incorporation, as previously described (30Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells and WT-EGFR-CHO cells were plated on sterile coverslips in 12-well plates. The cells were co-transfected with pEGFP, to express GFP, and with plasmids encoding either WT-EGFR, kinase-inactive EGFR (EGFR-K721A), EGFR-Y845F, EGFR-K721A/Y845A, dominant-negative MEK1, or dominant-negative STAT5b, at a ratio of 1:4, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Transfections were performed in serum-containing medium, as directed by the manufacturer. Cells were cultured for 18 h, washed with serum-free medium, and then cultured in serum-free medium for 4 h, prior to adding DIP-uPA (10 nm) or EGF (10 ng/ml) and BrdUrd (100 μm) in 1% FBS-containing medium. Incubations were conducted for an additional 18 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and treated with 2 m HCl for 1 h at 37 °C. Fixed cells were incubated with BrdUrd-specific antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:50). DNA synthesis was determined as the fraction of GFP-expressing cells that were also positive for BrdUrd. When cultures were maintained in 1% FBS for 18 h, 52 ± 4% of CHO-K1 cells were BrdUrd-positive. Under the same conditions, 43 ± 4% of the WT-EGFR-CHO cells were BrdUrd-positive. These baselines allowed detection of increases or decreases in DNA synthesis. All results are expressed as the -fold increase of the BrdUrd incorporation relative to cells maintained in 1% FBS. The maximum theoretical response was ∼2.0-fold. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired t test.Co-transfection efficiencies were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP and with plasmids encoding WT-EGFR, EGFR-K721A, EGFR-Y845F, or EGFR-K721A/Y845A and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were incubated with EGFR-specific antibody (1:1000) overnight. The cells were then washed and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (1 μg/ml). Co-transfection was demonstrated by the presence of red and green fluorescence in the same cells and was always >95%.RESULTSCo-receptor Function in uPAR-initiated Signaling to ERK— Our previous studies in MCF-7, HT-1080, and MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated that uPA activates ERK, that this response does not require uPA proteolytic activity, and that ERK activation, together with the resulting changes in cell migration and proliferation, are blocked by inhibiting uPA binding to uPAR (10Nguyen D.H.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In CHO-K1 cells, DIP-uPA activates ERK even though these cells do not express the EGFR; however, when CHO-K1 cells are transfected to express EGFR, signaling from uPAR to ERK becomes EGFR-dependent (26Jo M. Thomas K.S. O'Donnell D.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1642-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). FPRL-1 and/or related GPCRs have been identified as essential uPAR signaling co-receptors, like the EGFR (19Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether FPRL-1-related receptors are essential for uPA-initiated ERK activation in CHO-K1 cells. The cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 2 h, which inhibits the activity of FPRL-1 (19Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and then stimulated with 10 nm DIP-uPA. As shown in Fig. 1A, pertussis toxin blocked ERK activation, implicating FPRL-1 or a similar Gi-binding GPCR.Next, we tested WT-EGFR-CHO cells, which were previously characterized (26Jo M. Thomas K.S. O'Donnell D.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1642-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If the EGFR and FPRL-1 function interchangeably, then these cells would be expected to be pertussis toxin-insensitive; however, this was not the case. The EGFR-specific inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, inhibited ERK activation, supporting our earlier findings (26Jo M. Thomas K.S. O'Donnell D.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1642-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); however, pertussis toxin also completely blocked ERK phosphorylation. These data suggest that the EGFR does not displace or negate the need for FPRL-1-related receptors in the uPAR MSRC in CHO cells.In breast cancer cell lines, uPAR-specific antibody 399R binds to uPAR, blocks uPA-binding, and inhibits ERK activation together with resulting changes in cell physiology (11Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14Ma Z. Webb D.J. Jo M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether ERK activation by uPA requires uPAR in WT-EGFR-CHO, we pre-treated cells with antibody 399R or with control IgG. Antibody 399R blocked ERK activation, confirming a necessary role for uPAR in these cells (Fig. 1B).uPA Promotes Growth of CHO Cells That Express EGFR—To test whether the EGFR alters the cellular response to uPA, we compared CHO-K1 and WT-EGFR-CHO cells. Initially we studied cell growth, using the MTT assay, which measures the total number of viable cells (32Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J"

https://openalex.org/W1968453436,"The small GTPase Rheb displays unique biological and biochemical properties different from other small GTPases and functions as an important mediator between the tumor suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 and the mammalian target of rapamycin to stimulate cell growth. We report here the three-dimensional structures of human Rheb in complexes with GDP, GTP, and GppNHp (5′-(β,γ-imide)triphosphate), which reveal novel structural features of Rheb and provide a molecular basis for its distinct properties. During GTP/GDP cycling, switch I of Rheb undergoes conformational change while switch II maintains a stable, unusually extended conformation, which is substantially different from the α-helical conformation seen in other small GTPases. The unique switch II conformation results in a displacement of Gln64 (equivalent to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras), making it incapable of participating in GTP hydrolysis and thus accounting for the low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. This rearrangement also creates space to accommodate the side chain of Arg15, avoiding its steric hindrance with the catalytic residue and explaining its noninvolvement in GTP hydrolysis. Unlike Ras, the phosphate moiety of GTP in Rheb is shielded by the conserved Tyr35 of switch I, leading to the closure of the GTP-binding site, which appears to prohibit the insertion of a potential arginine finger from its GTPase-activating protein. Taking the genetic, biochemical, biological, and structural data together, we propose that Rheb forms a new group of the Ras/Rap subfamily and uses a novel GTP hydrolysis mechanism that utilizes Asn1643 of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 GTPase-activating protein domain instead of Gln64 of Rheb as the catalytic residue."
https://openalex.org/W2046359492,"Ess1 is an essential peptidylprolyl-cis/trans-isomerase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ess1 and its human homolog, Pin1, bind to phospho-Ser-Pro sites within proteins, including the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). Ess1 and Pin1 are thought to control mRNA synthesis by catalyzing conformational changes in Rpb1 that affect interaction of cofactors with the pol II transcription complex. Here we have characterized wild-type and mutant Ess1 proteins in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ess1 preferentially binds and isomerizes CTD heptad-repeat (YSPTSPS) peptides that are phosphorylated on Ser5. Binding by the mutant proteins in vitro was essentially normal, and the proteins were largely stable in vivo. However, their catalytic activities were reduced >1,000-fold. These data along with results of in vivo titration experiments indicate that Ess1 isomerase activity is required for growth, but only at vanishingly low levels. We found that although wild-type cells contain about ∼200,000 molecules of Ess1, a level of fewer than 400 molecules per cell is sufficient for growth. In contrast, higher levels of Ess1 were required for growth in the presence of certain metabolic inhibitors, suggesting that Ess1 is important for tolerance to environmental challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2068724980,"Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) is a chemokine that leads to leukocyte recruitment and activation at sites of infection. Controlling chemokine activity at sites of infection is important, since excess accumulation of leukocytes may contribute to localized tissue damage. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases modulate the bioactivity of chemokine and cytokine networks through proteolytic cleavage. Because MIP-1α is temporally expressed with neutrophils at sites of infection, we examined proteolysis of MIP-1α in vitro by the neutrophil-derived serine proteases: cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase 3. Recombinant human MIP-1α isoforms LD78β and LD78α were expressed and purified, and the protease cleavage sites were analyzed by mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing. Chemotactic activities of parent and cleavage molecules were also compared. Both LD78β and LD78α were cleaved by neutrophil lysates at Thr16-Ser17, Phe24-Ile25, Tyr28-Phe29, and Thr31-Ser32. This degradation was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Incubation of the substrates with individual proteases revealed that cathepsin G preferentially cleaved at Phe24-Ile25 and Tyr28-Phe29, whereas elastase and proteinase 3 cleaved at Thr16-Ser17 and Thr31-Ser32. Proteolysis of LD78β resulted in loss of chemotactic activity. The role of these proteases in LD78β and LD78α degradation was confirmed by incubation with neutrophil lysates from Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome patients, demonstrating that the cell lysates containing inactivated serine proteases could not degrade LD78β and LD78α. These findings suggest that severe periodontal tissue destruction in Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome may be related to excess accumulation of LD78β and LD78α and dysregulation of the microbial-induced inflammatory response in the periodontium.

A major process in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma, is the recruitment and activation of leukocytes by chemokines. During inflammation, leukocytes transgress the vascular endothelium and migrate into peripheral tissues in response to a gradient of chemotactic factors such as chemokines. Chemokine production is triggered by proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; NSP, neutrophil-derived serine protease; PLS, Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome; MIP-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; TLCK, N-tosyl-lys chloromethyl ketone; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; EST, (2S, 3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester. and tumor necrosis factor-α), bacterial products like lipopolysaccharides, and immune complexes (1Yanling J.

Invest. 1998; 85: 552-556Google Scholar). Another example may be seen in Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS), which is characterized by early onset, severe periodontal destruction. As a consequence of cathepsin C gene mutation(s), this autosomal recessive condition results in a complete loss of cathepsin C enzyme activity and subsequent failure to activate serine proteases such as cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase 3 (14de Haar S.

In periodontitis, the inflammatory response to microbial infection in the gingival sulcus results in destruction of connective tissues and resorption of alveolar bone. Chemokine-positive cells and chemokine receptor-positive cells are present in inflamed periodontal tissues, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α)-positive cells are more abundant than other chemokine-positive cells (15Gemmel E.

Human MIP-1α has two different isoforms, LD78β and LD78α, which are expressed by two highly related nonallelic genes on chromosome 17q21.1–3 (25Hirashima M. Ono T. Nakao M. Nishi H. Kumura A. Nomiyama H. Hamada F. Yoshido M. Shimada K. DNA Seq. 1992; 3: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both genes are relatively small (∼3.0 kb), consist of three exons and two introns, and are transcribed upon inflammatory cytokine stimulation. The LD78β and LD78α genes encode preproteins of 93 and 92 amino acid residues, respectively. After signal peptide cleavage, mature LD78β and LD78α both contain 70 amino acids with theoretical molecular masses of 7798.7 and 7788.7 Da, respectively. There are no apparent glycosylation sites on LD78β and LD78α, and they share 94% sequence similarity, differing by only three amino acids. The biological activity of the two different MIP-1α isoforms has been studied extensively in HIV-1 infection. LD78β is the more potent HIV-1-inhibiting chemokine, acting as a CCR5 agonist. Its binding affinity to CCR5 is 6-fold higher than that of LD78α (26Menten P. Struyf S. Schutyser E. Wuyts A. De Clercq E. Schols D. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Clin.

LD78α, when isolated from natural sources, has only 66 amino acids, LD78α-(5–70). Three different LD78β forms, LD78β-(1–70), LD78β-(3–70), and LD78β-(5–70), have been identified in conditioned media from stimulated mononuclear cells. Conversion of LD78β-(1–70) to LD78β-(3–70) results from processing of the precursor by a membrane-associated serine protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Truncated LD78β-(3–70) has increased chemotactic activity and enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity due to an increased receptor binding affinity compared with intact LD78β (28Proost P. Menten P. Struyf S. Schutyser E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the fate of MIP-1α at sites of infection is not well characterized. We investigated the proteolysis of the MIP-1α isoforms, LD78β and LD78α, by NSPs in order to identify the specific cleavage sites and to assess the chemotactic activity of the parent molecules and their cleavage products. We hypothesized that in PLS, the failure to activate NSPs due to cathepsin C inactivity prevents proteolytic degradation and inactivation of MIP-1α. Dysregulation of MIP-1α in inflamed periodontal tissues provides an environment favoring localized tissue destruction. Here, we report that LD78β and LD78α are cleaved by NSPs and that the cleavage products exhibit loss of chemotactic activity. We also report that NSPs from PLS patients fail to degrade LD78β and LD78α, supporting the hypothesis that this underlies the inflammation-associated destruction of the periodontium seen in this condition. Materials—Histopaque-1119-1 and Histopaque-1077-1 were purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were obtained from Sigma, and AEBSF, E-64, EST, leupeptin, TLCK, and TPCK were purchased from Calbiochem. Human neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase were purchased from Calbiochem, and human neutrophil proteinase 3 was purchased from Athens Research & Technology (Athens, GA). Construction of Recombinant Human LD78β and LD78α Expression System—Human LD78β and LD78α cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a macrophage-derived cDNA as a template and LD78β- and LD78α-specific primer sets (LD78β sense, 5′-ACA TTC CAT CAC CTG CTC CC-3′; LD78α sense, 5′-ACA TTC CGT CAC CTG CTC AG-3′; LD78 antisense, 5′-AAG CTT CTG GAC CCC TCA GG-3′). The PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 34 cycles. Amplified LD78β and LD78α PCR products were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen), and the cDNAs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Using these two cDNAs, NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced, and LD78β and LD78α cDNAs were generated by PCR (LD78β NdeI, 5′-ATA CAT ATG GCA CCA CTT GCT GCT GAC ACG-3′ (NdeI site underlined); LD78α NdeI, 5′-ATA CAT ATG GCA TCA CTT GCT GCT GAC ACG-3 (NdeI site underlined); LD78 BamHI, 5′-CGC GGA TTC TCA GGC ACT CAG CTC TAG G-3′ (BamHI site underlined)). Amplified PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and subcloned into the pET11ax vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with NdeI and BamHI. The clones were verified by sequence analysis and transformed into BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for LD78β and LD78α protein expression. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human LD78β and LD78α from Escherichia coli—A single colony was inoculated into 10 ml of NZCYM media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin in a 50-ml disposable centrifuge tube and grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C. This bacterial culture was seeded into a liter flask containing 500 ml of NZCYM-ampicillin media and grown to an OD (at 550 nm) of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, the flasks were shaken for 2–3 h, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. After the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 6 m urea and centrifuged, the supernatant was ultrafiltered using YM-30 and YM-3 membranes. The protein solution obtained following ultrafiltration was injected into HPLC with a reverse phase column ODP-50 (Supelco, St. Louis, MO). The proteins were eluted by 0–80% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonia water for 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified proteins were stored at –20 °C after freeze-drying. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Human neutrophils and mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors using Histopaque-1119-1 and Histopaque-1077-1 as described in Sigma procedure 1119 (leukocyte separation). The neutrophils were treated with cold NH4Cl buffer to lyse contaminating erythrocytes and washed with PBS. Neutrophils and mononuclear cells were assessed by light microscopy with Giemsa staining, and cells were counted using a hemacytometer. Cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and sonicated for 30 s. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatants were used as the cell lysate. For neutrophil preparation from PLS patients, blood was obtained from three Turkish patients, who were previously shown to have cathepsin C mutations and to lack cathepsin C activity (29Hart P.S. Zhang Y. Firatli E. Uygur C. Lotfazar M. Michalec M.D. Marks J.J. Lu X. Coates B.J. Seow W.K. Marshall R. Williams D. Reed J.B. Wright J.T. Hart T.C. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All patients had complete loss of cathepsin C activity (less than 5 μmol/min/mg protein; control range, 685–1200 μmol/min/mg protein). The genotypes of the three patients were p.G139R/p.G139R, p.R272P/R272P, and p.W429X/p.W429X. As controls, blood was obtained from five population- and age-matched healthy individuals. Proteolysis of LD78β and LD78α—Substrate solutions, 100 μm LD78β and LD78α, were prepared with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 10 mm CaCl2. Lysates of neutrophils or mononuclear cells were separately mixed with the substrate solutions at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 4–24 h at 37 °C and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. In order to determine the effect of inhibitors, the cell lysates were pretreated with protease inhibitors by incubating them at room temperature for 1 h, prior to adding the cell lysates. Test concentrations of the inhibitors were as follows: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm AEBSF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm E-64, 100 μm EST, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm TLCK, 100 μm TPCK. For the reaction with human NSPs, cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase 3 were dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions and diluted with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and mixed with substrate solution at a molar ratio of 1:10–100 (1 milliunit of protease for 8 μg of substrate). The pH of the reaction mixtures was adjusted (pH 5.5) with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 4–24 h at 37 °C. Protein Gel Electrophoresis and Coomassie Staining—For protein gel electrophoresis, each sample was mixed with 4× NuPAGE LDS sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and run in a 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel with MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining using SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). Determination of the N Terminus Amino Acid Sequence and Mass Values—The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using Towbin buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). The membranes were washed with distilled water for 3 × 5 min, stained with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, and washed with 50% methanol until the background became light blue. The protein bands were excised from the dried membrane and used for N terminus amino acid sequencing. Edman sequencing was performed by the FDA protein core laboratory, which uses a gas/liquid phase protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems model 477A) with an on-line HPLC determination of derived phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Mass finger print analyses of intact LD78β and LD78α proteins and their proteolytic peptides were made by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, whereas peptide sequencing was obtained through nanospray tandem mass spectrometry. For mass analysis of intact proteins, samples were analyzed using Shimadzu Axima CFR+ mass spectrometer (a MALDI-TOF) in linear positive ion mode. Sinapinic acid matrix (5 mg/ml) was prepared in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The dried droplet method was employed for sample preparation. In brief, 1 μl of the sample and matrix mixture was dried on MALDI target plates at room temperature. Two protein standards, bovine insulin (average M + H+ = 5734.51 Da) and equine cytochrome c (average M + H+ = 12,361.96 Da), were used as the calibrants. For peptide mass fingerprint analysis, the masses of samples were acquired with linear, positive ion mode using an ABI Proteomics Analyzer 4700 mass spectrometer. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (α-CHCA) matrix (5 mg/ml) was prepared in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The dried droplet method described above was employed. A mixture of synthetic P14R (average M + H+ = 1534.84 Da), human ACTH fragment 18–39 (average M + H+ = 2466.72 Da), bovine insulin oxidized β chain (average M + H+ = 3496.96 Da), bovine insulin (average M + H+ = 5734.51 Da), and equine apomyoglobin (average M + 2H2+, 8476.78 Da, doubly charged) was used as external calibrants. Nanospray tandem mass spectrometry of proteolytic peptides was carried out using the ProteomeX work station (LCQ DecaXP, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA), essentially according to the procedure recently reported by Li et al. (30Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A reverse phase PicoFrit column (BioBasic C18, 75 μm × 10 cm, tip = 15 μm; New Objective, Woburn, MA) was placed directly in front of the ion transfer tube of LCQ DecaXP plus mass spectrometer. After washing with solvent A (0.1% formic acid), the loaded peptide samples were eluted by 0–60% acetonitrile for 30 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min using a splitter (75 μl/min before the splitting). The mass/charge (m/z) ratios of peptides and their fragmented ions were recorded, and the raw data files were searched against the human data base by using BIOWORKS software (ThermoFinnigan), a modified version of SEQUEST. Chemotactic Assays—Chemotactic assays were performed using a disposable ChemoTx system (Neuro Probe 101-3; Gaithersburg, MD). Full-length LD78β, LD78α, and the cleavage products of LD78β generated by digestion with the three NSPs, cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase 3, were used as chemoattractants for mononuclear cells. The chemoattractants were dissolved in the concentration range of 0.1–10 nm in PBS. The lower wells were filled with 29 μl of chemoattractant solution, and a framed filter was placed onto the microplate. Mononuclear cells (107) were suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and 29 μl were added to the framed filter. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h, media containing nonresponders were aspirated off, and the cells were washed with PBS. Cells adhering to the filter were dislodged by spinning at 1500 rpm for 5 min. After freezing and thawing, the migrated total cells were labeled with a CyQuant cell proliferation kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the company's protocol, and the intensity of fluorescence was measured with 485 and 520 nm as the excitation and emission wavelength, respectively, using a luminescence spectrometer. Data were normalized with the value obtained with 10 nm LD78α as 100% and were obtained from triplicate measurements. Purification of LD78β and LD78α—For expression of full-length human LD78β or LD78α in bacteria, the expression vectors were constructed by adding methionine before the N-terminal amino acid residue alanine. The proteins were efficiently purified using ultrafiltration and reverse phase HPLC systems with the yield of 0.2–0.5 mg/liter of culture (Fig. 1) and characterized by N-terminal amino acid sequence and mass value (Table I). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LD78α started with ASLAADTP, excluding the first methionine, with a molecular mass of 7790.8 Da. LD78β had two different forms, MAPLAADTP- (minor, 10%) and PLAADTPMA- (major, 90%, lacking the first two amino acids), with a molecular mass of 7930.4 and 7728.0 Da, respectively.Table IDetermination of N terminus amino acid sequences and mass values of purified LD78β and LD78αProteinN terminus amino acid sequenceMass valueLD78βPLAADTPTA (major, 90%)7728.0 (7727.7)MAPLAADTP (minor, 10%)7930.4 (7929.9)LD78αASLAADTPTA (major, 99%)7790.8 (7788.7) Open table in a new tab Proteolysis of LD78β and LD78α by Cell Lysates—To examine proteolysis of LD78β and LD78α, the substrates were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with human peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates or neutrophil lysates. Fig. 2A shows the protein profiles of cell lysates and substrates. As shown in Fig. 2B, neutrophil lysates cleaved both substrates, whereas mononuclear cell lysates did not detectably degrade LD78β or LD78α. Neutrophil lysates degraded the parent substrates (7.8 kDa) to cleavage products with molecular masses of <6.5 kDa. The Effect of Protease Inhibitors on Degradation of LD78β and LD78α by Neutrophil Lysates—Neutrophil lysates were preincubated with various protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 1 h, and the lysates were reacted with LD78β or LD78α at 37 °C for 4 and 24 h. When incubated without inhibitors for 4 h, the lysates cleaved the parent 7.8-kDa LD78β to products with apparent molecular masses of ∼6.5 and 5 kDa. These cleavage products were further degraded to smaller peptides following a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B showed that full length LD78α was initially cleaved to 4.5–6.5-kDa cleavage products and further degraded to peptides of <4.0 kDa following a 24-h incubation. Degradation of LD78β and LD78α was almost totally blocked in the presence of serine protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and AEBSF, but not inhibited by EDTA, E-64, EST, leupeptin, TLCK, and TPCK (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the proteolysis of LD78β and LD78α may be by serine proteases in neutrophils. A 7.5-kDa band appeared during incubation of both LD78β and LD78α in the presence of AEBSF. Edman sequencing revealed that the 7.5-kDa band had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as the parent molecules, suggesting a portion of the C terminus part may be removed by specific protease activity (data not shown). Processing of LD78β and LD78α by Cathepsin G, Elastase, and Proteinase 3—Each NSP, cathepsin G, elastase, and protease 3, was tested to determine its capacity to degrade LD78β and LD78α. Different cleavage patterns were produced by each serine protease, with cathepsin G and proteinase 3 producing major cleavage products for LD78β of 6.5 and 5.5 kDa, whereas the major elastase cleavage products were <5 kDa (Fig. 4A). The cleavage pattern of LD78α generated by each serine protease was quite similar to that of LD78β (Fig. 4B and Table II). The serine protease cleavage patterns were different from those produced by neutrophil lysates, suggesting that degradation of LD78β and LD78α may occur by the action of two or more serine proteases.Table IIDetermination of mass values and peptide sequences of LD78β (A) and LD78α (B) cleavage products by neutrophil lysates and serine proteasesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Determination of the Cleavage Sites of LD78β and LD78α by Neutrophil Lysates or NSPs—The cleavage products of LD78α and LD78β by neutrophil lysates, cathepsin G, elastase, or proteinase 3 were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine the mass values and peptide sequencing of their cleavage products. Peptide sequence-matched mass values were assigned to the cleavage products, as shown in Table II. For LD78β, neutrophil lysates cleaved Thr16-Ser17, Phe24-Ile25, Tyr28-Phe29, Thr31-Ser32, Asp53-Pro54, and Tyr62-Val63 preferentially. Whereas cathepsin G cleaved Gln22-Asn23, Phe24-Ile25, and Tyr28-Phe29, elastase and proteinase 3 preferentially cleaved Cys12-Phe13, Thr16-Ser17, Ser17-Arg18, and Thr31-Ser32. For LD78α, Phe13-Ser14, Tyr15-Thr16, Thr16-Ser17, Phe24-Ile25, and Thr31-Ser32 were cleaved by neutrophil lysates. Cathepsin G cleaved Phe13-Ser14, Tyr15-Thr16, Phe24-Ile25, Tyr28-Phe29, Asp53-Pro54, and Tyr62-Val63; elastase and proteinase 3 preferentially Thr16-Ser17, Ser17-Arg18, and Thr31-Ser32. These results confirmed that the cleavage sites by neutrophil lysates were combinations of those by cathepsin G and elastase or proteinase 3. No Degradation of LD78β with Neutrophil Lysates Derived from PLS Patients—Neutrophil lysates obtained from three PLS patients and five healthy individuals were incubated with LD78β at 37 °C for 24 h, and the reaction mixtures were separated on polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 5, LD78β was cleaved by neutrophil lysates from healthy controls. In contrast, cell lysates from PLS patients did not detectably degrade LD78β. Incubation of LD78α also demonstrated the absence of cleavage by neutrophil lysates donated from PLS patients (data not shown). Chemotactic Activity of Intact LD78β, LD78α, and Their Cleavage Products—After LD78β was digested with three NSPs (cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase 3) for 24 h, its chemotactic activity was compared with the parent molecules LD78β and LD78α. The LD78β cleavage products had molecular masses of <4.5 kDa after cleavage by the three serine proteases (data not shown). After incubation of mononuclear cells with chemoattractant, the migrated cells were measured by fluorescence labeling of the cellular nucleic acids. The results showed that LD78β and LD78α had similar chemoattractant potency, and LD78β cleavage products lost the biological activity (Fig. 6). In addition to their role in intralysosomal degradation of engulfed cell debris and microorganisms, the function of extracellularly released NSPs at sites of inflammation has received increasing attention (5Bank U. Ansorge S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar). NSPs impact the bioactivity of cytokine networks through proteolytic release of active cytokines from precursor molecules, cleavage inactivation of active cytokines, cytokine receptor shedding, and proteolysis of cytokine"
https://openalex.org/W2041357287,"gp96 is a 96-kDa glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum that is believed to be involved in antigen processing as an intermediate carrier of peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. This function implies that gp96 carries a large array of different peptides that represent the antigenicity of the cell and can serve all MHC class I molecules. So far, the evidence regarding these peptides is largely indirect and based on experiments where mice immunized with gp96 from tumor or virus-infected cells developed T cellular immune responses with the corresponding specificities. We analyzed by mass spectrometry peptides isolated from gp96 and found a number of different peptides derived from the proteins of different cellular compartments but mostly cytoplasm and nucleus. The sequences of these peptides provide information on the specificity of antigen processing and reveal structural requirements for binding to gp96 that only partially correspond to those of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. The yield of peptides extracted from gp96 was far substoichiometric with an estimated occupancy of this chaperone of between 0.1% and 0.4%. These results strongly argue against a regular role for gp96 as a peptide chaperone in antigen processing. gp96 is a 96-kDa glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum that is believed to be involved in antigen processing as an intermediate carrier of peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.

These results strongly argue against a regular role for gp96 as a peptide chaperone in antigen processing. A number of different functions have been assigned to the endoplasmic chaperone gp96, including ATPase and aminopeptidase activity and a role in protein folding (1Li Z. Srivastava P.K.

Its involvement in cellular immunity first became apparent with the demonstration that it is immunogenic when injected into animals and induces immune responses against specific antigens of the cells from which it was isolated (3Srivastava P.K. DeLeo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This antigen transfer capacity was proposed to be the molecular basis for crosspriming, i.e. induction of T cell responses to antigens presented by MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TPPII, tripeptidyl peptidase II. 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TPPII, tripeptidyl peptidase II. class I molecules of cells other than those that express the antigens (4Berwin B.

A. 2004; 101: 6128-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and gp96 was postulated to be a key intermediate endoplasmic carrier of peptides that are destined for presentation by MHC class I molecules. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate stimulation of tumor-specific T cells with gp96 isolated from the tumor cells (6Fleischer K. Schmidt B. Kastenmuller W. Busch D.H. Drexler I. Sutter G. Heike M. Peschel C. Bernhard H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also, gp96 was shown to directly stimulate dendritic cells to mature to competent antigen-presenting cells and to induce anti-tumor immune responses even when the peptide-binding domain had been deleted (7Baker-LePain J.C. Sarzotti M. Fields T.A. Li C.Y. Nicchitta C.V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The α2-macroglobulin receptor was shown to be the receptor for gp96 involved in these processes (8Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G. Toes R.E. Schild H. Eur. J.

Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). All of these observations suggest that gp96 plays an important role in cellular immune responses. However, the proposed peptide chaperone function of this protein needs to be critically reevaluated (11Nicchitta C.V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Nicchitta C.V. Carrick D.M. Baker-Lepain J.C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for the antigen-specific immune functions is that gp96 carries a wide range of different peptides from different source proteins, including T cell epitopes that can be bound and presented by different MHC molecules independent of the specific MHC alleles of the cells that express the antigen. However, so far no direct information on the composition of gp96-bound peptides has been reported. Peptides presented by MHC class I molecules are thought to be derived mostly from defective ribosomal products, which are degraded by the proteasome system or, as recently reported, TPPII (13Schubert U.

Free peptides generated by these endoproteolytic systems have not yet been isolated from cells, presumably because they are rapidly degraded. However, it is generally believed that the C terminus of most of these peptides is generated by cleavage by the proteasomes or TPPII directly (17Nagorsen D. Servis C. Lévy N. Provenzano M. Dudley M.E. Marincola F.M. Lévy F. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 817-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the C terminus, the N terminus of the primary endoproteolytic products may be reduced by aminopeptidases in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum (18Serwold T. Gaw S. Shastri N. Nat.

Peptides associated with gp96 should provide insights into the composition of the intracellular peptide pool and into the specificity of cleavage of polypeptides by proteasomes and TPPII inside the cells. To clarify the nature of gp96-bound peptides and to answer the above questions, we isolated peptides from gp96 of the cutaneous T cell lymphoma tumor cell line MyLa, determined their molecular masses, assessed their physicochemical properties, and sequenced a number of these isolates to identify their origin. Cell Cultures—gp96 and MHC class I molecules were isolated from the HLA-A1- and HLA-B8-expressing cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell line MyLa (22Kaltoft K. Bisballe S. Dyrberg T. Boel E. Rasmussen P.B. Thestrup-Pedersen K. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in roller flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% newborn calf serum, and 100 units of interleukin-2/ml. 80 g of cells (∼8 × 1010 cells) were used for the isolation of MHC class I molecules, and 120 g (1.2 × 1011 cells) were used for gp96. Isolation of Peptide from MHC Class I Molecules—MHC class I were isolated as described in details elsewhere (23Demine R. Sherev T. Walden P. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane proteins were solubilized with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% CHAPS, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Pefabloc as proteinase inhibitors. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g), and the solubilisate precleared by passage through an immune affinity column with the monoclonal antibody 19-178, which has an irrelevant specificity. The MHC class I molecules were then absorbed to an affinity chromatography column with the monoclonal pan-HLA class I-specific antibody w6/32. Both antibodies were coupled to CH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) via N-hydroxy succinimid. After adsorption of the solubilized and precleared proteins, the immune affinity column was washed successively, first with 20 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), second with TBS with 0.3% CHAPS, third with TBS buffer, fourth with TBS with 0.3% β-octylglycoside, fifth with TBS buffer, and sixth with ultrapure water. The peptides were then eluted directly from the column with 0.7% trifluoroacetic acid in ultrapure water, dried by lyophilization, redissolved in 1 ml of 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and separated from high molecular mass materials by ultrafiltration (3-kDa molecular mass cut-off; Centricon 3; Millipore). Isolation of Peptide from gp96—For the isolation of gp96, the cells were Dounce homogenized in hypotonic NaHCO3 buffer (30 mm, pH 7.1) with 0.1 mm Pefabloc as protease inhibitor. The homogenate was cleared of cell debris by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatants were applied to a concavalin A affinity Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with homogenization buffer, and gp96 was eluted with the same buffer containing 10% α-methyl-mannopyranoside. The elution buffer was exchanged to homogenization buffer by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 30 or Centricon 30; Millipore). The concentrated eluate was collected, desalted by centrifugation through a spin column with Sephadex G10 (Amersham Biosciences), and adjusted to 2% trifluoroacetic acid. After 30 min at 4 °C the peptides were separated from the high molecular weight components by ultrafiltration (Centricon 3), dried by lyophilization, and redissolved in 5% acetonitile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The remaining gp96 was incubated for another 30 min with 40% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and again subjected to ultrafiltration to isolate hydrophobic peptides. Both batches of peptides were analyzed separately by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Quantification of the Proteins and Peptides—MHC class I molecules and gp96 were isolated from 10 g of MyLa cells, analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by a BCA protein quantification assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The theoretical yield of MHC class I molecules was assessed by determining the average number of molecules/cell surface by flow cytometry after staining the cells with the phycoerythrin-labeled pan-MHC class I-specific monoclonal antibody w6/32 and comparing the mean fluorescence intensities with the mean fluorescence intensities obtained with phycoerythrin-labeled calibration beads (QuantiBRITE™; BD Biosciences). The number of MyLa cells/1 g of cell pellet was estimated to be 1 × 109. The peptides extracted from MHC class I molecules and gp96 were quantified with the CBQCA ATTO-TAG peptide quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 10 mm borate buffer, pH 9.3, and a completely randomized nonapeptide library as standard. HPLC Separation of the Isolated Peptides—The peptides from the above preparations were fractionated by HPLC using a C2/C18 reversed phase column (SMART HPLC with a μRPC SC 2.1/10 column; Amersham Biosciences) and an acetonitrile gradient of 5–90% solvent B (solvent A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). 45 fractions of 200 μl were collected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. 20–50 μl of these fractions were subjected to a second dimension reverse phase micro HPLC (C18, 300-μm inner diameter, 5-cm length; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 5–90% solvent B as above at 2 μl/min and collected in 45 fractions of 0.5 μl directly onto MALDI targets. Mass Spectrometric Analysis and Sequencing of the Isolated Peptides—0.5 μl of every HPLC fractions was analyzed for the presence and the masses of peptides by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid as matrix. The peptides were sequenced by MALDI-TOF post-source decay (24Chaurand P. Luetzenkirchen F. Spengler B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences were deduced from the post-source decay fragmentation spectra with the de novo sequencing software Sequit (25Demine R. Walden P. Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (www.sequit.org) and the data base search engine MASCOT (26Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S.

Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1426-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (www.matrix-science.com). Peptides associated with gp96 are expected to be very heterogeneous with a low abundance of the individual peptide species. The peptides extracted from gp96 as well as those from the MHC class I molecules of the MyLa tumor cell line were therefore fractionated by reversed phased HPLC (Fig. 1A) to reduce their heterogeneity and to enrich the specific peptides in single HPLC fractions for subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Consistent with the supposed function of gp96 as an intermediate carrier of antigenic peptides, a highly complex mixture of peptides was found to be associated with gp96 covering a mass range of ∼800–2,600 Da (Fig. 1, B and D), which corresponds to peptide lengths of ∼7–24 amino acids. This size distribution covers a much wider range than what is typically found for peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules as exemplified by the peptides isolated from the MHC class I molecules of MyLa cells, which with 800–1500 Da is consistent with a length of MHC class I-bound peptide of 8–11 amino acids (Fig. 1, C and D). As by the acetonitrile concentrations required to elute these peptides from the HPLC reversed phase column, the hydrophobicity of the gp96 and of the MHC class I-bound peptides is comparable, although the MHC class I-associated peptides are more heterogeneous in their physicochemical properties. For determination of the yields of gp96 and MHC class I molecules and peptides associated with these proteins, gp96 and MHC peptide complexes were isolated from 10 g of MyLa cells each. The average number of MHC class I molecules/cell surface was 30,000 as measured by flow cytometry with the phycoerythrin-labeled pan-MHC class I-specific monoclonal antibody w6/32 and phycoerythrin-labeled calibration beads. The theoretical yield of MHC molecules and peptides from the 10 g of MyLa cells would thus be 498 pmol. After acidic elution of the MHC peptide complexes from the immune affinity column and separation of protein and peptides by ultrafiltration, 400 pmol of MHC molecules and 101 pmol of peptides were recovered, which corresponds to 80% recovery of the MHC molecules and of that 25% recovery of the peptides. Because MHC class I molecules are stable only with incorporated peptide, it is assumed that the occupancy with peptide is ∼100% so that the recovery of peptide reflects the outcome of the isolation procedure rather than the original occupancy of the MHC molecules. For gp96 it is not possible to measure the number of molecules in the intact cell. We therefore cannot calculate a theoretical yield. From the 10 g of cells 525 μg of gp96 were isolated, which is 5469 pmol, ∼14 times more than MHC class I molecules. From this amount of protein altogether 6.46 pmol of peptides were isolated, which corresponds to a yield of 0.1%. If we assume a comparable recovery of peptide isolated from gp96 as what we obtained from MHC class I molecules, the occupancy of gp96 would be 0.4%. Even taking into account the high excess of gp96 over MHC class I molecules, the amount of peptides bound to gp96 at steady state is only ∼6% of what is bound to the MHC class molecules. To control for this far substoichiometric yield of peptides, we subjected the proteins actin, lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and two different IgGs to the same acidic extraction procedure applied to gp96 but could not demonstrate any peptide binding. The low abundance of individual gp96-associated peptides makes their characterization more challenging than the analysis of MHC class I-associated peptides. Nonetheless, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with post-source decay fragmentation of the peptide and deduction of the sequences from the resulting fragments by de novo peptide sequencing or data base comparisons, we could determine the sequences of 14 of these peptides (Table I). These 14 peptides include samples from all but one of the HPLC fractions and thus represent the entire range of hydrophobicity of the gp96-associated peptides. Most of the peptides were obtained by extraction from gp96 with 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Only a few peptides were found in the 40% acetonitrile extracts. The sizes of the peptides were between 7 and 21 amino acids (887–2511 Da), which covers the entire size range of gp96-associated peptides detected. All of the peptides contain at least one of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine or tyrosine, which has been suggested to be critical for binding of peptides to gp96 (28Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Hainfeld J.F. Sastry S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11049-11054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 14 peptides are derived from 12 different source proteins with different subcellular localization. Nine (cystatin A and B, calvasculin, CdC2-related protein kinase 5, fus-like protein, 4-α-glucano-transferase, Hsp40, the mannose isomerase and the ribonucleoprotein) are proteins of the cytoplasm or nucleus, one (cathepsin A) is lysosomal, and two (plexin-A2 and the aminopeptidase) are membrane proteins. For cathepsin A, two peptides were found that differ by one amino acid at the N terminus (Fig. 2) and elute in different HPLC fractions, the shorter peptide in fraction 8 and the longer, more hydrophobic peptide in fraction 10. Cystatin A was also represented by two peptides, cystatin A78–98 and cystatin A81–98, eluting fractions 11 and 12, respectively. Here, the shorter is reduced by three amino acids at the N terminus. The structures of the two cathepsin A-derived peptides were determined by complete de novo sequencing (Fig. 2), and those of the longer cystatin A-derived peptides were determined by data base matches of the fragmentation profiles. No variations at the C terminus were found. Five peptides, the two variants of both cathepsin A and cystatin A, as well as the cystatin B peptide are of the C termini of the proteins, and the others are derived from internal sequence stretches.Table ISequences of peptides bound by gp96 of the T cell lymphoma cell line MyLaFractionaFraction of the reverse-phase HPLC in which the gp96-associated peptide was identified.[M + H]+bMeasured mass of the monoprotonated peptide ion.SequencecSequence of the peptide isolated from MHC class I and sequenced by MALDI-TOF post-source decay mass spectrometry and the de novo sequencing software Sequit and the mass spectrometry database comparison engine MASCOT.Protein (GI)dSource protein of the peptides isolated from gp96; in parenthesis: the gene identifier (gi) numbers.Position/AAeSequence position for the peptide and total numbers of amino acids in the protein sequence.71067.41GGGGGGSGGGGGYGNfus-like protein (7440064)186-200/52871127.49FGFGDSRGGGGNHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (133257)207-218/35381152.62SRFLNKQPYCathepsin A (4505989)472-480/48091064.51FEGFPDKQPCalvasculin (115601)90-98/10110887.50YRPPELLCell division cycle 2-like protein kinase 5 (10719935)265-271/418101299.69FSRFLNKQPYCathepsin A (4505989)471-480/48011894.48PVRQTFFLysosomal α-mannosidase precursor (3122374)635-641/1010112042.01VLTGYQVDKNKDDELTGFCystatin A (1311047)81-98/98121869.99EKKYFAATQFEPLAARLeucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase (5031881)285-300/1025122381.31KPITLKARNLPQPQSGQRGYEPlexin-A2 (6010215)272-292/1328122399.16EDLVLTGYQVDKNKDDELTGFCystatin A (4885165)78-98/9812,132511.29KPLTLSNYQTNKAKHDELTYFCystatin B (68783)78-98/98141136.64PLDCVTLQTF4-α-Glucanotransferase/amylo-1,6-glucosidase (105131)106-115/1515141157.54FGGRNPFDTFDnaJ (Hsp40) homologue, subfamily B, member 1 (5453690)106-115/340a Fraction of the reverse-phase HPLC in which the gp96-associated peptide was identified.b Measured mass of the monoprotonated peptide ion.c Sequence of the peptide isolated from MHC class I and sequenced by MALDI-TOF post-source decay mass spectrometry and the de novo sequencing software Sequit and the mass spectrometry database comparison engine MASCOT.d Source protein of the peptides isolated from gp96; in parenthesis: the gene identifier (gi) numbers.e Sequence position for the peptide and total numbers of amino acids in the protein sequence. Open table in a new tab To assess whether the gp96-associated peptides harbor MHC ligands, we compared their sequences to the sequences of peptides, which were found bound to MHC class I molecules and are listed in SYFPEITHI and in the JenPep databases of T cell epitopes and MHC ligands (29Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, 30Blythe M.J. Doytchinova I.A. Flower D.R.

Sci. 2003; 43: 1276-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, none of the gp96-associated peptides we identified match or include the sequences of the MHC class I ligands determined to date. Nonetheless, in principle, these peptides can be precursors of MHC class I ligands because it is apparent from a comparison of their sequences with the sequence motifs of MHC-binding peptides as listed in the SYFPEITHI data base. Because it is generally assumed that trimming of the precursors of the MHC class I ligands occurs only at the N terminus, we kept the C terminus of the peptides constant for these analyses and allowed for N-terminal variation. In the cases of the heptapeptides YRP-PELL (Cdc2-like PK265–271) and PVRQTFF (lysosomal mannosidase635–641), we assumed that there could be longer precursors and extended their sequences at the C terminus according to the sequences of the parental proteins. For 8 of the 14 peptides, we were able to define potential MHC class I ligands (Table II). These potential epitopes would be presented by different MHC allomorphs. However, none of them would fit the epitope-binding motifs of the MHC class I molecules HLA-A1 and HLA-B8, which are expressed by the MyLa cells from which the gp96 was isolated. At least one of the source proteins of the gp96-associated peptides, cathepsin A, contains an independent known MHC class I ligand, which was found to be HLA B*2705-restricted. In contrast to the lack of correlation with known MHC class I-restricted epitopes, one peptide, EKKYFAATQFEPLAAR of the leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase, covers part of the sequence of a peptide that was found before to be restricted by the HLA class II molecule HLA-DPA1*0201/DPB1*0401 (32Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Comparing the peptides isolated from gp96 with those isolated from the MHC class I molecules of the MyLa cells, we could not find any correspondence. Table III lists seven MHC class I-associated peptides that were sequenced. These are mostly nonapeptides; one is a decapeptide, and two are octapeptides whose sequences correspond largely to the published epitope motives for the HLA class I molecules expressed by MyLa, i.e. HLA-A1 and HLA-B8. None of these peptides was found on gp96. Moreover, comparing the masses and the hydrophobicity of the 71 peptides isolated from the MHC class I molecules and of the 216 peptides isolated from gp96 (Fig. 1), not a single match was found.Table IIPotential MHC class I-restricted T cell epitopes deduced from the sequences of gp96-associated peptidesC terminus of gp96-bound peptidesaTerminal amino acids of the peptides isolated from gp96.RepresentationbNumbers of peptides with the amino acid indicated in the first column at their C terminus.Suitable MHC class I allelecMHC restriction of the potential T cell epitopes deduced from the sequences of the gp96-associated peptides.Potential epitopedSequence of the potential T cell epitopes; the anchor amino acids corresponding to the allele-specific T cell epitope motifs of the MHC molecules given in column 3 are highlighted.ProteineSource proteins for the T cell epitopes.E1QPQSGQRGYEPlexin-A2F6xA3 B15 B38PLDCVTLQTF4-α-Glucanotransferase/amylo-1,6-glucosidaseB27 B46KNKDDELTGFCystatin AB27 B46KAKHDELTYFCystatin BFGGRNPFDTFDnaJ (Hsp40) homologue, subfamily B, member 1A2 A3 B15(LLL) PVRQTFFLysosomal alpha-mannosidase precursorL1A2(TLW) YRPPELLCell division cycle 2-like protein kinase 5N2xGSGGGGGYGNfus-like proteinFGDSRGGGGNHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1P1B61FFEGFPDKQPCalvasculinR1A31ATQFEPLAARLeucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidaseY2xB27FSRFLNKQPYCathepsin AMHC motifsfMHC allele-specific motifs of ligands for the MHC class I molecules expressed by the cutaneous lymphoma cell line MyLa, the source for the gp96 analyzed.A1–D/E––-YgDash indicates any amino acid.B8–K/R-K/R–-LgDash indicates any amino acid.a Terminal amino acids of the peptides isolated from gp96.b Numbers of peptides with the amino acid indicated in the first column at their C terminus.c MHC restriction of the potential T cell epitopes deduced from the sequences of the gp96-associated peptides.d Sequence of the potential T cell epitopes; the anchor amino acids corresponding to the allele-specific T cell epitope motifs of the MHC molecules given in column 3 are highlighted.e Source proteins for the T cell epitopes.f MHC allele-specific motifs of ligands for the MHC class I molecules expressed by the cutaneous lymphoma cell line MyLa, the source for the gp96 analyzed.g Dash indicates any amino acid.

Inherited defects in ARH lead to a hypercholesterolemia that closely phenocopies that caused by a defective LDL receptor. The elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels typical of ARH patients and the pronounced accumulation of the LDL receptor at the cell surface of hepatocytes in ARH-null mice argue that ARH operates by promoting the internalization of the LDL receptor within clathrin-coated vesicles. ARH contains an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain that associates physically with the LDL receptor internalization sequence and with phosphoinositides. The carboxyl-terminal half of ARH contains a clathrin-binding sequence and a separate AP-2 adaptor binding region providing a plausible mechanism for how ARH can act as an endocytic adaptor or CLASP (clathrin-associated sorting protein) to couple LDL receptors with the clathrin machinery. Because the interaction with AP-2 is highly selective for the independently folded appendage domain of the β2 subunit, we have characterized the ARH β2 appendage-binding sequence in detail. Unlike the known α appendage-binding motifs, ARH requires an extensive sequence tract to bind the β appendage with comparably high affinity. A minimal 16-residue sequence functions autonomously and depends upon ARH residues Asp253, Phe259, Leu262, and Arg266. We suggested that biased β subunit engagement by ARH and the only other β2 appendage selective adaptor, β-arrestin, promotes efficient incorporation of this mechanistically distinct subset of CLASPs into clathrin-coated buds.

Clathrin-coated vesicles are short lived transport intermediates fabricated solely for the preferential sorting and intracellular trafficking of select transmembrane proteins, bound ligands, and lipids (1Bonifacino J.S.

Clathrin coats assemble at several discrete intracellular sites where, typically, different cargo molecules are sorted. As the two major clathrin-associated heterotetrameric adaptor proteins (AP-1 and AP-2) are generally restricted to particular sorting stations within the cell, a long standing model has been that adaptors direct the process of cargo selection (4Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Different subunits of the adaptor complex directly engage different classes of sorting sequences. The μ2 subunit binds to YXXØ-type (where Ø is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) sorting signals in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (3Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J.

In the basal state, the orientation of the μ2 subunit within AP-2 makes the YXXØ interaction surface inaccessible. Phosphorylation on μ2 residue Thr156 is believed to alter the conformation of μ2 to allow productive engagement of the YXXØ sequence (7Olusanya O. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R. Smythe E. Curr.

Another sorting sequence termed the (DE)XXXL(LI) motif is recognized by AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 (6Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the (DE)XXXL(LI) sequence is bound by a hemicomplex of the γ and σ1 subunits in AP-1 or the δ and σ3 subunits in AP-3 (10Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), although the precise location of the interaction site remains to be determined. Not all cargo molecules sorted into clathrin-coated vesicles appear to utilize heterotetrameric adaptors directly, because not all sorting sequences conform to the YXXØ or (DE)XXX L(LI) types. At the plasma membrane, there are several other internalization signals/tags known (6Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), and the growing consensus is that alternate adaptor proteins govern the endocytosis of proteins with these signals (3Robinson M.S.

In humans, the LDL receptor, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, plays a critical role in regulating plasma LDL-cholesterol levels. Inherited defects in the receptor cause hypercholesterolemia and, if untreated, early onset coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. The 50-amino acid cytosolic domain of the LDL receptor contains an 802FDNPVY sequence that is necessary and sufficient for rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LDL (13Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of a receptor with a single nucleotide point mutation generating a Tyr807 → Cys substitution, which inactivates the FXNPXY internalization sequence, results in a clinical phenotype that is similar to individuals who express no detectable LDL receptor (14Davis C.G.

There is in vitro evidence for the vital FXNPXY sequence binding the AP-2 μ2 subunit (Kd ∼50 μm) but as an atypical variant of the YXXØ-type interaction utilizing the Tyr and distal amino acids (FDNPVYQKT). 2D. J. Owen, unpublished observations.2D. J. Owen, unpublished observations. (The boldface identifies the distal amino acids being referred to). Other biochemical work confirms a weak association with μ2 but suggests a binding site separate from the YXXØ interaction surface (15Boll W. Rapoport I. Brunner C. Modis Y. Prehn S. Kirchhausen T. Traffic. 2002; 3: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yet overexpression of the LDL receptor in HeLa cells does not impede the efficient clathrin-mediated endocytosis of either transferrin or epidermal growth factor receptors (16Warren R.A. Green F.A. Stenberg P.E. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17056-17063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In fact, RNA interference silencing of AP-2 protein levels has a negligible effect on the sorting of the FXNPXY sequence, although transferrin uptake is almost completely blocked (17Motley A.

These properties, together with the capacity to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 and cargo (the FXNPXY sequence), designate Dab2 and ARH as CLASPs (clathrin-associated sorting proteins). Importantly, ARH is the first human disease directly attributable to a defect in a component of the endocytic clathrin machinery. These CLASPs are presumed to expand the sorting repertoire of the endocytic clathrin coat and to act analogously to two other alternate adaptors, β-arrestin1 and -2. Following ligand stimulation, the internalization of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is driven by the β-arrestins, which rapidly translocate to the phosphorylated GPCR on the cell surface and mesh with existing clathrin-coated structures at the surface by binding to both clathrin and AP-2 (29Claing A.

Here we present a detailed analysis of the side chain requirements for specific binding to the AP-2 β2 appendage in human ARH. Our studies provide a comprehensive description of the endocytic interaction determinants located within vertebrate ARH proteins. DNA Constructs—The recombinant proteins consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to ARHC1 (human residues 180–308), AP-2 αC appendage (murine residues 701–938), αC appendage (Q782A) point mutant, AP-2 β2 appendage (rat residues 714–951), and the epsin 1 DPW domain (rat residues 229–407) fusion proteins have been described previously (22Mishra S.K.

GST-ARHM1 (human ARH residues 254–269) was generated by ligation of complementary oligonucleotides, after annealing and digestion, into EcoRI/XhoI cleaved pGEX-4T-1. The GST-ARHM2 was produced in two steps using the GST-ARHM1 plasmid as a template. First, an XbaI site was introduced into the center of the ARHM1 sequence without changing the encoded protein sequence. Then a second annealed oligonucleotide was ligated into EcoRI/XbaI-cut GST-ARHM1 to generate residues 248–269 of human ARH fused in-frame with GST. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ARHM2 was constructed similarly but using a single annealed oligonucleotide pair ligated into pEGFP-C1 between the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. ARH (full length) and the PTB domains (residues 1–179) were generated by insertion of appropriate PCR products into NheI/BglII digested pEGFP-N1, whereas ARHC1 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 using the EcoRI and BamHI sites. His6-tagged ARH was created by cloning PCR amplified full-length ARH between the NdeI and NotI sites of pET28. The GST-β-arrestin1 (rat residues 331–418) construct was kindly provided by Marc Caron. Directed mutations were introduced into the appropriate vectors using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) with the required mutagenic primer pairs (the sequences of which are all available upon request). All the clones and mutations were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Antibodies—The anti-clathrin heavy chain (HC) monoclonal antibody (mAb) TD.1, the AP-1/2 β1/β2-subunit mAb 100/1 or affinity-purified antibody GD/2, the AP-2 α-subunit mAbs 100/2 and AP.6, the anti-AP-1 γ subunit antibody AE/1, the anti-AP-1 μ1 subunit antibody RY/1, and the affinity-purified rabbit anti-epsin 1 antibodies have been described (33Traub L.M.

Rabbit anti-AP-2 μ2-subunit serum was kindly provided by Juan Bonifacino, and affinity-purified R461 anti-clathrin light chain antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-eps15 serum were kindly provided by Ernst Ungewickell. The mAbs directed against amphiphysin (which recognizes both amphiphysin I and -II) and AP180 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories, and the anti-GST mAb was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein and Tissue Extract Preparation—GST and the various GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The standard induction protocol entails shifting log-phase cultures (A600 ∼0.6) from 37 °C to room temperature and then adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 3–5 h at room temperature with constant shaking, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min and stored at -80 °C until used. Bacteria were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with sonication or in B-PER reagent (Pierce). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 23,700 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min, and then the GST fusions were collected on GSH-Sepharose. After extensive washing in PBS, GST fusions were eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm GSH, 5 mm DTT on ice and dialyzed into PBS, 1 mm DTT before use in binding assays. Several of the purified fusion proteins were cleaved from the GST with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) while still immobilized upon GSH-Sepharose. Digestion was as recommended by the manufacturer, followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 25 μm. His6-ARH was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by induction of log-phase cultures with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 3 h. Cleared lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose, and bound protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm sodium chloride, 100 mm imidazole. Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brain (PelFreez) by sequential differential centrifugation after homogenization in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture. The 105,000 × gmax supernatant is defined as cytosol and was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. Before use in binding assays, thawed samples of rat brain cytosol were adjusted to 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT (assay buffer) by addition of a 10× stock and then centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax (TLA-100.4 rotor) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove insoluble particulate material. Binding Assays—Pull-down-type assays, in a total volume of 300 μl, were as described previously (34Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Drake M.T. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28700-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Typically, 50–400 μg of GST and the GST fusion proteins were first each immobilized upon ∼25 μl of packed GSH-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous mixing. The Sepharose beads containing the required immobilized proteins were then washed and resuspended to 50 μl in assay buffer. Clarified rat brain cytosol or purified, thrombin-cleaved αC or β2 appendage (in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml carrier BSA) was added, and the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with continuous gentle mixing. For the competition assays, thrombin-cleaved proteins were added directly into the assay mixture to a final concentration of 20 μm in the presence of 25 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone. The GSH-Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 1 min, and an aliquot of each supernatant was removed and adjusted to 100 μl with SDS-sample buffer. After washing the GSH-Sepharose pellets four times each with ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS by centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated, and each pellet was resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—ARH-derived peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the University of Pittsburgh. The GST-β2 appendage fusion protein, produced in E. coli (DE3) pLysS (Novagen), was purified by affinity chromatography using GSH-Sepharose resin. The column matrix was washed extensively with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm sodium chloride, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated overnight with thrombin (Serva Electrophoresis). β2 appendage was eluted, concentrated, and further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm DTT. Mutant β2 appendage was expressed and purified as per wild type protein. ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC instrument (Microcal) at 10 °C in ITC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium chloride). 4–8 μl of 1 mm ARH-derived peptide was injected into 1.4 ml of 90 μm β2 appendage in 31–33 aliquots. The titration data were integrated and normalized in Origin (Microcal) to determine the reaction stoichiometry, n, and equilibrium constant,Kα(=Kd−1). Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Screens—The Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used. ARHC1 (residues 180–308) was cloned into EcoRI- and BamHI-cut pGBKT7, whereas the β2 appendage sequence was placed into pGADT7 digested with EcoRI and XhoI. After confirmation of the insert sequences, mutations were generated using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH190 was transformed with the appropriate plasmid combinations according to the manufacturer's protocols and selected first on SD minimal medium plates lacking Leu and Trp. Individual clones were selected and then streaked/spotted onto plates of SD medium lacking Leu and Trp, on plates without His, Leu, and Trp, or onto plates lacking Ade, His, Leu, and Trp. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved on polyacrylamide gels prepared with an altered acrylamide/bisacrylamide (30: 0.4) ratio stock solution. The decreased cross-linking generally improves resolution but also affects the relative mobility of several proteins, most noticeably AP180 and epsin 1. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose in ice-cold 15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine. Blots were usually blocked overnight in 5% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and then portions were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in the individual figure legends. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Immunofluorescence—CV-1 and HeLa SS6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2 and plated onto 12-mm round glass coverslips 1 day prior to transfection. For transient transfections in a 35-mm dish, 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was mixed with 375 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and 500 ng of DNA and incubated at room temperature for 45 min before adding the mixture to the dish. The following day the cells were permeabilized for 1 min on ice in 0.3% saponin in assay buffer, fixed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 10% goat serum, 0.2% saponin in PBS for 30 min, and finally incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies diluted with 10% goat serum and 0.05% saponin in PBS each for 1 h. Epifluorescent images were acquired using a 63× objective lens on a Nikon Microphot-FXL using appropriate excitation and emission filter cubes, and confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus Fluoview BX61 confocal with argon 488 and helium-neon 543 laser lines and appropriate filters. 3,3′-Dioctadecylindocarbocyanin (DiI)-LDL Internalization—HeLa cells were grown and transfected as described above, except that the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum following transfection to up-regulate LDL receptors. Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml DiI-LDL (Biomedical Technologies) for 40 min at 37 °C and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min for examination by epifluorescence microscopy. For quantitation, fields of cells were imaged using a 20× objective and analyzed using Metamorph (Universal Imaging). A binary mask corresponding to all of the transfected cells was generated and applied to the red channel (LDL). These transfected cells were then manually scored for no internalization (8-bit DiI-LDL intensity <80), partial internalization (structures present with 8-bit intensity 80–180), or normal internalization (structures present with 8-bit intensity >180). For transferrin internalization, cells were transfected and cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium as above but were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml DiI-LDL for 25 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 25 μg/ml biotin-conjugated human transferrin and further incubation at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, blocked, and permeabilized with 10% goat serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS for 30 min, incubated with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin with 10% goat serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS for 1 h, washed, mounted, and then imaged.

We used a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches to explore the contribution of transcriptional regulation to adult fast MyHC expression. Here we show that 800–1000 bp of a sequence upstream of the three mouse adult fast MyHC genes (Ia, IIb, and IId/x) are sufficient to drive muscle-specific and fiber-specific expression in vivo. We show that the upstream promoter region of the gene most abundantly expressed in mouse skeletal muscles, IIb MyHC, retains binding activity and transcriptional activation for three positive transcription factors, the serum response factor, Oct-1, and myocyte enhancer factor-2, whereas the other two genes (IIa and IId/x) have nucleotide substitutions in these sites that reduce binding and transcriptional activation. Finally, we demonstrate that regions upstream of 300 bp modulate the effects of these elements. Together, these data demonstrate that the quantitative differences in MyHC expression in mouse skeletal muscle have evolved at least in part through the elimination of positive-acting transcription factor binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2139917614,"Extremely variable clinic and genetic features characterize mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (MEM). Pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects can be divided into large-scale rearrangements and single point mutations. Clinical manifestations become evident when a threshold percentage of the total mtDNA is mutated. In some MEM, the ""mutant load"" in an affected tissue is directly related to the severity of the phenotype. However, the clinical phenotype is not simply a direct consequence of the relative abundance of mutated mtDNA. Other factors, such as nuclear background, can contribute to the disease process, resulting in a wide range of phenotypes caused by the same mutation. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide cDNA microarrays (HG-U133A), we studied the gene expression profile of muscle tissue biopsies obtained from 12 MEM patients [4 common 4977 bp deleted mtDNA and 8 A3243G: 4 progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and 4 mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic cidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) phenotypes] compared with age-matched healthy individuals. We found several differentially expressed genes: 35 were markedly up-regulated in the mtDNA macro-deletion group (vs. the control group) and 4 decreased; 56 genes were dysregulated in A3243G-related disorders (53 down-regulated in PEO and 3 up-regulated in MELAS). Finally, 12 genes were similarly regulated in the majority of the MEM patients under study. Amongst these, we identified an increased expression of genes related to the metabolism of the amino groups, as well as of several genes involved in genetic information processing. Moreover, few genes were similarly decreased in MEM patients vs. the control group. Real-time PCR demonstrated excellent reproducibility of the microarray-based findings. The observed expression changes are likely to represent a molecular signature for mitochondrial disorders. Furthermore, the differential expression profile of MELAS(A3243G) vs. PEO(A3243G) may support a role of nuclear background in contributing to these different clinical phenotypes. MEM microarray data are available from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with the accession number: GSE1462."

We investigated Gβγ dependence of the basal GIRK activity (AGIRK,basal) quantitatively, by titrated expression of Gβγ scavengers, in Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1/2 channels and muscarinic m2 receptors. The widely used Gβγ scavenger, myristoylated C terminus of β-adrenergic kinase (m-cβARK), reduced AGIRK,basal by 70–80% and eliminated the acetylcholine-evoked current (IACh). However, we found that m-cβARK directly binds to GIRK, complicating the interpretation of physiological data. Among several newly constructed Gβγ scavengers, phosducin with an added myristoylation signal (m-phosducin) was most efficient in reducing GIRK currents. m-phosducin relocated to the membrane fraction and did not bind GIRK. Titrated expression of m-phosducin caused a reduction of AGIRK,basal by up to 90%. Expression of GIRK was accompanied by an increase in the level of Gβγ and Gα in the plasma membrane, supporting the existence of preformed complexes of GIRK with G protein subunits. Increased expression of Gβγ and its constitutive association with GIRK may underlie the excessively high AGIRK,basal observed at high expression levels of GIRK. Only 10–15% of AGIRK,basal persisted upon expression of both m-phosducin and cβARK.

Opening of the channels is the result of a direct binding of Gβγ subunits released from the Gαi/oβγ heterotrimers (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 2Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y.

The channel can also be activated by cytosolic Na+ and membranal phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2); the latter is essential for proper GIRK gating by both Na+ and Gβγ (3Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 145: 47-179Crossref Google Scholar, 5Logothetis D.E. Zhang H. J. Physiol.

Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/111/re19)PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas the physiological role of neurotransmitter-induced GIRK activity is well established, the basal activity of these channels (AGIRK,basal) is often regarded as negligible and physiologically unimportant. This feature distinguishes GIRK from many other K+ channels of the Kir family, such as Kir1 and Kir2, which show high intrinsic activity under physiological conditions and are often referred to as “constitutively active.” Low AGIRK,basal is supposed to ensure high signal-to-noise ratio for GIRK-related neurotransmitter signaling and to minimize participation of GIRK in resting membrane K+ conductance (see Ref. 2Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, some classical and many recent studies challenge this concept. In sinoatrial node cells, GIRK channels may contribute a major part of basal K+ conductance (7Ito H. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 476: 55-68Google Scholar). Recent studies in intact neurons indicate that basal activity of GIRK may substantially contribute to resting K+ conductance, shunting the excitatory postsynaptic potentials and reducing the responses to glutamate (8Torrecilla M. Marker C.L. Cintora S.C. Stoffel M. Williams J.T. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substantial AGIRK,basal has been reported in hippocampal pyramidal cells (9Takigawa T. Alzheimer C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 67-75Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Luscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and in rat locus coeruleus slices (11Blanchet C. Luscher C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4674-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In murine locus coeruleus, where GIRKs mediate most of the inhibitory effects of opioids, knock-out of GIRK subunit genes depolarizes the cell's resting potential by as much as 20 mV (8Torrecilla M. Marker C.L. Cintora S.C. Stoffel M. Williams J.T. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, it was not clear whether the GIRK activity observed in resting cells under a variety of experimental conditions was a truly agonist-independent one or depended on the presence of “ambient” neurotransmitters or local hormones. For instance, in hippocampal pyramidal cells, one report assigned to ambient adenosine a major role in sustaining most of AGIRK,basal (9Takigawa T. Alzheimer C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 67-75Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas another one contended that AGIRK,basal was independent of adenosine or other neurotransmitters (10Luscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In any case, it appears that GIRK plays a substantial role in determining the resting membrane potential at least in some neurons and in sinoatrial pacemaker cells. It is therefore conceivable that not only activation of GIRK by Gi/o coupled neurotransmitters, but also its inhibition by neurotransmitters that activate Gαq (12Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J.

These considerations urge for a better understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of AGIRK,basal.An important contributor to AGIRK,basal is ambient free Gβγ. This has been shown in heterologous expression systems; coexpression of Gα subunits and a myristoylated C-terminal segment of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (m-cβARK), used in the past as standard Gβγ scavengers in GIRK studies (17Reuveny E.

(Lond.). 2002; 545: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), has been reported to reduce AGIRK,basal to different extents, between 50 and 90%. It is not clear whether the remaining activity is Gβγ-independent or simply reflects insufficient Gβγ sequestration, leaving open the question of whether a Gβγ-independent AGIRK,basal exists. Such Gβγ-independent basal activity could be due to a direct activation by cytosolic free Na+ (23Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and/or reflect an intrinsic Gβγ- and Na+-independent channel activity. The variability of the reported results regarding the extent of inhibition of AGIRK,basal by Gβγ scavengers calls for a better quantitative assessment of the Gβγ-dependent component. Furthermore, the use of Gα as a Gβγ scavenger is problematic. Coexpressed Gαi subunits may affect the level of channel expression (20Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); they interact with GIRK itself and have been hypothesized to affect the gating directly (20Peleg S.

It is not known whether m-cβARK, widely used to study modulation of ion channels by Gβγ (19Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen.

Therefore, further study is needed to reliably estimate the Gβγ-dependent part of AGIRK,basal.An intriguing phenomenon related to AGIRK,basal has been discovered in Xenopus oocytes (20Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). At low expression levels (densities) of GIRK, AGIRK,basal is low, and activation by agonist and by purified Gβγ (in whole cells and in excised patches, respectively) is strong, as expected. However, when more GIRK channels are expressed, their basal activity becomes excessively large at the expense of agonist- or Gβγ-evoked activity. Coexpression of a Gαi subunit restores the normal gating pattern, with low AGIRK,basal and high agonist- or Gβγ-evoked activity. We proposed that AGIRK,basal is controlled by a number of factors, most prominently Gβγ and Gα, and that the balance between these factors collapses when the channel is expressed at high levels in Xenopus oocytes, partly because of a lack of Gα (20Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Ivanina T. Varon D. Peleg S. Rishal I. Porozov Y. Dessauer C.W. Keren-Raifman T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17260-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The excessively high AGIRK,basal at high levels of GIRK expression remained incompletely understood. Theoretically, it seemed possible that at high densities GIRK behaves as a constitutively active channel.To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of AGIRK,basal, we have initiated a systematic study of Gβγ dependence of AGIRK,basal in Xenopus oocytes at different levels of GIRK expression. This heterologous expression system is superior to others for quantitative studies, since it allows both a controlled expression of proteins in very wide ranges and an accurate measurement of expressed proteins in the whole cell and in the plasma membrane (PM). Titrated expression of m-cβARK and a novel membrane-targeted Gβγ scavenger, myristoylated phosducin (m-phosducin), revealed that at least 90% of AGIRK,basal is Gβγ-dependent at all levels of expression of GIRK. Gβγ-independent activity, if any, constitutes only a small fraction of AGIRK,basal. The excessively high basal activity observed at high levels of channel expression may be due to a constitutive association of GIRK with Gβγ, in the absence of sufficient Gα needed to preserve low AGIRK,basal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs and RNA—The coding sequences of all cDNAs used in this study for preparation of RNA were inserted into high expression oocyte vectors containing 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of Xenopus β-globin: pGEMHE or its derivative pGEMHJ or pBS-MXT, as described in our previous publications (12Sharon D.

All PCR-derived cDNAs were sequenced in full at the Tel Aviv University sequencing facility. The original cDNAs of human m2R, human 5HT-1A receptor, mouse GIRK2, rat m-cβARK (aa 452–689end) (12Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen.

Hartig, P. Kofuji, E. Reuveny, R. J. Lefkowitz, and M. Lohse, respectively.PCR-derived full-length coding sequence of wild type phosducin was inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of pGEMHJ, creating the template for RNA synthesis and expression of wild-type, nonmyristoylated phosducin (n-phosducin). To create a membrane-attached derivative of phosducin, we first constructed a new vector, pGEMHE-myr, on the basis of the pGEMHE vector (33Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) modified by E. Reuveny, using standard PCR techniques. A DNA sequence, atggggagtagcaagagcaagcctaaggaccccagccagcgccgg, was inserted between SmaI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pGEM-HE vector. On the protein level, this adds the first 15 N-terminal aa of Src, MGSSKSKPKDPSQRR (34Dascal N. Doupnik C.A. Ivanina T. Bausch S. Wang W. Lin C. Garvey J. Chavkin C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), followed by Glu-Phe (encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the EcoRI site), to any proteins whose coding sequence is inserted between EcoRI and any one of the following restriction sites of pGEMHE polylinker. PCR product corresponding to the entire coding sequence of bovine phosducin, flanked by EcoRI and HindIII, was inserted into the respective restriction sites of pGEMHE-myr.cDNA for nonmyristoylated C terminus of human βARK1, n-cβARK, was created by inserting the cDNA sequence encoding aa 460–689end of βARK, preceded by a methionine, flanked by EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites, into the pGEMHJ vector. The comparison of physiological effects of m-cβARK (rat) and n-cβARK (human) is justified by high homology between these proteins (97% identity). To create the fusion proteins m2R-cβARK, 5HT1A-cβARK, and 5HT1A-1TMD-cβARK, PCR-derived coding sequences of m2R, 5HT1A receptor (5HT1AR), and aa 1–67 of 5HT1AR, respectively, flanked by EcoRI restriction sites, were inserted in frame just prior to the n-cβARK sequence made as described above. Point mutations in m-cβARK were done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).RNA was synthesized in vitro using a protocol that ensures incorporation of the GTP cap mainly into the 5′ portion of the RNA (35Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar) rather than along the whole length as with commercially available kits. Accordingly, the resulting RNAs are usually more efficient than those obtained by other standard protocols. 2N. Dascal, unpublished observations. Unless indicated otherwise, RNAs were injected into the oocytes in the following amounts: m2R, 0.5 ng/oocyte; n-cβARK, m2R-cβARK, 5HTA1-cβARK, 5HTA1–1TMD-cβARK, and m-cβARKR587Q, 5 ng/oocyte; n-phosducin, 10 ng/oocyte.Xenopus Oocytes Preparation and Electrophysiology—Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described (12Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Vorobiov D. Bera A.K. Keren-Raifman T. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), injected with RNA, and incubated for 3–4 days in ND-96 solution (NaCl, 96 mm; KCl, 2 mm; CaCl2, 1 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; Hepes/NaOH, 5 mm, pH 7.6) supplemented with gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm). All experiments were done at 20–22 °C. Whole-cell GIRK currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp with OC-725B (Warner Instruments Corp.), using agarose cushion electrodes (36Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) filled with 3 m KCl, with resistances of 0.1–0.5 megaohms. Oocytes were held at –80 mV in the ND-96 solution, and GIRK currents were measured in high K+ solutions, high K 96 or high K 24. High K 96 contained 96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). High K 24 contained 24 mm KCl, 72 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Data acquisition and analysis were done using Axotape and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA).Interaction between GST fusion proteins and phosducin and cβARK was studied as described (21Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecke B. Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29174-29183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-CT-GIRK1 fusion protein was purified, and its interaction with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (the various forms of cβARK, phosducin, and Gβ1γ2) synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was monitored using a standard pull-down procedure. GST-GIRK1-CT or GST-GIRK1-NT (5–10 μg) was incubated for 1 h with 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing the designated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in 300 μl of a high K+ buffer (150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) with the addition of 0.5% CHAPS. Then 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and washed in 1 ml of the same buffer (once with 0.5% and twice with 0.1% CHAPS). Bound proteins were eluted with 30 μlof 15 mm reduced glutathione and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The labeled products were imaged and quantified by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Western Blot Analysis—The oocytes were homogenized on ice in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) containing the Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture. Debris was removed by centrifugation twice at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cellular membrane fraction from 5–17 oocytes was obtained by 1 h of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. For Western blots, protein samples were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies against cβARK, phosducin, and Gβ common (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Visualization of protein bands was performed using ECL reagents obtained from Pierce. The intensity of labeling was quantified using TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Confocal Imaging of GIRK, Gα, and Gβ in Plasma Membrane—The levels of expressed proteins in PM were measured as described (20Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Singer-Lahat D. Dascal N. Mittelman L. Peleg S. Lotan I. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 627-633PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, large oocyte membrane patches were attached to coverslips with their cytoplasmic leaflet facing the external solution; fixed; stained by 0.75 ng/μl of a specific GIRK1 antibody (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem), 0.5 ng/μl of a common Gβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 2.5 ng/μl of a common Gα antibody (Calbiochem); and visualized using a Cy3-conjugated rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) using a Zeiss LSM 410 or a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Intensity of labeling (OD units) was measured with TINA software. In control experiments (Fig. 8, A and B), to estimate the specificity of labeling by the Gα and Gβ antibodies, purified Gαi1-GDP or purified Gβ1γ2, respectively, was added in 20-fold excess (w/v) over the antibodies. The purified Gαi1 and Gβ1γ2 were a generous gift from C. W. Dessauer (University of Texas, Houston).Data Presentation and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparison between two groups of treatment was done using the two-tailed Student's t test. Comparisons among several groups of data have been performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's test. The level of statistical significance is indicated in the figures as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.RESULTSm-cβARK Reduces Ibasal, but It Also Binds to the C Terminus of the GIRK1 Subunit—To separate the Gβγ-dependent component of AGIRK,basal, we have initially utilized the widely used Gβγ scavenger, m-cβARK. GIRK activation by Gβγ is membrane-delimited (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), so that only PM-attached Gβγ can activate the channel. Targeting of m-cβARK to the membranes is provided by the myristoylation signal (the first 15 aa of Src added to the N terminus of m-cβARK) (29Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dascal N. Doupnik C.A. Ivanina T. Bausch S. Wang W. Lin C. Garvey J. Chavkin C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For comparison, we have also constructed and tested a nonmyristoylated cβARK (n-cβARK), which should not be targeted to the membrane and thus is supposed to be less efficient than m-cβARK in inhibiting GIRK. As shown in Fig. 1, both m-cβARK and n-cβARK were well expressed in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1A) and in oocytes (Fig. 1B). m-cβARK showed two characteristic bands on SDS gels (Fig. 1, A and B). The lower band probably corresponded to the presence of a fraction of protein that remained nonmyristoylated, since only the upper band was present in the total membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, bottom). Only a small proportion of n-cβARK was found in the membrane fraction. Myristoylation of m-cβARK appeared to be more efficient in reticulocyte lysate than in the oocytes (Fig. 1, compare A and B). m-cβARK ran on the gel shown in this figure below the 35-kDa molecular size marker, but its actual molecular size was closer to 35 kDa, as deduced from its comparison with Gβ1 (∼37 kDa) and phosducin (∼33 kDa; see Figs. 3 and 4). In summary, in Xenopus oocytes, m-cβARK is synthesized, myristoylated, and preferentially targeted to the membranes, as expected.Fig. 1Myristoylation helps cβARK to associate with membranes.A, autoradiogram of n-cβARK and m-cβARK expressed in reticulocyte lysate.

https://openalex.org/W2017632687,"The BH3-only protein, Bim, exists as three splice variants (BimS, BimL, and BimEL) of differing pro-apoptotic potency. BimEL, the least effective killer, is degraded by the proteasome in response to phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation correlates with the presence of a domain unique to the BimEL splice variant that includes the major ERK1/2 phosphorylation site Ser65. However, efficient phosphorylation by ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 requires the presence in the substrate of a discrete kinase-docking domain as well as the phosphoacceptor site. Here we show that the region unique to BimEL (amino acids 41–97) harbors two potential DEF-type ERK1/2 kinase-docking domains, DEF1 and DEF2. Peptide competition assays revealed that the DEF2 peptide could act autonomously to bind active ERK1/2, whereas the DEF1 peptide did not. Truncation analysis identified a minimal region, residues 80–97, containing the DEF2 motif as sufficient for ERK1/2 binding. Mutation of key residues in the DEF2 motif abolished the interaction of ERK1/2 and BimEL and also abolished ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of BimEL in vivo, thereby stabilizing the protein and enhancing cytotoxicity. Our results identify a new physiologically relevant functional motif in BimEL that may account for the distinct biological properties of this splice variant.

Our results identify a new physiologically relevant functional motif in BimEL that may account for the distinct biological properties of this splice variant. The BH3-only protein Bim is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that links stress-induced signals to the core apoptotic machinery (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev.

Alternative splicing of the Bim gene gives rise to the short, long, and extra-long Bim proteins (BimS, BimL, and BimEL) (7O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), thereby introducing additional levels of regulation that may account for their differences in pro-apoptotic potency. For example, BimS is the most effective killer and is the simplest form, consisting largely of the pro-death BH3 domain and a C-terminal membrane-tethering domain (7O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). BimL contains an additional domain through which it can interact with dynein light chain 1 (DLC1) with the result that in viable cells BimL is sequestered at microtubules and so is a less effective killer (8Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Disruption of microtubules can cause the redistribution of BimL to the mitochondria, and this may be due to JNK-dependent phosphorylation of BimL at sites adjacent to the DLC1-binding site (9Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). BimEL also contains the DLC1-binding site but is the least effective killer, and this may be explained by the fact that BimEL protein stability is subject to post-translational regulation. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway promotes the proteasomal degradation of BimEL (10Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and this correlates with the presence of a unique domain encoded by exon 3 (11Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that includes an ERK1/2 phosphorylation site required for BimEL turnover (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ERK1/2, JNK, and the related stress kinase, p38, all bind to their substrates directly at “docking domains,” which are distinct from the phosphoacceptor site. Although the literature describing these regions has become increasingly complex, it is apparent that ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 can all bind to a common motif termed the D-domain, which contains limited sequence similarity but can be determined by the presence of basic amino acids followed by a LXL motif and/or a hydrophobic region (13Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization studies of p38α and peptides from myocyte enhancer factor 2A have identified binding interactions between the LXL motif and hydrophobic residues in the conserved kinase core (14Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A second docking domain, containing the consensus sequence FXF, has been termed the DEF domain (docking site for ERK, FXFP) (15Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has been found in several substrates including Elk1, SAP-1, and kinase suppressor of Ras (15Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and although initially thought to be specific for ERK1/2, it may allow docking of active p38α to SAP-1 (16Galanis A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to the constitutive binding of JNK to the D-domain in c-Jun, DEF domains can only bind to ERK2 when it is active (17Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Elizabeth J Goldsmith EJ. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the specific phosphorylation of BimEL by ERK1/2 is due to the presence of an ERK1/2 phosphoacceptor site within the domain unique to BimEL that is encoded by exon 3 (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here we have identified a docking domain in BimEL, also encoded by exon 3, that accounts for ERK1/2 binding, ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation, and turnover of BimEL. Materials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. U0126 was purchased from Promega. The following antibodies were used throughout this study. HA was provided by the Babraham Institute Monoclonal Antibody Facility. Phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology/New England Biolabs. Bim was from Chemicon, and JNK was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isoelectric focusing tube gels were purchased from Millipore Investigator Systems. All of the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest grade available unless otherwise stated in the text. Peptides corresponding to the DEF1 (SPLFIFVRR) or DEF2 domains (SGYFSFDTDR) of BimEL were synthesized by Dr. Ram Sharma (Southhampton Polypeptides Ltd.). Cell Culture—The culture of RM3 cells has been described previously (18Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained under identical conditions. For serum starvation, cells judged to be 50–60% confluent were washed once in serum-free medium and then placed in fresh serum-free medium with the indicated dose of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), FBS, inhibitors, or the relevant vehicle control for the times indicated in the figure legends. For emetine chase experiments, cells were starved for 18 h and then treated with emetine (10 μm) for 30 min to block protein synthesis prior to further treatments. Cells were harvested at times indicated for further analysis. Plasmids and Transfections—BimEL and fragments of BimEL were expressed as GST fusion proteins in pGEX-4T1 or as HA-tagged proteins in pCAN-HA (a derivative of pCDNA3 that includes an ATG and in-frame HA tag at the 5′ end of the multiple cloning sites). Amino acid numbering refers to the rat BimEL cDNA sequence that was used in these studies. Potential docking sites were altered by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Promega). Regions of interest were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T1 or pCAN-HA. All of the inserts were verified by ABI automated sequencing. The sequences of all of the oligonucleotides are available upon request. pEGFP-hBimα1 and pEGFP-hBimβ1 plasmids were provided by Dr. Toshiyuki Miyashita (National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan) and subcloned into pCAN-HA. A pGEX plasmid encoding amino acids 310–428 of Elk-1 was kindly provided by Prof. Andrew Sharrocks, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom). HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and left for the time indicated in the figure legends. HA-tagged Bim was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using either mouse anti-HA antibodies conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads or rabbit anti-HA antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting exactly as described previously (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional electrophoresis, the protocol previously described (20Seward R.J. von Haller P.D. Aebersold R. Huber B.T. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used with the exception that tube gels were not pre-focused. After, isoelectric focus samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacterial cells and purified on GSH beads as previously described (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was quantified by Bradford assay and from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels by densitometry. These recombinant proteins were used bound to beads in pull-down experiments. For co-precipitation/pull-down experiments, whole cell lysates were incubated with equivalent amounts of GST fusion protein-bound beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed at least four times with ice-cold lysis buffer followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with relevant antibodies. For peptide competition studies, pull-downs were performed as described above but in the presence of competing peptides as indicated in the figure legends. Assay of Bim-induced Cell Death—HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of empty pCAN-HA, pCAN-HA-BimEL, or pCAN-HA-ΔDEF2 together with 0.1 μg of pCMV-EGFP-spectrin. After 18 h, cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide (4Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and analyzed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of EGFP-positive cells exhibiting sub-G1 DNA was recorded. The Minimal Region Required for ERK-docking Maps within Residues 80–97 of BimEL—We have previously shown that activated ERK1/2 can bind directly to BimEL, but not BimS or BimL, and have mapped this interaction to amino acid residues 70–97 within the region unique to BimEL (Fig. 1) (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This region does not include the major ERK1/2 phosphoacceptor site at Ser65. Within this region, we identified two FXF motifs (FIF at residues 76–78 and FSF at residues 93–95) that could be potential DEF domains. These were labeled DEF1 and DEF2, respectively (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of these potential DEF domains, we used a series of GST-BimEL fusion proteins as bait to “pull down” active ERK1/2 from cell lysates (Fig. 2). In these experiments, we used Rat-1 cells that express the conditional protein kinase ΔMEKK3:ER* (so-called RM3 cells (18Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). When activated by treatment with 4-HT, ΔMEKK3:ER stimulates the ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 pathways. Consequently, lysates prepared from these cells serve as an abundant source of active ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Consistent with our previous study (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a GST fusion protein containing residues 70–97, including both DEF1 and DEF2, was sufficient to pull down ERK1/2 (Fig. 2, lane 1), albeit less effectively than a protein containing residues 41–127 (Fig. 2, lane 5). A smaller GST fusion protein, residues 80–97 (Fig. 2, lane 2), which contained only the DEF2 FXF motif as a potential interacting site, was very effective at pulling down ERK1/2 from cell lysates and notably was more efficient than the larger GST-BimEL70–97 fusion protein. A fragment containing further C-terminal residues (GST-BimEL80–127), including the entire DLC1-binding domain, was slightly less effective at binding ERK1/2 (Fig. 2, lane 3 compared with lane 2). Equal amounts of each fusion protein were used in these pull-down assays, and we cannot dismiss the possibility that differences in ERK1/2 binding might be due to differences in protein folding in bacteria. However, these results clearly show that a region of only 17 amino acids (residues 80–97) of BimEL is very effective at interacting with ERK1/2 in vitro. This fragment contains the DEF2 domain (FSF) but lacks the putative DEF1 domain (FIF) and the ERK1/2 phosphoacceptor site at Ser65. A BimEL DEF2 Domain Peptide Is Sufficient to Compete with BimEL41–127 for ERK1/2 Binding—To further investigate the role of the DEF domains in ERK1/2 binding, we used peptide competition assays. We based this assay on Bardwell et al. (22Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who showed that D-domain peptides (25–100 μm) could inhibit the binding of full-length MEK2 to GST-ERK2. Peptides corresponding to the DEF1 (SPLFIFVRR) or DEF2 domains (SGYFSFDTDR) were tested for their ability to compete with GST-BimEL41–127 for ERK1/2 binding in a pull-down assay and revealed that the DEF2 domain peptide, but not DEF1, was able to compete for ERK1/2 binding (Fig. 3A). It did not prove possible to examine the effect of both peptides in combination in this assay, because this repeatedly caused a nonspecific aggregation and precipitation of proteins from the cell lysate. 2R. Ley and S. Cook, unpublished observations. The DEF2 peptide caused a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of ERK2 precipitated by GST-BimEL41–127 (Fig. 3B). The inhibition of ERK binding to 2 μm GST-BimEL was apparent at 20 μm DEF2 peptide and was complete at 100 μm, indicating that a 10–50-fold excess of peptide was sufficient to inhibit ERK binding. Because the DEF2 peptide could bind to ERK1/2, we reasoned that it should also inhibit the binding of ERK1/2 to other substrates. To test this possibility, we compared the effect of the Bim DEF2 peptide on binding of ERK1/2 to the E-twenty six-specific (Ets) domain transcription factor Elk-1 (15Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 16Galanis A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the Bim DEF2 peptide in a pull-down assay again inhibited the binding of ERK1/2 to GST-BimEL41–127 and also inhibited the binding of ERK1/2 to GST-Elk-1310–428 (Fig. 3C). The DEF2 peptide inhibited the BimEL-ERK interaction, but it failed to block the interaction between JNK and c-Jun (Fig. 3D). Because the JNK-c-Jun interaction is mediated by the D-domain of c-Jun, rather than a DEF domain, this confirms the specificity of the DEF2 peptide as a minimal ERK-binding motif. Taken together, these results confirm that the DEF2 peptide is sufficient for ERK1/2-specific binding. Mutation of the DEF Domain Blocks ERK1/2 Binding to Residues 80–127 of BimEL in Vitro—The phenylalanine residues in DEF domains at position 1 and 3 are important determinants for ERK binding (15Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Consequently, we mutated these two phenylalanine residues to alanine in the GST-BimEL80–127 fusion protein (80–127 ΔDEF2) and compared this with the wild type fusion protein (residues 80–127) in pull-down experiments using lysates from RM3 cells treated with 4-HT. Compared with the wild type fusion protein, interaction with ERK1/2 was completely blocked by mutation of the two phenylalanine residues in the putative DEF2 motif (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4). Taken together with the preceding results, this observation suggests that the DEF2 FXF sequence at residues 93–97 in BimEL is indeed a DEF motif that, at least in the context of GST-BimEL80–127L, is absolutely required for direct binding to ERK1/2 in vitro. Mutation of the DEF Domain (FSF to ASA) Prevents Phosphorylation by ERK1/2 in Vivo—To test the role of the DEF2 domain in BimEL phosphorylation in vivo, we introduced the mutation disrupting the DEF2 domain (ΔDEF2) into a construct that allowed expression of the full-length HA-tagged protein in mammalian cells. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with DNA expressing wild type BimEL, BimELS65A, or BimELΔDEF2. BimELS65A was included as a positive control since we have previously shown that this mutation causes the loss of at least two ERK-dependent phosphorylation sites in vivo (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The following day, cells were stimulated with 10% FBS in the absence or presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. As seen previously (10Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), FBS stimulation caused the characteristic gel retardation of wild type BimEL that was inhibited by U0126, whereas BimELS65A failed to undergo gel retardation and its mobility on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels was not affected by U0126 (Fig. 4A). The BimELΔDEF2 protein migrated slightly more slowly on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels compared with the wild type protein, probably reflecting a change in its electrophoretic properties due to the two Phe→Ala mutations. However, treatment with U0126 had little if any effect on the migration of the BimELΔDEF2 protein (Fig. 4A), indicating that the loss of the DEF2 domain prevented MEK1/2-dependent (i.e. ERK-dependent) phosphorylation of BimEL in vivo. These results were confirmed by parallel two-dimensional electrophoresis. Upon serum stimulation, HA-BimEL resolves as a basic, non-phosphorylated spot and up to four additional acidic spots representing phosphorylated forms of the protein (Fig. 4B) (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Seward R.J. von Haller P.D. Aebersold R. Huber B.T. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser65, the major site of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro, causes the disappearance of the two most acidic spots (spots 3 and 4), indicating that they contain ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation sites in vivo (Fig. 4B) (12Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When we transiently expressed the BimELΔDEF2 protein in parallel, we also saw a reduction in the number of phosphoprotein spots to just spot 1 and spot 2 on two-dimensional gels (Fig. 4B). Thus, the mutation of the DEF2 domain alone is sufficient to block ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo. A trivial explanation for this observation was that the DEF2 mutation disrupted protein structure at the phosphoacceptor site and so prevented phosphorylation nonspecifically. However, the GST-BimEL41–127 ΔDEF2 fusion protein was phosphorylated as efficiently as wild type GST-BimEL41–127 when added to an in vitro ERK1/2 kinase reaction (Fig. 4C). In such assays, the components are present in excess so that phosphorylation requires intact phosphoacceptor sites but not the presence of a docking domain. Consequently, the DEF2 mutation did not disrupt the integrity of the phosphoacceptor sites. Thus, the simplest conclusion from these results is that the DEF2 motif is an important determinant allowing ERK1/2 to bind to and phosphorylate BimEL in vivo. Mutation of the DEF Domain Blocks Serum-stimulated BimEL Turnover and Enhances Cell Death—ERK1/2 phosphorylates BimEL in vitro at Ser65, which is also an ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation site in vivo (12Ley R.

Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and mutation of Ser65 to a non-phosphorylatable alanine prevents the turnover of BimEL (12Ley R.

Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We postulated that mutation of the DEF2-docking domain of BimEL should also reduce BimEL turnover by preventing ERK-dependent phosphorylation. To test this possibility, we expressed wild type HA-BimEL, HA-BimELS65A, or HA-BimELΔDEF2 in HEK293 cells in serum-free conditions. After 18 h, cells were stimulated with 10% FBS for 7 h (to activate ERK1/2) in the presence of emetine (to inhibit new protein synthesis) and expression of the HA-tagged Bim proteins was analyzed by Western blot. Data from a single representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5A and is quantified in Fig. 5B. These results revealed both HA-BimELS65A and HA-BimELΔDEF2 were expressed at a higher level than wild type BimEL in the basal state and that serum stimulation caused a 76% reduction in the amount of wild type HA-BimEL, whereas both HA-BimELS65A and HA-BimELΔDEF2 were less sensitive to serum-stimulated turnover. The simplest explanation for this result is that the loss of the phosphoacceptor site (S65A) or the ERK1/2-docking site (ΔDEF2) prevents ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation and turnover of BimEL in vivo. Since the loss of DEF2 prevented turnover of BimEL, we postulated that the DEF2 mutant would elicit greater cell death than wild type BimEL. Indeed, when we transfected these constructs into HEK293 cells, we again found that BimELΔDEF2 was expressed at higher levels than wild type BimEL and caused significantly greater cell death (Fig. 5C), confirming the physiological relevance of the DEF2 site. The Novel Splice Variants Bimα1 and Bimβ1 Possess the DEF2 Domain and Are Phosphorylated in an ERK1/2-dependent Fashion in Vivo—The ERK1/2 phosphoacceptor site and the DEF2 domain are both encoded by exon 3 (11Bouillet P.

To investigate whether exon 3 was sufficient to confer phosphorylation by ERK1/2, we examined additional Bim splice variants. Recent studies have reported the identification of at least six additional splice variants of Bim (25U., M. Miyashita T. Shikama Y. Tadokoro K. Yamada M.

Based on our analysis, we postulated that these splice variants would be subject to ERK-dependent phosphorylation in vivo because they contained the phosphoacceptor site (11Bouillet P. Zhang L.C.

Deficiency or dysfunction of factor VIII causes hemophilia A, a bleeding disorder. Administration of exogenous recombinant factor VIII as a replacement leads to development of inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII in 15–30% of hemophilia A patients. Hence, less immunogenic preparations of factor VIII are highly desirable. Inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII are mainly directed against immunodominant epitopes in C2, A3, and A2 domains. Further, several universal epitopes for CD4+ T-cells have been identified within the C2 domain. The C2 domain is also known to interact specifically with phosphatidylserine-rich lipid vesicles. Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that complexation of O-phospho-l-serine, the head group of phosphatidylserine, with the C2 domain can reduce the overall immunogenicity of factor VIII. The biophysical (circular dichroism and fluorescence) and biochemical studies (ELISA and size exclusion chromatography) showed that O-phospho-l-serine binds to the phospholipid-binding region in the C2 domain, and this interaction causes subtle changes in the tertiary structure of the protein. O-Phospho-l-serine also prevented aggregation of the protein under thermal stress. The immunogenicity of the factor VIII-O-phospho-l-serine complex was evaluated in hemophilia A mice. The total and inhibitory antibody titers were lower for factor VIII-O-phospho-l-serine complex compared with factor VIII alone. Moreover, factor VIII administered as a complex with O-phospho-l-serine retained in vivo activity in hemophilia A mice.

Factor VIII (FVIII) is a multidomain protein that functions as a cofactor in the coagulation cascade. FVIII is composed of six domains, NH2-A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2-COOH. It is synthesized as a 2351-residue single chain precursor protein, which is subsequently cleaved at residue 1680 to form the heavy chain (A1-A2-B) and the light chain (A3-C1-C2) (1Toole J.J.

The heavy chain undergoes further processing and is cleaved at several sites between the A2 and B domains, generating polypeptides with molecular masses ranging from 90 to 180 kDa (2Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Transfus. Med. Rev. 1997; 11: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The administration of exogenous FVIII, however, leads to the development of inhibitory antibodies in 15–30% of hemophilia A patients, complicating the replacement therapy (6Jacquemin M.G.

However, rFVIII preparations that prevent the formation of inhibitors present alternate clinical approaches. The epitope regions and the mechanisms by which FVIII antibodies inhibit clotting activity are well understood. Most immunodominant epitopes of rFVIII are located in the C2, A3, and A2 domains of FVIII (7Lollar P. Healey J.F. Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Adv. Exp. Med.

The immunoprecipitation and inhibitor neutralization assays of the inhibitor plasma from hemophilia A patients clearly indicated that the anti-light chain antibody titer was the highest (12Scandella D.H.

Three-dimensional models proposed based on crystallographic studies and mutational analysis show that the C2 domain also contains 2–4 hydrophobic loops and other charged residues that promote lipid binding (Fig. 1) (15Pratt K.P.

Blood. 2002; 99: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Further, the C2 domain has structural features characteristic of universal immunodominant CD4+ epitopes (shown as sticks in Fig. 1) (18Raju R. Navaneetham D. Okita D. Diethelm-Okita B. McCormick D. Conti-Fine B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the blood coagulation cascade, FVIII binds to the membrane surface of activated platelets via specific interaction between phosphatidylserine and the C2 domain (19Kemball-Cook G. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thromb. Res. 1992; 67: 57-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert G.E. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction is mediated by O-phospho-l-serine (OPLS) the head group of phosphatidylserine (21Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9577-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since OPLS is known to interact with C2 domain that contains immunodominant epitopes, it would be of significance to know the effect of OPLS on the immunogenicity of rFVIII. Here we have investigated the effects of OPLS on the conformation, folding, and stability of rFVIII using physical and biochemical methods. We have also evaluated the impact of OPLS on the activity and immunogenicity of rFVIII in vivo in FVIII knock-out (hemophilia A) mice. The results suggest that binding of OPLS to immunodominant epitopes of rFVIII results in improved stability and reduction in immunogenicity of rFVIII in hemophilia A mice. We used recombinant human factor VIII (Baxter, Glendale, CA) for in vivo experiments. Monoclonal antibodies ESH4 and ESH8 were obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Normal coagulation control plasma and FVIII deficient plasma for the activity assays were purchased from Trinity Biotech (County Wicklow, Ireland). Platelin L reagent used in activated partial thromboplastin time and Bethesda assays was purchased (BioMerieux, Durham, NC). The activated partial thromboplastin time and Bethesda assays were performed using a COAG-A-MATE coagulation analyzer (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). Diethanolamine, OPLS, phosphocholine calcium salt (PC), and glycerol-1-phosphate (PA) were obtained from Sigma. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was purchased from Pierce. All buffer salts were purchased from Fisher and used without further purification. The l-form of O-phosphoserine (OPLS) was selected for our studies, since this form has been shown to interact with rFVIII to a greater extent than the d-form (21Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9577-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The rFVIII·OPLS complex was prepared by diluting rFVIII stock solution in buffer composed of 5, 10, or 20 mm OPLS, 25 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, and 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. rFVIII complexes with PA or PC were prepared as described for rFVIII·OPLS complex by diluting with Tris buffer containing 10 mm PA or PC. For immunogenicity studies, all solutions were prepared using pyrogen-free water and were sterile filtered prior to use. Complexation of rFVIII with OPLS can also be accomplished during purification of rFVIII. Briefly, rFVIII was expressed transiently by transfecting COS-7 cells with the plasmid containing the cDNA of human FVIII. The transfected cells were cultured in serum free media. The medium was subjected to a two-step ion exchange chromatography (22Doering C. Parker E.T. Healey J.F. Craddock H.N. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The factor VIII-containing medium was loaded on a HiPrep 16/10 SP FF column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a linear gradient from 100–650 mm NaCl in HEPES-CaCl2 buffer containing 10 mm OPLS. Fractions containing rFVIII were loaded on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 200 mm to 1 m NaCl linear gradient in the HEPES-CaCl2 buffer. The purity of the isolated protein was assessed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Biosep SEC-S-4000 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) (details to be published elsewhere). It was also found that inclusion of OPLS in the elution buffer enhanced the recovery of rFVIII. rFVIII was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (0.017 μm) in Tris buffer (Tris (25 mm), sodium chloride (300 mm), and calcium chloride (5 mm), pH 7). OPLS was dissolved in Tris buffer, and pH was adjusted to 7.0. Stock solution of OPLS at 1 mm concentration was prepared in Tris buffer containing 5 μg/ml rFVIII. Required volumes (as calculated by the alligation method) of the above solution were mixed with a 5 μg/ml solution of rFVIII in Tris buffer to obtain various concentrations of OPLS. Following each addition, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before the fluorescence intensity was measured. Changes in tertiary structure of the protein in the presence of various concentrations of OPLS were monitored using a PTI-Quantamaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Excitation wavelength was set at 285 nm, and emission was monitored at 335 nm (23Purohit V.S. Ramani K. Kashi R.S. Durrani M.J. Kreiger T.J. Balasubramanian S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1617: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An I-shaped cuvette was used to minimize any inner filter effect (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity (F) at 335 nm in the presence of a given concentration of OPLS was normalized to the fluorescence intensity of rFVIII (Fo), to obtain the F/Fo ratio. The F/Fo is related to rFVIII and lipid concentrations by the following set of equations, FFo=1−(Fmax∗PLPT)(Eq. 1) PL=nPT∗[L]KD+[L](Eq. 2) where P represents protein, L is OPLS, PL is protein-OPLS complex, [L] is free OPLS concentration, PT is total protein concentration, n is stoichiometry, and Fmax is maximal change in F/Fo. The data were plotted as F/Fo versus OPLS concentration (μm) and fitted using WinNonlin (Pharsight, Mountainview, CA) with the following expression derived from the above equations to obtain estimates for KD. FFo=1−FmaxPT∗2∗[[KD+PT+LT]−[KD+PT+LT]2−4∗PT∗LT](Eq. 3) The above equation assumes a stoichiometry (n) of 1 and a single binding site. Binding of OPLS to the phospholipid-binding region of rFVIII was confirmed by evaluating the ability of OPLS to compete with ESH4, an antibody against the phospholipid-binding region of the C2 domain (25Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in a sandwich ELISA. Nunc-Maxisorb 96-well plates were coated with ESH4 antibody by incubating 50 μl/well solution of the antibody at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in carbonate buffer (0.2 m, pH 9.4) overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then washed with phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBT consisting of 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.14 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.02% NaN3). The remaining nonspecific protein binding sites on the plastic's adsorptive surface were blocked by incubating 200 μl of blocking buffer consisting of 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer (consisting of 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.14 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl) for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBT, and 50 μl of 100 ng/ml rFVIII in the presence or absence of OPLS in blocking buffer was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBT and incubated with 50 μl of biotinylated ESH8 at a 1 μg/ml concentration and 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, both in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBT and 100 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution in diethanolamine buffer (consisting of 1 m diethanolamine and 0.5 mm MgCl2). The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by adding 100 μl of 3 n NaOH. Optical density at 405 nm was monitored using a plate reader. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was used to monitor the unfolding of rFVIII upon thermal stress. CD spectra were acquired on a JASCO-715 spectropolarimeter calibrated with d-10-camphor sulfonic acid. Thermal denaturation was performed in the presence and in the absence of 5 mm OPLS at a controlled heating rate of 60 °C/h from 20 to 80 °C. Protein concentrations typically used were 25 μg/100 μl in Tris buffer. Ellipticity was monitored at 215 nm, and the spectrum was obtained from 250 to 208 nm in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette. The shorter path length cuvette was used to minimize the contribution of OPLS on rFVIII signal. Further the CD spectrum of rFVIII was corrected by subtracting the base-line spectrum of 5 mm OPLS buffer. Higher concentrations of OPLS were not investigated as it contributed significantly to the buffer base line. It is appropriate to mention here that thermal denaturation studies were carried out in Tris buffer because of its low metal ion binding capacity (26Derrick T.S. Kashi R.S. Durrani M. Jhingan A. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2004; 93: 2549-2557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, Tris buffer has a high temperature coefficient, which causes pH changes at elevated temperatures. Hence the observed changes at elevated temperatures could be due to combination of temperature and pH changes. Steady State Fluorescence Anisotropy Studies—Changes in the steady-state emission anisotropy (r) of rFVIII upon thermal denaturation in the presence and in the absence of OPLS were measured by a PTI-Quantamaster fluorescence spectrophotometer, equipped with a Peltier unit and motorized Glan-Thompson polarizing prisms. The concentration of the protein used was typically 5 μg/ml, and a variable path length cuvette was used to minimize the inner filter effect. The G-factor was determined at 20 °C and was applied to data collected at higher temperatures. Thermal denaturation was conducted at a heating rate of 60 °C/h. Studies were carried out over the temperature range of 20–80 °C with a holding time of 1–2 min every 5 °C. Samples were excited at 280 nm, and the emission was monitored at 335 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were set at 4 nm. Anisotropy was calculated using the following equation (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar), r=III−G∗I⊥III+2∗G∗I⊥(Eq. 4) where I∥ represents emission intensity with the emission polarizer oriented parallel to the excitation polarizer, I∥ is emission intensity with the emission polarizer oriented perpendicular to the excitation polarizer, and G is instrument-specific G-factor (G = I∥/I⊥). Data were represented as percentage change in anisotropy (r) as a function of temperature. The percentage change in anisotropy (r) was computed as follows, % change in r=riro∗100(Eq. 5) where ro represents the anisotropy of the protein at 20 °C, and rt is the anisotropy at a given temperature. Size Exclusion Chromatography—SEC was performed to confirm the onset of aggregation observed in the CD experiments. SEC was performed using a Biosep-SEC4000S 300 × 4.6-mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) column with an exclusion limit of 2,000,000 daltons. The column was calibrated using a standard protein mixture of known molecular weight from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). The chromatograph consisted of a Waters 510 isocratic pump (Waters, Milford, MA), equipped with a Shimadzu (Shimadzu, Braintree, MA) autoinjector, a column oven, fluorescence detector, and an integrator. Tris buffer was used as the mobile phase, and eluent was monitored at an excitation of 285 nm and emission of 335 nm. Typical sample injection volumes were 50 μl. SEC profiles of rFVIII (20 μg/ml) in the presence and in the absence of OPLS (5 mm) at different temperatures of thermal denaturation were obtained by heating the protein at controlled heating rates of 60 °C/h. Samples were withdrawn at 25, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75 °C and stored at 4 °C prior to injection onto the column. A colony of hemophilia A mice (C57BL/6J with a target deletion in exon 16 of the FVIII gene) was established with breeding pairs from the original colony (27Bi L. Lawler A.M. Antonarakis S.E. High K.A. Gearhart J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of adult male and female mice, aged 8–12 weeks, were used for the studies. The sex of the animal has no impact on the immune response (28Qian J. Borovok M. Bi L. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hoyer L.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The in vivo activity of rFVIII·OPLS complex was confirmed by the tail clip method in the hemophilia A mice (29Sarkar R. Xiao W. Kazazian Jr., H.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Groups of animals (n = 3) were administered subcutaneously either with Tris buffer or with rFVIII alone or rFVIII·OPLS complex (10 mm). The dose of rFVIII used was ∼2 μg of protein (9.85 IU) per animal. The tip (1 cm) of the tail of each animal was cut off with a sharp scalpel about 2 h after administration. The animals were then monitored for the next 18 h and the survival was noted at the end of the period. Immunization and Sampling—Immunization of hemophilia A mice consisted of two intravenous injections that were 2 weeks apart or four subcutaneous injections 1 week apart of rFVIII or rFVIII·OPLS complex (2 μg in 100 μl of Tris buffer). The subcutaneous route of administration was investigated mainly to amplify the immune response. Further, Reipert et al. (30Reipert B.M. Ahmad R.U. Turecek P.L. Schwarz H.P. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported that the IgG subtype levels were identical after subcutaneous and intravenous administration in hemophilia A mice, suggesting an identical mechanism of immune response for subcutaneous and intravenous routes. Blood samples were obtained in acid citrate dextrose buffer at various time points up to 6 weeks by cardiac puncture. Immunogenicity of rFVIII with PA or PC was also evaluated after subcutaneous administration. All studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University at Buffalo. Measurement of Total and Inhibitory Anti-rFVIII Antibody Titers— Antibody titers were determined by standard antibody capture ELISA (31Crowther J.R. Methods in Molecular Biology. 149. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Briefly, Nunc-Maxisorb 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl/well of 5 μg/ml rFVIII and subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). 50 μl/well of various dilutions of the sample and standard concentrations (12.5–150 μg/ml) of ESH8 antibody in blocking buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed and incubated with 50 μl of goat anti-mouse Ig (IgG + IgM + H + L)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Color was developed for 30 min with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution in diethanolamine buffer (consisting of 1 m diethanolamine and 0.5 mm MgCl2). Reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 3 n NaOH. Optical density at 405 nm was monitored using a plate reader. The plate-specific parameter (PSP) was used to normalize the plate to plate variability. The PSP for each plate was obtained as follows. A linear standard curve of known ESH8 antibody concentrations was obtained for each plate and used to calculate the maximum and minimum predicted absorbance. Half of the difference between the maximum and minimum predicted absorbance was calculated as the PSP. A linear regression of the plot of absorbance of various dilutions (1:100 to 1:40,000) versus log of dilution was used to calculate the dilution that gave an optical density equal to the PSP. The dilution so obtained was the antibody titer for the sample. Inhibitory antibody titers were determined using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay as described previously (32Verbruggen B. Novakova I. Wessels H. Boezeman J. van den Berg M. Mauser-Bunschoten E. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of various dilutions of mouse plasma diluted in human FVIII-deficient plasma were mixed with an equal volume of normal human plasma and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Residual activity at the end of the incubation was determined using an activated partial thromboplastin time assay. A linear regression of the plot of residual activity of various dilutions (1:2 to 1:32,000) versus log of dilution was performed to calculate the dilution with 50% reduction in activity and was expressed in Bethesda units. Statistical analysis was conducted using Minitab Statistical Software, Minitab Release 14 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA). Effect of OPLS and Phosphatidylserine Analogs on the Tertiary Structure of rFVIII—In order to determine the effect of OPLS on the tertiary structure of the protein, the steady state fluorescence spectrum of the protein was monitored in the presence of various concentrations of OPLS. A concentration-dependent decrease in F/Fo of rFVIII at 335 nm was observed in the presence of OPLS (Fig. 2a) without any change in emission λmax. Similar spectral changes have been interpreted as conformational fluctuations for factor Va upon interaction with short chain phospholipids (33Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The data were fit using Equation 3 (described under “Experimental Procedures”) to estimate the binding parameters. A high apparent KD value (5.71 μm) indicates that OPLS interaction with rFVIII is weak. Phosphatidylserine analogues with a hydrophobic acyl chain such as dihexyl phosphatidylserine showed a lower apparent KD value (3.31 μm), and the observed higher affinity is probably due to both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (data not shown). It is appropriate to mention that the apparent KD is a phenomenological parameter and may not represent the actual binding affinity of OPLS to rFVIII. Sandwich ELISA: Interaction of OPLS with rFVIII—Sandwich ELISA studies were carried out to determine whether OPLS binds to the lipid-binding region (2303–2332) of the C2 domain. The monoclonal antibody, ESH4, that binds to the lipid-binding region was used as a stationary antibody, whereas biotinylated ESH8 that recognizes a nonoverlapping region in the C2 domain was used as probe antibody. If OPLS binds to the lipid-binding region of the protein, it would compete with ESH4, leading to a reduction in rFVIII binding to ESH4 (Fig. 2b). As can be seen from the figure, the binding of rFVIII to ESH4 antibody reduces with increasing concentrations of OPLS, suggesting that the binding site of OPLS and ESH4 overlap. In order to evaluate the possible interference from OPLS (a charged molecule) on the amounts of ESH4 coated on the plates, a control experiment was conducted where OPLS alone was incubated with ESH4-coated wells prior to the addition of rFVIII. As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 2b, the optical densities were unaltered and are independent of the concentration of OPLS. The result indicates that the reduction of rFVIII binding to ESH4 observed with OPLS is mainly due to competition between ESH4 and OPLS for binding to rFVIII. Effect of OPLS on Thermal Denaturation of rFVIII—Thermal stress has been used to evaluate the folding and stability relationship of several proteins (34Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L. Schell D.

This study revealed that the effect of estrogen was markedly disrupted by estrogen-independent expression of PR. Transfection of PR in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells abolished the estradiol-17β growth stimulatory effect that was observed in the parental cells and the vector-transfected controls in a ligand-independent manner. The antiestrogenic effect was also observed at the level of gene transcription. Estradiol-17β (E2)-induced gene expression of pS2 and GREB1 was impaired by 50–75% after 24–72 h of E2 treatment in PR-transfected cells. Promoter interference assay revealed that PR transfection drastically inhibited E2-mediated ER binding to estrogen response elements (ERE). The antiestrogenic effects of transfected PR are associated with enhanced metabolism of E2. HPLC analysis of [3H]E2 in the samples indicated that the percentage of [3H]E2 metabolized by PR-transfected cells in 6 h is similar to that by vector-transfected control cells in 24 h (77 and 80%, respectively). The increased metabolism of E2 may, in turn, be caused by increased cellular uptake of E2, as demonstrated by whole cell binding of [3H]E2. The findings open up a new window for a hitherto unknown functional relationship between the PR and ER. The antiestrogenic effect of transfected PR also provides a potential therapeutic strategy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer.

The findings open up a new window for a hitherto unknown functional relationship between the PR and ER. The antiestrogenic effect of transfected PR also provides a potential therapeutic strategy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Ovarian steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone are essential for the normal growth and development of the breast. The two hormones also play critical roles in the regulation of breast cancer development. It has been established that estrogen stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (1McGuire W. Carbone P. Vollmer R. Estrogen in Human Breast Cancer. Raven Press, New York1975Google Scholar, 2Jensen E.V. Cheng G. Palmieri C. Saji S. Makela S. Van Noorden S. Wahlstrom T. Warner M. Coombes R.C. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antiestrogens have been the front-line therapy for hormone-dependent breast cancers (4MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar), which are estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; E2, estradiol-17β; PR, progesterone receptor; PR-A, PR isoform A; PR-B, PR isoform B; eiPR, estrogen-independent PR; RT, reverse transcription; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ab, antibody. - and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive. Nonetheless, antiestrogen-induced remissions are often followed by acquisition of antiestrogen resistance and ultimately disease relapse (5Clarke R. Liu M.C. Bouker K.B. Gu Z. Lee R.Y. Zhu Y. Skaar T.C. Gomez B. O'Brien K. Wang Y. Hilakivi-Clarke L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7316-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The acquired resistance is mostly manifested by insensitivity to antiestrogens such as tamoxifen and increased ER activity (6Berstein L.M. Zheng H. Yue W. Wang J.P. Lykkesfeldt A.E. Naftolin F. Harada H. Shanabrough M. Santen R.J. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2003; 10: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been shown that signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu can activate both ER and the important ER coactivator AIB1 (7Osborne C.K. Schiff R. Breast. 2003; 12: 362-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Breast tumors with high levels of AIB1 and HER-2 may be resistant to tamoxifen because of an increase in its estrogen agonist activity. The development of strategies for the effective treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer is one of the main challenges for breast cancer research. Whereas it is established that estrogen stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells, the function of progesterone in breast cancer remains controversial. Progestins were found to stimulate growth, have no effect, or inhibit growth depending on the experimental conditions and the status of hormone receptors (8Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Pang G.Y.N. Musgrove E.A. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 48: 5084-5091Google Scholar, 9Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

Tan M.G. Ng E.H. Chan V.S. Ho G.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar). This controversy reflects our insufficient understanding of progesterone biology and has hampered effective applications of progestins or antiprogestins in breast cancer treatment. The controversies over the effect of progesterone in breast cancer are due to several complexities in the PR system. One of the complexities is that PR is an estrogen receptor-dependent gene product (12Druege P.M. Klein H.L. Green S. Stack G. Chambon P. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9329-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Graham J.D. Roman S.D. MaGowan E. Sutherland R.L. Clarke C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30693-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the action of progesterone requires priming treatment of estrogen to induce PR. It is conceivable that the prior presence of estrogen may significantly confound assessment of the role of progesterone on growth and other cellular processes in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the effects of progesterone also depend on a complex interaction between estrogen, progesterone, and their receptors. Studies have demonstrated the suppression of estrogen-stimulated ER activity by agonist- and antagonist-occupied PR (14Kraus W.L. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 1: S33-S37Crossref Google Scholar). However, ER can transmit signals received from the agonist-activated PR to the Src/p21 (ras)/Erk pathway (16Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), suggesting a synergistic interaction between the ER and PR. Our previous work has shown that estrogen-independent expression of PR by transfection in the ER- and PR-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, facilitated a striking inhibition of cell growth by progesterone in vivo and in vitro (11Lin V.C. Ng E.H. Aw S.E. Tan M.G. Ng E.H. Chan V.S. Ho G.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lin V.C. Eng A.S. Hen N.E. Ng E.H. Chowdhury S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2880-2886PubMed Google Scholar). Progesterone also induced remarkable focal adhesions in the PR-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (18Lin V.C. Ng E.H. Aw S.E. Tan M.G. Ng E.H. Bay B.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). This present study reveals that estrogen-independent expression of PR in MCF-7 cells exhibited strong antiestrogenic and antiproliferative effect that is independent of PR ligands. The antiestrogenic effect is associated with a marked decrease of estradiol-17β (E2) in the culture medium of PR-transfected cells. This suggests that the transfected PR exerted the antiestrogenic effect by modulating cellular uptake and metabolism of E2. The study provides the basis for a novel antiestrogenic mechanism that may be used for breast cancer treatment. Chemicals—All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Propidium iodide (PI), progesterone, 17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, 6α-hydroxyestradiol, and 16α-hydroxyestrone were purchased from Sigma. Trichloroacetic acid was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Nonidet P-40 was purchased from USB Corp. (Cleveland, OH). [2,4,6,7,16,17-3H]Estradiol-17β (∼149 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection in 1995 at passage 147. Cells were routinely maintained in phenol red-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, and 40 mg/liter gentamicin. For all experiments involving cell culture, phenol red-free medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-fetal calf serum (DCC-FCS), and 2 mm glutamine was used, and this medium will be referred as Test Medium in the subsequent description. Transfection—PR expression vectors hPR1 and hPR2 contain human PR cDNA coding for PR isoform B and A, respectively, in pSG5 plasmid (18Lin V.C. Ng E.H. Aw S.E. Tan M.G. Ng E.H. Bay B.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene) containing the neomycin-resistant gene was cotransfected with hPR1 and hPR2 into MCF-7 cells using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Neomycin-resistant clones selected in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) were further screened for vector pSG5 sequence by PCR using primers specific for pSG5. Cells stably transfected with both pBK-CMV and pSG5 (Stratagene) plasmids were used as transfection controls. Western Blotting Analysis—Total proteins were extracted from the cells by three cycles of freezing (liquid nitrogen) and thawing (37 °C water bath) in buffer containing 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 2% β-mercapthoethanol. Lysates containing 50 μg of protein were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Human PR isoforms A and B were probed with anti-PR antibody Ab-8 from Neomarker (Fremont, CA); human ERα was probed with anti-ER antibody Ab-15 from Neo-marker; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probed by anti-GAPDH antibody (Ambion) was used as loading control. Cell Growth Assay—1 × 104 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates in Test Medium. Two days later, the cells were treated with 10–9m E2 in fresh medium from 1000-fold stock in ethanol, which gave a final concentration of ethanol of 0.1%. Treatment controls received 0.1% ethanol only. The medium with the test compounds was changed every 2 days, and cells were counted with a hemocytometer. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells plated onto 6-well plates were grown in Test Medium for 48 h before they were treated with E2 or progesterone for the indicated periods of time. Trypsinized cells were stained with PI in Vindelov's mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 50 mg PI/liter, 10 mg/liter RNaseA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h in the dark. The stained cells were analyzed in FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with excitation wavelength of 488 nm. The resulting histograms were analyzed by program MODFIT for cell cycle distribution. Real Time RT-PCR—cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA. Real time PCR was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers for pS2 are 5′-ATGGCCACCATGGAGAACAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAAAATTCACACTCCTCTTCTGG-3′ (reverse). The primers for GREB1 are 5′-CCCCGTGGCCCCGCAGAG-3′ (forward) 5′-AGGATGAGCCCGAGGAGGAGGACA-3′ (reverse). 36B4 (forward: 5′-GATTGGCTACCCAACTGTTGCA-3′ and reverse: 5′-CAGGGGCAGCAGCCACAAAGGC-3′), which codes for human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein, was used as internal control for normalizing the quantity of cDNA analyzed. PCR for each gene fragment were performed in triplicates, and each experiment was repeated twice. The relative amount of PCR products generated from each primer set was determined on the basis of threshold cycle (Ct). Promoter Interference Assay—Cells were grown in Test Medium for 48 h before they were transfected with 2 μg of CMV-TATA-ERE2-CAT (cytomegalovirus-estrogen response element-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) or 2 μg of control vector CMV-TATA-CAT. 16 h later, cells were given fresh medium and treated with 10–9m E2 or 0.1% ethanol as control. Cells were harvested at 16, 24, and 48 h after E2 treatment. CAT activity was measured using the CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Cellular Uptake of [3H]E2—Cells (1 × 105) were grown on 12-well plates in Test Medium for 48 h before they were incubated with 10–9m [3H]E2 in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. Nonspecific uptake was determined by incubating 10–9m [3H]E2 in the presence of 200-fold excess of unlabeled E2. Following incubation, the cells were washed with cold Mg2+- and Ca2+-free DBPS three times, and cellular [3H]E2 was extracted with 500 μl of absolute ethanol and measured by a Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of Estradiol Metabolism by HPLC—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 48 h before they were treated with 10–9m [3H]E2. The conditioned media were harvested following 3, 6, and 24 h treatment. Cell-free media incubated with 10–9m [3H]E2 were used as controls for each time point. The proteins in the media were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by washing with acetone twice. The pH of the deproteinated medium was adjusted to ∼5.0 with 10 n NaOH. HPLC was performed on a Supercosil LC-18-DB column (5 μm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm, Supelco Bellefonte, PA) at room temperature. The mobile phase A contains 21% acetonitrile, 22% methanol, 57% water, 0.1% acetic acid; B contains 40% acetonitrile, 60% water, 0.33% acetic acid. The gradient was as follows: 0–15 min, 100% solvent A; 15–25 min, a linear increase to 19% solvent B; 25–30 min, a linear increase to 20% solvent B; 30–53 min, a linear increase to 100% solvent B; 53–60 min, 100% solvent B. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. 0.5 min flow fractions were collected and the radioactivity was measured on a Microbeta liquid scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—Differences among treatment groups with regard to cell proliferation and growth were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test. Differences of gene expression, reporter gene activity, and E2 concentration between control and E2-treated cells were tested by Student's t test. Characterization of PR Transfectants—Fig. 1 shows the levels of PR and ER proteins in the parental cells MCF-7, the vector-transfected control cells MCF-7-C8 and in PR-transfected cells MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26. MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 cells express ∼3–5 times more PR than MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8 cells in the absence of E2. MCF-7-PR8 cells express ∼three times as much PR-B as PR-A, whereas MCF-7-PR26 express twice as much PR-A as PR-B. Despite the expression of estrogen-independent PR (eiPR), E2 was able to induce endogenous PR in PR-transfected cells. Fig. 1 also revealed that the ER protein was reduced by 20% following E2 treatment in all the cell lines. On the other hand, PR transfection did not affect the levels of ER in the presence or absence of E2. PR-transfected MCF-7 cell clones MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 were studied for their responses to progesterone and estrogen. The MCF-7 parental cells and the vector-transfected MCF-7 clones 8 (MCF-7-C8) served as control cells. E2 Inhibited Cell Cycle Progression in PR-transfected MCF-7 Cells after 72 h of Treatment—The experiment depicted in Fig. 2 was designed to determine the effect of progesterone on cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells transfected with PR. The cells had been treated with either 0.05% ethanol or 10–9m E2 for 24 h before they were treated with various concentrations (0, 10–12m, 10–9m, and 10–6m) of progesterone for 48 h. The duration of E2 treatment is thus 72 h. The estradiol treatment was to induce PR so that the effect of progesterone can be compared between PR-transfected cells and the control cells. The results revealed that increase of PR protein by transfection in MCF-7 cells did not affect the action of progesterone on cell proliferation. Whereas having no affect at lower concentrations, progesterone at 10–6m elicited about an 8–10% increase of the S-phase fraction in both PR-transfected cells (MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 cells) and control cells (MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). However, the affect of E2 on PR-transfected MCF-7 cells is the opposite of that on control cells. In accordance with the known effect, E2 increased the S-phase fraction of MCF-7 and vector-transfected control MCF-7-C8 cells by an average of 35% regardless of the presence or absence of progesterone. In contrast, E2 decreased S-phase cells by an average of 30–40% in PR-transfected cells MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26. This effect of transfected PR is ligand-independent as progesterone at various concentrations did not modify this antiproliferative effect of E2 in PR-transfected MCF-7 cells. PR Transfection in MCF-7 Cells Abolished the Growth Stimulatory Effect of E2—Fig. 3 shows that the numbers of E2-treated MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8 cells were double that of vehicle-treated controls after 8 days. In contrast, the cell numbers of E2-treated MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 cells were the same as that of vehicle-treated cells. Although the cell numbers of PR-transfected cell clones appears to be higher than that of control cells after 8 days in culture, this does not necessarily indicate an increased rate of cell growth in PR-transfected cells. As shown by Fig. 6, the S-phase fraction of PR-transfected cells receiving control vehicle is similar to that of parental and vector-transfected cells (19 versus 22%).Fig. 6A, the effect of E2 on cell cycle progression as a function of time.

To determine if transfected PR inhibits the effect of E2 by modifying the transcriptional activity of ER, the expression of two well known estrogen target genes pS2 and GREB1 were studied by real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4). E2 induced the increase of pS2 expression by 6–10-fold after 24 h of treatment in all cell lines tested. This induction of pS2 gene expression was sustained in MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8 cells after 48 and 72 h of treatment. In MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 cells; however, the induction of pS2 gene expression by E2 was impaired by 50–75% after 48 and 72 h of treatment (p < 0.001). Similarly, estradiol-induced GREB1 expression following 48 and 72 h of treatment was impaired by 70% compared with that at the 24 h time point in PR-transfected cells. In contrast, the induction of gene expression in MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8 cells for both pS2 and GREB1 remained statistically similar at all time points studied. It is interesting to note that the inhibition of transcription activity of ER by PR transfection at 24 h was not as prominent as that at 48 and 72 h. Transfected PR Interferes with ER Binding to Estrogen Response Elements (ERE)—To determine if the transfected PR modify the effect of E2 by interfering with ER binding to specific ERE, we conducted promoter interference assay by transient transfection. The reporter plasmid (CMV-ERE2-CAT) contains two ERE sequences positioned between the TATA box and the start of transcription. The ER binding to ERE will disrupt the assembly of the general transcription complex, resulting in the reduction of the CMV promoter-driven CAT reporter gene expression. It has been validated that insertion of up to three ERE into CMV-TATA-CAT plasmids did not disrupt the expression of CAT activity in the absence of ER (20Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Gass E.K. Leonhardt S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1905-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with CMV-TATA-CAT reporter construct were used as transfection controls for each treatment. The result of each treatment in Fig. 5 was expressed as the percentage of CAT expression by CMV-TATA-ERE2-CAT relative to that by CMV-TATA-CAT. CAT expression by CMV-TATA-ERE2-CAT in vehicle-treated cells is on the average 50% of that by CMV-TATA-CAT, suggesting some intrinsic interference of CMV promoter activity by cellular proteins. In MCF-7 and vector-treated MCF-7-C8 cells, E2 treatment for 16, 24, and 48 h caused a 40–60% reduction in CAT activity compared with vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, estradiol-17β-mediated promoter interference activity was largely abolished in PR-transfected cells at these time points. Hence transfected PR inhibited ER binding to ERE. This effect appeared as early as 16 h after treatment. The Antiestrogenic Effect of Transfected PR on Cell Proliferation Exhibited a Delay of ∼60 h—We have shown earlier that the inhibitory effect of E2 on cell cycle was demonstrated after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 2). Gene expression studies showed that the antiestrogenic effect of transfected PR appeared following a delay of ∼24 h. Further studies were carried out to determine if this delay also occurs in cell cycle regulation. Surprisingly, the effect of E2 on cell cycle progression was stimulatory in these PR-transfected cells up to the time point of 60 h after treatment. The S-phase fraction of these cells plunged to about 60% of the vehicle-treated controls only after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 6A). In contrast, S-phase fractions of E2-treated MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8 cells were consistently higher than that in vehicle-treated control cells throughout the 72-h period examined. These results suggest E2 treatment turned growth inhibitory after 72 h. Studies of both gene expression and cell cycle suggest that E2 functions normally during the first 24–48 h of treatment depending on the parameter tested. We asked the question whether PR transfection affected the metabolism of E2 such that E2 is short-lived. In this scenario, a second dose of E2 should still be growth stimulatory initially. This hypothesis was tested by studying cells in culture over a period of 7 days, and the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium with E2 after 72 and 120 h. Fig. 6B shows that freshly added E2 was able to induce an increase of S-phase fraction after 24 h in culture in PR-transfected cells. But it again turned antimitogenic after 48 h in culture. The same stimulatory and inhibitory pattern occurred following the third addition of E2. This is in sharp contrast to the effect of E2 on vector-transfected cells MCF-7-C8 cells in which the number of S-phase cells was higher in E2-treated cells than that of vehicle-treated control cells throughout the 7-day period. These data support the hypothesis that E2 in PR-transfected cells may be metabolized at a faster rate than that in control cells, and E2 may be converted to a growth inhibitory compound in PR-transfected MCF-7 cells. Heightened Metabolism of E2 in PR-transfected MCF-7 Cells—The metabolic changes of [3H]E2 in the media of MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-C8 cells were monitored by scintillation counting of radioactivity in the fractions of eluate following HPLC separation (Fig. 7). The whole media were analyzed without solvent extraction so that metabolites of both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature were present in the sample. The protein components were removed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation to prevent interference in separation. [3H]E2 was eluted as peak y since it was the only peak in cell-free medium, and its retention time also matched that of E2 standard (23.9 ± 1.5 min). Peak x is a mixture of [3H]E2 metabolites, and this peak was not present in cell-free medium. There was a progressive decrease of the [3H]E2 peak and increase of the metabolites peak x with time in both cell lines. However, these changes occurred more rapidly in culture medium of MCF-7-PR8 cells compared with that of MCF-7-C8 cells. After 3 h of treatment, 58% of [3H]E2 was metabolized by MCF-7-PR8 cells compared with 26% (Table I) by MCF-7-C8 cells. Following 6 h of treatment, 77% of [3H]E2 was metabolized by MCF-7-PR8 cells compared with 40% by MCF-7-C8 cells. It is remarkable that the percentage of [3H]E2 metabolized by MCF-7-PR8 cells in 6 h (77%) is similar to that by MCF-7-C8 cells in 24 h (80%), suggesting a much faster metabolic conversion of E2 in PR-transfected cells than the vector-transfected controls.Table IThe percentage of radioactivity in peak x and peak y for the histogram presented inFig. 7E2 and E2 metabolite(s)Radioactivity3 h6 h24 h%Cell-free control mediaPeak x———Estradiol (Peak y)92.092.893.9MCF-7-C8 cell mediaPeak x25.840.480.4Estradiol (Peak y)67.655.313.2MCF-7-PR8 cell mediaPeak x57.977.093.4Estradiol (Peak y)38.817.52.0 Open table in a new tab The retention time of [3H]E2 metabolites in peak x is between 4 and 9 min. This overlaps the retention time for 6α-hydroxyestradiol (4.3 min), estriol (5.1 min), and 16α-hydroxyestrone (7.9 min) (Table II). Although these three compounds are some of the major metabolites of E2, there are insufficient data for us to confirm the identities of the metabolites in peak x.Table IIThe retention time of unlabeled E2 and E2 metabolite standardsSteroidRetention timemin6α-Hydroxyestradiol4.3 ± 0.5Estriol5.1 ± 0.816α-Hydroxyesterone7.9 ± 0.817β-Estradiol23.9 ± 1.5Estrone30.2 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab We also determined whether the heightened E2 metabolism is caused by enhanced cellular uptake. Fig. 8 shows that after just 1 h of incubation with [3H]E2, cellular [3H]E2 in MCF-7-PR8 and MCF-7-PR26 cells was 32% higher (p < 0.05) than that in control cells MCF-7 and MCF-7-C8. It appears that enhanced cellular uptake of E2 in PR-transfected cells is possibly one of the mechanisms for increased metabolism of E2. Phylogenetic analysis and genome mapping of steroid receptors revealed that the first steroid receptor to evolve is the ER, followed by the progesterone receptor (22Thornton J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5671-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 23Thornton J.W. Need E. Crews D. Science. 2003; 30: 1714-1717Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Estrogen-dependent expression of PR in target tissues may carry selective advantages from an evolutionary point of view. The emergence of PR before estrogen may inflict certain threats to homeostasis of cells. This study demonstrates that the expression of PR prior to estrogenic signal severely hampered the function of estrogen. eiPR inhibited E2-mediated gene expression and abolished its growth stimulatory effect. While the antiestrogenic effects of progestin have been documented (14Kraus W.L. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 1: S33-S37Crossref Google Scholar, 24Pasqualini J.R. Ebert C. Chetrite G.S. Gynecol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the antiestrogenic effects of these eiPR are ligand-independent. Neither progesterone nor antiprogestins such as RU486 or ZK98299 were able to modify the antiestrogenic property of these PR-transfected MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Several lines of evidence suggest that the antiestrogenic effect of eiPR may be mediated through enhancing the metabolism of E2. The first indication was that the affect of E2 on gene expression and cell proliferation was only impaired following 48 or 72 h of treatment. Because Western blotting analysis revealed no difference in the ER levels between PR-transfected cells and control cells, we speculate that this antiestrogenic effect may be caused by the depletion of E2. Indeed, when the S-phase fraction of E2-treated PR-transfected cells fell to 40% below vehicle-treated controls at the 72-h point, freshly added E2 was able to resume the growth stimulatory effect in these cells. Results of HPLC analysis of [3H]E2 in the conditioned media strongly supported the notion of enhanced metabolism of [3H]E2 in PR-transfected cells; MCF-7-PR8 cells metabolized 77% [3H]E2 in 6 h compared with a similar percentage metabolized (80%) by MCF-7-C8 cells in 24 h. The study also suggests that increased cellular uptake of E2 is one of the mechanisms for the increased E2 metabolism in PR-transfected cells. This is conceivable as the metabolism of E2 in culture occurs mainly inside the cells (25Lakhani N.J. Venitz J. Figg W.D. Sparreboom A. Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Though the retention time of 6α-hydroxyestradiol, estriol, and 16α-hydroxyestrone match that of the metabolite peak, the true identities of the metabolites in the mixture remain to be determined. It has been suggested that estriol and 6α-hydroxyestradiol are among the main end products of follicular metabolism (26Dehennin L. Blacker C. Reiffsteck A. Scholler R. J Steroid Biochem. 1984; 20: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies in MCF-7 cells suggested estrone, 2-hydroxyestrone, and estradiol 3-sulfate as the main metabolites of E2 (27Wild M.J. Rudland P.S. Back D.J. J Steroid Biochem. Mol Biol. 1991; 39: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Brueggemeier R.W. Gu X. Mobley J.A. Joomprabutra S. Bhat A.S. Whetstone J.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

All three compounds were not detectable in our study based on their retention time (27Wild M.J. Rudland P.S. Back D.J. J Steroid Biochem. Mol Biol. 1991; 39: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Wilson A.M. Reed G.A. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The discrepancies may be because of many differences in experimental conditions such as the position and the amount of tritium labeling in E2, the concentration of E2 used, and the method of extraction. The time lag between the antiestrogenic effects on gene expression and on cell cycle progression also supports the theory of heightened metabolism of E2 in PR-transfected cells. The effect of E2 during the first few hours has probably initiated the genomic events that were sufficient to commit cells to 2 rounds of accelerated cell cycles. That explains why the antiestrogenic effect on cell cycle distribution was only observed following 72 h of treatment. In contrast, E2 induction of gene expression is a relatively early event, and the effect can be observed at 6–12 h following E2 depletion. Because 77–94% E2 was metabolized in PR-transfected cells between 6 and 24 h following E2 treatment, a decline in E2-activated gene transcription of cell cycle genes would be seen after 24–48 of E2 treatment, as is shown in Fig. 4. It is intriguing that the S-phase fraction of E2-treated PR-transfected cells at 72 h is 40% lower than vehicle-treated controls. It seems to suggest that E2 has been converted to growth inhibitory metabolites that can counteract the effect of E2. Compounds such as estriol and 2-methoxyestradiol have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, but these effects were only exhibited at high concentrations (>10–6 m) (32Reddel R.R. Sutherland R.L. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5323-5329PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P.P. Schweigerer L. Nature. 1994; 368: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The E2 concentration of 10–9 m used in this study is unlikely to generate higher concentrations of metabolites. E2-mediated promoter interference was abolished as early as 16 h after treatment in eiPR-expressing cells. This antiestrogenic event seems to be too early to be attributable to the depletion of E2. Therefore, there may be additional mechanisms leading to the impaired ER-ERE interaction. In this regard, the mechanism of competition for cofactors between eiPR and ER is more plausible. It has been reported (34Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) that transcriptional activity of ER was inhibited in HeLa cells by co-expressing ER and PR in a ligand-dependent manner. This inhibition could be relieved by increasing the expression level of ER. The above study appears to suggest that PR may compete with ER for transcription cofactors or co-regulators so as to impair the ER transcriptional activity. It is also possible that eiPR compete for binding with chaperone proteins such as heat shock protein 90 and various immunophilins that are required to maintain the receptor in a favorable conformation for ligand binding (35Ratajczak T. Ward B.K. Minchin R.F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1348-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear how transfected PR mediates increased cellular uptake of E2. Early studies showed that the relative binding affinity of E2 for PR is less than 0.3% of progesterone (36Lin C.L. Buttle H.L. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 130: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). With a dissociation constant of 10–9 m for progesterone binding, the estimated dissociation constant for E2 would be in the range of 10–6 m. It is thus theoretically not possible for E2 at 10–9 m to bind to PR significantly. However, we observed that E2 treatments facilitate an inhibition of the PR progesterone response element binding in the promoter interference assay, 2Z.-Y. Zheng, B.-H. Bay, S.-E. Aw, and V. C.-L. Lin, unpublished results. suggesting an inhibitory effect of E2 on PR-DNA interaction. Whether this is mediated through E2-PR binding remains to be investigated. Evidence supporting the antiestrogenic potential of eiPR has been recently reported in an in vivo study. Breast cancer cells T47D expressing eiPR grew into smaller estrogen-dependent tumors in nude mice than PR-negative cells, and this phenomenon is independent of the PR ligand (37Sartorius C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 79: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The effect was PR isoform-selective as tumors expressing PR-A were only half the size of PR-B-expressing tumors. However, there was no indication of one PR isoform being more potent than the other in our study. Although MCF-7-PR8 expresses more PR-B than PR-A and MCF-7-PR26 expresses more PR-A than PR-B, the two cell lines have similar potential to abolish the growth stimulatory effect of E2. Studies of gene expression of pS2 and GREB1 indicate that the antiestrogenic potential of MCF-7-PR8 is greater than that in MCF-7-PR26. This may be related to the higher level of PR in MCF-7-PR8 cells instead of the relative expression of PR isoforms. In summary, the study demonstrated that estrogen-independent expression of PR in MCF-7 cells antagonized the stimulatory effect of E2 on cell proliferation and on gene expression in a PR ligand-independent manner, and interfered with ER binding to ERE. This antiestrogenic effect of eiPR is associated with an accelerated metabolism of E2 in PR-transfected MCF-7 cells, which is likely mediated through increased cellular uptake of E2. Squelching of cofactors by transfected PR may explain the reduced ER-ERE interaction in a promoter interference assay. The findings open up a new window for a hitherto unknown functional relationship between the PR and ER. This antiestrogenic mechanism is also of therapeutic relevance to the group of ER-positive breast tumors, which do not respond to antiestrogen therapy, and to the antiestrogen-resistant tumors that remain ERα-positive and estrogen-responsive.

It is currently used in treatment of various forms of cancer. ONC antitumor properties depend on its ribonucleolytic activity that is low in comparison with other members of the superfamily. The most damaging side effect from Onconase treatment is renal toxicity, which seems to be caused by the unusual stability of the enzyme. Therefore, mutants with reduced thermal stability and/or increased catalytic activity may have significant implications for human cancer chemotherapy.

ONC shares 30% of identity with the sequence of RNase A, and its three-dimensional structure exhibits a highly conserved ribonuclease-like topology (13Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which comprises a characteristic V-shaped β-sheet motif surrounded by three α-helices. Differences are mainly localized in the loop regions, which are significantly shorter in ONC, and at the C terminus where a disulfide bond, unique to amphibian ribonucleases, tethers the C-terminal residue Cys104 to Cys87 located in one strand of the β-sheet (13Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Another distinct property of ONC is the presence of an N-terminal pyroglutamate (Pyr1), which folds back against the N-terminal helix (13Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The overall active site architecture closely resembles that of RNase A and includes His10, Lys31, and His97, which form the catalytic triad corresponding to His12, Lys41, and His119, respectively, of the pancreatic enzyme. Despite this similarity and the activating effect of the N-terminal Pyr residue (14Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the Onconase activity is by 3–5 orders of magnitude lower in comparison with RNase A, depending on the used substrate (15Boix E.

The structural reasons for this very low ribonucleolytic activity are not yet clearly understood. Although very low, the activity is essential for the Onconase antitumor action (7Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonuclease: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1996: 491-514Google Scholar), which seems to be related to its ability to evade the ribonuclease inhibitor (10Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protein present in human cells that protects them from the potentially damaging effects of their own RNases. Although ONC is a frog protein, it is immunologically tolerated by humans. It only causes a reversible renal toxicity (16Vasandani V.M. Burris J.A. Sung C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), probably linked to the enzyme stability, which is unusually high for a protein isolated from a mesophilic source (17Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Dal Piaz F. Barone G. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8711-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ONC has a denaturation temperature (Td) close to 90 °C at pH 6.0 and is particularly resistant to proteolysis (17Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Dal Piaz F. Barone G. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8711-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Notomista E. Cafaro V. Fusiello R. Bracale A. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9097-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, the mutant in which methionine 23 has been replaced by leucine (M23L-ONC) is 5-fold more active than the native enzyme and fully toxic toward tumor cells (17Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Dal Piaz F. Barone G. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8711-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants in which the disulfide bond Cys87-Cys104 has been eliminated, (C87S,des104)-ONC and (C87S,des103–104)-ONC, exhibit a greatly reduced thermal stability with a Td of 70.2 and 69.3 °C, respectively (19Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Di Gaetano S. Barone G. Di Donato A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9097-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas their catalytic action and antitumor activity are practically unaffected. Here we report the crystal structures of (C87S,des103–104)-ONC and M23L-ONC and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of ONC and (C87S,des103–104)-ONC. The results provide strong evidence of the high rigidity of the enzyme. In particular, despite the strict similarity in the β-sheet architecture, ONC does not possess the β-sheet breathing motion characteristic of RNase A and considered to be functionally important (20Merlino A. Vitagliano L. Ceruso M.A. Di Nola A. Mazzarella L. Biopolymers. 2002; 65: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Vitagliano L. Merlino A. Zagari A. Mazzarella L.

The decreased flexibility provides a basis to explain the low affinity of ONC toward nucleotides (23Lee J.E. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11443-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and, more generally, its lower catalytic activity. It also provides a basis to rationalize the substitution effects on the activity and thermal stability of the mutants. Crystallization and Data Collection—Mutants of Onconase were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (17Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Dal Piaz F. Barone G.

Crystallization was achieved by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique at 277 and 293 K for (C87S,des103–104)-ONC and M23L-ONC, respectively. A volume of 2 μl of protein at 15 mg/ml was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5–4.7, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, and 25–27% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Crystals of the two mutants grow in 2–4 days; they are nearly isomorphous and belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a ENRAF-NON-IUS DIP area detector equipped with an FR591 rotating anode of the Istituto di Biostrutture e Bioimmagini (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Naples, Italy). For M23L-ONC, diffraction data were collected also at 100 K on the x-ray diffraction beamline at Elettra Synchrotron, Trieste, Italy. Trehalose (300 mg/ml) was used as cryoprotectant. All data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38453) Google Scholar).

Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) at 1.7-Å resolution. The refinement was carried out with the program CNS (25Brunger A.T.

Several alternating cycles of positional refinement, energy minimization, individual temperature factor refinement, and manual model building were performed. Water molecules were inserted into the model at positions corresponding to peaks in the Fo – Fc electron density map with heights greater thanX 3σ and at hydrogen bonding distances from appropriate atoms. Sulfate anions were also located in difference Fourier maps and added to the current models. The program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss M.D. Thorton J.M. J. Appl.

The ionization state was set to mimic a neutral pH environment. The overall charge of the systems was neutralized by adding the appropriate number of ions more than 7 Å away from the protein surface. The solvent was relaxed by energy minimization followed by a 20-ps MD simulation at 300 K. The overall system was then minimized without restraints before the productive run. All bond lengths were constrained by LINCS (32Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Freaje J.G.E.M. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11372) Google Scholar); Newton's equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 2 fs, and atomic coordinates were saved for analyses every 0.5 ps. A dielectric constant of 1 was used. The simulated temperatures, 300 and 350 K, were kept constant by coupling the system to an external bath (33Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. van Gusteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23173) Google Scholar). A cut-off of 14 Å was used for the treatment of both electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions. 4-ns simulations were performed at 300 and 350 K for ONC and for the mutant (C87S,des103–104)-ONC. A second independent 10-ns simulation of ONC was carried out at 300 K using the same parameters of 4-ns simulation but a different set of initial velocities.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the MD Trajectories—The global structural stability of the simulations has been evaluated by following several geometric parameters as a function of time. The ONC and (C87S,des103–104)-ONC simulations were stable and exhibited great similarity to the x-ray starting structures at 300 K. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values for the Cα atoms are on average 2.2 Å, and the average values for radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area are comparable with those experimentally observed. At 350 K, the r.m.s.d. values are 2.2 Å for ONC and 3.2 Å for (C87S,des103–104)-ONC. The mobility of each Cα atom with respect to the average structure (root mean square fluctuation) has been calculated according to Equation 1, 1N∑i=1n(ri−〈r〉)2(Eq. 1) where ri represents the element position at time i, and r represents the average value. Essential degrees of freedom were extracted from the equilibrated portions of the trajectories according to the essential dynamic method (34Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). The eigenvectors corresponding to the higher 10 eigenvalues obtained from diagonalization of the covariance matrix of Cα atom fluctuations were used to describe almost all the conformational substates accessible to the protein (essential subspace). To evaluate the overlap of the conformation spaces spanned by the different systems, we have calculated the root mean square inner product (RMSIP) (22Merlino A. Vitagliano L. Ceruso M.A. Mazzarella L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Ceruso M.A. Amadei A. Di Nola A.

The RMSIP is defined according to Equation 2, 110∑i=110∑i=110(ηiηj)2(Eq. 2) where ηi and ηj are the ith and jth eigenvectors from the two trajectories, respectively. The RMSIP value was also used to ascertain the convergence in the essential subspace between two halves of the equilibrated portion of the trajectories and to evaluate their similarity. X-ray Structure of M23L-ONC and (C87S,des103–104)-ONC—The room temperature structure of M23L-ONC was refined to an R-factor of 0.168 (R-free = 0.212) using data collected at 1.78-Å resolution and includes 90 water molecules and one sulfate anion. A low temperature model was also obtained by using the 1.51-Å resolution data, collected at 100 K, and refined to a final R-factor of 0.156 (R-free = 0.198); in this case 144 water molecules and three sulfate anions were included in the final model. The room temperature crystal structure of (C87S,des103–104)-ONC, refined at 1.90-Å resolution to a final R-factor of 0.144 (R-free = 0.194), includes 99 water molecules and one sulfate anion. The average B-factors for all the nonhydrogen atoms are 17.5, 11.2, and 19.9 Å2 for the three structures, respectively. A full list of the refinement statistics is reported in Table II. Fig. 1 gives a general view of the molecule; the mutated and/or deleted residues are shaded. The overall structures of the two mutants, refined with the room temperature data, are very close to that of the wild type enzyme (13Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), showing that in both cases the mutations do not produce any relevant alteration of the protein tertiary structure. Indeed, after superimposition of each mutant on the native protein, the r.m.s.d. of all the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C, and O) is 0.16 Å for M23L-ONC and 0.13 Å for (C87S,des103–104)-ONC. Slightly higher values were obtained when the 100 K structure of M23L-ONC was compared with the room temperature structure (0.31 Å) or with the wild type enzyme (0.38 Å). The former value is very close to the one obtained when two crystal structures of RNase A, refined at 98 and 300 K, respectively, are compared (38Tilton Jr., R.F. Dewan J.C. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2469-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The close similarity of the two mutants with the wild type enzyme also extends to the active site region where a sulfate anion is located. This anion, which mimics the phosphate of the natural substrate, hydrogen bonds His10 and His97 as found in the structure of the wild type enzyme (13Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as well as in several other members of the pancreatic-like superfamily (39Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G.

A. 1994; 91: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the mutants, as well as in the wild type structure, His97 adopts a g– conformation (χ1 = –76 ± 3°) very similar to the B conformation of the corresponding His119 in RNase A (44Borkakoti N. Palmer R.A. Haneef I. Moss D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this enzyme, His119 has access to more than one conformation, although the A conformation (χ1 close to 180°), which is considered to be catalytically relevant in the transphosphorolytic step, is more often encountered due to the stabilizing interaction with the carboxylate group of Asp121 (40Berisio R. Lamzin V.S. Sica F. Wilson K.S. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the corresponding position 99 of Onconase, the presence of a valine instead of the aspartate decreases the A conformation stability because of the loss of the salt bridge and the greater steric hindrance of the side chain. This feature is expected to reduce the activity of the enzyme at most in the first step of the enzymatic reaction and cannot account for the dramatic decrease observed for the first as well as for the second rate-limiting hydrolytic step (15Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this context, the explanation of the increased activity of M23L-ONC in comparison with the wild type enzyme on the basis of their structural differences may shed light on the origin of the very low ribonucleolytic activity of Onconase. In the room temperature model of M23L-ONC, despite its similarity with the wild type enzyme, small conformational changes of residues near the mutation site and in the active site are indeed observed. The side chain of the mutated residue is located in a hydrophobic cavity lined by the side chains of Ile22, Phe28, Phe36, Tyr77, Cys68, and Lys31 and stiffened by the presence of the three aromatic residues (Fig. 2A). The greater bulkiness of the Leu branched side chain compared with Met produces a small but significant rearrangement of the contacting residues such as Phe36 and, particularly, Lys31, a residue that plays an important role in the ribonucleolytic activity of the enzyme (23Lee J.E. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11443-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the Nζ of this lysine modifies its hydrogen bonding network. Both in ONC and in (C87S,des103–104)-ONC, the cationic head of Lys31 is hydrogen-bonded at a distance of 2.9 and 3.2 Å, respectively, to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys33. In M23L-ONC, Nζ moves about 0.5 Å away from this oxygen in the direction of the sulfate and establishes an hydrogen bond to Oδ-1 of Asn34 at a distance of 3.0 Å (4.0 Å in ONC and 3.7 Å in (C87S,des103–104)-ONC) (Fig. 2B). Although small, this movement places the side chain in a more favorable position to activate the enzymatic reaction. Incidentally a similar hydrogen bond was found in RNase A between the conserved active site residues Lys41 and Asn44 (41Vitagliano L. Merlino A. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The features observed in the room temperature structure of M23L-ONC were fully confirmed by the 100 K structure refined at a resolution of 1.5 Å. Despite some differences arising from the binding of two extra sulfate anions and the rearrangement of a few exposed side chains, the lysine is practically unmoved and well defined in the electron density map together with its hydration sphere. In this case, in addition to the hydrogen bond to O-δ1 of Asn34 (3.2 Å), Nζ is bonded to two water molecules in a roughly tetrahedral fashion, whereas its distance from the oxygen of Lys33 is 3.7 Å (Fig. 2C). A reorientation of the lysine side chain in comparison with the wild type enzyme has been recently detected in a NMR study of a variant of ONC, which, in addition to the replacement of Met23 with Leu, presents at the N terminus the substitution of Pyr1 with the sequence Met-Gln (45Gorbatyuk V.Y.

It is gratifying to notice that both solid state and solution data converge in the indication that the leucine side chain perturbs the ly"
https://openalex.org/W1992003720,"The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. Two primary Tat complexes have been identified, comprising TatABC or TatA multimers, which may interact at the point of translocation. We have analyzed green/cyan/yellow fluorescent protein (XFP) fusions to each of the Tat subunits. We show that the TatB and TatC fusions are active and incorporated into purified TatABC complexes. Proteolytic clipping of the TatA-XFP fusion precludes a definitive conclusion regarding activity, but we do find that the full fusion protein is preferentially incorporated into the TatABC complex. A previous study has proposed that TatB and possibly TatC are localized at the cell poles, whereas TatA is distributed more uniformly throughout the plasma membrane. Here, we likewise show that TatA-XFP is primarily distributed around the periphery of the cell. However, whereas much of the TatB-XFP is found at the poles, quantitative imaging studies show that approximately half of the protein is uniformly distributed in the plasma membrane. Moreover, we show that the bulk of TatC-XFP is detected as a halo around the cells, in some cases as punctate areas that are much smaller than those occupied by TatB-green fluorescent protein (GFP), indicating a uniform distribution. No evidence for a polar localization of TatC-GFP was obtained. Although TatC-GFP is found correctly complexed with TatB, a high proportion of TatB-GFP is not linked to TatC, and we propose that this ""free"" TatB forms unphysiological assemblies, possibly because it is synthesized in excess. Since TatC is invariably complexed with TatB in wild-type complexes, the combined data demonstrate that TatABC complexes are uniformly distributed throughout the plasma membrane. The significance of the punctate TatA/B/C-GFP is unclear; fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements show that these pools of proteins are immobile, whereas nonaggregated proteins are highly mobile in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2056799774,"Disruption of the dystroglycan gene in humans and mice leads to muscular dystrophies and nervous system defects including malformation of the brain and defective synaptic transmission. To identify proteins that interact with dystroglycan in the brain we have used immunoaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) and found that the GTPase dynamin 1 is a novel dystroglycan-associated protein. The β-dystroglycan-dynamin 1 complex also included α-dystroglycan and Grb2. Overlay assays indicated that dynamin interacts directly with dystroglycan, and immunodepletion showed that only a pool of dynamin is associated with dystroglycan. Dystroglycan was associated and colocalized immunohistochemically with dynamin 1 in the central nervous system in the outer plexiform layer of retina where photoreceptor terminals are found. Endocytosis in neurons is both constitutive, as in non-neural cells, and regulated by neural activity. To assess the function of dystroglycan in the former, we have assayed transferrin uptake in fibroblastic cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells null for both dystroglycan alleles. In wild-type cells, dystroglycan formed a complex with dynamin and codistributed with cortactin at membrane ruffles, which are organelles implicated in endocytosis. Dystroglycan-null cells had a significantly greater transferrin uptake, a process well known to require dynamin. Expression of dystroglycan in null cells by infection with an adenovirus containing dystroglycan reduced transferrin uptake to levels seen in wild-type embryonic stem cells. These data suggest that dystroglycan regulates endocytosis possibly as a result of its interaction with dynamin.

In skeletal muscle α- and β-DG form the functional core of a larger complex that links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and serves to maintain the integrity of myofibers faced with the stress of repeated contractions (14Durbeej M. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Hence, mice with skeletal muscle deficient in DG develop a severe muscular dystrophy (15Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat.

Recent work has shown that myodystrophy (myd) mice, which have a mutation in LARGE, a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in O-glycosylation of α-DG (31Grewal P.K. Holzfeind P.J. Bittner R.E. Hewitt J.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), have decreased affinity for laminin and disrupted meningeal basement membranes (2Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H. Straub V. Mathews K.D. Moore S.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These mice also have defects in neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (2Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H. Straub V. Mathews K.D. Moore S.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In humans, similar defects, called lissencephalies, are associated with profound mental retardation and are manifested in Walker Warburg Syndrome, Muscle Eye Brain Disease, and Fukuyama Muscular Dystrophy. All of these are congenital muscular dystrophies that result from mutations in genes known or suspected to regulate glycosylation of α-DG (32Montanaro F. Carbonetto S. Neuron. 2003; 37: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice with a targeted deletion of dag1 in the brain have a similar phenotype (19Moore S. Saito F. Chen J. Michele D.E. Henry M.D. Messing A. Cohn R.D. Ross-Barta S.E. Westra S. Williamson R.A. Hoshi T. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), suggesting that many functions of DG are mediated by carbohydrate side chains, which are responsible for most ligand binding (1Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 2Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H.

In addition, mice lacking DG in the brain have defects in long term potentiation in the hippocampus (19Moore S. Saito F. Chen J. Michele D.E. Henry M.D. Messing A. Cohn R.D. Ross-Barta S.E. Westra S. Williamson R.A. Hoshi T. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and myd mice have an abnormal electroretinogram with no signs of disrupted neuronal migration in the retina (20Holzfeind P.J. Grewal P.K. Reitsamer H.A. Kechvar J. Lassmann H. Hoeger H. Hewitt J.E. Bittner R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DG is also necessary for stabilization of the postsynaptic density of acetylcholine receptors on skeletal myotubes in culture (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Grady R.M. Zhou H. Cunningham J.M. Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2000; 25: 279-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and at nerve-muscle synapses in vivo (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J.

Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) Emerging evidence indicates that the proteins that interact with DG in non-muscle tissues differ from those in muscle. For example, α-neurexin is complexed with α-DG in the central nervous system (CNS), (12Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K.P. Sudhof T.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) whereas periaxin is associated with DG in Schwann cells (35Sherman D.L. Fabrizi C. Gillespie C.S. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To identify novel DG interactors we have used immunoaffinity chromatography to purify DG and its associated proteins from rat brains. We report that β-DG forms a complex with dynamin 1, a GTPase essential for several modes of endocytosis including regulated endocytosis during synaptic vesicle release and constitutive endocytosis, which occurs in neuronal and non-neuronal cells alike (36D'Hondt K. Heese-Peck A. Riezman H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 255-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The β-DG-dynamin complex in the CNS also contains α-DG and the SH2 (Src homology 2)/SH3 (Src homology 3) adapter protein Grb2 and has the potential to anchor dynamin at discrete sites within the cell. In an overlay assay, β-DG interacts directly with brain dynamin. In the retina, DG is associated and immunohistochemically colocalized with dynamin at the outer plexiform layer where previous ultrastructural studies (27Koulen P. Blank M. Kroger S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Blank M. Koulen P. Blake D.J. Kroger S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2121-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have found DG to be distributed presynaptically in synapses formed by photoreceptors onto bipolar and horizontal cells. Finally, in fibroblasts differentiated from embryonic stem (ES) cells, DG associates with dynamin and codistributes with cortactin at membrane ruffles, which are organelles implicated in endocytosis. Cells null for DG have an increased uptake of transferrin, and re-introduction of DG into these null cells reduces this increase to normal levels. Antibodies—Antisera to β-DG and monoclonal antibody (mAb 1B7) to α-DG were characterized previously (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40Moukhles H. Roque R. Carbonetto S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). mAbs to the following proteins were used for Western blotting: β-DG (1:250) (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.); α-DG (IIH6) (1:1000) (Upstate Biotechnology); Grb2 (1:500); GST (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). mAb Hudy-1 (Upstate Biotechnology), which recognizes dynamin 1 found in the brain as well as the more ubiquitous dynamin 2 (41Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), was used at 1:40,000 dilution for Western blotting and 1:200 dilution for immunocytochemistry. mAbs to cortactin (Upstate Biotechnology) were used at 1:250. Antisera to amphiphysin (1874) was a gift from Peter McPherson (McGill). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:2000) and goat anti-rabbit antisera (1:4000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used as secondary antibodies in Western blots. Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:200) and fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antisera (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used for immunofluorescence staining. Tissue Extraction—Rat brains and hippocampi were dissected from adult rats euthanized according to the Guidelines of McGill University Health Center Animal Facility. Tissues were homogenized on ice four times (10 s each) with a Polytron tissue homogenizer in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 9.0) containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% in a total volume of 6 ml. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with occasional vortexing, the homogenates were centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined (DC Protein Assay Kit; Bio-Rad). Synaptosomes were prepared from rat brains as described by Sugita et al. (12Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K.P. Sudhof T.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, rat brains were removed and homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g to remove nuclei. The postnuclear supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 9,800 × g, and the resulting pellets were collected as crude synaptosomes. Immunoaffinity Chromatography—Antisera to β-DG (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), bovine serum albumin (control), or rabbit immunoglobulin (control) were co-valently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Five milligrams of hippocampal extract (2-3 ml) were incubated overnight with 1 ml of each Affi-Gel-protein conjugate. The slurry was packed into a column, washed first with 10 ml of PBS (pH 9.0) containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.15 m sodium chloride (buffer A), followed by a wash with 10 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A, and finally 10 ml of 5 mm EDTA in buffer A. Proteins still bound to the column were eluted at low pH with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralized with 0.3 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The columns then were equilibrated each with 10 ml of PBS, and any remaining proteins were eluted with 3 ml of 0.1 m triethylamine (pH 11.5) and neutralized with 0.3 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The glycine and triethylamine eluates were pooled, dialyzed against PBS overnight, and then concentrated to equal volumes (Millipore Centricon filters), and equal aliquots of the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (3Gee S.H. Blacher R.W. Douville P.J. Provost P.R. Yurchenco P.D. Carbonetto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14972-14980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Crude synaptosomes or retinas were solubilized in PBS (pH 9.0) containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (buffer B) and centrifuged for 37,000 × g for 30 min. 60-100 μl of supernatant were precleared with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 1 h. After preclearing, 20 μl of protein G beads conjugated to relevant antibodies or preimmune sera were added to the precleared supernatants and incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking. The agarose beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were collected, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer C, followed by 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in buffer B, and finally with 0.5 ml of buffer B containing 5 mm EDTA. The washed beads were then boiled in sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Overlay Assay—The cytoplasmic tail of β-DG was amplified by PCR from a plasmid containing the full-length DG cDNA sequence using sense 5′-GAAGATCTTCTATCGCAAGAAGAGG-3′, and antisense primers 5′-GCTCTAGATTAAGGGGGAACATACGG-3′. The amplified β-DGcyto was digested with BglII and gel-purified. Plasmid pGEX-3x (Amersham Biosciences) was digested with EcoR I, blunt-ended, digested with BamHI, and gel-purified. The purified pGEX-3X vector and β-DGcyto fragment were ligated to produce pGST-βDGcyto plasmid. The DH5α Escherichia coli strain was transformed with plasmids pGST-3X and pGST-βDGcyto, and proteins induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2-3 h were purified according to the procedures described by Frangioni and Neel (42Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). To assay the interaction of dynamin with β-DG, dynamin was immunoprecipitated from 0.4 mg of synaptosomal extracts with 6 μg of mAb Hudy-1 (43Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated dynamin was electrophoresed in a 4-15% acrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% powdered skim in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1%Tween-20) and incubated overnight with GST (20 μg/ml) or GST-βDGcyto (20 μg/ml) in TBST containing 5% skim milk. The membranes were washed three times with TBST (10 min each) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-GST antibody for 1 h. After three washes with TBST (15 min each), the signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture, Immunocytochemistry, and Transferrin Uptake Assay— Wild-type and DG-null embryonic stem cells were engineered as previously described (15Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies that were grown on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After 3 days in culture, cells from the embryoid bodies spread and fibroblast-like flat cells appear at the periphery. At this point, cultures were treated with 200 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 15 min, after which cells were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with 20 μg/ml of rhodamine-conjugated transferrin in fresh growth medium at 37° for 15 or 120 min. After washing in PBS, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Immunocytochemistry followed previously described methods (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, then washed with PBS three times, and incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were washed prior to mounting on slides in Immuno-fluore mounting medium (MP Biomedicals) and observed under a ×63 objective using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope. Images were captured with a Retiga 1300 Monochrome 10-bit digital camera (Qimaging Corp.) and analyzed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix). Quantifications were done on 8-bit images using threshold values of 86-255 pixels (11Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sum of the areas that were fluorescent were obtained for each field and normalized to the number of cells per field. Measurements were tabulated with Microsoft Excel and analyzed statistically using StatView (Abacus Concepts, Inc.). To isolate and expand fibroblastic cells, wild-type and DG-null embryoid bodies were grown for 3 weeks. At this point embryoid bodies were surrounded by a halo of fibroblastic cells. The central cell mass was aspirated, and the remaining adherent cells on the periphery were grown for 2 days after which cells that did not appear fibroblastic were carefully aspired. The fibroblastic cells were then harvested and grown on 175-cm2 dishes for 4 days. Some cells were passaged onto dishes for transferrin uptake assays with the same procedures as before except that cells were incubated with transferrin at 37 °C for 15 min. Others were harvested, solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were used for immunochemical studies. Adenoviral Constructs and Infection—To express full-length DG in DG-null fibroblastic cells, we generated a replication-defective adenovirus using the AdEasy system (Qbiogene) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, DG cDNA was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pAdTrack-CMV(GFP) (GFP and DG are under separate CMV promoters producing two separate proteins), linearized using PmeI, and cotransfected with pAdEasy-1 into BJ5183, an electrocompetent E. coli strain. Recombinants (AdDG/GFP) were screened by colony size and confirmed by restriction digests. They were then linearized using PacI, purified, and transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Adenovirus production was observed by plaque formation and by GFP fluorescence. Viral particles were isolated from cellular lysates and amplified through several rounds of infections in HEK293 cells. Titers were determined by TCID50 infection test as described by the manufacturer (Qbiogene). For DG expression, ES cells were grown at low confluence, infected with 103 plaque forming units/ml (multiplicity of infection, 5) of control Ad-GFP or of AdDG/GFP for 18 h in growth medium. Infection efficiency was monitored by GFP reporter gene expression and was maximal 2 days postinfection. At this point, transferrin uptake was assayed. Immunohistochemistry—Three-month-old male mice (strain C57BL/6) were anesthetized using xylazine (2 mg/ml, Bayer Inc.) and ketamine hydrochloride (15 mg/ml, Ayerst Veterinary Laboratory). After anesthesia, mice were perfused intraventricularly with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Whole eyes were dissected from the animals and postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by cryopreservation in 30% sucrose. Eyes were then frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek) on crushed dried ice and stored at -80°. 8-μm horizontal sections were cut using a Leica CM3050S cryostat and stored at -20°. Sections were thawed to room temperature, washed with PBS, and blocked with 10% horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h prior to immunostaining."
https://openalex.org/W2169696236,"We have recently demonstrated that in human heart, β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) are biochemically coupled not only to the classical adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway but also to the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) pathway (Pavoine, C., Behforouz, N., Gauthier, C., Le Gouvello, S., Roudot-Thoraval, F., Martin, C. R., Pawlak, A., Feral, C., Defer, N., Houel, R., Magne, S., Amadou, A., Loisance, D., Duvaldestin, P., and Pecker, F. (2003) Mol. Pharmacol. 64, 1117–1125). In this study, using Fura-2-loaded cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rats, we showed that stimulation of β2-ARs triggered an increase in the amplitude of electrically stimulated [Ca2+]i transients and contractions. This effect was abolished with the PKA inhibitor, H89, but greatly enhanced upon addition of the selective cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3. The β2-AR/cPLA2 inhibitory pathway involved Gi and MSK1. Potentiation of β2-AR/AC/PKA-induced Ca2+ responses by AACOCF3 did not rely on the enhancement of AC activity but was associated with eNOS phosphorylation (Ser1177) and l-NAME-sensitive NO production. This was correlated with PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB (Ser16). The constraint exerted by the β2-AR/cPLA2 pathway on the β2-AR/AC/PKA-induced Ca2+responses required integrity of caveolar structures and was impaired by Filipin III treatment. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated zinterol-induced translocation of cPLA and its cosedimentation with MSK1, eNOS, PLB, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA) 2a in a low density caveolin-3-enriched membrane fraction. This inferred the gathering of β2-AR signaling effectors around caveolae/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) functional platforms. Taken together, these data highlight cPLA as a cardiac β2-AR signaling pathway that limits β2-AR/AC/PKA-induced Ca2+ responses in adult rat cardiomyocytes through the impairment of eNOS activation and PLB phosphorylation. We have recently demonstrated that in human heart, β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) are biochemically coupled not only to the classical adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway but also to the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) pathway (Pavoine, C., Behforouz, N., Gauthier, C., Le Gouvello, S., Roudot-Thoraval, F., Martin, C.

Cardiovascular diseases are becoming the leading cause of death worldwide, with heart failure as a major symptom. Most patients with heart failure show dysregulation of the sympathetic system, and the resulting chronic elevation of plasma catecholamine levels correlates with the prognosis (1Brodde O.E. Michel M.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 651-690PubMed Google Scholar). Among the identified cardiac catecholamine receptors, β1-adrenergic receptors (β1-AR) 1The abbreviations used are: β1-AR, β1-adrenergic receptor; AC, adenylyl cyclase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; PLB, phospholamban; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PTX, pertussis toxin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DAF-FM (4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein. and β2-AR received the most interest as mainstay regulators of cardiac performance. Noteworthy, β1-AR and β2-AR functionally diverge because of clear discrepancies in signaling transduction pathways (2Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Chronic over-stimulation of cardiac β1-AR, associated with exclusive activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway, is detrimental and leads to hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart failure (3Bisognano J.D. Weinberger H.D. Bohlmeyer T.J. Pende A. Raynolds M.V. Sastravaha A. Roden R. Asano K. Blaxall B.C. Wu S.C. Communal C. Singh K. Colucci W. Bristow M.R. Port D.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 817-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, sustained β2-AR stimulation protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis. In addition, transgenic mice with cardiac moderate β2-AR overexpression display not only long term improved cardiac function but also normal life expectancy (4Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B.

The beneficial effect of β2-AR stimulation appears to rely on the ability of β2-AR to couple with pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins (Gi2 and Gi3), leading to a β2-AR/Gs/AC signaling spatially confined to the caveolar structures and functionally moderated, as compared with the β1-AR/Gs/AC pathway (7Xiao R.P.

Identification of β2-AR/Gi-downstream effectors is of major interest to elucidate, and to further exploit the cardiac protective β2-AR potential. Recently, on human cardiac ventricular and auricular biopsies, we identified a new β2-AR-stimulated pathway, namely the Gi/cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) pathway, in addition to the classical β2-AR/Gs/AC pathway (10Pavoine C. Behforouz N. Gauthier C. Le Gouvello S. Roudot-Thoraval F. Martin C.R. Pawlak A. Feral C. Defer N. Houel R. Magne S. Amadou A. Loisance D. Duvaldestin P. Pecker F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is a high molecular mass enzyme (85 kDa), activated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+, that displays a unique selectivity for arachidonyl in the sn-2 position of phospholipids (11Leslie C.C. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 373-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is fully activated by both phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase and increases in [Ca2+]i. cPLA2 activation is associated with its translocation from the cytosol to intracellular membranes, such as endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and nuclear envelope. The essential role of cPLA2 in inflammation, asthma, neurodegenerative diseases, and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is now well documented, and cPLA2 has been identified as an attractive therapeutic target in the development of new inflammatory drugs (12Bonventre J.V.

Med. 2002; 8: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, a dearth of information exists on the possible functional impact of the cPLA2 and its role in the development of cardiac diseases. Only one recent study has established the antihypertrophic potential of the cPLA2 pathway in cardiac and skeletal muscles, using the model of the cPLA2 knockout mice (16Haq S. Kilter H. Michael A. Tao J. O'Leary E. Sun X.M. Walters B. Bhattacharya K. Chen X. Cui L. Andreucci M. Rosenzweig A. Guerrero J.L. Patten R. Liao R. Molkentin J. Picard M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the impact of β2-AR-Gi/cPLA2 and β2-AR-Gs/Ac pathways on Ca2+ signaling and contraction in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. We show that β2-AR agonists trigger an increase in the amplitude of electrically stimulated [Ca2+]i transients that relies on the β2-AR-Gs/AC/PKA pathway and is under the negative control of the β2-AR-Gi/MSK1/cPLA2 pathway. We provide evidence that upon β2-AR stimulation cPLA2 translocates to caveolae/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-functional platforms and bridles phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and phospholamban (PLB). Using fluorescence imaging, we show that the β2-AR/cPLA2 pathway neutralizes NO production. Our study highlights the essential physiological role of the β2-AR/Gi/cPLA2 pathway in limiting β2-AR/AC/PKA-induced Ca2+ responses.

Adult male Wistar rats (180–250 g, Janvier, Le Genest St Isle, France) were used. Calcium-tolerant myocytes were isolated by cardiac retrograde aortic perfusion as previously described, but using liberase blendzyme III (30 μg/ml) instead of collagenase (17Delcayre C. Samuel J.L.

Results are shown as a typical representation. Coordinated NO and Ca2+Imaging in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—NO synthesis was visualized with the cell permeable fluorescent precursor, DAF-FM (4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein) diacetate. Inside cells, this dye is hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases to the nonpermeable DAF-FM. In the presence of nitric oxide and oxygen, the relatively non-fluorescent DAF-FM is converted into the highly fluorescent and photostable triazole form, DAF-FM T, whose fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the NO concentration. This dye was chosen as the most sensitive fluorescent probe allowing NO imaging (detection from 3 nm [NO]i), and displaying the important advantages of a fluorescent spectrum independent of pH variations above pH 5.5 and a resistance to bleaching (22Itoh Y. Ma F.H. Hoshi H. Oka M. Noda K. Ukai Y. Kojima H. Nagano T. Toda N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at room temperature, and cells were exposed to 1 μm DAF-FM diacetate and 1.5 μm Fura 2-AM, for 20 min, to combine [NO]i and [Ca2+]i imaging. Cells were washed in BSS solution containing 100 μm l-arginine and submitted to electrical stimulation. Because of Fura-2 loading, cells were checked for appropriate [Ca2+]i transient responses to electrical stimulation, as well as to agonists (zinterol or zinterol plus AACOCF3), before and after the NO imaging experiment. DAF-FM diacetate fluorescence was excited at 480 nm, and emitted cellular fluorescence was recorded at 540 nm. Changes in cellular DAF-FM diacetate fluorescence intensities (F) in each experiment were normalized to the level of fluorescence recorded before agonist application (F0), and changes in [NO]i are expressed as F/F0. l-Arginine was omitted when l-NAME was used to block NO synthase. Images were recorded every 6 s. Results are described as mean ± S.E. for 10–15 cells obtained from three different isolations or shown as a typical representation. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—A particulate fraction was obtained from freshly isolated cardiomyocytes suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g.

Drug Treatment—Note that a maximal 1 μm zinterol concentration was chosen in order to focus on selective β2-AR-mediated effects. AACOCF3 (10 μm), RO 318220 (1 μm), l-NAME (1 mm), and H89 (3 μm) were added 10 min, or 30 min concerning H89, before addition of other stimuli, respectively. PTX treatment (500 ng/ml for 24 h) was carried out as described previously (23Pavoine C. Magne S. Sauvadet A. Pecker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 628-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Adult rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with Filipin III (0.2 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min before zinterol (1 μm) exposure. It is noteworthy that this dose of Filipin III allowed us to perform experiments on Fura-2-loaded cells that were devoid of any sign of Fura-2 leakage and were responsive to electrical stimulation for at least an additional 1 h experimental duration, thus arguing for peripheral cellular membrane integrity. Preparation of Low Density Caveolin-3-enriched Membrane Fractions—Fractions enriched in the muscle-specific caveolin-3 isoform were prepared from isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes according to a detergent-free purification scheme as described previously (24Song K.S.

Freshly isolated cardiomyocytes (1.5 × 106 cells/condition) were submitted to a 10 min of pretreatment with or without 10 μm AACOCF3 followed by a 10-min incubation with or without 1 μm zinterol in BSS buffer at 37 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells suspended in 1 ml of solution A (0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 11, containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 5 mm Na4P2O7)) were sequentially disrupted by homogenization with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a bath sonicator (one 5-min burst). 1 ml of homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose (% Brix measured with a refractometer) by adding 3 ml of 60% sucrose prepared in 2 volumes of MES-buffered saline (MBS: 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) and 1 volume of solution A. The 45% sucrose fraction was placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid with a 5–30% continuous sucrose gradient (sucrose solutions were prepared using equal volumes of MBS and solution A) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). After centrifugation, eleven 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (addition of 75 μl of a 100% solution). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8 added with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 5 mm Na4P2O7) and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Following determination of the protein content, fractions were dissolved in Laemmli loading buffer. Immunoblot Analysis of the Phosphorylation State of MSK1, eNOS, and PLB and Detection of Caveolin-3, PLB, MSK1, eNOS, SERCA 2A, and cPLA2—Samples, 50 μg of each cellular extract (Fig. 5) or 5 μg of each gradient fraction (Fig. 7A), were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide gels) and proteins electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.22 μm, Millipore). Membranes were first incubated with antibodies against caveolin-3 (1:5,000) (Fig. 7A), or P-(Ser16)-PLB (1:1,000) (Fig. 5), or P-(Thr17)-PLB (1:1,000) (not shown). Blots were then treated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (1:20,000) or goat-anti rabbit (1:20,000) antibodies. The peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Supersignal West Dura). 65 μg of each caveolin-3-enriched fraction (fraction 7) were loaded on preparative SDS-PAGE (8–16% acrylamide) and transferred to Hybond C Super (Amersham Biosciences) nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were cut in small pieces and analyzed with antibodies for cPLA2 (1:500), MSK1 (1:1,000), P-(Thr581)-MSK1 (1:500), PLB (1:5,000), P-(Ser16)-PLB (1:1,000), SERCA 2a (1: 1,000), eNOS (1:2,500), and P-(Ser1177)-eNOS (1:1,000). Blots were then treated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (1: 20,000 dilution), goat-anti rabbit (1:20,000 dilution), or donkey anti-sheep (1:20,000 dilution) antibodies.Fig. 7Zinterol induces translocation of the cPLA2 to platforms integrating caveolin-3-enriched membranes, closely associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and allowing functional interaction between upstream activators (MSK1) and downstream targets (eNOS and PLB) of the cPLA2. Cardiomyocytes, isolated from adult rats, were pretreated (or not) for 10 min, maintained with AACOCF3 (10 μm), and treated for 10 min with or without zinterol (1 μm). A, cardiomyocytes obtained from each of four distinct conditions of incubation (control, zinterol, AACOCF3, AACOCF3 + zinterol) were homogenized and fractionated according to a detergent-free purification scheme, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples (5 μg of each gradient fraction) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membranes were immunostained with antibodies against caveolin-3, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of caveolin-3, and the protein and sucrose distribution patterns were analyzed in parallel in the fractions corresponding to each gradient. Note that these patterns were equivalent under the four experimental conditions. A representative immunoblot is presented from experiments that have been repeated four times. B, caveolin-3-enriched fraction 7 of cardiomyocyte fractionations obtained from each of four distinct conditions of incubation was loaded on a preparative gel, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of the four membranes was cut in small pieces and analyzed, in parallel, for the presence of caveolae markers (caveolin-3, eNOS), upstream activators of the cPLA2 (MSK1, P-(Thr581)-MSK1), downstream effectors of the cPLA2 (P-(Ser1177)-eNOS, P-(Ser16)-PLB), and sarcoplasmic markers (SERCA 2a, PLB). Representative immunoblots are presented from experiments that have been repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunofluorescence Staining—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on freshly isolated myocytes fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature as described previously (26Rucker-Martin C. Pecker F. Godreau D. Hatem S.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by overnight incubation with a solution of mouse monoclonal antibodies against caveolin-3 (clone 26, 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SERCA 2a (1:100, see Ref. 27Vangheluwe P. Louch W.E. Ver Heyen M. Sipido K. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After washes, cells were first incubated for 1 h with an excess of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) highly cross-absorbed coupled to Alexa Fluor® 594 (1:100). Myocytes were then washed and treated with the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-absorbed coupled to Alexa Fluor® 647 (1:100) for 1 h. This was followed after washes by incubation with FITC-conjugated-phalloidin (1/30) for 90 min. After a final wash, coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Labeling of cells with secondary antibodies alone was carried out as a negative control. Confocal Microscopy and Image Processing—Images were collected with a Zeiss LSM-510 multitracking laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SAS, Frankfurt, Germany). Fluorochromes were detected sequentially using laser lines 488 nm (FITC), 543 nm (Alexa Fluor® 594) and 633 nm (Alexa Fluor® 647). DAPI was visualized by UV excitation. Offset and gain for each channel was set in order to avoid any cross-talk between the three fluorochrome emission spectra. The images were coded white (FITC), red (Alexa Fluor® 594), and green (Alexa Fluor® 647) giving yellow co-localization in merge images (Alexa Fluor® 594 and Alexa Fluor® 647). The oil objective used was ×63 (NA 1.4), giving a resolution of 100 nm in the x,y plane and 300 nm in the z axis (pinhole, 72 μm). Quantification of Overlapping—We studied 10 individual myocytes and analyzed 55 ± 2 successive single sections acquired in each image stack. Overlapping was quantified with the LSM 510 3 software (Carl Zeiss). The overlapping of SERCA 2a and caveolin-3 stainings in the x,y plane was determined owing to analysis of fluorescence intensity profiles as previously described by Bolte et al. (28Bolte S. Brown S. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Positive structures were evaluated using threshold values of 152 ± 17 (caveolin-3) and 144 ± 5 (SERCA 2a) pixel units on a grayscale of 0–255. A scatterplot of the individual pixels from each paired images was generated, and overlapped pixels were characterized by an overlap coefficient value of 1. The number of overlapped pixels was compared with the number of total positive pixels for each labeling (caveolin-3 or SERCA 2a). Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05. The β2-AR/cPLA2 Pathway Restrains the β2-AR/AC/PKA-induced Ca2+and Contraction Responses in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—The amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients was measured in electrically stimulated adult rat cardiomyocytes and loaded with Fura 2-AM, in response to the β2-AR selective agonist, zinterol. Zinterol induced a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients (maximal response of 182 ± 11% with zinterol (1 μm)) (Fig. 1, A and B). The cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3 (10 μm), had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i transient amplitude (Fig. 1B), but enhanced zinterol-induced Ca2+ responses (maximal response of 307 ± 28% with 1 μm zinterol) (Fig. 1, A and B). Typical traces of [Ca2+]i transients and fractional shortening showed the correlation between the increase in the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients and that of contraction in cardiomyocytes in response to zinterol added alone, or after treatment with AACOCF3 (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of PKA with H89 (3 μm) blunted the zinterol effect on the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients and contraction, in the absence (not shown) as well as in the presence of AACOCF3 (Fig. 1A). These results identified PKA activation as an essential feature of zinterol-induced Ca2+ and contraction responses, and demonstrated that the cPLA2 pathway exerted a constraint on PKA-dependent events. Among the possible targets of the cPLA2 pathway, we examined AC activity. In membranes purified from isolated cardiomyocytes, zinterol produced a limited but significant dose-dependent activation of AC activity (maximal 125 ± 5% with zinterol (1 μm)), compared with the 216 ± 21, 356 ± 5, and 1435 ± 10% stimulations elicited by isoproterenol (10 μm) (mainly β1-AR), NaF (1 mm), and forskolin (10 μm), respectively (Fig. 1C). The restricted zinterol-induced AC activation was unmodified by preincubation with AACOCF3 (maximal 123 ± 4% activation; Fig. 1C), rejecting AC as a possible target of the β2-AR/cPLA2 pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2047496931,"In the spherical virion of the parvovirus minute virus of mice, several amino acid side chains of the capsid were previously found to be involved in interactions with the viral single-stranded DNA molecule. We have individually truncated by mutation to alanine many (ten) of these side chains and analyzed the effects on capsid assembly, stability and conformation, viral DNA encapsidation, and virion infectivity. Mutation of residues Tyr-270, Asp-273, or Asp-474 led to a drastic reduction in infectivity. Mutant Y270A was defective in capsid assembly; mutant D273A formed stable capsids, but it was essentially unable to encapsidate the viral DNA or to externalize the N terminus of the capsid protein VP2, a connected conformational event. Mutation of residues Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, or Lys-471 led to a moderate reduction in infectivity. None of these mutations had an effect on capsid assembly or stability, or on the DNA encapsidation process. However, those five mutant virions were substantially less stable than the parental virion in thermal inactivation assays. The results with this model spherical virus indicate that several capsid residues that are found to be involved in polar interactions or multiple hydrophobic contacts with the viral DNA molecule contribute to preserving the active conformation of the infectious viral particle. Their effect appears to be mediated by the non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA. In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging.

In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging. Many fundamental biological processes involve protein-nucleic acid recognition. Double-stranded DNA-protein interactions have been extensively studied, but single-stranded (ss) 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; CPV, canine parvovirus; Nt, N-terminal; MVM, minute virus of mice; MVMi, MVMp, MVM strains i or p, respectively; HA, hemagglutination; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VLP, virus-like particle; VP, viral capsid protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. DNA- or RNA-protein interactions are much less characterized. In particular, very little is known about the molecular interactions between the nucleic acid genome of ssDNA or RNA virus and its protein shell, or the functional role of those interactions. Such knowledge may be essential for a better understanding of the life cycle of viruses, and for the design of drugs aimed at disrupting nucleic acid-protein interfaces. The structure of a helical virus, tobacco mosaic virus, has revealed defined interactions between repeating sets of three nucleotides in its ssRNA genome and each capsid subunit (reviewed in Ref. 1Stubbs G. Saenger W. Heinemann U. Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions. CRC Press, Boca Raton1989: 87-109Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of spherical viruses (reviewed in Refs. 2Liljas L. Prog.

Fortunately, in a few icosahedral viruses some segments of the nucleic acid molecule (∼10–60% of the total) are arranged with the same symmetry as the capsid, and could be visualized. The structural analysis (reviewed in Refs. 4Casjens S. Chiu W. Burnett R.M. Garcea R.L. Structural Biology of Viruses. Oxford University Press, NY1997: 3-37Google Scholar, 7Stockley P.G. Curr. Opin.

Virol. 2002; 147: 2261-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) has revealed that the visible capsid-nucleic acid interfaces generally include a limited number of amino acids and some 7–30 nucleotides that in several, but not in all cases, form intramolecular double-helical segments. The tertiary structure acquired by the nucleic acid within the virion may be at least partly independent of the nucleotide sequence (11Tihova M. Dryden K.A. Le T.-V. Harvey S.C. Johnson J.E. Yeager M. Schneemann A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, a capsid-binding nucleotide motif is not repeated exactly along the sequence, and thus the modeled nucleic acid stretch represents an average of the true individual sequences bound. Accordingly, many of the interactions detected in viral nucleic acid-capsid interfaces are van der Waals and polar interactions with the nonspecific phosphate and pentose moieties, but more specific interactions with the bases are also observed. Ionic interactions between some phosphates and basic side chains protruding from the internal surface of the capsid, or located in disordered N-terminal (Nt) arms of capsid proteins, occur in several ssRNA plant viruses (12Vriend G.

However, and partly due to the limited structural information available, mutational analyses to dissect the individual role(s) of specific capsid side chains that interact with the nucleic acid molecule are scarce (e.g. Refs. 41Ilag L.L.

Also, no single-residue scanning of capsid side chains involved in major interactions at the viral nucleic acid-capsid interface had, to our knowledge, been described.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the VP1/VP2 gene of MVM (strain p) was carried out using the QuikChange system (Stratagene), on recombinant plasmid pSVtk-VP1/2, and the mutant sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The mutations were introduced by subcloning in the MVMp infectious clone pMM984, originally provided by P. Tattersall (51Gardiner E.M. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modified to include the VP2 sequence of the MVMp variant used in our laboratories (52Ramírez J.C. Santarén J.F. Almendral J.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two HindIII restriction sites, or unique sites XbaI and EcoRI in the VP2 gene were respectively used for mutations located upstream or downstream of the codon corresponding to amino acid residue 402. The mutant infectious clones were subjected to restriction analysis, and the presence of the mutations and the entire sequence inserted were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The concentration of purified DNA was estimated first by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated by ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm. Electroporation of Mammalian Cells, Immunofluorescence, and Infectivity Assays—For mutational analyses, mammalian NB324K cells at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml were electroporated as described previously (53Lombardo E.

Virions were recovered at 72 h from transfected monolayers and titrated in standard plaque-formation assays (55Tattersall P. Bratton J. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 944-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results were normalized by quantitation, using SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and immunoblotting with anti-MVM antiserum, of the amount of viral capsid proteins present in extracts of the transfected cells (56Maroto B. Valle N. Saffrich R. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10685-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence assays were as described previously (56Maroto B. Valle N. Saffrich R. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10685-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The primary antibodies used were: (i) a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the MVM capsid proteins (VPs) (52Ramírez J.C. Santarén J.F. Almendral J.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); (ii) a monoclonal antibody (B7) that recognizes a discontinuous epitope specific of the assembled capsid (57López-Bueno A. Mateu M.G. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); and (iii) a polyclonal antibody elicited against the VP2 Nt that recognizes virions that have encapsidated the genome, and concomitantly externalized the VP2 Nt segment (56Maroto B.

Purification of Virions and Empty Capsids—Natural infections with MVMp or transfection with its infectious recombinant plasmid yield a large proportion of empty capsids mixed with a minor proportion of infectious virions (49Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. Adv. Virus. Res. 1987; 33: 91-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Partially purified mixtures of empty capsids and infectious virions were obtained essentially as described (56Maroto B. Valle N. Saffrich R. Almendral J.M. J.

Empty capsids and infectious virions were purified by centrifugation in cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradients (see below), and dialyzed against PBS. The capsid and virion preparations were found essentially free of contaminants by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was estimated by densitometry of stained gels and/or UV spectrophotometry (59Carreira A.

https://openalex.org/W2166865219,"CC3 (TIP30) is a protein with pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic properties. The tumor suppressor effect of CC3 has been suggested to result from inhibition of nuclear transport by binding to importin βs or by regulating transcription through interaction in a complex with co-activator independent of AF-2 function (CIA) and the c-myc gene. Previous biochemical studies indicated that CC3 has protein kinase activity, and a structural similarity to cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was proposed. By contrast, bioinformatics studies suggested a relationship of CC3 to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase family. To clarify details of the CC3 structural family and ligand binding properties, we have determined the crystal structure of CC3 at 1.7-Å resolution. CC3 has a short chain dehydrogenase reductase fold and binding specificity for NADPH, yet it is unlikely to be normally enzymatically active because it is monomeric. These structural results, in conjunction with data from earlier mutagenesis work on the nucleotide binding motif, suggest that NADPH binding is important for the biological activity of CC3, including interaction with importins and with the CIA/c-myc system. CC3 provides an example of the adaptation of a metabolic enzyme fold to include a regulatory role, as also seen in the case of the NADH-binding co-repressor CtBP.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an opposing role to cell division in the homeostatic regulation of animal cell populations. As well as being of significance in development, apoptosis has an important place in the pathogenesis of some disease states. Mutated and deleted pro-apoptotic genes can give rise to carcinogenesis and tumor growth (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 489-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). CC3 (also known as TIP30) is an anti-tumor protein that predisposes cells to apoptosis, thereby giving properties of metastatic suppression (2Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CC3 is an evolutionarily conserved gene ubiquitously expressed as a 27-kDa protein in human tissues. CC3 RNA is absent in variant small cell lung carcinoma cell lines that are derived from tumors with highly aggressive metastatic behavior (2Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Significantly, ectopic expression of CC3 in variant small cell lung carcinoma cells induces expression of a number of apoptosis-related genes including Bad and Siva (3Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and also attenuates metastasis in vivo (2Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that genetically engineered mice deficient in CC3 have a high incidence of liver cancer and that reduced expression of CC3 is also associated with 33% of human hepatocellular carcinomas (4Ito M. Jiang C. Krumm K. Zhang X. Pecha J. Zhao J. Guo Y. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8763-8767PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have been aimed at defining the biochemical properties of CC3, as well as the interactions made with partner proteins that may relate to its pro-apoptotic effects. Recent results have shown that CC3 can bind directly to karyopherins of the importin β family of nuclear transportins in a Ran-GTP-insensitive manner (5King F.W. Shtivelman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7091-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For importin β2, the site of interaction with CC3 involves HEAT domain(s) in the C-terminal third of the protein. Binding of CC3 to importins inhibits the nuclear transport of proteins with either the classical nuclear localization signal or the M9 signal recognized by importin β2. Cells modified to overexpress CC3 have slower rates of nuclear transport and higher sensitivity to death signals. CC3 mutated in the region of a nucleotide binding motif (GXXGXXG, between residues 25 and 31) lacked apoptotic properties and had weakened interactions with importin β2 (5King F.W. Shtivelman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7091-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TIP30 was shown to bind to the N-terminal trans-activation domain of HIV-1 tat, resulting in activation of the HIV-1 promoter. However, in model promoter systems, neither the level of basal transcription nor the level of Gal-VP16- and Gal-SP1-activated transcription was dependent on TIP30, indicating that it is not a general transcription factor. Subsequently, it was realized that CC3 and TIP30 were one and the same protein (7Baker M.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CC3 (TIP30) has been reported to have Ser/Thr protein kinase activity, to undergo autophosphorylation, and to phosphorylate the heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit in a tat-dependent manner (3Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mutating two of the glycine residues in the putative nucleotide binding motif (GXXGXXG) of CC3 abolished the pro-apoptotic effects of the protein and apparently abolished its protein kinase activity. The biological significance of the CC3-tat interaction is unclear, however, because the generally accepted mode of action of tat involves interaction with cyclin T and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (8Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Follow-up studies by the same group aimed at establishing the normal cellular role of CC3 have been reported (9Jiang C. Ito M. Piening V. Bruck K. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27781-27789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CC3 interacts in a complex formed in response to estrogen, consisting of the estrogen receptor α5, the co-activator CIA, and the promoter and downstream regions of the c-myc gene (9Jiang C. Ito M. Piening V. Bruck K. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27781-27789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CC3 overexpression represses estrogen receptor α-mediated c-myc transcription, whereas CC3 deficiency enhances it. Based on these data, it has been proposed that the increased level of c-myc transcription is the mechanism of tumorigenesis associated with low levels of CC3 (9Jiang C. Ito M. Piening V. Bruck K. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27781-27789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The nature of the CC3 protein fold and its consequent implications for ligand binding specificity and likely biochemical properties have, however, been controversial. Bioinformatics studies using hidden Markoff models have indicated a relationship of CC3 to the SDR family, with the closest match to UDP-galactose epimerase (7Baker M.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Follow-up homology modeling studies lead to the prediction of a binding site for NADP or NADPH (10Baker M.E. Yan L. Pear M.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between CC3 and UDP-galactose epimerase at ∼17.5% is, however, lower than the level required to definitively assign a similar protein fold, and thus the relatedness of these two proteins could not be established with certainty. In fact, a higher level of amino acid sequence identity (∼22%) was reported for the alignment of CC3 and Caenorhabditis elegans cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (3Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental Fig. 1B). It was suggested that the GXXGXXG motif in CC3 was responsible for binding ATP, and mutation to GXXVXXA apparently caused loss of protein kinase activity (3Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of CC3 at 1.7-Å resolution, work aimed at determining the protein fold and ligand binding specificity and hence defining the potential functional properties of the protein. Such data will be of value in further biochemical characterization and studies of the mechanism of action of CC3 in apoptosis and tumor suppression. Cloning Expression and Purification of CC3 (TIP30)—The gene encoding CC3 was obtained from the Sanger Centre (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK). The coding sequence for CC3 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression plasmid pET45b, giving rise to a protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. The plasmid was transformed into Rosetta-(DE3)pLysS for protein expression. The cells were grown overnight in a 60-ml LB starter culture supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, with shaking at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted 1:100 into 6 liters of LB (with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol included) and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.7. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the induction was carried out at 30 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm sodium inorganic phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a 5-ml nickel chelating column (Hitrap chelating column; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. CC3 was eluted with buffer A + 500 mm imidazole by a linear gradient. Fractions containing CC3 were applied to a Superdex S-200 gel/filtration column pre-equilibrated in buffer A but without Tween 20. Pure CC3 was concentrated, and buffer was exchanged against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The purification protocol produced, on average, 40 mg of pure CC3. Selenomethionine-labeled CC3 was expressed in the methionine auxotroph strain B834 grown on SelenoMet Medium Base with Nutrient Mix media (Athena Enzyme Systems) and purified using the same protocols as described for the methionine protein. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using a Waters Q-Tof micro mass spectrometer indicated >95% incorporation of selenomethionine. CC3 was shown to be monomeric in solution in the presence of dithiothreitol using dynamic light scattering measured in a Protein Solutions DynaPro. Assessment of Nucleotide Binding to CC3 (TIP30)—The assessment of the binding of potential ligands to CC3 was carried out using a parallelized thermal shift assay with Sypro Orange dye as probe (11Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of CC3 (1 mg/ml), either unliganded or with 0.5 mm added ligand (ATP, ADP, AMPPCP, NAD, NADP, NADH, or NADPH), were heated in a 96-well plate from 25 °C to 90 °C in 1 °C steps. Experiments were repeated with the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescence was monitored for each raised degree with a real-time PCR machine (Chromo4 detector; MJ Research). Crystallization and Data Collection—CC3 at 14 mg/ml was initially screened in crystallization trials with a total of ∼4032 droplets (672 standard conditions consisting of Hampton, Wizard, and Emerald kits for 6 different ligand complexes). The crystallization system developed at the Oxford Protein Production Facility was used for the initial screening phase (12Walter T.S. Diprose J. Brown J. Pickford M. Stuart D.I. Harlos K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 308-314Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A Cartesian Technologies pipetting robot was used to set up nano-crystallizations consisting of 100 nl of protein and 100 nl of reservoir solution mixed as sitting drops in 96-well Greiner plates. Crystallization plates were placed in a TAP Homebase storage vault maintained at 22 °C and imaged via a Veeco visualization system (12Walter T.S. Diprose J. Brown J. Pickford M. Stuart D.I. Harlos K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 308-314Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An initial crystal hit that only yielded very small crystals, even after some optimization, was subjected to an additive screen that indicated that PEG 400 improved crystal size and quality. Further screening with different low molecular weight PEGs revealed that PEG 600 gave dramatically larger crystals of CC3. The optimal conditions for the growth of crystals of the CC3·NADPH complex with dimensions of up to 300 × 130 × 130 μm were as follows: 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.4, and 8% (v/v) PEG 600. X-ray diffraction data for CC3·NADPH crystals were collected to 1.7 Å at station PX14.2, SRS (Daresbury, UK). Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data for selenomethionine-labeled CC3·NADPH crystals were collected to 1.96-Å resolution at beamline BM14, the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Following a fluorescence scan, the peak wavelength was set as 0.97919 Å. Data were also collected at a remote wavelength (λ = 0.90789 Å). Indexing and integration of data images were carried out with HKL2000, and data were merged using SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Following data preparation with SHELXC, SHELXD (14Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) was used to identify selenium sites. The electron density map following SHELXE using just the peak wavelength data was very clear, with “dimples” observable in aromatic rings. Data collection was thus terminated after just two wavelengths. SOLVE/RESOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) were then used for refinement of selenium positions and phase improvement combined with automated model building. The CC3 structure was refined in CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) using positional and B factor refinement. Initially, the selenomethionine CC3 structure was rebuilt from the RESOLVE model and subjected to a single round of refinement before switching to the 1.7-Å resolution native data for further refinement to give the final statistics shown in Table I. Structure Alignments and Protein Docking—The refined coordinates of CC3 were aligned with available protein structures in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). For more detailed comparisons of CC3 with selected protein structures, SHP was used (18Stuart D.I. Levine M. Muirhead H. Stammers D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). CC3 was docked with the C-terminal region of importin β2 using FTDOCK (19Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M.

Co-crystallization Studies with Potential CC3 (TIP30) Ligands—His-tagged CC3 purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration columns was initially used to assess possible ligand specificity. Using a parallelized thermal shift assay, seven potential ligands were screened for binding to CC3. ATP, ADP, AMPPCP, NAD, and NADH at 0.5 mm gave no indication of binding, whereas NADPH gave a significant right shift, and NADP gave an intermediate shift (Fig. 1). The right shifts were observed in either the presence or absence of dithiothreitol. Although efforts were therefore focused on co-crystallization of the putative CC3·NADPH complex, each potential ligand was also tested in our standard set of 672 crystallization conditions. The only CC3 crystals obtained were in the presence of NADPH, again strongly suggesting that it is the preferred ligand for CC3. The original small crystals of CC3 grew significantly larger in the presence of 8% PEG 600, which was identified from two rounds of additive screening. The crystal volume was increased by a factor of ∼50-fold by adding PEG 600. The effect of PEG 600 in improving the crystallization was later rationalized by the identification of a PEG 600 molecule binding in the crystal (Figs. 2b and 3a). A PEG 600 molecule binds between two CC3 monomers (and within 5.5 Å of the NADPH site), which potentially may have a rigidifying effect on the protein.Fig. 2Electron density maps of CC3. a, stereoview of the electron density at 2.0-Å resolution around the NADPH binding site after density modification with RESOLVE. b, stereoview of the simulated annealing omit electron density map at 1.7-Å resolution for the PEG 600 molecule at the end of refinement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Ribbon diagrams showing the overall fold of CC3 and comparison with human biliverdin IXβ reductase (PDB code 1HE2) and porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PDB code 1N5D). a, stereoview of the overall fold of CC3 with the secondary structure labeled.

Refinement of the CC3 structure to 1.7 Å gave an Rwork of 0.167 (Rfree = 0.193) while retaining good stereochemistry (Table I). The CC3 structure is dominated by a dinucleotide (Rossmann) fold largely located in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein. An N-terminal extension from the Rossmann fold consists of residues 1–18, which (apart from the first four amino acids that are disordered) form an α-helix from residues 5–18 (α-1). There is a rather extended region pointing away from the main body of CC3 located within the C-terminal third of the protein, consisting of residues 168–206 inserted between β-6 and α-8 (Fig. 3a). The Rossmann fold structure has a central core running from residues 18–164 and consists of a parallel β-sheet (strands β-1 to β-6) interconnected by α-helices (α-2 to α-6). A seventh helix (α-8) and seventh strand (β-9) are contributed by the C-terminal region. The extended loop region between 168 and 206 contains a helix (α-7) and two parallel β-strands (β-7 and β-8). There is a cavity in the CC3 structure that is the site of NADPH binding. Adjacent to the nucleotide binding site is a bound PEG 600 molecule that is located in the extended region between residues 168 and 206 and shared between two CC3 monomers, related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Figs. 2b and 3a). The contacts of CC3 with the PEG 600 include residues Val169, Leu171, Gln175, Leu183, Val184, Lys186, Phe187, Phe188, Trp195, His199, and Ser200. Electron density for NADPH was clearly identified in an extended conformation in the initial selenomethionine multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion-phased map (Fig. 2a). Refinement at 1.7-Å resolution confirmed that NADPH was well defined with holes visible for each of the aromatic rings in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map, allowing a detailed description of the stereochemistry of the nucleotide interactions with CC3. For the ADP moiety of NADPH, the adenine ring is sandwiched between a cluster of hydrophobic residues (van der Waals contacts with Phe72, Leu92, Val107, and Tyr111) and the side chain of Arg52. Arg52 lies parallel with the plane of the purine ring, making contacts along part of its length (Fig. 4a). The specificity for the 2′-phosphate of NADPH is generated by salt bridge formation with Arg52 and Arg53 as well as via an H-bond to Ser27. The ribose ring oxygen forms an H-bond to the main chain of Gly93. The 3′-hydroxyl H-bonds with the main chain nitrogen of Gly28, as well as with the side chain of Ser27. The NADPH pyrophosphate group has the expected close approach to the tight turn (β-1 to α-2) containing the signature nucleotide binding motif GXXGXXG. The contacts to the cofactor are via main chain hydrogen bonds from residues 29 and 30 with the phosphate groups. The helix dipole of α-2 giving some positive charge at the N-terminal end of the helix may also contribute to the binding of the pyrophosphate group. The nicotinamide ring of NADPH forms main chain H-bond interactions involving the amide group O to the NH group of Leu170 as well as via a water molecule to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu170 (Fig. 4a). The nicotinamide ring of NADPH is in a syn-conformation and forms an internal H-bond from the amide NH2 to the α-phosphate group. Tyr143, which may have catalytic importance, has an interaction with the nicotinamide pyridine nitrogen in a direction approximately normal to the ring. In contrast, the opposite face of the nicotinamide ring is in a much more hydrophobic environment in a pocket lined by Leu130, Pro167, and Leu170. In the crystal, a CC3 dimer is present across a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which leads to an additional interaction with the NADPH pyrophosphate group via Arg178 from the opposing subunit. CC3 Is Related to the SDR Superfamily Rather Than to cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase—DALI searches (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) revealed that the protein structures most closely related to CC3 are members of the SDR family (23Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The highest match was with biliverdin IXβ reductase (20Pereira P.J. Macedo-Ribeiro S.

Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) are among the next most closely related structures. More detailed analyses comparing CC3 with additional SDR homologues in different ligand complexes were carried out with SHP. Biliverdin IXβ reductase and CC3 have 158 equivalent residues with an r.m.s. deviation in α-carbons of 1.8 Å. In contrast, murine cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (26Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar) (closely related to the C. elegans orthologue used in published amino acid sequence alignments) was not within the list of significant matches in DALI. Attempts at overlapping CC3 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit with SHP indicated that the folds of these two proteins are largely unrelated. A structure-based sequence alignment of CC3 with other SDR proteins is shown in supplemental Fig. 1A. For comparison, an alignment of CC3 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit sequences, similar to that described previously (3Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is in supplemental Fig. 1B. Unusually for an SDR-like protein, CC3 does not form a dimer involving the packing of two pairs of helices (including one containing the YXXXK active site motif) related by a 2-fold axis. SDR dimer formation allows correct orientation of the active site residues and thus is normally required for enzymatic activity (21Ghosh D. Sawicki M. Pletnev V. Erman M. Ohno S. Nakajin S. Duax W.L.

Type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKIs) were purified biochemically as a priming factor. PIPKI consists of three domains: the N-terminal region, the central kinase domain, and the C-terminal region. Three isoforms (α, β, and γ) of PIPKI have been identified, and each is alternatively spliced at the C-terminal region. In the present study, we conducted a structure/function analysis of PIPKIs in the priming of exocytosis, and we found that recombinant PIPKIα and PIPKIγ had priming activity. However, an unexpected finding of these results was that PIPKIβ did not prime exocytosis. The N- or C-terminal region of PIPKIα and PIPKIγ was not required for priming, which indicates that the central kinase domain is sufficient for this process. Alternative splicing in each isoform did not affect the isoform specificity in priming. Priming activity by isoforms is strongly correlated with their phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase activity because PIPKIα and PIPKIγ had higher kinase activity than PIPKIβ. These results suggest that PIPKIα and PIPKIγ are the critical priming factors for exocytosis; it also suggests that the levels of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase activity in producing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate specify the function of PIPKI isoforms in priming.

Overexpression of PIPKIα, but not of PIPKIβ, has effects on the endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (24Barbieri M.A. Heath C.M. Peters E.M. Wells A. Davis J.N. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47212-47216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar isoform specificity may exist in PIPKI-mediated priming: Aikawa and Martin (25Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) found that the transfection of PC12 cells with PIPKIα or PIPKIγ, but not with PIPKIβ, reversed the ARF6 transfection-mediated inhibition of priming. However, the authors of that study could not draw a conclusion about this isoform specificity, given that they found that the expression level of transfected PIPKIβ in PC12 cells was lower than it was in other isoforms (25Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is unclear what determines these potential isoform specificities. In this article, we show that bacterially expressed recombinant PIPKIs exhibit priming activity. Using these recombinant PIPKIs, we have addressed the isoform specificity as well as the mechanism that underlies it. We also attempted to determine whether alternative splicing in PIPKIs affects their priming activity, and whether the central kinase domain of PIPKIs is sufficient for the priming of exocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPC12 Secretion Assay—PC12 cells were maintained in 10-cm dishes with 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum (Hyclone), 5% horse serum (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in 9.5% CO2. The secretion assay followed the protocols of previously published work (4Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were labeled for 12–20 h with 4 μl of [3H]norepinephrine (NE; 56.4 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbic acid. After washing, the cells were harvested in KGlu buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm EGTA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, permeabilized with a ball homogenizer (H&Y Enterprise), and incubated for 1–3 h on ice, in the presence of 10 mm EGTA, in order to extract the cytosolic proteins. Two-stage secretion assays were performed in KGlu buffer with 0.05–0.1% bovine serum albumin. Thirty-minute priming incubations at 30 °C contained permeabilized PC12 cells, 2 mm MgATP, and recombinant proteins (or 1.0 mg/ml rat brain cytosol). The cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed with KGlu buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and used for 5-min triggering incubations at 30 °C that contained Ca2+ (1.72 mm; free Ca2+ concentrations are estimated to be ∼1–10 μm) and 0.5 mg/ml rat brain cytosol, which provides the Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion required for triggering (5Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Construction of Expression Plasmids—All the expression plasmids were generated using parental plasmid pGex-KG (9Sugita S.

Expression plasmids for full-length PIPKIs and PIPKIIα are pGex-mPIPKIα-1 (a long form of PIPKIα, made from IMAGE clone 4503697), pGex-mPIPKIα-8 (a short form of PIPKIα generated by PCR on pGex-mPIPKIα-1 based on the sequence information from IMAGE clones 30932032 and 30608358), pGex-mPIPKIβ-3 (a short form of PIPKIβ, made from IMAGE clone 3326897), pGex PIPKIβ-4 (a long form of PIPKIβ, made from IMAGE clone 5289812), pGex-mPIPKIγ-3 (a short form of PIPKIγ, made from IMAGE clone 4459567), pGex-hPIPKIγ-5 (a long form of PIPKIγ, made from clone KIAA 0589), and pGex-mPIP-KIIα-1 (PIPKIIα, made from IMAGE clone 3672732). IMAGE clone 4459567 contained a mutation at residue 12 (S12A), which was corrected by a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). IMAGE clones were purchased from Invitrogen. KIAA 0589 was a kind gift from Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). Expression constructs for truncated PIPKIs include pGex-mPIPKIα-3 (encoding residues 1–439 of PIPKIα, C-terminal truncation), pGex-mPIPKIα-4 (residues 32–439 of PIPKIα, N- and C-terminal truncation), and pGex-mPIPKIγ-2 (residues of 52–635 of PIPKIγ, N-terminal truncation).Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Proteins were expressed in Origami B (DE3) strain (Novagen) or Origami B (DE3) harboring pG-Tf2 (Takara) and purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) (9Sugita S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which in some cases included MgATP washing. Proteins were eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glutathione), and the eluted proteins were then concentrated by centrifugation with Nanosep 30 (Pall Gelman). Concentrated proteins (∼0.2 mg/ml) were dialyzed with KGlu buffer. In some cases, GST fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin (Roche Applied Science) in a cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cleaved proteins were then processed for the secretion assay, similar to the eluted proteins.Kinase Activity Assays—PIP kinase activity was measured in 50-μl reactions, performed for 11 min at room temperature in a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 80 μm phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (Sigma), 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The amounts of recombinant proteins used were 0.4 μg for GST and GST-PIPKIs. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 N HCl, and lipids were then extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). This was followed by further extraction with 80 μl of methanol/1 N HCl (1:1). The extracted lipids were separated using thin layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60; Merck) in chroloform/methanol/15 N NH4OH/distilled H2O (90:90:7:22), and the labeled products were detected by autoradiography (16Ishihara H.

Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As previously described, incubation of the PC12 cell ghosts with brain cytosol and MgATP at the priming stage enhanced Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis at the triggering stage. Omission of either brain cytosol or MgATP during the priming stage resulted in poor Ca2+-dependent exocytosis during the triggering stage (Fig. 1). Incubation with brain cytosol plus MgATP at the priming stage resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in exocytosis at triggering, compared with incubation with MgATP alone at the same stage (Fig. 1) (t10 = 11.3, p < 0.0001). This significant effect provided sufficient resolution to allow us to examine the effect of an individual priming factor.We expressed full-length mouse PIPKIα as a GST fusion protein (GST-mPIPKIα-1) in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was eluted with glutathione and dialyzed with the same buffer (KGlu buffer) used in the secretion assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2A). We questioned whether the recombinant PIPKIα alone (i.e. without brain cytosol) could significantly prime exocytosis. Purified GST-mPIPKIα-1 and MgATP were introduced to permeabilized PC12 cells at the priming stage, and their effects on exocytosis at the triggering stage were examined. Recombinant PIPKIα exhibited dose-dependent priming activity and could prime up to 60% above the control (Fig. 2B), whereas purified GST had no effect. The dose required for priming was similar to the required dose of partially purified native PIPKI from erythrocytes (7Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Andersen R.E. Martin T.F. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), suggesting that recombinant PIPKIα and native PIPKI are similarly active in priming. We were able to conclude that PIPKIα is indeed an important factor for priming and that recombinant PIPKIs are useful tools for the study of the structure/function relationship of PIPKI in priming of neurotransmitter exocytosis.Fig. 2Recombinant PIPKIα primes neurotransmitter exocytosis.A, analysis of purified GST (∼2 μg) and full-length mouse PIPKIα fused with GST (GST-mPIPKIα-1) by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In this gel, the amount of full-length product of GST-PIPKIα-1 was estimated to be ∼2 μg. B, GST-PIPKIα-1 (but not GST) primed NE release. At the priming stage, PC12 cells were incubated with MgATP and the indicated amounts of either GST or GST-mPIPKIα-1. The primed cells were washed and incubated with Ca2+ and brain cytosol to trigger NE release. As a result of incubation with only MgATP during priming, the average NE release was set at 100% for each experiment. Error bars indicate S.E.

In PIPKIγ, the C terminus is alternatively spliced (shown as D in Fig. 3A) (18Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and this splicing regulates binding to the focal adhesion protein, talin (21Di Paolo D. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Vorov S. Chang S. Guo J. Renk M.R. DeCamilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bruce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This binding in turn augments the PIP kinase activity of PIPKIγ. The C terminus of PIPKIβ is similarly spliced (shown as C in Fig. 3A) (17Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, human PIPKIα is alternatively spliced at the region in the immediate proximity of the central kinase domain (shown as A in Fig. 3A). We found a nearly identical splicing in mouse PIPKIα by searching the mouse expressed sequence tag data base (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found a novel splicing site in mouse PIPKIβ (shown as B in Fig. 3A). We compared splicing site A in (human and mouse) PIPKIα and splicing site B in PIPKIβ by aligning the sequences of PIPKIα and PIPKIβ; we found that these two splicing sites exist at similar positions (Fig. 3B). Thus, the region in the immediate proximity of the central kinase domains of both PIPKIα and PIPKIβ is alternatively spliced by a similar mechanism; this finding suggests that there is a functional significance.Fig. 3Analysis of alternative splicing in C-terminal regions of PIPKIs.A, schematic representation of PIPKI isoforms. The sites of alternative splicing (labeled A–D) in C-terminal regions of PIPKIs are underlined. B, sequence alignment of splicing site A in PIPKIα and splicing site B in PIPKIβ. Sequences of human and mouse PIPKIα and PIPKIβ are aligned (h, human; m, mouse). Residues that are identical in at least three sequences are highlighted. The number of the last residue of each PIPKI sequence is indicated on the right. Alternative splicing site A found in human and mouse PIPKIα (Ref. 17Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and this study) and splicing site B found in mouse PIPKIβ in this study are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine isoform specificity in the priming of exocytosis and investigate the role of alternative splicing for this process, we generated a short (i.e. lacking splicing site A) form of PIPKIα, long (i.e. containing splicing site B) and short (i.e. lacking splicing site B) forms of PIPKIβ, and long (i.e. containing splicing site D) and short (i.e. lacking splicing site D) forms of PIPKIγ (Fig. 4, A and B). As a negative control, we generated recombinant PIPKIIα (Fig. 4, A and B) because native PIPKII was previously shown to exhibit no priming activity (7Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Andersen R.E. Martin T.F. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). As expected, recombinant PIPKIIα (GST-mPIPKIIα-1) had no priming activity (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the short form of recombinant PIPKIα (GST-mPIPKIα-8) exhibited significant priming, as did the long form of PIPKIα (GST-mPIPKIα-1) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, both the short (GST-mPIPKIγ-3) and long (GST-hPIPKIγ-5) forms of PIPKIγ exhibited similar priming. Unexpectedly, neither the short (GST-mPIPKIβ-3) nor long (GST-mPIPKIβ-4) form of PIPKIβ exhibited priming activity (Fig. 4C). Thus, alternative splicing in each isoform does not appear to affect the priming of exocytosis. Furthermore, PIPKIα and PIPKIγ, but not PIPKIβ, appear to be the priming factors for exocytosis.Fig. 4PIPKIα and PIPKIγ, but not PIPKIβ or PIPKIIα, prime exocytosis.A, schematic representation of full-length GST fusion PIPKI and PIPKIIα proteins that are expressed and tested for priming of exocytosis. B, analysis of purified GST fusion PIPKIα, PIPKIβ, PIPKIγ, and PIPKIIα proteins by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. C, PIPKIα and PIPKIγ exhibited priming activity, whereas PIPKIβ and PIPKIIα did not. For each experiment, 1–2 μg of GST or GST-PIPKIs or 4 μg of GST-PIPKII was used to prime PC12 cells in the presence of 2 mm MgATP. The data were normalized so that the average of NE release as a result of priming by GST + MgATP (control; denoted by C in the figure) was set to 100% for each experiment. Error bars indicate S.E.

We cleaved GST from both GST-mPIPKIβ-4 and GST-mPIPKIα-1 using thrombin, and then we tested the cleaved PIPKα and PIPKIβ in priming (Fig. 5). Isoform specificity remained because PIPKIα, but not PIPKIβ, was still able to exhibit priming. From this, we concluded that isoform specificity is inherent to PIPKIs and is not solely due to a GST artifact.Fig. 5Isoform specificity remains after the cleavage of GST. GST-cleaved PIPKIα, but not GST-cleaved PIPKIβ, primed NE exocytosis. Error bars indicate S.E.

Previous deletion analysis of PIPKIs has determined the minimal kinase domains of PIPKIs (18Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and all PIPKI isoform kinase domains are located in the central region (Fig. 3A). PIPKIs contain N-terminal and C-terminal regions that may be critical for protein-protein interactions (21Di Paolo D. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Vorov S. Chang S. Guo J. Renk M.R. DeCamilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bruce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), as well as other functions. We suspected that the N-terminal region might contribute to the observed isoform specificity because, as noted above, PIPKIα and PIPKIγ have a longer N-terminal region than PIPKIβ does. To test this possibility, we generated the N-terminal truncation protein of PIPKIγ (Fig. 6A). The truncated PIPKIγ (GST-mPIPKIγ-2) exhibited robust priming that was comparable to the priming of the full-length PIPKIγ (Fig. 6B). We also generated a C-terminal truncation for PIPKIα (Fig. 6A), and we were able to identify strong priming by the truncated PIPKIα (GST-mPIPKIα-3, Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the truncation of both N- and C-terminal regions of PIPKIα (GST-PIPKIα-4) did not reduce priming, indicating that the kinase domain of PIPKIα, and perhaps PIPKIγ as well, is sufficient for priming (Fig. 6C).Fig. 6Central kinase domain of PIPKIα or PIPKIγ is sufficient for priming.A, the schematic representation of truncated proteins of PIPKIα and PIPKIγ. B and C, for comparison, the truncated GST-PIPKIα and GST-PIPKIγ proteins were tested with GST (negative control) and GST full-length PIPKIα or PIPKIγ (positive control). Error bars indicate S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2129298815,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent, proinflammatory cytokine, but local environmental factors in inflamed sites or in sepsis may affect cell metabolism and energetics, including the amplitude and duration of IL-1-induced signals, thereby leading to loss of tissue homeostasis. Currently, the mechanisms by which disruption of cell energetics affects inflammatory signaling are incompletely understood. Here, we examined the impact of cell energetics and mitochondrial function on the regulation of IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals and ERK activation in human gingival fibroblasts, cells that are important targets for IL-1-induced destruction of extracellular matrix in inflamed connective tissues. In untreated cells, IL-1 induced a prolonged increase of free intracellular calcium, which was required for ERK activation. Inhibition of cellular energetics by selective depolarization of mitochondria blocked Ca2+ uptake and almost completely abolished IL-1-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signals and ERK activation. IL-1 caused rapid Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), concomitant with mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake from ER and non-ER stores. Disruption of mitochondrial energetics abrogated IL-1 induced Ca2+ release from the ER but left other vital cellular functions intact. The negative effect of mitochondrial depolarization on ER release was bypassed by BAPTA/AM, indicating that mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering is the key mechanism in regulating ER release. Thus, in gingival fibroblasts, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is essential not only for shaping the kinetics and duration, but also the generation of, IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals. Consequently, mitochondria regulate key downstream effectors of IL-1, including MAP kinases."
