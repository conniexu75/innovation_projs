https://openalex.org/W2085518524,"THE depletion by reserpine of storage in the body of 5-hydroxytryptamine (‘Serotonin’) and of the catechol amines is now well established1–3. In reserpinized animals the peripheral part of the adrenergic system does not function owing to lack of the transmitter2. This is presumably true also of the central part of the adrenergic system. However, it remains to be proved to what extent the central action of reserpine may be attributed to changes in brain catechol amines and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine."

https://openalex.org/W2039004589,"OXYGEN is known to increase the effectiveness of X-rays in killing bacteria1,2 and cells from many other organisms3 by a factor of 2 or 3. There have been numerous reports of substances which protect against the effects of irradiation under aerobic conditions4, but there does not appear to be any report of a substance which, in complete anoxia, raises the radiosensitivity of bacteria to the level normally associated with full aeration. Before giving the evidence which suggests that nitric oxide may be such a substance, we may consider the factors which first directed attention to this gas."

https://openalex.org/W1994527736,"ALTHOUGH the presence of filamentary forms in preparations of influenza virus was first noted in 19461, the finding remained one of academic interest until the demonstration by Chu, Dawson and Elford in 19492 that recently isolated influenza A strains contain a high proportion of filaments. These forms have since been shown to possess many of the biological characteristics of spherical influenza virus particles3,4; but the question of the number of filaments needed to induce infection was not considered until recently. The main contribution in this direction has been the pioneer work of Donald and Isaacs5, who used quantitative counting techniques. They, however, did not claim any differences in the relative infectivity of virus filaments and spheres. Valentine and Isaacs6 have since suggested that, owing to the tendency of filaments to break up during adsorption on red cells, the actual counts of Donald and Isaacs5 are over-estimates of the number of filaments initially present, and hence there is an increased probability that filaments are infectious. In connexion with nucleic acid studies on filaments, we have used a strain of filamentary virus (Ryan) that has a mean ratio of 50 per cent egg infectivity dose/ agglutinating dose of the same order as that given by strains which exist almost exclusively as spheres. Using the counts of Donald and Isaacs5 together with our 50 per cent egg infectivity dose/agglutinating dose value, it can be calculated that, for this strain of virus, fewer filaments than spheres are necessary to induce infection in the embryonated egg."

https://openalex.org/W2056110530,"DURING the past two years, attempts have been made in this laboratory to keep alive in vitro sterile trematodes of the species Haplometra cylindracea (Zeder, 1800) obtained by aseptic dissection from the lungs of frogs (Rana temporaria). Of the 338 frogs dissected to date, 194 were uninfected with this trematode and the remaining 144 frogs provided a total of 576 living flukes. One remarkable frog had 23 flukes in the left lung and 17 in the right lung; but the majority of infected frogs had either two or three flukes in each lung."

https://openalex.org/W2045482785,"A PUZZLING feature of studies on the basis of pathogenicity of Pasteurella pestis is the relationship of the behaviour of the so-called toxin1–4 in guinea pigs to infection in the same host. This toxin is lethal for mice but not for guinea pigs4,5, although the two hosts are equally susceptible to plague1,6. This anomaly led us to consider whether, in plague, guinea pigs are killed by a toxin different from that killing mice, or whether the ‘toxin’ as previously isolated is a degraded form of a native toxin that kills both species. The results described below support the latter view and give a reasonable explanation for the death of guinea pigs from plague."
https://openalex.org/W1966194282,"WE have recently described the effect of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine on acid gastric secretion elicited by histamine in dogs1. Recent experiments with its precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan have shown that this substance is also capable of inhibiting acid secretion. A technique has been used for recording the secretory-rate from a gastric cannula in anæsthetized dogs, as drops per min. on a kymograph. The acid output is expressed as mille equivalents, and is fairly constant after 1 hr. during histamine administered by continuous infusion (Table 1,a)."

https://openalex.org/W1996496540,"NON-HALOPHILIC bacteria which are able to form lævan from sucrose have been described within several genera, for example, Bacillus1, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas2, Streptococcus3, Aerobacter4, as well as Corynebacterium5. However, lævan-forming bacteria occurring among the halophiles offer special interest from the enzymological point of view and, in addition, are of considerable economic importance."
https://openalex.org/W2040466088,"IT has been shown that reserpine influences the anterior1 and the posterior2 lobes of the hypophysis, the thyroid gland3, the adrenal medulla4 and cortex5, and the endocrine cells of the gonads1. In most of the work on this subject, the short-term effects have been investigated. Therefore, we undertook a study in which the effect of prolonged administration was examined."
https://openalex.org/W2066865601,"THE presence of fucose as a constituent sugar in oligosaccharides obtained from human milk was reported by Kuhn1 in 1952. Since that time Kuhn and his associates have characterized four oligosaccharides from this source, in all of which fucose is found: a trisaccharide, fucosido-lactose; two pentasaccharides referred to as lacto-N-fucopentaoses I and II, and a hexasaccharide, lacto-N-difucohexaose; the last three are derivatives of a common, fucose-free parent compound—lacto-N-tetraose2. Montreuil, in a series of communications, has reported the occurrence of compounds probably identical with those analysed by Kuhn, and in addition, a further range of fucose-containing substances of still greater complexity3. He has isolated thirteen sugar compounds, other than lactose, from human milk, all of which contain galactose and glucose and most of them fucose and acetylglucosamine as well."
