https://openalex.org/W3103438630,"Twelve-qubit quantum computing for chemistry Accurate electronic structure calculations are considered one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing that will revolutionize theoretical chemistry and other related fields. Using the Google Sycamore quantum processor, Google AI Quantum and collaborators performed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation of two intermediate-scale chemistry problems: the binding energy of hydrogen chains (as large as H 12 ) and the isomerization mechanism of diazene (see the Perspective by Yuan). The simulations were performed on up to 12 qubits, involving up to 72 two-qubit gates, and show that it is possible to achieve chemical accuracy when VQE is combined with error mitigation strategies. The key building blocks of the proposed VQE algorithm are potentially scalable to larger systems that cannot be simulated classically. Science , this issue p. 1084 ; see also p. 1054"

These immune components often cluster together in the host genomes, leading to expanded defense systems. Taking advantage of the evolutionary modularity of defense systems, Gao et al. bioinformatically predicted defense genes in most available bacterial and archaeal genomes. In addition, they reconstituted the newly identified systems in Escherichia coli and verified their defense functions against specific bacteriophages. In particular, they characterized defense functions for several predicted nucleoside triphosphatases. Science , this issue p. 1077"

https://openalex.org/W3080210124,"An unexpected source of Earth's water The abundances of Earth's chemical elements and their isotopic ratios can indicate which materials formed Earth. Enstatite chondrite (EC) meteorites provide a good isotopic match for many elements but are expected to contain no water because they formed in the hot inner Solar System. This would require Earth's water to be from a different source, such as comets. Piani et al. measured hydrogen contents and deuterium/hydrogen ratios (D/H) in 13 EC meteorites (see the Perspective by Peslier). They found far more hydrogen than is commonly assumed, with D/H close to that of Earth's mantle. Combining these data with cosmochemical models, they show that most of Earth's water could have formed from hydrogen delivered by EC meteorites. Science , this issue p. 1110 ; see also p. 1058"

These are closely related mosquito-borne viruses with about 40% homology within the envelope protein. We know that subsequent dengue infections bring a risk of antibody-dependent disease enhancement. Whereas emphasis has been placed on how prior dengue immunity affects Zika infection, little is known about how prior Zika immunity may affect dengue disease. Katzelnick et al. have been following a well-characterized and established pediatric cohort in Nicaragua who were serially exposed to both flaviviruses in recent years (see the Perspective by Clapham). This study shows not only that a previous history of just one round of dengue is a problem but also that prior Zika immunity creates an increased risk for severe dengue virus sereotype 2 infection. By contrast, multiple infections raise antibodies to protective levels. Science , this issue p. 1123 ; see also p. 1055"
https://openalex.org/W3080403511,"Building niches for multiple microbes Microbial conversion of heterogeneous feedstocks such as lignocellulose into one or more desired products requires assembly of pathways to both break down the inputs and produce the outputs. Shahab et al. assembled a collection of microbes that occupy different spatial niches within a bioreactor and have different metabolic capabilities. In the simplest version of their setup, an aerobic fungus adeptly breaks down cellulose into short sugar chains, an oxygen-tolerant bacterium converts these to lactic acid, and an anaerobic bacterium uses the lactic acid to synthesize the short-chain fatty acid butyric acid. Additional microbes handle limitations in the intermediate stream or divert lactic acid to longer-chain fatty acids, which are potentially more valuable. The integrated production and use of lactic acid for biosynthetic reactions could ideally serve as a platform for biosynthesis using robust, heterogeneous microbial consortia.

https://openalex.org/W3080808978,"The diagnosis of COVID-19 requires integration of clinical and laboratory data. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, >80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection."

Cells are best at navigating complex routes, for which they use “self-generated chemotaxis” and create their own attractant gradients. An example of this is when neutrophils migrate into tissues to attack infection. Using modeling and live-cell data, Tweedy et al. found that self-generated chemotaxis allows cells to obtain surprising amounts of information about their environment. Cells of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and mouse pancreatic cancer–derived cells were able to use the diffusion of attractants to identify the best route through complex mazes, even when the correct path was long and twisted, without ever entering incorrect paths.

https://openalex.org/W3080329859,"The gut microbiota affects tissue physiology, metabolism, and function of both the immune and nervous systems. We found that intrinsic enteric-associated neurons (iEANs) in mice are functionally adapted to the intestinal segment they occupy; ileal and colonic neurons are more responsive to microbial colonization than duodenal neurons. Specifically, a microbially responsive subset of viscerofugal CART + neurons, enriched in the ileum and colon, modulated feeding and glucose metabolism. These CART + neurons send axons to the prevertebral ganglia and are polysynaptically connected to the liver and pancreas. Microbiota depletion led to NLRP6- and caspase 11–dependent loss of CART + neurons and impaired glucose regulation. Hence, iEAN subsets appear to be capable of regulating blood glucose levels independently from the central nervous system."

The key is to find a means of rapidly interconverting the reactants while one of them is being more efficiently funneled to product. DeHovitz et al. report cooperative application of organocatalysis, photoredox catalysis, and enzymatic catalysis to achieve DKR of β-substituted ketones into chiral alcohols.

https://openalex.org/W3080124272,"Neuronal synapses undergo structural and functional changes throughout life, which are essential for nervous system physiology. However, these changes may also perturb the excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission balance and trigger neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Molecular tools to restore this balance are highly desirable. Here, we designed and characterized CPTX, a synthetic synaptic organizer combining structural elements from cerebellin-1 and neuronal pentraxin-1. CPTX can interact with presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors and induced the formation of excitatory synapses both in vitro and in vivo. CPTX restored synaptic functions, motor coordination, spatial and contextual memories, and locomotion in mouse models for cerebellar ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injury, respectively. Thus, CPTX represents a prototype for structure-guided biologics that can efficiently repair or remodel neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3080428800,"The CIITAdel keeps viruses at bay A better understanding of cellular mechanisms involved in viral resistance is needed for the next generation of antiviral therapies. Bruchez et al. used a transposon-mediated gene-activation screen to search for previously unreported host restriction factors for Ebola virus (see the Perspective by Wells and Coyne). The authors found that a transcription factor, major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator (CIITA), induces resistance in human cell lines by directing the expression of the p41 isoform of the invariant chain (CD74). CD74 p41 then disrupts cathepsin-mediated Ebola glycoprotein processing, which prevents viral fusion and entry. CD74 p41 can also stymie the endosomal entry of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This work should inform future treatments against cathepsin-dependent viruses such as filoviruses and coronaviruses. Additionally, the screening strategy used may serve as a blueprint for uncovering resistance mechanisms against other dangerous pathogens. Science , this issue p. 241 see also p. 167"
https://openalex.org/W3080525189,"To continue or to switch strategy? Successful behavior in an uncertain, changing, and open-ended environment critically relies on the ability to decide between continuing with the ongoing strategy or exploring new options. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the human medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the part of the brain that primarily deals with this dilemma. However, the contribution of the different mPFC regions remains largely unknown. Domenech et al. recorded neuronal activity in six epileptic patients with depth electrodes in this brain area (see the Perspective by Steixner-Kumar and Gläscher). The ventral mPFC inferred the reliability of the ongoing action plan according to action outcomes. It proactively flagged outcomes either as learning signals to better exploit this plan or as potential triggers to explore new ones. The dorsal mPFC then evaluated action outcomes and generated an adaptive behavioral strategy. Science , this issue p. eabb0184 ; see also p. 1056"

Raddi et al. collected and sequenced the RNA of more than 8000 individual hemocytes from the disease-carrying mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti . These data were then analyzed to determine hemocyte differentiation lineages and population changes in response to noninfected and Plasmodium -infected blood meals. From these data, the researchers identified a new hemocyte type, the megacyte, defined by the transcription of specific marker genes. Gene-silencing experiments implied that the megacyte functions in hemocyte differentiation during immune priming and thus may be involved in the immune response in mosquitoes.

https://openalex.org/W3080075062,"Exploring the design landscape Protein design typically selects a protein topology and then identifies the geometries (secondary-structure lengths and orientations) that give the most stable structures. A challenge for this approach is that functional sites in natural proteins often adopt nonideal geometries. Pan et al. addressed this issue by exploring the diversity of geometries that can be sampled by a given topology. They developed a computational method called LUCS that systematically samples geometric variation in loop-helix-loop elements and applied it to two different topologies. This method generated families of well-folded proteins that include structures with non-native geometries. The ability to tune protein geometry may enable the custom design of new functions.

https://openalex.org/W3082555894,"Soil sulfur metabolism surprise Soil bacteria have a range of metabolic pathways that contribute to acquiring and recycling nutrients and carbon. Curiously, some of these organisms give off ethylene gas when starved for sulfur under anaerobic conditions. North et al. traced the source of ethylene to a small, sulfur-containing organic molecule produced by certain reactions in cells. Growing cells in sulfur-limiting conditions enabled them to identify the enzymes involved in sulfur salvage, and the concomitant ethylene production, through this pathway. Methane and ethane were also observed as products when appropriate substrates were provided. The key genes involved are distantly related to nitrogenase and several other reductase enzymes found in bacteria and archaea. The involvement of such nitrogenase-like genes in sulfur metabolism highlights the potential of unexplored diversity in this family of enzymes and raises many mechanistic and evolutionary questions that are now ripe for exploration.

https://openalex.org/W3082153094,"Lower-limb wearable robotic devices can improve clinical gait and reduce energetic demand in healthy populations. To help enable real-world use, we sought to examine how assistance should be applied in variable gait conditions and suggest an approach derived from knowledge of human locomotion mechanics to establish a 'roadmap' for wearable robot design. We characterized the changes in joint mechanics during walking and running across a range of incline/decline grades and then provide an analysis that informs the development of lower-limb exoskeletons capable of operating across a range of mechanical demands. We hypothesized that the distribution of limb-joint positive mechanical power would shift to the hip for incline walking and running and that the distribution of limb-joint negative mechanical power would shift to the knee for decline walking and running. Eight subjects (6M,2F) completed five walking (1.25 m s-1) trials at -8.53°, -5.71°, 0°, 5.71°, and 8.53° grade and five running (2.25 m s-1) trials at -5.71°, -2.86°, 0°, 2.86°, and 5.71° grade on a treadmill. We calculated time-varying joint moment and power output for the ankle, knee, and hip. For each gait, we examined how individual limb-joints contributed to total limb positive, negative and net power across grades. For both walking and running, changes in grade caused a redistribution of joint mechanical power generation and absorption. From level to incline walking, the ankle's contribution to limb positive power decreased from 44% on the level to 28% at 8.53° uphill grade (p < 0.0001) while the hip's contribution increased from 27% to 52% (p < 0.0001). In running, regardless of the surface gradient, the ankle was consistently the dominant source of lower-limb positive mechanical power (47-55%). In the context of our results, we outline three distinct use-modes that could be emphasized in future lower-limb exoskeleton designs 1) Energy injection: adding positive work into the gait cycle, 2) Energy extraction: removing negative work from the gait cycle, and 3) Energy transfer: extracting energy in one gait phase and then injecting it in another phase (i.e., regenerative braking)."
https://openalex.org/W3081334669,"Abstract DNA methylation is implicated in the acquisition of malignant phenotypes, and the use of epigenetic modulating drugs is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (decitabine, 5-azadC) is an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor with proven effectiveness against hematological malignancies and more recently triple-negative breast cancer (BC). Herein, genetic or pharmacological studies uncovered a hitherto unknown feedforward molecular link between DNMT1 and the estrogen related receptor α (ERRα), a key transcriptional regulator of cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, DNMT1 promotes ERRα stability which in turn couples DNMT1 transcription with that of the methionine cycle and S-adenosylmethionine synthesis to drive DNA methylation. In vitro and in vivo investigation using a pre-clinical mouse model of BC demonstrated a clear therapeutic advantage for combined administration of the ERRα inhibitor C29 with 5-azadC. A large-scale bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis revealed specific methylation perturbations fostering the discovery that reversal of promoter hypermethylation and consequently derepression of the tumor suppressor gene, IRF4 , is a factor underlying the observed BC suppressive effects. This work thus uncovers a critical role of ERRα in the crosstalk between transcriptional control of metabolism and epigenetics and illustrates the potential for targeting ERRα in combination with DNMT inhibitors for BC treatment and other epigenetics-driven malignancies."

Metallothionein (MT) plays an important role in protecting against heavy metals and oxidative injury, however it may also portend drug resistance and a worse prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the amount of Cu, Zn, Cu/Zn and MT in evaluating a group of patients with HCC, including those treated with lenvatinib.We enrolled 175 patients with HCC (139 men, 36 women; mean age 71.1 years; hepatitis C virus n = 85, hepatitis B virus n = 19, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus n = 2, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis n = 39, alcohol n = 25, others n = 5; Child-Pugh A n = 141, Child-Pugh B n = 30, Child-Pugh C n = 4; Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage 0 n = 38, stage A n = 56, stage B n = 39, stage C n = 38, stage D n = 4). We evaluated the associations between Cu, Zn and MT. The study outcome was liver cancer-specific survival. Moreover, we treated 12 HCC patients with lenvatinib and investigated the changes in MT during lenvatinib therapy.The serum level of Cu was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase and the BCLC stage. The serum level of Zn decreased concordant with liver disease progression. Patients with a Cu/Zn ratio≥0.999 had significantly improved rates of survival when compared to patients with a Cu/Zn ratio<0.999 (45.3 vs. 30.1 months, p<0.001). MT was significantly correlated with the Cu/Zn ratio and increased after the administration of lenvatinib. Using multivariate Cox regression analyses, it was determined that the Cu/Zn ratio (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.442, p = 0.008), alpha-fetoprotein (HR: 1.000, p<0.001) and BCLC stage (HR: 2.087, p<0.001) were independent predictors of survival.The Cu/Zn ratio could serve as a useful predictive marker for survival in cases of HCC. MT levels increased in HCC patients receiving lenvatinib therapy, and maybe a predictor of reduced survival."

Understanding the mechanisms regarding how these factors promote an efficient remyelination is crucial to deciphering the molecular and cellular processes required to promote nerve repair. Schwann cells (SCs) play a central role in the process of peripheral nerve repair/regeneration. Using a model of facial nerve crush injury and repair, we identified Annexin A1 (ANXA1) as the extracellular trigger of SC proliferation and migration. ANXA1 activated formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) receptors and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling cascade, leading to SC proliferation and migration in vitro. SCs lacking FPR2 or AMPK displayed a defect in proliferation and migration. After facial nerve injury (FNI), ANXA1 promoted the proliferation of SCs and nerve regeneration in vivo. Collectively, these data identified the ANXA1/FPR2/AMPK axis as an important pathway in SC proliferation and migration. ANXA1-induced remyelination and SC proliferation promotes FNI regeneration."

However, it has been revealed from the recent empirical studies that little attention is given on grammar learning with the proper instructional materials design and the motivational framework for designing an efficient mobile-assisted grammar learning tool. This paper hence, reports a preliminary study that investigated learner motivation when a mobile-assisted tool for tense learning was used. This study applied the Attention-Relevance-Confidence-Satisfaction (ARCS) model. It was hypothesized that with the use of the designed mobile- assisted tense learning tool students would be motivated to learn grammar (English tense). In addition, with the increase of motivation, performance outcome in paper- based test would also be improved. With the purpose to investigate the impact of the tool, a sequential mixed-method research design was employed with the use of three research instruments; Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS), a paper-based test and an interview protocol using a semi-structured interview. Participants were 115 undergraduate students, who were enrolled in a remedial English course. The findings showed that with the effective design of instructional materials, students were motivated to learn grammar, where they were positive at improving their attitude towards learning (male 86%, female 80%). The IMMS findings revealed that students’ motivation increased after using the tool. Moreover, students improved their performance level that was revealed from the outcome of paper-based instrument. Therefore, it is confirmed that the study contributed to designing an effective multimedia based instructions for a mobile-assisted tool that increased learners’ motivational attitude which resulted in an improved learning performance."

https://openalex.org/W3082033145,"Exercise exerts a beneficial effect on the major pathological and clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease in humans and mouse models of the disease. While numerous mechanisms for such benefits from exercise have been proposed, a clear understanding of the causal links remains elusive. Recent studies also suggest that cerebral blood flow in the brain of both Alzheimer’s patients and mouse models of the disease is decreased and that the cognitive symptoms can be improved when blood flow is restored. We therefore hypothesized that the mitigating effect of exercise on the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease may be mediated through an increase in the otherwise reduced brain blood flow. To test this idea, we performed a pilot study to examine the impact of three months of voluntary wheel running in a small cohort of ~1-year-old APP/PS1 mice on short-term memory function, brain inflammation, amyloid deposition, and baseline cerebral blood flow. Our findings that exercise led to a trend toward improved spatial short-term memory, reduced brain inflammation, markedly increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and a reduction in hippocampal amyloid-beta deposits are consistent with other reports on the impact of exercise on the progression of Alzheimer’s related symptoms in mouse models. Notably, we did not observe any impact of wheel running on overall baseline blood flow nor on the incidence of non-flowing capillaries, a mechanism we recently identified as one contributing factor to cerebral blood flow deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, our findings add to the emerging picture of differential effects of exercise on cognition and blood flow in Alzheimer’s disease pathology by showing that capillary stalling is not decreased following exercise."

No effective medical treatment exists so far. We aimed to test whether intraluminal admission of Penta-Galloyl Glucose (PGG) treatment in a rodent AAA model could hold the potential to inhibit aneurysmal progression.Male Sprague Dawley rats had either intraluminal elastase infused for AAA induction or saline to serve as controls. In two independent experimental series, elastase was used to induce AAA followed by an intraluminal PGG (directly or by a drug eluting balloon) treatment. All rats were followed for 28 days and euthanized. In both series, maximal infrarenal aortic diameter was measured at baseline and at termination as a measure of AAA size. In series 2, maximal internally AAA diameter was followed by ultrasound weekly. AAA tissues were analyzed for elastin integrity by millers stain, collagen deposition by masson trichrome staining. In other AAA tissue samples the mRNA level of CD45, lysyloxidase (LOX), lysyloxidase like protein 1 (LOXL1) were determined by qPCR.Direct administration of PGG significantly reduced AAA expansion when compared to controls. PGG treatment resulted in a higher number and more preserved elastic fibers in the aneurysmal wall, while no significant difference was seen in the levels of CD45 and LOX mRNA levels. The drug eluting balloon (DEB) experiment showed no significant difference in AAA size observed neither macroscopically nor ultrasonically. Also the aneurysmal mRNA levels of CD45, LOX and LOXL1 were unchanged between groups.A significant reduced expansion of AAAs was observed in the PGG group, suggesting PGG as a drug to inhibit aneurysmal progression, while administration through a DEB did not show a promising new way of administration."

https://openalex.org/W3081693237,"In a serverless cloud computing environment, the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of resources whereas the developers purely focus on their applications. The data-driven applications in serverless cloud computing mainly address the web as well as other distributed scenarios, and therefore, it is essential to offer a consistent user experience across different connection types. In order to address the issues of data-driven application in a real-time distributed environment, the use of GraphQL (Graph Query Language) is getting more and more popularity in state-of-the-art cloud computing approaches. However, the existing solutions target the low level implementation of GraphQL, for the development of a complex data-driven application, which may lead to several errors and involve a significant amount of development efforts due to various users’ requirements in real-time. Therefore, it is critical to simplify the development process of data-driven applications in a serverless cloud computing environment. Consequently, this research introduces UMLPDA (Unified Modeling Language Profile for Data-driven Applications), which adopts the concepts of UML-based Model-driven Architectures to model the frontend as well as the backend requirements for data-driven applications developed at a higher abstraction level. Particularly, a modeling approach is proposed to resolve the development complexities such as data communication and synchronization. Subsequently, a complete open source transformation engine is developed using a Model-to-Text approach to automatically generate the frontend as well as backend low level implementations of Angular2 and GraphQL respectively. The validation of proposed work is performed with three different case studies, deployed on Amazon Web Services platform. The results show that the proposed framework enables to develop the data-driven applications with simplicity."
https://openalex.org/W3081704350,"The antimalarial agents artemisinins inhibit cytomegalovirus (CMV) in vitro and in vivo, but their target(s) has been elusive. Using a biotin-labeled artemisinin, we identified the intermediate filament protein vimentin as an artemisinin target, validated by detailed biochemical and biological assays. We provide insights into the dynamic and unique modulation of vimentin, depending on the stage of human CMV (HCMV) replication. In vitro, HCMV entry and viral progeny are reduced in vimentin-deficient fibroblasts, compared with control cells. Similarly, mouse CMV (MCMV) replication in vimentin knockout mice is significantly reduced compared with controls in vivo, confirming the requirement of vimentin for establishment of infection. Early after HCMV infection of human foreskin fibroblasts vimentin level is stable, but as infection proceeds, vimentin is destabilized, concurrent with its phosphorylation and virus-induced calpain activity. Intriguingly, in vimentin-overexpressing cells, HCMV infection is reduced compared with control cells. Binding of artesunate, an artemisinin monomer, to vimentin prevents virus-induced vimentin degradation, decreasing vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-55 and Ser-83 and resisting calpain digestion. In vimentin-deficient fibroblasts, the anti-HCMV activity of artesunate is reduced compared with controls. In summary, an intact and stable vimentin network is important for the initiation of HCMV replication but hinders its completion. Artesunate binding to vimentin early during infection stabilizes it and antagonizes subsequent HCMV-mediated vimentin destabilization, thus suppressing HCMV replication. Our target discovery should enable the identification of vimentin-binding sites and compound moieties for binding."

https://openalex.org/W3080155380,"Strategies to increase energy expenditure are an attractive approach to reduce excess fat storage and body weight to improve metabolic health. In mammals, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in brown and beige adipocytes uncouples fatty acid oxidation from ATP generation in mitochondria and promotes energy dissipation as heat. We set out to identify small molecules that enhance UCP1 levels and activity using a high-throughput screen of nearly 12,000 compounds in mouse brown adipocytes. We identified a family of compounds that increase Ucp1 expression and mitochondrial activity (including un-coupled respiration) in mouse brown adipocytes and human brown and white adipocytes. The mechanism of action may be through compound binding to A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 1, modulating its localization to mitochondria and its interaction with protein kinase A (PKA), a known node in the β-adrenergic signaling pathway. In mice, the hit compound increased body temperature, UCP1 protein levels, and thermogenic gene expression. Some of the compound effects on mitochondrial function were UCP1- or AKAP1-independent, suggesting compound effects on multiple nodes of energy regulation. Overall, our results highlight a role for AKAP1 in thermogenesis, uncoupled respiration, and regulation energy balance."

Superficially these inclusions are similar to those formed by polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded Huntingtin exon 1 (Httex1) in Huntington’s disease. Both have been reported to form an amyloid-like structure suggesting they might aggregate via similar mechanisms and therefore recruit the same repertoire of endogenous proteins. When co-expressed in the same cell, polyGA101 and Httex1(Q97) inclusions adopted immiscible phases suggesting different endogenous proteins would be enriched. Proteomic analyses identified 822 proteins in the inclusions. Only 7 were specific to polyGA and 4 specific to Httex1(Q97). Quantitation demonstrated distinct enrichment patterns for the proteins not specific to each inclusion type (up to ~8-fold normalized to total mass). The proteasome, microtubules, TriC chaperones, and translational machinery were enriched in polyGA aggregates, whereas Dnaj chaperones, nuclear envelope and RNA splicing proteins were enriched in Httex1(Q97) aggregates. Both structures revealed a collection of folding and degradation machinery including proteins in the Httex1(Q97) aggregates that are risk factors for other neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation when mutated, which suggests a convergence point in the pathomechanisms of these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3081226976,"Activated protein C is a trypsin-like protease with anticoagulant and cytoprotective properties that is generated by thrombin from the zymogen precursor protein C in a reaction greatly accelerated by the cofactor thrombomodulin. The molecular details of this activation remain elusive due to the lack of structural information. We now fill this gap by providing information on the overall structural organization of these proteins using single molecule FRET and small angle X-ray scattering. Under physiological conditions, both zymogen and protease adopt a conformation with all domains vertically aligned along an axis 76 Å long and maximal particle size of 120 Å. This conformation is stabilized by binding of Ca2+ to the Gla domain and is affected minimally by interaction with thrombin. Hence, the zymogen protein C likely interacts with the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex through a rigid body association that produces a protease with essentially the same structural architecture. This scenario stands in contrast to an analogous reaction in the coagulation cascade where conversion of the zymogen prothrombin to the protease meizothrombin by the prothrombinase complex is linked to a large conformational transition of the entire protein. The presence of rigid epidermal growth factor domains in protein C as opposed to kringles in prothrombin likely accounts for the different conformational plasticity of the two zymogens.

The new structural features reported here for protein C have general relevance to vitamin K-dependent clotting factors containing epidermal growth factor domains, such as factors VII, IX, and X. Protein C is a glycoprotein with modular architecture similar to that of other vitamin K-dependent factors of the blood coagulation cascade, i.e. prothrombin, factors VII, IX, and X (1Stenflo J.

Synthesis of protein C in the liver produces a zymogen form of 419 amino acids comprising the N-terminal Gla domain (residues 1-46), two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (residues 55-90 and 96-136), and a C-terminal trypsin-like domain (residues 170-419). Three linker regions connect the Gla domain to EGF1 (residues 47-54), the two EGF domains (residues 91-95) and EGF2 to the protease domain (residues 137-169). This last segment contains the activation peptide (residues 158-169) and the dipeptide sequence Lys156–Arg157 that is removed during synthesis to produce a two-chain zymogen where the light chain (residues 1-155) and heavy chain (residues 158-419) remain connected through a disulfide bond between Cys141 and Cys277 (Fig. 1A). It is in this two-chain form that 90% of protein C circulates in the plasma, with the rest being slightly modified but functionally equivalent (2Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Tryptophans 231 and 234 in protein C report the Ca2+-dependent conformational change required for activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7547963): 12221-1222610.1021/bi00038a016Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein C is activated by thrombin upon cleavage at Arg169, resulting in removal of the entire activation peptide and folding of the active site and primary specificity pocket as in other members of the trypsin family (3Page M.J.

Activated protein C (APC) inactivates cofactors Va and VIIIa with the assistance of protein S, down-regulates the amplification and progression of the coagulation cascade, and maintains patency of the capillaries (4Esmon C.T.

Of particular importance is establishing whether any conformational change in protein C involves the site of activation around Arg169, which is thought to become exposed upon binding to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (16Pozzi N.

Furthermore, it is of interest to establish if protein C has intrinsic conformational plasticity as recently observed in prothrombin, where an equilibrium between open and closed forms (17Chinnaraj M.

The closed form features an intramolecular collapse of kringle-1 onto the protease domain and promotes activation along the meizothrombin pathway (cleavage at Arg320), whereas in the open form the collapse is removed and activation proceeds along the alternative prethrombin-2 pathway (cleavage at Arg271). In this study, we use single molecule FRET (smFRET) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to probe the structural architecture of the zymogen protein C and the protease APC. We find that both proteins assume a nearly identical conformation in solution, with the constitutive domains vertically stacked in a linear arrangement that does not change significantly upon binding of thrombin. smFRET measurements with protein C and APC labeled with the AF555/AF647 FRET pair at positions C12/C312 across the Gla and protease domains (Fig. 1A) were carried out to evaluate the overall conformational properties of the two proteins. Labeling had no adverse effect on the thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C, indicating lack of structural perturbations affecting function (Fig. 1B). No perturbation was also detected for APC as established from the catalytic activity of the labeled protein compared with the unlabeled protein (Fig. 1C). smFRET measurements reveal an interprobe distance between the FRET pair that does not change between the zymogen protein C and protease APC. FRET efficiency histograms are consistent with a single population of labeled species with low FRET efficiency and an interprobe distance of 76 Å (Fig. 2, A and B). A very small population of labeled species at high FRET efficiency (E > 0.9) is also notable in the histogram of APC, but due to experimental uncertainties this population was not considered in subsequent analysis. Our results indicate that the overall architecture of protein C does not change significantly during conversion to APC, thereby establishing another significant difference with the behavior recently reported for prothrombin where activation to meizothrombin is linked to transition from a dominant closed form to the elongated open form (17Chinnaraj M.

The conclusion is supported by SAXS measurements that reveal envelopes of protein C and APC with identical maximal particle size (Dmax) values of 120 Å (Fig. 3, A–C).Figure 3SAXS measurements of protein C and APC.

Chelation of the divalent metal with EDTA produces significant broadening of the FRET histograms and a shift toward higher efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B). The EDTA-derived histograms are best interpreted with a double Gaussian distribution, yielding peaks with efficiencies of 0.21 and 0.5. Because broadening of the histograms often results from dynamics on the millisecond time scale that occur during diffusion of the molecules through the confocal volume, we performed burst variance analysis (BVA) to establish whether EDTA has an effect on the conformational flexibility of protein C and APC. BVA tests for dynamics in the millisecond time scale by comparing the expected shot noise-limited standard deviation for a given mean efficiency and the experimentally observed standard deviation (22Torella J.P. Holden S.J. Santoso Y. Hohlbein J. Kapanidis A.N. Identifying molecular dynamics in single-molecule FRET experiments with burst variance analysis.Biophys. J. 2011; 100 (21402040): 1568-157710.1016/j.bpj.2011.01.066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When molecules experience significant dynamic fluctuations as they transit through the confocal volume, their FRET efficiencies are characterized by an increased standard deviation from that predicted by short noise only (22Torella J.P. Holden S.J. Santoso Y. Hohlbein J. Kapanidis A.N. Identifying molecular dynamics in single-molecule FRET experiments with burst variance analysis.Biophys.

There are no significant conformational rearrangements on the millisecond time scale when Ca2+ is present and the main population with FRET efficiency of about 0.1 displays observed standard deviation that closely matches the predicted one (Fig. 4, A and D). In contrast, variations above the predicted standard deviation are noted in the presence of EDTA, especially for molecules with FRET efficiencies in the 0.22-0.6 range (Fig. 4, B and E). Chelation of Ca2+ increases the conformational flexibility of the Gla domain, resulting in conformational transitions in the millisencond time scale. Because protein C undergoes conformational changes as it transits through the confocal volume in the presence of EDTA, the values of 0.21 and 0.5 calculated from the double Gaussian distribution represent apparent rather than true transfer efficiencies (Fig. 2). The observation that Ca2+ stabilizes the conformation of the Gla domain is in agreement with results reported by others (23Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J.

Castellino F.J. Calcium and phospholipid binding properties of synthetic γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing peptides with sequence counterparts in human protein C.Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (8142347): 3501-350810.1021/bi00178a006Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Specifically, the far-UV CD spectrum of the isolated Gla domain of protein C is characterized by a significant loss of helical content and increased percentage of random coil elements in the absence of Ca2+ (23Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Calcium and phospholipid binding properties of synthetic γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing peptides with sequence counterparts in human protein C.Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (8142347): 3501-350810.1021/bi00178a006Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The smFRET data suggest that binding of Ca2+ to the Gla domain of protein C contributes to the structural integrity of this domain and stabilizes the overall linear arrangement of the entire protein. smFRET measurements were also used to monitor changes in the conformational properties of protein C during its interaction with thrombin, used as the catalytically inactive mutant S195A to prevent hydrolysis. Binding of thrombin to protein C was confirmed by independent measurements using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (data not shown). When measurements are carried out in the presence of Ca2+, the low FRET distribution of protein C remained largely unaffected (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the overall conformation of protein C is already optimized for binding to thrombin and possibly to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Binding of thrombin in the absence of Ca2+ causes protein C to assume a conformation similar to the one in the presence of cation (Fig. 2A). The same effect is observed when thrombin binds to APC (Fig. 2B). BVA plots reveal that the thrombin-bound conformations of protein C and APC, characterized by FRET efficiencies of ∼0.1, display observed standard deviations that map within the upper-limit of the confidence interval of the expected standard deviation (Fig. 4, C and F). We conclude that thrombin dampens the conformational fluctuations of protein C observed in the presence of EDTA. However, a small fraction of molecules with FRET efficiencies >0.2 may still undergo conformational fluctuations as they diffuse through the confocal volume (Fig. 4, C and F). Titration of the shift in the FRET distribution measured in the presence of EDTA allows for quantitative measurements of the interaction with thrombin and yields comparable Kd values of 0.9 ± 0.2 μm for protein C and 1.1 ± 0.2 μm for APC (Fig. 2, C and D). Thrombin does not show significant binding preference for the zymogen over the protease. The result is in agreement with previous findings (24Hogg P.J. Ohlin A.K. Stenflo J.

The role of the activation peptide is to control the interaction kinetically (31Xu H. Bush L.A. Pineda A.O. Caccia S. Di Cera E.

Much of this effect is due to caging of Arg169 by the acidic residues in the activation peptide (16Pozzi N. Barranco-Medina S. Chen Z. Di Cera E.

Acrylamide quenching studies were performed to establish if accessibility of aromatic groups in protein C changes during activation to APC. A graphical representation of the dynamic quenching constant (Equation 1) obtained from analysis of the Stern-Volmer plot is shown in Fig. 5, A and B. The KSV value for protein C is significantly lower than that of APC in the presence of Ca2+, showing that activation is linked to increased accessibility of aromatic groups. The higher KSV value is not due to a more accessible active site in APC because it does not change in the presence of the irreversible active site inhibitor PPACK. A significantly higher value of KSV is also observed in the presence of EDTA for protein C but not APC, suggesting that Ca2+ restricts the accessibility of aromatic residues to acrylamide in the zymogen but not the protease. The effect may be due at least in part to the presence of the activation peptide, whose conformation is known to be influenced by the binding of Ca2+ (34Yang L. Prasad S. Di Cera E. Rezaie A.R.

Upon excitation at 375 nm, the emission spectrum of free 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid (ANS) is characterized by a maximum at 520 nm (Fig. 6, A and C). In the presence of protein C, the maximum of ANS is blue-shifted to 513 nm, resulting in a difference of 7 nm relative to the free probe. A more pronounced blue shift of about 15 nm is observed when ANS reacts with APC (Fig. 6, A and C), showing that the level of solvent-accessible hydrophobic clusters increases when the zymogen converts to the mature protease. Again, the increased reactivity of APC with ANS binding to the active site is ruled out by measurements in the presence of PPACK. The level of exposed hydrophobic clusters does not change in the presence of EDTA, for both protein C and APC (Fig. 6, B and C). A combination of smFRET and SAXS measurements shows that activation of protein C is not linked to significant changes in the overall structural architecture of the protein. Protein C and APC feature nearly identical SAXS envelopes (Dmax ∼ 120 Å) and interprobe distances for the C12/C312 FRET pair (76 Å) across the Gla and protease domains. The relative arrangement of the auxiliary Gla and EGF domains does not change during the conversion of protein C to APC, in contrast to the conversion of prothrombin to meizothrombin that is accompanied by a drastic relocation of kringle-1, which removes the intramolecular interaction with the protease domain (17Chinnaraj M.

https://openalex.org/W3081591010,"High altitude pregnancy is associated with increased frequency of low birth weight infants and neonatal complications, the risks of which are higher in women of low-altitude ancestry. Does ancestry also influence the risk of miscarriage (pregnancy loss <20 weeks) in high-altitude pregnancy? To answer this, 5386 women from La Paz, Bolivia (3300-4150 m) with ≥1 live-born infant were identified. Data were extracted from medical records including maternal and paternal ancestry, demographic factors, and reproductive history. The risk of miscarriage by ancestry was assessed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for parity, and maternal age. Andean women experienced first live-births younger than Mestizo or European women (21.7 ± 4.6 vs 23.4 ± 8.0 vs 24.1 ± 5.1, P < .001). Andeans experienced more pregnancies per year of reproductive life (P < .001) and had significantly higher ratios of live-births to miscarriages than women of Mestizo or European ancestry (P < .001). Andean women were 24% less likely to have ever experienced a miscarriage compared to European women (OR:0.76; CI:0.62-0.90, P < .001). The woman's partner's ancestry wasn't a significant independent predictor of miscarriage. In conclusion, the risk of miscarriage at high altitude is lower in Andean women. The lack of a paternal ancestry effect suggests underlying mechanisms relate more to differential maternal adaptation in early pregnancy than fetal genetics."
https://openalex.org/W3082729461,"Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a global disease caused by the inability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete adequate insulin. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in T2D remains unknown. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of UDP-glucose (UDP-G), a P2Y14-specific agonist, in the regulation of insulin release using human isolated pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. P2Y14 was expressed in both human and rodent pancreatic β-cells. Dose-dependent activation of P2Y14 by UDP-G suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and knockdown of P2Y14 abolished the UDP-G effect. 12-h pretreatment of human islets with pertussis-toxin (PTX) improved GSIS and prevented the inhibitory effect of UDP-G on GSIS. UDP-G on GSIS suppression was associated with suppression of cAMP in INS-1 cells. UDP-G decreased the reductive capacity of nondiabetic human islets cultured at 5 mm glucose for 72 h and exacerbated the negative effect of 20 mm glucose on the cell viability during culture period. T2D donor islets displayed a lower reductive capacity when cultured at 5 mm glucose for 72 h that was further decreased in the presence of 20 mm glucose and UDP-G. Presence of a nonmetabolizable cAMP analog during culture period counteracted the effect of glucose and UDP-G. Islet cultures at 20 mm glucose increased apoptosis, which was further amplified when UDP-G was present. UDP-G modulated glucose-induced proliferation of INS-1 cells. The data provide intriguing evidence for P2Y14 and UDP-G's role in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W3081626170,"The effective treatment of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection has been limited and required novel potential agents. Due to the novel drug development crisis, using old antimicrobial agents and combination therapy have been highlighted. This study focused on fosfomycin which inhibits cell wall synthesis and has potential activity on Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated fosfomycin activity against carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and characterized fosfomycin resistance mechanisms. Fosfomycin revealed effective activity against only 31.8% of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. The major resistance mechanism was FosA3 production. The co-occurrence of FosA3 overexpression with the mutation of glpT (or loss of glpT) and/or uhpT was mediated high-level resistance (MIC>256 mg/L) to fosfomycin. Moreover, fosA3 silenced in sixteen fosfomycin-susceptible isolates and the plasmid carrying fosA3 of these isolates increased 32- to 64-fold of fosfomycin MICs in Escherichia coli DH5α transformants. The in vitro activity of fosfomycin combination with amikacin by checkerboard assay showed synergism and no interaction in six (16.2%) and sixteen isolates (43.3%), respectively. No antagonism of fosfomycin and amikacin was observed. Notably, the silence of aac (6)’-Ib and aphA6 was observed in amikacin-susceptible isolates. Our study suggests that the combination of fosfomycin and amikacin may be insufficient for the treatment of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates."
https://openalex.org/W3081977725,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes and is associated with high risk for cardiovascular mortality, which is partially related to elevated platelet activity. Platelets are also active players in inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we examine the effect of ticagrelor-induced platelet inhibition on the development of DN. DN was induced by unilateral nephrectomy followed by streptozotocin injections for 5 days. Mice received ticagrelor (300 mg/kg) or vehicle every other day, for 16 weeks. Experimental groups: non-diabetic control, diabetic control, non-diabetic ticagrelor, and diabetic ticagrelor. Ticagrelor treatment in diabetic mice lowered urinary albumin excretion, it prevented diabetes-induced mesangial matrix expansion, podocyte effacement, and glomerular endothelial cell injury, which includes loss of endothelial fenestrations, ICAM-1 expression, and PECAM expression. In addition, ticagrelor treatment prevented collagen IV deposition and macrophage infiltration in the tubulointerstitium and these diabetic mice showed lower systemic and tubular inflammation and tubular apoptosis. This tubular protection is likely to be a result of protection to the glomerular endothelium by ticagrelor, which reduces albuminuria and albumin toxicity to the tubules and reduced tubular and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. In conclusion, ticagrelor-induced platelet inhibition protects against renal injury in diabetic mice, likely by protecting the glomerular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3082042666,"Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 x 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = -8.4 to 0.1°C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall–likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sørensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance—patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-related pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization."
https://openalex.org/W3082058479,"Health advances are contingent on continuous development of new methods and approaches to foster data-driven discovery in the biomedical and clinical sciences. Open-science and team-based scientific discovery offer hope for tackling some of the difficult challenges associated with managing, modeling, and interpreting of large, complex, and multisource data. Translating raw observations into useful information and actionable knowledge depends on effective domain-independent reproducibility, area-specific replicability, data curation, analysis protocols, organization, management and sharing of health-related digital objects. This study expands the functionality and utility of an ensemble semi-supervised machine learning technique called Compressive Big Data Analytics (CBDA). Applied to high-dimensional data, CBDA (1) identifies salient features and key biomarkers enabling reliable and reproducible forecasting of binary, multinomial and continuous outcomes (i.e., feature mining); and (2) suggests the most accurate algorithms/models for predictive analytics of the observed data (i.e., model mining). The method relies on iterative subsampling, combines function optimization and statistical inference, and generates ensemble predictions for observed univariate outcomes. The novelty of this study is highlighted by a new and expanded set of CBDA features including (1) efficiently handling extremely large datasets (>100,000 cases and >1,000 features); (2) generalizing the internal and external validation steps; (3) expanding the set of base-learners for joint ensemble prediction; (4) introducing an automated selection of CBDA specifications; and (5) providing mechanisms to assess CBDA convergence, evaluate the prediction accuracy, and measure result consistency. To ground the mathematical model and the corresponding computational algorithm, CBDA 2.0 validation utilizes synthetic datasets as well as a population-wide census-like study. Specifically, an empirical validation of the CBDA technique is based on a translational health research using a large-scale clinical study (UK Biobank), which includes imaging, cognitive, and clinical assessment data. The UK Biobank archive presents several difficult challenges related to the aggregation, harmonization, modeling, and interrogation of the information. These problems are related to the complex longitudinal structure, variable heterogeneity, feature multicollinearity, incongruency, and missingness, as well as violations of classical parametric assumptions. Our results show the scalability, efficiency, and usability of CBDA to interrogate complex data into structural information leading to derived knowledge and translational action. Applying CBDA 2.0 to the UK Biobank case-study allows predicting various outcomes of interest, e.g., mood disorders and irritability, and suggests new and exciting avenues of evidence-based research in the context of identifying, tracking, and treating mental health and aging-related diseases. Following open-science principles, we share the entire end-to-end protocol, source-code, and results. This facilitates independent validation, result reproducibility, and team-based collaborative discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3082140433,"The E6 protein of both mucosal high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as HPV-16, which have been causally associated with malignant tumors, and low-risk HPVs such as HPV-11, which cause the development of benign tumors, interacts with the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP). This indicates that both HPV types employ E6AP to organize the cellular proteome to viral needs. However, whereas several substrate proteins of the high-risk E6-E6AP complex are known, e.g. the tumor suppressor p53, potential substrates of the low-risk E6-E6AP complex remain largely elusive. Here, we report on an affinity-based enrichment approach that enables the targeted identification of potential substrate proteins of the different E6-E6AP complexes by a combination of E3-selective ubiquitination in whole-cell extracts and high-resolution MS. The basis for the selectivity of this approach is the use of a ubiquitin variant that is efficiently used by the E6-E6AP complexes for ubiquitination but not by E6AP alone. By this approach, we identified ∼190 potential substrate proteins for low-risk HPV-11 E6 and high-risk HPV-16 E6. Moreover, subsequent validation experiments in vitro and within cells with selected substrate proteins demonstrate the potential of our approach. In conclusion, our data represent a reliable repository for potential substrates of the HPV-16 and HPV-11 E6 proteins in complex with E6AP."
https://openalex.org/W3082540132,"Epidermal lineages and injury induced regeneration are controlled by transcriptional programs coordinating cellular signaling and epigenetic regulators, but the mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies showed that conditional deletion of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator 1 (Med1) changes epidermal lineages and accelerates wound re-epithelialization. Here, we studied a molecular mechanism by which Med1 facilitates these processes, in particular, by focusing on TGFβ signaling through genome wide transcriptome analysis. The expression of the TGF ligands (Tgfβ1/β2) and their downstream target genes is decreased in both normal and wounded Med1 null skin. Med1 silencing in cultured keratinocytes likewise reduces the expression of the ligands (TGFβ1/β2) and diminishes activity of TGFβ signaling as shown by decreased p-Smad2/3. Silencing Med1 increases keratinocyte proliferation and migration in vitro. Epigenetic studies using chromatin immuno-precipitation and next generation DNA sequencing reveals that Med1 regulates transcription of TGFβ components by forming large clusters of enhancers called super-enhancers at the regulatory regions of the TGFβ ligand and SMAD3 genes. These results demonstrate that Med1 is required for the maintenance of the TGFβ signaling pathway. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of TGFβ signaling enhances epidermal lineages and accelerates wound re-epithelialization in skin similar to that seen in the Med1 null mice, providing new insights into epidermal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3082698669,"Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are involved in various cardiovascular pathologies and play remarkable roles in communication between endothelial cells (ECs), which are constantly exposed to mechanical cyclic stretch (CS) following blood pressure. However, the roles of EMPs induced by CS in EC homeostasis are still unclear. Both fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and western blotting revealed the activation of Src in ECs was significantly increased by 5% CS-induced EMPs. Furthermore, proteomic analysis revealed that the contents were obvious different in the EMPs between 5%- and 15%-group. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, CD151 on EMPs was predicted to activate Src, which was further confirmed by both FRET and western blotting. Moreover, the expression of CD151 on EMPs was significantly increased by 5% CS and involved in the binding of EMPs to ECs. EC apoptosis, which was significantly decreased by 5% CS-derived EMPs, showed obvious increase after pretreatment with Src inhibitor in target ECs. Our present research suggests that mechanical stretch changes the components of EMPs, which in turn modulates EC apoptosis by Src activation. CD151 expressed on CS-induced EMPs may play important roles in EC communication and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3082752470,"In the age of machine learning, building programs that take advantage of the speed and specificity of algorithm development can greatly aid efforts to quantify and interpret changes in animal behavior in response to abiotic environmental factors, like temperature. For both endotherms and ectotherms, temperature can affect everything from daily energy budgets to nesting behaviors. For instance, in birds environmental temperature plays a key role in shaping parental incubation behavior and temperatures experienced by embryos. Recent research indicates that temperatures experienced by embryos affect viability and are important in shaping fitness-related traits in young birds, sparking renewed interest in relationships among environmental factors, parental incubation behavior, and incubation temperature. Incubation behavior of birds can be monitored non-invasively by placing thermal probes into the nest and analyzing temperature fluctuations that occur as parents attend and leave the nest (on- and off-bouts, respectively). When other measures of temperature (e.g., ambient air or operative temperature) are collected simultaneously with incubation temperature it is possible to compare shifts in behavior with environmental changes. To improve analysis of incubation behavior using these large thermal data sets we developed a program, NestIQ, that uses machine learning to guide parameter optimization allowing it to track the behavior of diverse species. NestIQ’s algorithm was tested using six species incubating in lab or field scenarios, that exhibit unique incubation patterns. This stand-alone and open source software is operated through a graphical user interface (i.e., no user programming is required) that provides important behavioral and thermal output statistics. Further, measures of environmental temperature can be imported alongside nest temperature into the program, which then reports various attributes of environmental temperature during shifts in parental behavior. This program will improve the ability of avian ecologists to interpret a critical parental care behavior that can be used across diverse incubation scenarios and species. Although specifically designed for quantifying avian incubation, NestIQ has the potential for broader applications, including basking and nesting behaviors of non-avian reptiles in relation to ambient temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3082800054,"Pakistan is considered by the World Health Organization to currently have a ""concentrated"" HIV-1 epidemic due to a rapid rise in infections among people who inject drugs (PWID). Prevalence among the country's nearly 105,000 PWID is estimated to be 37.8% but has been shown to be higher in several large urban centers. A lack of public health resources, the common use of professional injectors and unsafe injection practices are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Here we evaluate the molecular characteristics of HIV-1 sequences (n = 290) from PWID in several Pakistani cities to examine transmission dynamics and the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission with regards to regional trends in opioid trafficking. Tip-to-tip (patristic) distance based phylogenetic cluster inferences and BEAST2 Bayesian phylodynamic analyses of time-stamped data were performed on HIV-1 pol sequences generated from dried blood spots collected from 1,453 PWID as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in Pakistan during 2014/2015. Overall, subtype A1 strains were dominant (75.2%) followed by CRF02_AG (14.1%), recombinants/unassigned (7.2%), CRF35_AD (2.1%), G (1.0%) and C (0.3%). Nearly three quarters of the PWID HIV-1 sequences belonged to one of five distinct phylogenetic clusters. Just below half (44.4%) of individuals in the largest cluster (n = 118) did seek help injecting from professional injectors which was previously identified as a strong correlate of HIV-1 infection. Spikes in estimated HIV-1 effective population sizes coincided with increases in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Pakistan's western neighbor. Structured coalescent analysis was undertaken in order to investigate the spatial relationship of HIV-1 transmission among the various cities under study. In general terms, our analysis placed the city of Larkana at the center of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistan which is consistent with previous epidemiological data."
https://openalex.org/W3082558551,"Inosine is ubiquitous and essential in many biological processes, including RNA-editing. In addition, oxidative stress on RNA has been a topic of increasing interest due, in part, to its potential role in the development/progression of disease. In this work we probed the ability of three reverse transcriptases (RTs) to catalyze the synthesis of cDNA in the presence of RNA templates containing inosine (I), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroinosine (8oxo-I), guanosine (G), or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoG), and explored the impact that these purine derivatives have as a function of position. To this end, we used 29-mers of RNA (as template) containing the modifications at position-18 and reverse transcribed DNA using 17-mers, 18-mers, or 19-mers (as primers). Generally reactivity of the viral RTs, AMV / HIV / MMLV, towards cDNA synthesis was similar for templates containing G or I as well as for those with 8-oxoG or 8-oxoI. Notable differences are: 1) the use of 18-mers of DNA (to explore cDNA synthesis past the lesion/modification) led to inhibition of DNA elongation in cases where a G:dA wobble pair was present, while the presence of I, 8-oxoI, or 8-oxoG led to full synthesis of the corresponding cDNA, with the latter two displaying a more efficient process; 2) HIV RT is more sensitive to modified base pairs in the vicinity of cDNA synthesis; and 3) the presence of a modification two positions away from transcription initiation has an adverse impact on the overall process. Steady-state kinetics were established using AMV RT to determine substrate specificities towards canonical dNTPs (N = G, C, T, A). Overall we found evidence that RNA templates containing inosine are likely to incorporate dC > dT > > dA, where reactivity in the presence of dA was found to be pH dependent (process abolished at pH 7.3); and that the absence of the C2-exocyclic amine, as displayed with templates containing 8-oxoI, leads to increased selectivity towards incorporation of dA over dC. The data will be useful in assessing the impact that the presence of inosine and/or oxidatively generated lesions have on viral processes and adds to previous reports where I codes exclusively like G. Similar results were obtained upon comparison of AMV and MMLV RTs."
https://openalex.org/W3081792871,"The Global Navigation Satellite System is vulnerable to interference signals that can potentially disable the system, because the signal strength tends to be very weak. Interference such as jamming, which disables the receiver via excessively high signal strength in the satellite navigation frequency band, and spoofing, which induces the receiver to output erroneous position and time data via signals similar to actual navigation signals, disrupt satellite navigation systems. As the threat of interference is increasing, considerable research effort has been expended in an attempt to deal with it in various ways. Spoofing attacks are especially difficult to detect. This paper deals with a technique to detect a spoofing signal and to mitigate attacks on satellite navigation systems. The satellite navigation signal is influenced by the navigation satellite itself and errors due to environmental factors, and spoofing signal detection should be well reflected in the navigation signal. Especially, in the case of mobile receivers, it is not easy to detect a spoofing signal because the exact position of the receiver cannot be known. To detect a spoofing signal, additional hardware may be required; in some cases, heterogeneous sensors, such as inertial sensors, may be used. The technique introduced in this paper effectively discriminates spoofing signals based only on receiver measurements, without the need for additional devices. It generates test statistics based on the pseudorange, which is the measured value of the receiver position, and detects spoofing signals by setting the monitoring interval according to a ""sliding window"". Because the proposed method uses output data and measurements obtained from the receiver, it can be applied to general receivers at low cost."

This paper examines these relationships using FDI, portfolio and bank inflows for 28 emerging market economies. We find that greater fixity of the exchange rate and sterilized intervention can potentially encourage capital inflows, and that the effect is magnified when combined. Further, we find that the effect differs by region, and it is larger for higher inflows."
