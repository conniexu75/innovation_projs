Acid hydrolyzates of cell walls isolated from sorbose-grown (colonial) hyphae contain more glucosamine and less glucose than do hydrolyzates of cell walls obtained from normally growing hyphae. Snail digestive juice, an agent which effects a structural change in the cell wall of N. crassa by liberating from it large quantities of glucose, has been found to induce colonial growth."

https://openalex.org/W2032707193,"The effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on axons of the walking leg of lobster have been investigated. In 10(-2)M concentration the ester lowers the resting potential by approximately 7 mv within 10 minutes. Simultaneously, the spike height is decreased. Complete but reversible block ensues in 10 to 15 minutes. At lower concentrations essentially similar but smaller effects are observed. Choline chloride and sodium acetate, at concentrations of 10(-2)M, are without any effect. In conjunction with the evidence accumulated for the essential role of acteylcholine in the control of ion movements, the demonstration of the ability of acetylcholine to reversibly depolarize axons of somatic nerve fibers appears pertinent."

The organism is televised, collisions between it and the scanning beam, which make a discrete pathway of ""blips,"" being photographable on the viewing screen. The pathway of the miracidium of Schistosoma mansoni in water and in ""host-factor"" is recorded."

https://openalex.org/W2983579319,"RECENTLY, Carroll1 advocated the use of the product of retention time (tR) and peak height (h) for the quantitative estimation of relative peak areas. This method2, based on the assumption of a proportionality of peak width (w) and retention time (tR) or volume (VR), gives satisfactory results with respect to the reproducibility. In fact, we have found that the reproducibility (under equal operating conditions) of this method is better than that of any other ‘manual’ estimation of peak areas. However, the method is not commonly used in our Laboratory, as the results obtained with it are erratic. This is due to the fact that in most cases the proportionality between w and VR is only approximate. Differences between the relative areas, as found by the triangulation method and from the product of h and VR, can amount to several per cent relative. In principle the non-linearity of w and VR can be taken into account when calibrating the detector. However, changing the column or altering the carrier gas velocity will change the calibration factors."

Control cultures were treated the same way, but without addition of the virus. These cultures were then followed for 4 weeks. During the first ten days, the number of epidermal elements declined gradually in both test and control cultures. From the 10th day on, however, a marked proliferation of the remaining epidermal cells was observed in cultures exposed to the virus, whereas no further changes were noticed in the control cultures."

Destruction by microorganisms is often assumed responsible and has, in the ocase of phenoxyacetic acids and some other compounds, been clearly proved1,2."
https://openalex.org/W2054771798,"MORPHOLOGICAL considerations led Dry1 to distinguish three stages in the hair-growth cycle; namely, anagen, catagen and telogen. Anagen referred to the period of active growth, including development of the follicle and subsequent synthesis of the hair. The rapid growth in anagen abruptly ceases and the follicle is largely destroyed in a brief phase, termed by Dry as catagen. The follicle remnant and associated hair are in a phase of apparent inactivity known as telogen in Dry's system. This classification of the hair-growth cycle has been extended2 by subdividing anagen into six phases on the bases of detailed histological observations."

https://openalex.org/W1980134341,"REDUCTION in somatic nuclei has been noted in various plants and animals by a number of workers. This communication reports an instance in which both glossy and semi-glossy seed-stems were found on the same onion plant. Huskins1 has reviewed many examples in the plant field, thus a full review will not be given here, but only a few more pertinent examples will be cited. Segregation and/or reduction in chromosome number was induced in cells of onion root tips which had been treated with 1–4 per cent sodium nucleate. Regular genetic segregation occurred with greater frequency than would be expected if the distribution of the chromosomes were a random process2. Onion bulbs stored at 5°–6° C. showed a reductional grouping3."
