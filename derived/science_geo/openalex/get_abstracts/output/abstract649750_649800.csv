https://openalex.org/W3013509442,"Flood is the most devastating and prevalent disaster among all-natural disasters. Every year, flood claims hundreds of human lives and causes damage to the worldwide economy and environment. Consequently, the identification of flood-vulnerable areas is important for comprehensive flood risk management. The main objective of this study is to delineate flood-prone areas in the Panjkora River Basin (PRB), eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan. An initial extensive field survey and interpretation of Landsat-7 and Google Earth images identified 154 flood locations that were inundated in 2010 floods. Of the total, 70% of flood locations were randomly used for building a model and 30% were used for validation of the model. Eight flood parameters including slope, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, and rainfall were used to map the flood-prone areas in the study region. The relative frequency ratio was used to determine the correlation between each class of flood parameter and flood occurrences. All of the factors were resampled into a pixel size of 30×30 m and were reclassified through the natural break method. Finally, a final hazard map was prepared and reclassified into five classes, i.e., very low, low, moderate, high, very high susceptibility. The results of the model were found reliable with area under curve values for success and prediction rate of 82.04% and 84.74%, respectively. The findings of this study can play a key role in flood hazard management in the target region; they can be used by the local disaster management authority, researchers, planners, local government, and line agencies dealing with flood risk management."
https://openalex.org/W3014023943,"Oxidative stress is suggested to be the crucial factor in diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) pathogenesis and in the development of diabetic complications. Patients with DM2 may be more susceptible to infections due to hyperglycaemia-induced virulence of various microorganisms. Several studies pointed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and/or activation of signalling pathways connected with ROS. The present study analyzed serum activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in DM2 patients with and without EBV infection. Blood and saliva were collected from 120 patients with DM2. EBV DNA was detected in the saliva using nested-PCR technique. Spectrophotometric methods were implemented to determine serum GPx and SOD activity with the use of diagnostic kits produced by Randox Laboratories. GPx and SOD activity was decreased in diabetic patients, with the lowest values in DM2 EBV-positive patients. There was correlation between GPx and SOD activity–with increased value of GPx, SOD activity was also rised. In patients with DM2 history longer than 10 years as well as in DM2 patients with obesity, antioxidant enzymes activity was decreased. Determination of examined parameters may be useful in diabetic patients with EBV infection and could be important prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W3013842624,"Edible insects are increasingly being considered as sustainable alternatives to fish and soybean meals in animal feed because of their high nutritional quality and environmental benefits. However, successful introduction of a new product to the market depends on the target user’s acceptance. Thus, evaluating the potential demand of insect-based feeds would provide relevant information for policy development. The present study assessed farmers’ knowledge on edible insects as feed, their acceptance of integrating insect meals in animal feeds and willingness to pay (WTP) for insect-based feed (IBF) using a contingent valuation method. A household survey was conducted among 957 randomly selected farmers including: 409 poultry, 241 fish and 307 pig farmers in four counties in Kenya. Results of the study reveal that over 70 and 80% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, are aware that insects can be used as a feed ingredient. In addition, over 60 and 75% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, consider insects as a good component of feed. Poultry, pig and fish farmers interviewed accepted and showed willingness to pay for IBF. Regression analysis indicated that age, gender, education, marital status, distance to feed trader, awareness of insects as feed, attitude towards insects, acceptance of insect species, availability of agricultural inputs, use of commercial feeds, availability of training and market information had a significant influence on the WTP for IBF. Therefore, increased extension services to educate famers on the nutritional benefits of insect meals in animal feeds and existing market opportunities are expected to improve farmers’ attitude towards utilization and consequently enhance WTP for IBF, which in return would significantly reduce the existing pressure on conventional fishmeal feed resources. Our findings provide the first insights into the market opportunities of including insect meals in the animal feed value chain in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3012984956,"Introduction The dynamics of intimate partner violence (IPV)—one of the world’s leading public health problems—in urban Africa remain poorly understood. Yet, urban areas are key to the future of women’s health in Africa. Study objectives We explored survivor-, partner-, and household-level correlates of prevalence rates for types of IPV in urban SSA women. Method The study uses DHS data from 42,143 urban women aged 15–49 in 27 SSA countries. Associations at the bivariate level were examined using the Pearson Chi-square test. The modified Poisson regression test estimated the relative prevalence of IPV subtypes in the study population at the multivariate level. Results Approximately 36% of women in urban SSA experienced at least one form of IPV; 12.8% experienced two types; and 4.6% experienced all three types. SSA urban women who had only primary-level education, had 3 or more living children, were informally employed, were in polygynous unions, or who approved of wife-beating similarly displayed higher adjusted prevalence rates for all three forms of IPV compared respectively to their counterparts without formal education, without a living child, were unemployed, in monogamous unions, or who do not approve of wife-beating. On the other hand, the region’s urban women who began cohabiting between ages 25 and 35 years or who lived in higher wealth households showed consistently lower adjusted prevalence rates for all three forms of IPV relative to their counterparts who began cohabiting before 18 years or who lived in lower wealth households. Compared to their counterparts without formal education, without a living child, or whose partners did not have formal education, women with secondary and higher education, with 1–2 living children, or whose partners had only primary level schooling displayed higher adjusted prevalence rates for both IPEV and IPPV, but not for IPSV. However, relative to their counterparts whose partners were aged 25 years or below, living with a partner aged 40 years and above was associated with statistically significant reduced prevalence rates for IPPV and IPSV, but not for IPEV. Only for IPPV did women with partners educated at secondary and above levels display statistically significant higher adjusted prevalence rates relative to their counterparts with uneducated partners. Also, solely for IPPV did women who began cohabiting between ages 18 and 24 years or whose partners were employed (whether formally or informally) show decreased adjusted prevalence rates relative to their counterparts who started cohabiting before 18 years or whose partners were unemployed. In addition, only for IPSV did women aged 40 years and above or living in middle wealth households show statistically significant reduced adjusted prevalence rates relative to their counterparts aged less than 25 years or living in lower wealth households. Discussion and conclusion By 2030, the majority of SSA women will be urban dwellers. Complexities surround IPV in urban SSA, highlighting the unique dynamics of the problem in this setting. While affirming the link between IPV and marital power inequities and dynamics, findings suggest that the specific correlates of prevalence rates for different IPV sub-types in urban SSA women can, at once, be both similar and unique. The contextual drivers of the differences and similarities in the correlates of the prevalence rates of IPV sub-types among the region’s urban women need further interrogation."
https://openalex.org/W3013754455,"Objective To determine the impact of pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus (D), obesity (O) and chronic hypertension (H) on preterm birth (PTB). Methods Retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada between 2012–2016. Women who had a singleton livebirth or stillbirth at > 20 weeks gestation were included in the cohort. Exposures of interest were D, O and H, individually, and in various combinations. The primary outcome was PTB at 241/7 to 366/7 weeks. PTB was further analyzed by spontaneous or provider-initiated, early (< 34 weeks) or late (34–37 weeks), and the co-presence of preeclampsia, large for gestational age (LGA), and small for gestational age (SGA). Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to generate relative risks (RR), further adjusted for maternal age and parity (aRR). Population attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated for each of the outcomes by exposure state. Results 506,483 women were eligible for analysis. 30,139 pregnancies (6.0%) were complicated by PTB < 37 weeks, of which 7375 (24.5%) had D or O or H. Relative to women without D or O or H, the aRR for PTB < 37 weeks was higher for D (3.51; 95% CI 3.26–3.78) and H (3.81; 95% CI 3.55–4.10) than O (1.14; 95% CI 1.10–1.17). The combined state of DH was associated with a significantly higher aRR of PTB < 37 weeks (6.34; 95% CI 5.14–7.80) and < 34 weeks (aRR 10.33, 95% CI 6.96–15.33) than D alone. The risk of provider initiated PTB was generally higher than that for spontaneous PTB. Pre-pregnancy hypertension was associated with the highest risk for PTB with preeclampsia (aRR 45.42, 95% CI 39.69–51.99) and PTB with SGA (aRR 9.78, 95% CI 7.81–12.26) while pre-pregnancy diabetes was associated with increased risk for PTB with LGA (aRR 28.85, 95% CI 24.65–33.76). Conclusion Combinations of DOH significantly magnify the risk of PTB, especially provider initiated PTB, and PTB with altered fetal growth or preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3013108048,"Early-life education (years of schooling) has been investigated in regards to cognition, health outcomes and mortality. It has been shown to confer cognitive reserve that might lessen the impact of brain pathology and its impact on cognitive and motor functioning in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and, for instance, to influence electrical activity [Begum, T., Reza, F., Ahmed, I., & Abdullah, J. M. (2014). Influence of education level on design-induced N170 and P300 components of event related potentials in the human brain. J Integr Neurosci, 13(1), 71-88. doi:10.1142/S0219635214500058]. On the other hand, demonstrations of a direct association between education and brain-structural measures have been more equivocal and scant. The current study sought to identify univariate cortical-thickness patterns underlying education and general intelligence after adjusting for age, gender and possible in-scanner movement in 353 individuals aged 40 to 80. We followed up this idea with multivariate analyses as well. For univariate analyses, our analyses yielded no robust associations between education and general intelligence beyond confounding effects of gender, age and extraneous in-scanner movement. A subsequent multivariate analyses showed a relationship between education and regional cortical thickness with a robust pattern of negative as well as positive loadings in several right-sided brain areas, speaking to a subtle but robust distributed effect of education on cortical thickness. Cortical thickness variance that is the residual of this education-related pattern was shown to be positively associated with age and extraneous in-scanner movement. Our study thus presents a complex picture of the association of education with regional cortical thickness: education was associated with a distributed brain-wide pattern of positive as well as negative loadings with unaccounted residuals being larger for older participants. Focal regional associations beyond demographic and age covariates were not identified."
https://openalex.org/W3014009429,"Angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare neoplasm with limited treatment options and a poor survival rate. Development of effective therapies is hindered by the rarity of this disease. Dogs spontaneously develop hemangiosarcoma (HSA), a common, histologically similar neoplasm. Metastatic disease occurs rapidly and despite chemotherapy, most dogs die several months after diagnosis. These features suggest that HSA might provide a tractable model to test experimental therapies in clinical trials. We previously reported whole exome sequencing of 20 HSA cases. Here we report development of a NGS targeted resequencing panel to detect driver mutations in HSA and other canine tumors. We validated the panel by resequencing the original 20 cases and sequenced 30 additional cases. Overall, we identified potential driver mutations in over 90% of the cases, including well-documented (in human cancers) oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA (46%), PTEN (6%), PLCG1(4%), and TP53 (66%), as well as previously undetected recurrent activating mutations in NRAS (24%). The driver role of these mutations is further demonstrated by augmented downstream signaling crucial to tumor growth. The recurrent, mutually exclusive mutation patterns suggest distinct molecular subtypes of HSA. Driver mutations in some subtypes closely resemble those seen in some AS cases, including NRAS, PLCG1, PIK3CA and TP53. Furthermore, activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways appear to be key oncogenic mechanisms in both species. Together, these observations suggest that dogs with spontaneous HSA could serve as a useful model for testing the efficacy of targeted therapies, some of which could potentially be of therapeutic value in AS."
https://openalex.org/W3013262094,"The heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23 or IL23A/IL12B) is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages and promotes the proinflammatory and regenerative activities of T helper 17 (Th17) and innate lymphoid cells. A recent study has reported that IL-23 is also secreted by lung adenoma cells and generates an inflammatory and immune-suppressed stroma. Here, we observed that proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling strongly induce IL23A expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, we identified a strong crosstalk between the NF-κB and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) pathways, involving the formation of a transcriptional enhancer complex consisting of proto-oncogene c-Jun (c-Jun), RELA proto-oncogene NF-κB subunit (RelA), RUNX family transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and RUNX3. Collectively, these proteins induced IL23A secretion, confirmed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous IL23A from activated human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, IL23A was likely secreted in a noncanonical form, as it was not detected by an ELISA specific for heterodimeric IL-23 likely because IL12B expression is absent in CRC cells. Given recent evidence that IL23A promotes tumor formation, we evaluated the efficacy of MAPK/NF-κB inhibitors in attenuating IL23A expression and found that the MEK inhibitor trametinib and BAY 11–7082 (an IKKα/IκB inhibitor) effectively inhibited IL23A in a subset of human CRC lines with mutant KRAS or BRAFV600E mutations. Together, these results indicate that proinflammatory and mitogenic signals dynamically regulate IL23A in epithelial cells. They further reveal its secretion in a noncanonical form independent of IL12B and that small-molecule inhibitors can attenuate IL23A secretion.

https://openalex.org/W3013332385,"Houttuynia cordata Thunb. has been used as a traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments in Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. In Thailand, H. cordata fermentation products (HCFPs) are commercially produced and popularly consumed throughout the country without experimental validation. Anti-inflammatory activity of H. cordata fresh leaves or aerial parts has previously been reported, however, the anti-inflammatory activity of the commercially available HCFPs produced by the industrialized process has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of the selected industrialized HCFP. LPS-induced RAW264.7 and carrageenan-induced paw edema models were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of HCFP. The phenolic acid components of HCFP aqueous and methanolic extracts were investigated using HPLC analysis. In RAW264.7 cells, the HCFP aqueous and methanolic extracts reduced NO production and suppressed LPS-stimulated expression of PGE2, iNOS, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in a concentration-dependent manner, however, less effect on COX-2 level was observed. In Wistar rats, 3.08 and 6.16 mL/kg HCFP reduced paw edema after 2 h carrageenan stimulation, suggesting the second phase anti-edematous effect similar to diclofenac (150 mg/kg). Whereas, 6.16 mL/kg HCFP also reduced paw edema after 1 h carrageenan stimulation, suggesting the first phase anti-edematous effect. Quantitative HPLC revealed the active phenolic compounds including syringic, vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic and ferulic acids, which possess anti-inflammatory activity. Our results demonstrated for the first time the anti-inflammatory activity of the industrialized HCFP both in vitro and in vivo, thus validating its promising anti-inflammation potential."
https://openalex.org/W3013527628,"Background To evaluate screening efficiency and suggest cut-offs for parent and child Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) and the short version (SMFQ) in unselected help seeking child- and adolescent psychiatric outpatients for subgroups of 6–12 versus 13–17 year olds and boys versus girls. Method Eligible for inclusion were newly admitted outpatients age 6–17 years (n = 5908) in four Swedish child- and adolescent psychiatry clinics. They were prompted consecutively and n = 307 accepted a specific day for assessment until time slots randomly were filled. We prospectively validated the MFQ (33 items) and SMFQ (13 items) in patients (n = 186) using receiver operating characteristics against a reference test of Longitudinal Expert All Data DSM-IV depression based on a Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and 1.2 (sd .6) years of follow-up. Results A depressive disorder was confirmed in 59 (31.7%) patients ranging from 14.0% for girls 6–12 years to 53.3% for girls 13–17 years. SMFQ performed roughly equivalent to MFQ. Adolescent score on SMFQ discriminated fairly for boys with Area Under Curve .77 (95% confidence interval .59–.81) and good (.82, .69–.91) for girls and parent ratings for adolescent girls (.85, .73–.93), but not for boys. Depression in children below age 13 could not be discriminated by MFQ or SMFQ whether filled in by child and mostly also when filled in by parent. Favouring maximum kappa value, the optimal cut-off was for MFQ self-report girls ≥32 versus boys ≥11 and for SMFQ self-report girls ≥17 versus boys ≥ 6. Suggested clinical SMFQ cut-offs for girls were ≥12 and for boys ≥ 6. Conclusions MFQ and SMFQ can, with gender-based cut-offs, be used for screening in clinical populations of adolescents but not in children. Parent MFQ and SMFQ can be used for adolescent girls but not boys. SMFQ is sufficient for screening."
https://openalex.org/W3013696284,"Extracellular matrix-evoked angiostasis and autophagy within the tumor microenvironment represent two critical, but unconnected, functions of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan, decorin. Acting as a partial agonist of vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2), soluble decorin signals via the energy sensing protein, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in the autophagic degradation of intracellular vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Here, we discovered that soluble decorin evokes intracellular catabolism of endothelial VEGFA that is mechanistically independent of mTOR, but requires an autophagic regulator, paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3). We found that administration of autophagic inhibitors such as chloroquine or bafilomycin A1, or depletion of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), results in accumulation of intracellular VEGFA, indicating that VEGFA is a basal autophagic substrate. Mechanistically, decorin increased the VEGFA clearance rate by augmenting autophagic flux, a process that required RAB24 member RAS oncogene family (RAB24), a small GTPase that facilitates the disposal of autophagic compartments. We validated these findings by demonstrating the physiological relevance of this process in vivo. Mice starved for 48 h exhibited a sharp decrease in overall cardiac and aortic VEGFA that could be blocked by systemic chloroquine treatment. Thus, our findings reveal a unified mechanism for the metabolic control of endothelial VEGFA for autophagic clearance in response to decorin and canonical pro-autophagic stimuli. We posit that the VEGFR2/AMPK/PEG3 axis integrates the anti-angiogenic and pro-autophagic bioactivities of decorin as the molecular basis for tumorigenic suppression. These results support future therapeutic use of decorin as a next-generation protein therapy to combat cancer.

We match individual-level mental health data for over three million Americans between 1993 and 2010 to historical daily weather information. We exploit the random fluctuations in temperature over time within counties to identify its effect on a 30-day measure of self-reported mental health. Compared to the temperature range of 60–70°F, cooler days in the past month reduce the probability of reporting days of bad mental health while hotter days increase this probability. We also find a salience effect: cooler days have an immediate effect, whereas hotter days tend to matter most after about 10 days. Using our estimates, we calculate the willingness to pay to avoid an additional hot day in terms of its impact on self-reported mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3013897295,"Psychosocial stress is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to a wide range of health conditions and has a significant negative impact on public health. Quantifying exposure to stress in the naturalistic environment can help to better understand its health effects and identify strategies for timely intervention. The objective of the current project was to develop and test the infrastructure and methods necessary for using wearable technology to quantify individual response to stressful situations and to determine if popular and accessible fitness trackers such as Fitbit® equipped with an optical heart rate (HR) monitor could be used to detect physiological response to psychosocial stress in everyday life. The participants in this study were University of Minnesota students (n = 18) that owned a Fitbit® tracker and had at least one upcoming examination. Continuous HR and activity measurements were obtained during a 7-day observation period containing examinations self-reported by the participants. Participants responded to six ecological momentary assessment surveys per day (~ 2 hour intervals) to indicate occurrence of stressful events. We compared HR during stressful events (e.g., exams) to baseline HR during periods indicated as non-stressful using mixed effects modeling. Our results show that HR was elevated by 8.9 beats per minute during exams and by 3.2 beats per minute during non-exam stressors. These results are consistent with prior laboratory findings and indicate that consumer wearable fitness trackers could serve as a valuable source of information on exposure to psychosocial stressors encountered in the naturalistic environment."
https://openalex.org/W3013595405,"In bacteria, the restart of stalled DNA replication forks requires the DNA helicase PriA. PriA can recognize and remodel abandoned DNA replication forks, unwind DNA in the 3′-to-5′ direction, and facilitate the loading of the helicase DnaB onto the DNA to restart replication. Single-stranded DNA–binding protein (SSB) is typically present at the abandoned forks, but it is unclear how SSB and PriA interact, although it has been shown that the two proteins interact both physically and functionally. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to visualize the interaction of PriA with DNA substrates with or without SSB. These experiments were done in the absence of ATP to delineate the substrate recognition pattern of PriA before its ATP-catalyzed DNA-unwinding reaction. These analyses revealed that in the absence of SSB, PriA binds preferentially to a fork substrate with a gap in the leading strand. Such a preference has not been observed for 5′- and 3′-tailed duplexes, suggesting that it is the fork structure that plays an essential role in PriA's selection of DNA substrates. Furthermore, we found that in the absence of SSB, PriA binds exclusively to the fork regions of the DNA substrates. In contrast, fork-bound SSB loads PriA onto the duplex DNA arms of forks, suggesting a remodeling of PriA by SSB. We also demonstrate that the remodeling of PriA requires a functional C-terminal domain of SSB.

https://openalex.org/W3013596941,"NR4A is a nuclear receptor protein family whose members act as sensors of cellular environment and regulate multiple processes such as metabolism, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and autophagy. Since the ligand binding domains of these receptors have no cavity for ligand interaction, their function is most likely regulated by protein abundance and post-translational modifications. In particular, NR4A1 is regulated by protein abundance, phosphorylation, and subcellular distribution (nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation), and acts both as a transcription factor and as a regulator of other interacting proteins. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification that can affect protein stability, transcriptional activity, alter protein-protein interactions and modify intracellular localization of target proteins. In the present study we evaluated the role of SUMOylation as a posttranslational modification that can regulate the activity of NR4A1 to induce autophagy-dependent cell death. We focused on a model potentially relevant for neuronal cell death and demonstrated that NR4A1 needs to be SUMOylated to induce autophagic cell death. We observed that a triple mutant in SUMOylation sites has reduced SUMOylation, increased transcriptional activity, altered intracellular distribution, and more importantly, its ability to induce autophagic cell death is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W3013645147,"Objectives Our aim was to compare neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes across three encephalitis aetiological groups: Herpes simplex virus (HSV), other infections or autoimmune causes (Other), and encephalitis of unknown cause (Unknown). Methods Patients recruited from NHS hospitals underwent neuropsychological and psychiatric assessment in the short-term (4 months post-discharge), medium-term (9–12 months after the first assessment), and long-term (>1-year). Healthy control subjects were recruited from the general population and completed the same assessments. Results Patients with HSV were most severely impaired on anterograde and retrograde memory tasks. In the short-term, they also showed executive, IQ, and naming deficits, which resolved in the long-term. Patients with Other or Unknown causes of encephalitis showed moderate memory impairments, but no significant impairment on executive tests. Memory impairment was associated with hippocampal/medial temporal damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and naming impairment with left temporal and left frontal abnormalities. Patients reported more subjective cognitive complaints than healthy controls, with tiredness a significant problem, and there were high rates of depression and anxiety in the HSV and the Other encephalitis groups. These subjective, self-reported complaints, depression, and anxiety persisted even after objectively measured neuropsychological performance had improved. Conclusions Neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes after encephalitis vary according to aetiology. Memory and naming are severely affected in HSV, and less so in other forms. Neuropsychological functioning improves over time, particularly in those with more severe short-term impairments, but subjective cognitive complaints, depression, and anxiety persist, and should be addressed in rehabilitation programmes."
https://openalex.org/W3013921102,"Specialized transporting and sensory epithelial cells employ homologous protocadherin-based adhesion complexes to remodel their apical membrane protrusions into organized functional arrays. Within the intestine, the nutrient-transporting enterocytes utilize the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) to assemble their apical microvilli into an ordered brush border. The IMAC bears remarkable homology to the Usher complex, whose disruption results in the sensory disorder type 1 Usher syndrome (USH1). However, the entire complement of proteins that comprise both the IMAC and Usher complex are not yet fully elucidated. Using a protein isolation strategy to recover the IMAC, we have identified the small EF-hand protein calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4) as an IMAC component. Consistent with this finding, we show that CALML4 exhibits marked enrichment at the distal tips of enterocyte microvilli, the site of IMAC function, and is a direct binding partner of the IMAC component myosin-7b. Moreover, distal tip enrichment of CALML4 is strictly dependent upon its association with myosin-7b, with CALML4 acting as a light chain for this myosin. We further show that genetic disruption of CALML4 within enterocytes results in brush border assembly defects that mirror the loss of other IMAC components and that CALML4 can also associate with the Usher complex component myosin-7a. Our study further defines the molecular composition and protein-protein interaction network of the IMAC and Usher complex and may also shed light on the etiology of the sensory disorder USH1H. Specialized transporting and sensory epithelial cells employ homologous protocadherin-based adhesion complexes to remodel their apical membrane protrusions into organized functional arrays. Within the intestine, the nutrient-transporting enterocytes utilize the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) to assemble their apical microvilli into an ordered brush border. The IMAC bears remarkable homology to the Usher complex, whose disruption results in the sensory disorder type 1 Usher syndrome (USH1). However, the entire complement of proteins that comprise both the IMAC and Usher complex are not yet fully elucidated.

A new light chain for myosin-7Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 28PreviewRecent research has revealed that an adhesion complex based on cadherins and the motor protein myosin-7b (MYO7B) links the tips of intestinal microvilli. Choi et al. now report that a largely uncharacterized protein known as calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4) is a component of this adhesion complex and functions as a light chain for myosin-7b. Because the intermicrovillar adhesion complex is homologous to the myosin-7a (MYO7A)-based Usher syndrome complex and Choi et al. also report that CALML4 can bind to myosin-7a, this work also has important implications for research on myosin-7a and hereditary deaf-blindness.

Prime examples of this can be seen with transporting enterocytes of the intestine and sensory hair cells of the inner ear.

Sensory hair cells assemble an apical hair bundle: a staircase-like array of specialized microvilli, known as stereocilia, that decode sound information into neural signals (2Barr-Gillespie P.G.

It has recently become appreciated that these epithelia use adhesion as a conserved mechanism to create and maintain the exquisite order of their apical membrane protrusions (1Crawley S.W.

In each case, protocadherin-based adhesion is used to create physical linkages that connect neighboring protrusions together, thereby promoting the desire apical architecture. Two homologous protocadherin adhesion complexes generate these physical adhesion links.

Despite serving tissues with divergent physiological functions, the IMAC and Usher complex exhibit striking homology in both their composition and interactome. The IMAC is comprised of the adhesions molecules CDHR2 (also known as protocadherin-24) and CDHR5 (also known as mucin-like or μ-protocadherin), the PDZ-based scaffold USH1C (also known as harmonin), the ankyrin repeat scaffold ANKS4B, and the myosin motor protein myosin-7b (Myo7b) (4Crawley S.W.

In the intestine, these proteins target to the distal tips of enterocyte microvilli, where they create intermicrovillar adhesion links that physically couple neighboring microvilli together. During the intermediate stages of BB assembly, intermicrovillar adhesion results in microvilli clustering together on the apical surface. This adhesion between neighbors ultimately results in the assembly of microvilli into highly organized, tightly packed hexagonal arrays that cover the entire apical surface of the mature enterocyte. The Usher complex is comprised of the adhesions molecules cadherin-23 (CDH23) and protocadherin-15 (PCDH15), the scaffolds USH1C and USH1G (also known as Sans), and the motor myosin-7a (Myo7a) (6Pan L.

Importantly, the USH1C scaffold is shared genetically between the IMAC and Usher complex, although different splice isoforms are utilized between these two complexes (4Crawley S.W. Shifrin Jr., D.A.

The Usher complex has been principally characterized in the inner ear, where it forms “tip-links” that connect adjacent stereocilia on the surface of mechanosensory hair cells (7Jaiganesh A. Narui Y.

Depending on which component of the Usher complex is mutated, patients are classified as having a different variant of USH1 (e.g. patients with deleterious genetic defects in Myo7a suffer from USH1B). Of note, the causative genes for three USH1 subtypes (USH1E, USH1K, and USH1H) still have not been identified, suggesting that more Usher complex components may remain to be discovered (17Ahmed Z.M.

A similar situation is seen with the IMAC; structure-function studies of this complex clearly point toward the idea that the full interactome is not yet known (5Crawley S.W. Weck M.L.

In this study, we sought to further elucidate the molecular composition of the IMAC. To that end, we devised a protein isolation strategy to recover components of the complex associated with CDHR2 and have identified the small EF-hand protein calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4) as an additional adhesion complex factor. CALML4 shares 45% sequence identity with conventional calmodulin; however, the functional properties of CALML4 have not been studied to-date. Our interactome analysis suggests that CALML4 incorporates into the IMAC by functioning as a light chain for Myo7b. Given the striking homology between the IMAC and Usher complex, this led us to test and demonstrate that CALML4 is a direct binding partner for the Usher complex motor, Myo7a. In sum, our results suggest that CALML4 may represent the second adhesion complex component that is shared genetically between the IMAC and the Usher complex and therefore may play an important role in both gut and inner ear biology. The ability of CDHR2 to promote BB assembly depends on its interaction with an ill-defined cytosolic complex that is necessary for both proper targeting and function of the cadherin at the distal tips of enterocyte microvilli (4Crawley S.W.

Toward the goal of identifying additional components of the IMAC, we devised a protein isolation strategy to recover endogenous CDHR2 and its cytoplasmic complex from enterocyte BBs. We reasoned that we could use the innate adhesion of the IMAC protocadherins as a mechanism to affinity isolate CDHR2. Similar techniques have been used to dissect signaling pathways that are activated by mechanical tension applied to cells (22Marjoram R.J. Guilluy C. Burridge K. Using magnets and magnetic beads to dissect signaling pathways activated by mechanical tension applied to cells.Methods. 2016; 94 (26427549): 19-2610.1016/j.ymeth.2015.09.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within the BB, CDHR2 and CDHR5 reside at the microvillar tips and interact to form “intermicrovillar adhesion links” that physically couple neighboring microvilli together (4Crawley S.W. Shifrin Jr., D.A. Grega-Larson N.E. McConnell R.E. Benesh A.E. Mao S. Zheng Y. Zheng Q.Y. Nam K.T. Millis B.A. Kachar B. Tyska M.J. Intestinal brush border assembly driven by protocadherin-based intermicrovillar adhesion.Cell. 2014; 157 (24725409): 433-44610.1016/j.cell.2014.01.067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our protocol involves incubating magnetic beads coated with the ectodomain (ED) of CDHR5 with isolated BBs to affinity-purify CDHR2. BB-bead incubation is first done in the absence of calcium, a condition under which intermicrovillar adhesion links are disrupted. A calcium switch is then performed to induce adhesion bond formation between the beads and endogenous CDHR2 (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, CDHR2 and its associated cytoplasmic complex are recovered using a typical bead-based protein pulldown protocol. The power of this recovery strategy is 2-fold; it exploits the inherent specificity encoded in the trans-heterophilic adhesion mediated between the CDHR2 and CDHR5 as an affinity purification step while also benefitting from the fact that the source material used for the purification, namely isolated enterocyte BBs, is highly enriched in the IMAC. Successful recovery of the CDHR2 cytoplasmic complex using our strategy rests on two principal caveats: that the cytoplasmic complex associated with CDHR2 remains intact during the preparation of our BB source material and that our CDHR5 ED–coated beads are able to make functional interactions with endogenous CDHR2 found in BB microvilli. To begin to test the feasibility of our approach, we first assessed whether the IMAC remains intact in isolated BB source material. Whereas previous proteomic analysis of isolated mouse enterocyte BBs revealed the presence of all known IMAC components (23McConnell R.E. Benesh A.E. Mao S. Tabb D.L. Tyska M.J. Proteomic analysis of the enterocyte brush border.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2011; 300 (21330445): G914-G92610.1152/ajpgi.00005.2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the cytoplasmic complex associated CDHR2 remains intact after BB preparation. To assess the integrity of the CDHR2 cytoplasmic complex, native BBs were isolated from rat small intestinal tissue and stained for USH1C (Fig. 1, B and C). The scaffold USH1C serves as an excellent marker to assess the CDHR2-associated cytoplasmic complex, as it directly interacts with CDHR2, ANKS4B, and Myo7b and has been shown to be essential for proper distal tip localization of both ANKS4B and Myo7b (4Crawley S.W.

Confocal imaging of rat BBs stained for USH1C revealed marked enrichment of this scaffold at the distal tips of microvilli, the normal site of IMAC function (Fig. 1C). We also sometimes observed signal at the base of the BB microvilli in the region containing the presumptive terminal web, although this staining was also seen in our secondary antibody control and staining for other IMAC components, suggesting that it is nonspecific binding (see CDHR5 BB staining (Fig. S1A) and secondary antibody control (Fig. S1F)). We further investigated the integrity of the CDHR2-associated complex using BBs isolated from polarized CACO-2BBE cells, an enterocyte model system that uses the IMAC to construct near tissue-like BBs after an extended period in cell culture (4Crawley S.W.

Similar to the localization of USH1C in BBs isolated from native intestinal tissue, we observed striking examples of USH1C, CDHR2, ANKS4B, and Myo7b at the distal tips of microvilli derived from this polarized cell line (Fig. S1, B–E). Thus, in line with previous proteomic data (23McConnell R.E. Benesh A.E. Mao S. Tabb D.L. Tyska M.J. Proteomic analysis of the enterocyte brush border.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Human CDHR5 exhibits robust heterophilic interaction with CDHR2, with little CDHR5 homophilic adhesion detected using both bead aggregation assays and conventional protein pull-downs (4Crawley S.W.

We next assessed whether CDHR5 ED–coated beads could make functional interactions with BB microvilli. To this end, we utilized a CACO-2BBE cell line stably expressing CDHR2-EGFP, which served as a marker for the IMAC. CDHR2-EGFP CACO-2BBE cells were allowed to polarize for 6 days, after which CDHR5 ED–coated beads were added to the apical surface and cells were allowed to polarize an additional 6 days. As a control, beads coated with the ED of CDHR5 lacking the first extracellular cadherin (EC) domain (ΔEC1-CDHR5 ED) were also seeded onto CDHR2-EGFP CACO-2BBE cells. Adhesion between CDHR5 and CDHR2 was previously shown to be strictly dependent upon the first EC domain within the ectodomain of both cadherins (4Crawley S.W. Shifrin Jr., D.A. Grega-Larson N.E.

These CACO-2BBE monolayers were then washed extensively while being held at a 90° angle in a coverslip rack to remove unbound beads. Cells were subsequently fixed, stained for F-actin, and visualized by confocal microscopy. We observed abundant examples of BB microvilli forming intimate contact with the CDHR5 ED–coated beads, especially cells in the monolayer overexpressing CDHR2-EGFP (Fig. 1, D and G). In most cases, BB microvilli seemed to be drawn toward and directly attached to the beads (Fig. S1G). We confirmed this using scanning EM, which showed clear examples of microvilli directly bound to beads (Fig. S1H). In stark contrast, monolayers that were seeded with ΔEC1-CDHR5 ED–coated beads were largely devoid of beads after extensive washing (Fig. 1, E and G). To ensure that the interaction of our CDHR5 ED–coated beads with microvilli was solely dependent upon interaction with CDHR2 (and not some unknown CDHR5-adhesive binding partner), we incubated our beads with polarized CACO-2BBE cells lacking endogenous CDHR2. Microvilli from CDHR2 KD CACO-2BBE failed to retain CDHR5 ED–coated beads (Fig. 1, F and G). Interestingly, we noted the appearance of “bead-shaped” voids of space lacking microvilli on the apical surface of these CDHR2 KD cells. However, CDHR2 KD cells that were not incubated with beads also displayed identical structures, demonstrating that these voids are not a result of the application of the beads themselves (compare Fig. 1F with Fig. S2A). In sum, we conclude that CDHR5 ED–coated beads are able to form functional adhesion bonds with native BB microvilli in a manner dependent upon interaction with CDHR2. We proceeded by incubating BBs isolated from polarized CACO-2BBE monolayers with CDHR5 ED–coated beads for our IMAC recovery strategy. We chose to utilize BBs derived from CACO-2BBE cells because we had previously validated specific antibodies toward each IMAC component using this cell line that work well for both immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis, and CACO-2BBE cells can also be genetically manipulated for control experiments. BBs were incubated with CDHR5 ED–coated beads first in the absence of calcium for 20 min, after which a calcium switch step was performed to engage adhesion between the BBs and the beads. As a control, we utilized beads that had been coated with ΔEC1-CDHR5 ED. Beads were subsequently recovered, washed with extraction buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis for the known IMAC components. We confirmed that CDHR2, USH1C, Myo7b, and ANKS4B were all recovered using CDHR5 ED–coated beads, consistent with these components forming a stable complex in BBs (Fig. 2). Interestingly, analysis of the eluates also detected the presence of the small EF-hand protein CALML4 (Fig. 2). Importantly, beads coated with ΔEC1-CDHR5 ED failed to recover both the known IMAC components and CALML4. To further confirm that CALML4 is recovered using this strategy as a result of its direct association with the IMAC, we attempted to repeat these assays using BBs derived from CACO-2BBE monolayers lacking CDHR2. However, given the key role that CDHR2 plays in BB assembly, we were unable to adequately recover isolated BBs from CDHR2 KD cells due to their highly disorganized nature, which makes them mechanically fragile (Fig. S2A) (4Crawley S.W.

We therefore chose to use CDHR2 KD whole-cell lysates as the starting material for these pull-downs. Pull-downs using the CDHR5 ED–coated beads from polarized CDHR2 KD CACO-2BBE cells failed to recover CALML4 (Fig. S2B). In contrast, polarized CACO-2BBE cells expressing a negative control (scramble) shRNA resulted in the recovery of CALML4. Together, these data identify CALML4 as a putative component of the IMAC that is associated with the CDHR2 cytoplasmic complex. As a starting point to characterize CALML4 as part of the IMAC, we first set out to identify the CALML4 splice isoforms that are found as transcripts in the intestinal tract. The CALML4 gene is predicted to encode four different transcript variants in humans. The longest isoform (transcript variant 1) exhibits ∼45% amino acid sequence identity to conventional calmodulin (Fig. S3A) and encodes for a protein 196 amino acids in length that contains an extended N terminus followed by the typical two globular EF-hand–based lobes (denoted here as N-lobe and C-lobe) that are seen with other calmodulin/calmodulin-like protein family members (Fig. 3, A and D). Proteins encoded by transcript variants 3 and 4 result from utilizing internal start codons compared with transcript variant 1, whereas transcript variant 2 is spliced to remove 47 amino acids internally (Fig. 3A). In each case, these shorter variants would encode for"

We examined the regional variations in contraceptive use among 15,699 currently married women ages 15–49 years using data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). Multivariate logistic regression models of contraceptive use were calibrated with sociodemographic attributes and cultural factors. Based on the aggregate sample (i.e., rural and urban combined), we found significant regional variations in contraceptive use across the administrative divisions in Bangladesh. Based on a disaggregate sample (i.e., rural and urban separately), we found that there were significant differences in divisional variations in contraceptive use in rural areas. In contrast, no significant variation in contraceptive use across divisions in urban areas of Bangladesh was found. More specifically, among women living in rural areas, the Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions had higher odds of contraceptive use than the Barisal division, whereas the Chittagong and Sylhet divisions had much lower odds of contraceptive use even after adjusting for selected sociodemographic attributes and cultural factors. A separate analysis of the divisional variations in usage of modern methods of contraception also revealed similar findings with only one exception. Findings of this study provide an evidence-based direction for adapting a pragmatic approach to reducing the divisional disparity of contraceptive use in rural areas of Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3014050314,"Despite the increase in the number of journals issuing data policies requiring authors to make data underlying reporting findings publicly available, authors do not always do so, and when they do, the data do not always meet standards of quality that allow others to verify or extend published results. This phenomenon suggests the need to consider the effectiveness of journal data policies to present and articulate transparency requirements, and how well they facilitate (or hinder) authors' ability to produce and provide access to data, code, and associated materials that meet quality standards for computational reproducibility. This article describes the results of a research study that examined the ability of journal-based data policies to: 1) effectively communicate transparency requirements to authors, and 2) enable authors to successfully meet policy requirements. To do this, we conducted a mixed-methods study that examined individual data policies alongside editors' and authors' interpretation of policy requirements to answer the following research questions. Survey responses from authors and editors along with results from a content analysis of data policies found discrepancies among editors' assertion of data policy requirements, authors' understanding of policy requirements, and the requirements stated in the policy language as written. We offer explanations for these discrepancies and offer recommendations for improving authors' understanding of policies and increasing the likelihood of policy compliance."

Subjects/Methods Food and nutrient intakes from a 68-item FFQ were compared with three non-consecutive 24 hour recalls in a follow-up cohort of children aged 1.5, 3.5 and 5.0 years old. Data from both methods were available for 231, 172 and 187 participants at ages 1.5, 3.5 and 5.0 years, respectively. Results Out of 11 nutrients, four (protein, fat, fibre, iron), two (Vitamin C, folate) and three (protein, vitamin C and folate) nutrients showed good-acceptable outcome for 2 out of 3 group-level validation tests at ages 1.5, 3.5 and 5.0 years, respectively. Of 26 food groups, good-acceptable outcome for 2 out of 3 group-level validation tests was revealed for two, four and six food groups at ages 1.5, 3.5 and 5.0 years, respectively. For individual-level validation tests, all nutrients showed good-acceptable outcome for 2 out of 3 individual level tests across three time points, except for folate at age 1.5 years and energy intake at age 3.5 years. Most food groups (22 out of 26) at age 1.5 years and all food groups at both ages 3.5 and 5.0 years showed good-acceptable outcome for 2 out of 3 individual-level validation tests. Conclusions At all three time points, the FFQ demonstrated good-acceptable validity for some nutrients and food groups at group-level, and good-acceptable validity for most nutrients and food groups at individual-level. This quantitative FFQ is a valid and robust tool for assessing total diet of young children and ranking individuals according to nutrient and food intakes."

The objective of this work was to perform a spatial exploration of the microbialites of Bacalar Lagoon, analyze their prokaryote diversity, following a high throughput sequencing approach of the V4 region of the 16S rDNA, and correlate to the environmental parameters that influence the structure of these communities. The results indicate the presence of microbialites throughout the periphery of the lagoon.

In contrast to protein roadblocks, chemical DNA lesions have not typically been used for nascent RNA display experiments despite their well-established inhibitory effect on transcription elongation (10Sancar A.

The lack of chemical transcription roadblocking approaches can be attributed to two challenges. First, chemical lesions that efficiently stall RNAPs are also likely to stall DNA polymerases so that preparation of DNA templates for in vitro transcription yields a truncated dsDNA product during PCR amplification. Preparation of internally modified dsDNA has been achieved for short DNA molecules by annealing and ligating modified oligonucleotides (11Van Houten B. Gamper H. Sancar A. Hearst J.E.

In this work, we address both of the above challenges to develop a simple and versatile chemical approach for halting E. coli RNAP transcription elongation in vitro. We determined that an internal desthiobiotin-triethylene glycol (desthiobiotin–TEG) modification positioned in the transcribed strand of in vitro transcription DNA templates efficiently and stably halts E. coli RNAP. We first show that internally modified dsDNA can be prepared by sequential PCR amplification and translesion synthesis. We then show that desthiobiotin–TEG alone efficiently halts E. coli RNAP one nucleotide upstream of the modification site, that bypass of the desthiobiotin–TEG modification by RNAP is sufficiently slow to enable manipulation of stalled TECs, and that stalled TECs are stable for at least 2 h at ambient temperature. Last, we demonstrate that our translesion synthesis approach can be used to enzymatically prepare DNA templates containing an internal 1,N6-etheno-2′-deoxyadenosine (etheno-dA) nucleotide, which was recently shown to halt E. coli RNAP transcription (19Pupov D. Ignatov A. Agapov A. Kulbachinskiy A. Distinct effects of DNA lesions on RNA synthesis by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 510 (30665719): 122-12710.1016/j.bbrc.2019.01.062Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our findings establish a method for chemically encoding a transcription stall site within a dsDNA molecule to enable efficient RNAP roadblocking in a minimal in vitro transcription reaction. We observed that an internal desthiobiotin–TEG modification by itself (Fig. 1A) in the transcribed DNA strand causes E. coli RNAP to stall when attempting to develop a reversible desthiobiotin–streptavidin transcription roadblock. Although the desthiobiotin–streptavidin complex was capable of halting RNAP, RNAP also appeared to stall at the desthiobiotin–TEG modification site following streptavidin elution. Given that E. coli RNAP has been reported previously to bypass abasic sites in the transcribed DNA strand (15Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Effects of abasic sites and DNA single-strand breaks on prokaryotic RNA polymerases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90 (8341674): 6601-660510.1073/pnas.90.14.6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we envisioned that the desthiobiotin–TEG modification might enable protein-free transcription roadblocking at a defined DNA template position. Notably, the desthiobiotin–TEG modification is distinct from abasic lesions because of the presence of the desthiobiotin moiety and because it introduces unnatural spacing (two versus three carbons) in the transcribed DNA strand (Fig. S1). We therefore performed our initial assessment of desthiobiotin–TEG as a transcription roadblock compared with an internal amino linker modification, which preserves the natural three-carbon spacing of the DNA phosphodiester backbone and contains a less perturbative functional moiety (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). In the sections below, we first describe our characterization of desthiobiotin–TEG as a chemical transcription roadblock. We then describe a similar characterization of the etheno-dA DNA modification in the final section under “Results.” To assess the transcription roadblocking properties of the desthiobiotin–TEG and internal amino linker modifications, we prepared in vitro transcription DNA templates using synthetic oligonucleotide primers that contain an internal modification site 29 bp upstream of the template end (Fig. 1C and Table S1). Preparation of internally modified DNA templates by PCR amplification yielded a dsDNA product with one truncated strand, suggesting that Vent® (exo−) DNA polymerase cannot efficiently bypass the modification site (Fig. 1, D and E). To complete the truncated DNA strand, we performed translesion synthesis using the thermostable Y-family lesion bypass polymerase Sulfolobus islandicus DNA polymerase IV (DNA Pol IV) (Fig. 1D). The related Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA Pol IV has been shown to discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides with reported misincorporation frequencies between 8 × 10−3 and 3 × 10−4 (20Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4): an archaeal DinB-like DNA polymerase with lesion-bypass properties akin to eukaryotic poleta.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11713310): 4607-461610.1093/nar/29.22.4607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DNA Pol IV from several Sulfolobus species has been used in combination with TaqDNA polymerase to PCR-amplify damaged and ancient DNA (21McDonald J.P. Hall A. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Ballantyne J. Woodgate R. Novel thermostable Y-family polymerases: applications for the PCR amplification of damaged or ancient DNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (16488882): 1102-111110.1093/nar/gkj512Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our application, we separate PCR amplification and translesion synthesis into independent steps so that the DNA template promoter and transcribed region are synthesized first using a DNA polymerase with fidelity suitable for downstream applications. Translesion synthesis is then used to bypass the modification site and complete the truncated DNA strand. In our initial protocol, we purified the truncated dsDNA PCR product before performing translesion synthesis. We later determined that, because Vent® (exo−) DNA polymerase and DNA Pol IV are active in the same buffer and under the same nucleotide conditions, efficient translesion synthesis could be achieved by simply adding DNA Pol IV directly to the reaction after PCR cycling without an intermediate cleanup step. Both translesion synthesis protocols yielded internally modified dsDNA templates that were indistinguishable from unmodified templates by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1E and Fig. S2A). DNA templates containing an internal desthiobiotin–TEG modification were also analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE and showed a slight mobility shift relative to unmodified DNA (Fig. S2B). DNA templates in which translesion synthesis was performed using the thermostability-enhancing dNTPs 2-amino-dATP and 5-propynyl-dCTP showed an identical mobility shift, suggesting that the shift is a consequence of the desthiobiotin–TEG modification and not instability in the DNA downstream of the modification site (Fig. S2C). Translesion DNA synthesis can involve incorporation of a nucleotide opposite the traversed lesion (22Strauss B.S. The “A rule” of mutagen specificity: a consequence of DNA polymerase bypass of non-instructional lesions?.Bioessays. 1991; 13 (2029269): 79-8410.1002/bies.950130206Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To further characterize our internally modified DNA templates, we determined the nucleotide incorporation preference of DNA Pol IV-mediated lesion bypass for the internal desthiobiotin–TEG, amino linker, and etheno-dA DNA modifications by primer extension (Fig. 2A). On an unmodified DNA template, primer extension with all four dNTPs primarily yielded runoff products with one, and to a lesser extent, two more nucleotides than the expected full-length template-encoded product (Fig. 2, B and C). This is consistent with observations that S. solfataricus DNA Pol IV can extend a blunt DNA terminus by one to two nucleotides with a preference for dATP incorporation (23Fiala K.A. Brown J.A. Ling H. Kshetry A.K. Zhang J. Taylor J.S. Yang W. Suo Z. Mechanism of template-independent nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by a template-dependent DNA polymerase.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365 (17095011): 590-60210.1016/j.jmb.2006.10.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The internal desthiobiotin–TEG–modified template yielded a runoff product distribution comparable with that of the unmodified template, suggesting that desthiobiotin–TEG bypass frequently occurs without incorporation of a nucleotide opposite the modification site (Fig. 2, B, C, and F). In contrast, the enrichment of full-length +2 products from amino linker– and etheno-dA–modified templates suggests that bypass of these lesions can involve incorporation of a nucleotide opposite the modification site (Fig. 2, B, C, and F). Notably, the etheno-dA template essentially shifted the product distribution of the unmodified template by one additional nucleotide (Fig. 2C). We confirmed these interpretations by primer extension in the presence of ddNTPs to determine how bypass of each modification distorts the observed sequencing ladder. In agreement with our analysis above, we observed that the desthiobiotin–TEG template yielded a sequencing ladder similar to that of the unmodified control, the amino-linker template yielded the expected +0 sequencing ladder and a ladder with a +1 offset, and the etheno-dA template yielded a mixed +0/+1 sequencing ladder with enrichment for +1 products (Fig. 2D). We further validated these observations by performing primer extension in the presence of one base at a time to determine the efficiency of lesion bypass using each dNTP. Under the conditions of our assay (incubation at 55 °C for 5 min), starving DNA Pol IV of all but one dNTP appeared to yield homopolymer primer extension products because of misincorporation (Fig. 2E); however, the observation of a readily discernable sequencing ladder when all four dNTPs are present (Fig. 2D) indicates that misincorporation to this degree is specific to nucleotide starvation conditions. Consistent with the observations above, we found that desthiobiotin–TEG bypass is most efficient when dNTP incorporation is templated by the nucleotide immediately downstream of the modification site, amino linker bypass is efficiently mediated by templated dGTP or untemplated dATP incorporation, and etheno-dA bypass is most efficient with dATP (Fig. 2E). The observation that S. islandicus DNA Pol IV efficiently bypasses the amino linker and etheno-dA modifications in the presence of dATP is consistent with a previous finding that S. solfataricus DNA Pol IV follows the “A rule” (22Strauss B.S. The “A rule” of mutagen specificity: a consequence of DNA polymerase bypass of non-instructional lesions?.Bioessays. 1991; 13 (2029269): 79-8410.1002/bies.950130206Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and typically incorporates dATP opposite an abasic site (20Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4): an archaeal DinB-like DNA polymerase with lesion-bypass properties akin to eukaryotic poleta.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11713310): 4607-461610.1093/nar/29.22.4607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for why desthiobiotin–TEG bypass preferentially occurs without incorporation of a nucleotide opposite the modification site is that its branched triethylene glycol scaffold interrupts the DNA backbone by only two carbons, whereas the amino linker and etheno-dA modifications preserve the natural three-carbon spacing of DNA nucleotides (Fig. S1). Importantly, preparation of DNA templates containing these modifications was efficient despite the difference in DNA Pol IV-mediated lesion bypass, suggesting that our translesion synthesis approach for enzymatic production of internally modified dsDNA will be generalizable to other modifications. We evaluated the transcription roadblocking properties of the internal desthiobiotin–TEG and amino linker modifications by single-round in vitro transcription with E. coli RNAP. Transcription was initiated in the absence of CTP to walk RNAP to U15, one nucleotide upstream of the first C in the transcript, before addition of NTPs to 500 μm. Both internal modifications produced a transcription stall site at C42, one nucleotide upstream of the modification position (Fig. 1, F and G). Importantly, an unmodified DNA template control showed no evidence of modification-independent transcription stalling at C42, indicating that the C42 stall site is entirely modification-dependent (Fig. 3A). We next compared the desthiobiotin–TEG and amino-linker roadblocks with the “gold standard” terminal biotin–streptavidin roadblock using a 32-min time course in the presence of 500 μm NTPs. To halt transcription at C42, the terminal biotin–streptavidin roadblock was placed 10 nucleotides downstream of C42 at the transcribed DNA strand 5′ end to account for collision of RNAP with streptavidin (3Strobel E.J. Watters K.E. Nedialkov Y. Artsimovitch I. Lucks J.B. Distributed biotin-streptavidin transcription roadblocks for mapping cotranscriptional RNA folding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28398514): e10910.1093/nar/gkx233Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After 32 min, there was no indication that RNAP had bypassed the terminal biotin–streptavidin roadblock to produce runoff transcripts (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the terminal biotin–streptavidin complex, retention of TECs at the desthiobiotin–TEG stall site was not absolute; after 32 min, ∼87% of TECs remained at the stall site (Fig. 3, A and B). Nonetheless, desthiobiotin–TEG outperformed the amino linker modification, which retained only ∼40% of TECs at the stall site after 32 min (Fig. 3, A and B). Last, we measured the rate at which RNAP bypasses the desthiobiotin–TEG modification site following promoter escape. Under our standard reaction conditions for internal RNA labeling (200 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP and 50 μm UTP), we observed an initial decay of t½ = 592 min (n = 2, R2 = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [541, 655]) (Fig. 4). In our first replicate, which included time points to 256 min, desthiobiotin–TEG bypass slowed after the 64-min time point. In our second replicate, which included time points to 64 min, modification bypass slowed after the 48-min time point (Fig. 4). Although the origin of this effect is unclear, it suggests that stalled TECs may be heterogeneous. We conclude that virtually all TECs initially stall upon encountering the desthiobiotin–TEG modification and that the vast majority of TECs persist at the stall site well beyond the reaction time of typical nascent RNA display experiments.Figure 4Time-dependent desthiobiotin–TEG bypass by E. coli RNA polymerase.

Many applications of chemical transcription roadblocking also depend on DNA template immobilization, which is typically achieved by attachment of a 5′-biotin–modified DNA template to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. It is therefore desirable for the DNA template to contain only one attachment point. One solution for this limitation is to sequester the desthiobiotin–TEG modification within the RNAP footprint before DNA immobilization. To test this approach, we first positioned RNAP at the U15 walk site so that the desthiobiotin–TEG modification is exposed (Fig. 5A). After incubation with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, ∼89% of U15 complexes partitioned into the bead pellet (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when RNAP was positioned at the desthiobiotin–TEG stall site, only ∼4% of stall site complexes were recovered in the bead pellet fraction (Fig. 5, A and B). Because the ability of desthiobiotin–TEG to bind streptavidin can be controlled by RNAP position, stall site–proximal elongation complexes can be enriched by exclusion from streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. To determine how the E. coli RNAP footprint interferes with desthiobiotin–streptavidin binding at nucleotide resolution, we distributed TECs using 3′-dNTP chain terminators before incubating the arrested complexes with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and separating pellet and supernatant fractions. In agreement with the established downstream border of E. coli RNAP on dsDNA (24Metzger W. Schickor P. Heumann H. A cinematographic view of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase translocation.EMBO J. 1989; 8 (2555184): 2745-275410.1002/j.1460-2075.1989.tb08416.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), elongation complexes 15 nucleotides or less upstream of the desthiobiotin–TEG modification were predominantly excluded from the bead pellet, whereas complexes upstream of this boundary were retained (Fig. 5C). Thus, use of desthiobiotin–TEG as a chemical transcription roadblock additionally provides a straightforward means of enrichment for stall site–proximal TECs by exclusion from streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The observation that the RNAP footprint sequesters desthiobiotin function enabled us to assess the stability of desthiobiotin–TEG–stalled TECs over long incubation times. We prepared a DNA template containing an internal desthiobiotin–TEG modification to stall RNAP and a 5′-biotin–TEG modification upstream of the promoter for DNA immobilization by attachment to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Fig. 6A). After TECs were positioned at the desthiobiotin–TEG stall site, the transcription reaction was incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads for 10 min, washed twice with transcription buffer supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 to remove free NTPs, and resuspended in this same buffer. Separation of bead pellet and supernatant fractions indicated that ∼98% of stalled TECs remained attached to the beads after 2 h of incubation at room temperature (Fig. 6, B and C). Thus, elongation complexes that are stalled at a desthiobiotin–TEG modification site retain the exceptional stability that is expected for ternary elongation complexes. For some applications, it may be desirable to block transcription using a smaller and less disruptive DNA modification, such as etheno-dA, which has been shown recently to halt E. coli RNAP efficiently in the presence of 100 μm NTPs (19Pupov D. Ignatov A. Agapov A. Kulbachinskiy A. Distinct effects of DNA lesions on RNA synthesis by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Using CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we have abrogated CD20 expression in five different malignant B-cell lines. We show that CD20 deletion has no effect upon B-cell receptor signaling or calcium flux. Also B-cell survival and proliferation is unaffected in the absence of CD20. On the contrary, we found a strong defect in actin cytoskeleton polymerization and, consequently, defective cell adhesion and migration in response to homeostatic chemokines SDF1α, CCL19 and CCL21. Mechanistically, we could identify a reduction in chemokine-triggered PYK2 activation, a calcium-activated signaling protein involved in activation of MAP kinases and cytoskeleton regulation. These cellular defects in consequence result in a severely disturbed homing of B cells in vivo."

These results indicate that microRNA-15 may be an initiator of molecular and cellular changes in major depression. In this study, we intend to examine how microRNA-15b in the nucleus accumbens works to be one of the essential epigenetic molecules that impair GABAergic neurons and lead to depressive disorder.

The tests of sucrose preference, Y-maze and forced swimming, were used to identify CUMS-induced depression-like behavior. Anti-microRNA-15b was done by microinjecting microRNA-15b antagomir into the nucleus accumbens. The effect of microRNA-15b was mimicked by microinjecting microRNA-15b agomir into this area. Synapse activities in the nucleus accumbens were monitored by electrophysiological whole-cell recordings in brain slices. Axon projections and synapse innervations were analyzed by neural tracing with AAV-conjugated fluorescent proteins.

After a week's accommodation, two groups of mice were placed into the control house and the house with CUMS for 3 weeks, respectively. Their mood state was assessed by the sucrose preference test (SPT), Y-maze test (YMT), and forced swimming test (FST). Compared with control mice, the mice in the CUMS house had an increased immobile time in the FST, a decreased sucrose preference, and a decreased M-arm stay time in the Y-arm maze. Values for immobile time are 142.8 ± 9.14 s in CUMS-treated mice (red symbols in Fig. 1B, n = 21) and 88.05 ± 7.7 s in control mice (open symbols; n = 15, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). SPT values in CUMS-treated mice are 68.31 ± 2.1% after the CUMS (red symbols in Fig. 1C) and 88.42 ± 1.06% before the CUMS (red symbols; n = 21, p < 0.001, paired t test). The ratios of the stay time in the M-arm to the stay time in total arms in CUMS-treated mice are 35.33 ± 2.29% after the CUMS (red symbols in Fig. 1D) and 46.72 ± 2.02% before the CUMS (red symbols; n = 21, p < 0.01, paired t test). Therefore, the CUMS induces the decreases in sucrose preference and social interaction as well as an increase of immobility in the forced swim, i.e. depression-like behavior in mice. We then examined cellular and molecular changes in the nucleus accumbens. Excitatory synaptic transmission was studied at GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens included in the coronal section of brain slices. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) were recorded under the whole-cell voltage-clamp. sEPSC amplitudes and frequencies appear to be decreased on GABAergic neurons from CUMS-induced depression mice, compared with control mice (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B illustrates the cumulative probabilities of sEPSC amplitudes in the CUMS-induced depression group (red symbols, n = 14 cells from five mice) and in the control group (open symbols, n = 15 cells from five mice). Fig. 2B, inset, shows that sEPSC amplitudes at 67% cumulative probability are 8.43 ± 0.34 pA in control mice and 6.17 ± 0.44 pA in the CUMS-induced depression mice (p < 0.001). Fig. 2C shows the cumulative probabilities of inter-sEPSC intervals in the CUMS-induced depression group (red symbols, n = 14 from five mice) and in the control group (open symbols, n = 15 cells from five mice). Fig. 2C, inset, shows that inter-sEPSC intervals at 67% cumulative probability are 526 ± 51.20 ms in the control mice and 1144 ± 104.7 ms in the CUMS-induced depression mice (p < 0.001). The decreased sEPSC amplitude and frequency indicate that excitatory synapses on GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens are deteriorated in the CUMS-induced depression mice. Excitatory synapse innervation from the medial prefrontal cortex to neurons in the nucleus accumbens was analyzed in the CUMS-induced depression mice and the control mice. GABAergic neurons in mouse brain were genetically labeled by green fluorescent protein (GFP). mCherry carried by adeno-associated viruses (AAV) was injected into the medial prefrontal cortex (see under “Experimental procedures” for details). Subsequently, these mice were placed in either a CUMS house or a control house for 3 weeks. The contacts (yellow) between presynaptic axonal boutons (red) from the medial prefrontal cortex and postsynaptic GABAergic neurons (green) in the nucleus accumbens were counted to be synapse innervations. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, excitatory synapse innervations on GABAergic neurons are lower in the CUMS-induced depression mice than in controls. The numbers of boutons on GABAergic neurons are 12.67 ± 0.64 per cell in the control group (open symbols in Fig. 3C; n = 27 cells from five mice) and 9.57 ± 0.4 per cell in the CUMS-induced depression group (red symbols; n = 35 cells from five mice; p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). This result indicates that excitatory synapse innervation to GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens from the medial prefrontal cortex is lowered in the CUMS-induced depression mice. To the functional and morphological down-regulations of excitatory synapses onto GABAergic neurons, we assumed that the expression of genes and proteins relevant to synapse structure and function was attenuated.

https://openalex.org/W3014073529,"Globally, groupers (Epinephelidae) that form fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) are highly vulnerable to overfishing and often require site-specific approaches to management. Over 5-years (2009-2013), we conducted underwater visual censuses (UVC) at a well-known spawning site at Njari Island, Gizo, Western Province, Solomon Islands, that supports aggregations of squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and brown-marbled grouper (E. fuscoguttatus). Findings show that while there were species-specific variations in the duration and timing of the spawning season, aggregation densities peaked from March to June, representing the main spawning season for all three species. For P. areolatus, gonad analysis from samples taken from 2008 to 2011 confirmed reproductive activity in support of density trends observed through UVC. Over the 5-year UVC monitoring period, FSA densities declined for P. areolatus and E. polyphekadion. Conversely, following the first year of monitoring, E. fuscoguttatus densities increased. These inter-specific differences may reflect variable responses to fishing as shown elsewhere, or for example, differences in recruitment success. In response to known declines in FSAs of these species, in 2018 the Solomon Islands government placed a nationwide ban on these species' harvest and sale between October and January. As this study shows, this ban does not encompass the peak aggregation period at Njari and will offer limited protection to other FSAs of these species that are known to vary in reproductive seasonality across the Solomon Islands. A more biologically meaningful and practical management strategy would be to implement a nationwide ban on the harvest and sale of these groupers each month between full and new moons when these FSAs form consistently throughout the country. Since effective management of FSAs typically requires a combined approach, spatial management that protects both spawning sites and reproductive migratory corridors is warranted."

Ribosome dimerization is thought to be reversible, with the dissociation of the 100S complexes enabling ribosome recycling for participation in new rounds of translation. The precise pathway of 100S ribosome recycling has been unclear. We previously found that the heat-shock GTPase HflX in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a minor disassembly factor.

Here, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that two essential translation factors, ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) and GTPase elongation factor G (EF-G), synergistically split 100S ribosomes in a GTP-dependent but tRNA translocation-independent manner. We found that although HflX and the RRF/EF-G pair are functionally interchangeable, HflX is expressed at low levels and is dispensable under normal growth conditions. The bacterial RRF/EF-G pair was previously known to target only the post-termination 70S complexes; our results reveal a new role in the reversal of ribosome hibernation that is intimately linked to bacterial pathogenesis, persister formation, stress responses, and ribosome integrity.

https://openalex.org/W3014062223,"Objectives Participation in the arts has well-documented benefits for health. However, participation in the arts is socially patterned, and it remains unclear why this is: what factors act as barriers or enablers of individual arts engagement. Therefore this study explored how individual characteristics predict individuals’ capabilities, opportunities and motivations to engage in participatory arts activities. Methods We analysed data from 6,867 adults in the UK (61.2% female, average age 46.7 years) who engage infrequently in performing arts, visual arts, design and crafts, literature-related activities, or online, digital and electronic arts. We constructed a structural equation model to explore the relationship between demographic factors (including age, sex, ethnicity or socio-economic status), health factors (including physical and mental health) or social factors (including living alone, urban density, loneliness or socialising) and perceived barriers to arts engagement. Results Individuals with poorer physical and mental health experienced more barriers affecting their perceived capabilities to engage in the arts, whilst individuals with poorer mental health also described experiencing more barriers affecting their motivations to engage. Individuals of lower SES reported more barriers in terms of opportunities to engage, whilst loneliness was related to more barriers around opportunities and motivations and living alone was associated with more opportunity barriers. Interestingly, adults who were older experienced fewer barriers relating to capabilities or opportunities, as did men, whilst being of white ethnicity was associated with fewer barriers across all three domains. Adults who were more socially engaged or who had poorer physical health experienced fewer barriers relating to motivations. Geographical area of dwelling was not related to any barriers. Conclusions This study has shown for the first time where the barriers leading to differential patterns of arts engagement lie. The findings could inform future behaviour change interventions designed to encourage arts engagement amongst individuals who are least likely to engage."
https://openalex.org/W3013632656,"Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the reduction in responses to a common stimulus that does not generalize, or only partially generalizes, to other stimuli. SSA has been studied mainly with sounds that bear no behavioral meaning. We hypothesized that the acquisition of behavioral meaning by a sound should modify the amount of SSA evoked by that sound. To test this hypothesis, we used fear conditioning in rats, using two word-like stimuli, derived from the English words ""danger"" and ""safety"", as well as pure tones. One stimulus (CS+) was associated with a foot shock whereas the other stimulus (CS-) was presented without a concomitant foot shock. We recorded neural responses to the auditory stimuli telemetrically, using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays in freely moving animals before and after conditioning. Consistent with our hypothesis, SSA changed in a way that depended on the behavioral role of the sound: the contrast between standard and deviant responses remained the same or decreased for CS+ stimuli but increased for CS- stimuli, showing that SSA is shaped by experience. In most cases the sensory responses underlying these changes in SSA increased following conditioning. Unexpectedly, the responses to CS+ word-like stimuli showed a specific, large decrease, which we interpret as evidence for substantial inhibitory plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3012991468,"Rice-crab culture is the characteristic rice ecological breeding model used in the Panjin area of Liaohe River Basin, China, and it can improve the ecological environment and create increased economic benefits. From a food perspective, both rice yield and quality, which are closely related to the fertilization mode, should be considered. However, the effect of different fertilization modes on rice quality has not been comprehensively investigated in this co-culture system. This study investigated the effects of three fertilization modes(FP1, FP2, and OPT) divided according to different fertilization types and methods on rice yield and quality, and set up a non-fertilized control group. In the rice-crab culture system, FP2 used fewer fertilizers and had a lower economic cost, and the yield was only slightly less than that of OPT(highest yield) but there was no statistical difference. FP2 elicited the best appearance quality and better cooking and eating quality among all treatment modes. Compared with CK, three fertilization modes significantly increased the protein content in rice and decreased the amylose content, which would lead to the deterioration of rice eating quality. However FP2 had the least protein increase and the least amylose reduction. There was no significant change in crude fat and starch content. Therefore, the FP2 fertilization mode was the best choice for the rice-crab culture system, as it significantly improved rice yield and increased rice quality at a relatively low cost."
https://openalex.org/W3013083002,"Background Opioid overdose mortality continues to increase in the United States despite significant investments to reverse the epidemic. The national response to-date has focused primarily on reducing opioid prescribing, yet reductions in prescribing have been associated with patients reporting uncontrolled pain, psychological distress, and transition to illicit substances. The aim of this study is to qualitatively explore chronic pain management experiences among PLWH with a history of illicit substance use after long-term opioid therapy reductions or discontinuations. Methods We analyzed 18 interviews, stopping upon reaching thematic saturation, with HIV-positive participants with a history of substance use who were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to assess the impact of prescribing changes among patients with chronic pain. Participants in this nested qualitative study had been reduced/discontinued from opioid pain relievers (OPRs) within the 12 months prior to interview. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two analysts coded all interviews, interrater reliability was measured, and coding discrepancies discussed. The study took place in San Francisco, California in 2018. Results Eleven participants were male with a mean age of 55; 8 were African American and 8 were White. All participants were HIV-positive, actively engaged in primary care, and had a lifetime history of illicit substance use. Twelve reported using illicit substances within the past year, including non-prescription opioids/heroin (10), and stimulant use (10). After being reduced/discontinued from their long-term opioid therapy, patients reported developing complex multimodal pain management systems that often included both nonpharmacological approaches and illicit substance use. Participants encountered a range of barriers to nonpharmacological therapies including issues related to accessibility and availability. Participants often reported attempts to replicate their prior OPR prescription by seeking out the same medication and dose from illicit sources and reported transitioning to heroin after exhausting other options. Conclusion After being reduced/discontinued from OPRs, HIV-positive patients with a history of substance use reported experimenting with a range of pain management modalities including nonpharmacological therapies and illicit substance use to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal and pain. Providers should consider that any change to a patients’ long-term opioid therapy may result in experimentation with pain management outside of the medical setting and may want to employ patient-centered, holistic approaches when managing patients’ opioid prescriptions and chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W3013441314,"Background The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Methods Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Results Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. Conclusion In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD."
https://openalex.org/W3013929504,"The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors for medical and productivity costs, and return to work (RTW) during the first two years after trauma in a clinical trauma population.This prospective multicentre observational study followed all adult trauma patients (≥18 years) admitted to a hospital in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands from August 2015 through November 2016. Health care consumption, productivity loss and return to work were measured in questionnaires at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after injury. Data was linked with hospital registries. Prognostic factors for medical costs and productivity costs were analysed with log-linked gamma generalized linear models. Prognostic factors for RTW were assessed with Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive ability of the models was assessed with McFadden R2 (explained variance) and c-statistics (discrimination).A total of 3785 trauma patients (39% of total study population) responded to at least one follow-up questionnaire. Mean medical costs per patient (€9,710) and mean productivity costs per patient (€9,000) varied widely. Prognostic factors for high medical costs were higher age, female gender, spine injury, lower extremity injury, severe head injury, high injury severity, comorbidities, and pre-injury health status. Productivity costs were highest in males, and in patients with spinal cord injury, high injury severity, longer length of stay at the hospital and patients admitted to the ICU. Prognostic factors for RTW were high educational level, male gender, low injury severity, shorter length of stay at the hospital and absence of comorbidity.Productivity costs and RTW should be considered when assessing the economic impact of injury in addition to medical costs. Prognostic factors may assist in identifying high cost groups with potentially modifiable factors for targeted preventive interventions, hence reducing costs and increasing RTW rates."
https://openalex.org/W3013110793,"Neuroinflammation is a major risk factor associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed but their long term use is associated with adverse effects. Thus, herbal based medicines are attracting major attraction worldwide as potential therapeutic candidates. Tylophora indica (Burm. f) Merrill is a valuable medicinal plant well known in Ayurvedic practices for its immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-asthmatic and antirheumatic activities. The present study aimed to elucidate the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of water and hydroalcoholic leaf extracts of micropropagated plants of T. indica using BV-2 microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide as an in vitro model system and development of an efficient reproducible protocol for its in vitro cloning. Non cytotoxic doses of the water and hydroalcoholic extracts (0.2μg/ml and 20μg/ml, respectively) were selected using MTT assay. α-Tubulin, Iba-1 and inflammatory cascade proteins like NFκB, AP1 expression was studied using immunostaining to ascertain the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of these extracts. Further, anti-migratory activity was also analyzed by Wound Scratch Assay. Both extracts effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide induced microglial activation, migration and the production of nitrite via regulation of the expression of NFκB and AP1 as the possible underlying target molecules. An efficient and reproducible protocol for in vitro cloning of T. indica through multiple shoot proliferation from nodal segments was established on both solid and liquid Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) media supplemented with 15μM and 10μM of Benzyl Amino Purine respectively. Regenerated shoots were rooted on both solid and liquid MS media supplemented with Indole-3-butyric acid (5–15μM) and the rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized and transferred to open field conditions showing 90% survivability. The present study suggests that T. indica may prove to be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent and may be further explored as a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Further, the current study will expedite the conservation of T. indica ensuring ample supply of this threatened medicinal plant to fulfill its increasing demand in herbal industry."
https://openalex.org/W3013707539,"Background Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients are at high risk for tumour recurrence and progression, hence an intensive follow-up procedure is recommended which is costly. Identification of factors that are associated with the risk of recurrence and progression may enable personalized follow-up schedules. Obesity and diabetes mellitus may be associated with a worse prognosis, but the evidence is limited and inconsistent. Our objective was to determine the associations of BMI and diabetes mellitus with risks of recurrence and progression among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Methods A population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer between 1995 and 2010 was retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited to participate in the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (n = 1,433). Average weight during adult life, height, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis were self-reported by use of a questionnaire. Clinical follow-up data were retrieved from medical files. Associations were quantified using proportional hazard analyses. For all analyses, minimal adjustment sets were selected using a Directed Acyclic Graph. Results Fourteen percent of the patients indicated to be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and more than half was overweight (45%) or obese (9%). Compared to healthy weight, overweight and obesity were not associated with risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86–1.22, and HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.76–1.38, respectively) and overall progression (HR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.74–1.44, and HR = 1.20; 95% CI: 0.69–2.09, respectively). Also, no clear associations of diabetes mellitus with risk of recurrence (HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.98–1.54) and overall progression (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.76–1.76) were found. Conclusion Average BMI during adult life and diabetes mellitus were not clearly associated with risk of recurrence or progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Prospective cohort studies with detailed information on BMI and diabetes mellitus before and after diagnosis are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3013989232,"Arteriovenous fistula puncture pain is a serious problem for patients undergoing dialysis and a good indication for topical anesthetics. No previous study has compared lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) with lidocaine tape for pain relief during arteriovenous fistula puncture in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. To this end, we conducted a multicenter randomized crossover study including 66 patients (mean age, 65.8 years; males, 57.6%) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis thrice/week. Subjects were assigned to Sequence EL (EMLA administration followed by lidocaine, with 1-week wash-out) or Sequence LE (reverse administration, first lidocaine then EMLA). All subjects completed the study. At each puncture site, 1 g EMLA (25 mg lidocaine + 25 mg prilocaine) or one sheet of lidocaine tape (18 mg lidocaine) was applied 1 h or 30 min prior to arteriovenous fistula puncture, respectively. The primary endpoint was puncture pain relief, which was measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, which was measured by SF-36, and safety. EMLA produced a 10.1-mm greater visual analog scale improvement than lidocaine tape (P = 0.00001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups, and no significant carryover/period effect was observed in any analysis. Further, no drug-related adverse events were observed. Taken together, these results suggest that EMLA cream is superior to lidocaine tape for the relief of arteriovenous fistula puncture pain in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.

https://openalex.org/W3010100083,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and major cause of mortality worldwide. One of the crucial steps for atherosclerotic plaque development is oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Through the oxidation, highly immunogenic epitopes are created and the immune system is activated. Association between atherosclerosis and periodontal diseases is well documented, and one of the main oral pathogens common in periodontitis is Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa). Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is an important virulence factor for Aa bacteria and a strong activator of the immune system. Cross-reactivity of HSP60 and oxidized LDL (OxLDL) antibodies could be a potential mechanism in the progression of atherosclerosis and one possible link between atherosclerosis and periodontitis. Human plasma samples from neonates and mothers were analyzed to determine if antibody titer to Aa-HSP60 protein is already present in newborns. Further objectives were to characterize antibody response in Aa-HSP60 immunized mice and to determine possible antibody cross-reaction with oxidized LDL. We demonstrated that newborns already have IgM antibody levels to Aa-HSP60. We also showed that in mice, Aa-HSP60 immunization provoked IgG and IgM antibody response not only to Aa-HSP60 but also to malondialdehyde acetaldehyde-modified LDL (MAA-LDL). Competition assay revealed that the antibodies were specific to Aa-HSP60 and cross-reacted with MAA-LDL. Our results suggest a possibility of molecular mimicry between Aa-HSP60 and MAA-LDL, making it intriguing to speculate on the role of HSP60 protein in atherosclerosis that manifests at young age."
https://openalex.org/W3013434029,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually-transmitted infection and the major cause of preventable blindness worldwide. The asymptomatic nature of many infections along with uncontrolled inflammation leads to irreversible damage in the upper genital tract and the tarsal conjunctivae, with the major complications of infertility and chronic pelvic pain, and blindness, respectively. Inflammation must, therefore, be tightly regulated to avoid an unrestrained immune response. The genetic factors that regulate inflammation through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways during C. trachomatis infection have not been fully characterized. SIGIRR (also known as IL-1R8 or TIR8) can regulate inflammation in response to various pathogens and diseases. However, nothing is known about its role during C. trachomatis infection. Expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8, was measured in epithelial cells infected with C. trachomatis. The effect of SIGIRR was determined by depleting SIGIRR or over-expressing SIGIRR in the epithelial cells before infection. Our results indicate that, in the absence of SIGIRR, epithelial cells induce higher levels of the pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8, in response to C. trachomatis infection. In addition, SIGIRR associates with MyD88 in both infected and uninfected infected cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that SIGIRR functions as a negative regulator of the immune response to C. trachomatis infection. This finding provides insights into the immuno-pathogenesis of C. trachomatis that can be used to treat and identify individuals at risk of uncontrolled inflammation during infection."
https://openalex.org/W3013481629,"The beneficial effects of omega (ω)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on major depressive disorder have been actively studied, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study examined the involvement of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopaminergic systems in behavioral changes in mice fed a diet high in ω-3 PUFAs. Mice fed a diet containing about double the amount of ω-3 PUFAs (krill oil (KO) diet) exerted shorter immobility times in the forced swim test (FST) than mice fed a control diet, containing only α-linolenic acid (ALA) as ω-3 PUFAs. The shorter immobility times were observed in both male and female mice. A dopamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, increased in the NAc in male mice fed the KO diet when compared with those fed the control diet. In addition, dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, and homovanillic acid increased in the NAc in female mice fed the KO diet. Notably, the effects of the KO diet on the immobility time in the FST were abolished by microinjection of sulpiride, an antagonist of D2-like receptors, into the NAc. A similar microinjection of an antagonist selective for D1-like receptors, SKF83566, also abolished the reduction in immobility in the FST. Moreover, we found that tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells increased in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice fed the KO diet. These results suggest that modulation of the VTA-NAc dopaminergic pathway is one of the mechanisms by which a KO diet rich in ω-3 PUFAs reduces the immobility behavior in the mouse FST."
https://openalex.org/W3013159206,"This study investigated the co-compost product of the shell and seed cake of Camellia oleifera Abel, which is a small evergreen tree in the family Theaceae. Tannin and saponin contents in compost samples at different time-points and their compositional changes, as well as their relationships with nutrients and compost maturity, were analyzed using an UPLC-triple-TOF/MS system. Our results showed that tannins in the compost samples mainly consisted of 11 phenolic acid compounds, of which four small-molecule phenolic acid compounds were found in low contents. Saponins mainly consisted of five saponin aglycones (A, B, C, D, E) and four of their derivatives in C. oleifera. Microbially secreted enzymes converted the large-molecule phenolic acid compounds into small-molecule compounds and their derivatives, while saponins were decomposed into saponin aglycones. Contents of tannin and saponin had correlations with the C/N ratio, germination index (GI), and the Solvita maturity index. After composting, the content of tannin was reduced to less than 1%, and the content of saponin was not more than 2%. And compost products were safe."
https://openalex.org/W3013324346,"Despite antiretroviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection results in neuroinflammation of the central nervous system that can cause HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HAND are unclear, however, they are likely due to both direct and indirect consequences of HIV-1 infection and inflammation of the central nervous system. Additionally, opioid abuse in infected individuals has the potential to exacerbate HIV-comorbidities, such as HAND. Although restricted for productive HIV replication, astrocytes (comprising 40–70% of all brain cells) likely play a significant role in neuropathogenesis in infected individuals due to the production and response of viral proteins. The HIV-1 protein Tat is critical for viral transcription, causes neuroinflammation, and can be secreted from infected cells to affect uninfected bystander cells. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade plays an integral role in restricting HIV-1 infection in part by negatively regulating HIV-1 Tat function. Conversely, Tat can overcome this negative regulation and inhibit β-catenin signaling by sequestering the critical transcription factor TCF-4 from binding to β-catenin. Here, we aimed to explore how opiate exposure affects Tat-mediated suppression of β-catenin in astrocytes and the downstream modulation of neuroinflammatory genes. We observed that morphine can potentiate Tat suppression of β-catenin activity in human astrocytes. In contrast, Tat mutants deficient in secretion, and lacking neurotoxic effects, do not affect β-catenin activity in the presence or absence of morphine. Finally, morphine treatment of astrocytes was sufficient to reduce the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation. Examining the molecular mechanisms of how HIV-1 infection and opiate exposure exacerbate neuroinflammation may help us inform or predict disease progression prior to HAND development."
https://openalex.org/W3013440995,"Congressional hearings are a venue in which social scientists present their views and analyses before lawmakers in the United States, however quantitative data on their representation has been lacking. We present new, publicly available, data on the rates at which anthropologists, economists, political scientists, psychologists, and sociologists appeared before United States congressional hearings from 1946 through 2016. We show that social scientists were present at some 10,347 hearings and testified 15,506 times. Economists testify before the US Congress far more often than other social scientists, and constitute a larger proportion of the social scientists testifying in industry and government positions. We find that social scientists' testimony is increasingly on behalf of think tanks; political scientists, in particular, have gained much more representation through think tanks. Sociology, and psychology's representation before Congress has declined considerably beginning in the 1980s. Anthropologists were the least represented. These findings show that academics are representing a more diverse set of organizations, but economists continue to be far more represented than other disciplines before the US Congress."
https://openalex.org/W3013035028,"The turnout of the lower extremities is the major component of the classical ballet positions (CPs) and correctly is initiated in the hips. The aim of this research was to determine the differences in the electromyographic and kinematic variables in the five CPs in ballet students with greater and lesser amount of passive hip external rotation (HER). A group of 14 female pre-professional ballet dancers 11–16 years of age participated in the study. Based on the amount of passive HER, participants with higher values made up greater rotation group (n = 7) whereas those with lesser values formed lesser rotation group (n = 7). Electromyographic activity of 14 muscles from right side of the trunk and right lower extremity was recorded with the surface electrodes while subjects were standing in all five CPs (CP1-CP5). The external rotation of the hips, knees and feet were recorded with the motion capture system. The kinematic differences between the groups were revealed in asymmetric positions CP4 and CP5 where foot progression angle was significantly lesser in forward than backward setting only in lesser rotation group. In lesser rotation group the ankle and back muscles were more engaged in CPs while abdominal and hip muscles less when compared with greater rotation group. This finding suggests that in the group with lesser passive HER the mechanism of forced turnout was employed. The most remarkable finding in our work was that various electromyographic patterns can be observed between groups in all CPs, while kinematic differences may be marked only in asymmetric positions."

Multivariable binary and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the cross-sectional associations between specific risk factors and diabetes status (diabetes, pre-diabetes, or neither) at W1 and the longitudinal associations between changes in risk factors and progression of diabetes status from W1 to W2, respectively.Mean time between waves was 7.0 years (SD 1.1). Prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes was 16% and 10% at W1 and increased to 30% and 16% at W2, respectively. The cross-sectional prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes was significantly higher among men, participants over the age of 45 years, and individuals who were overweight or obese or had metabolic syndrome (MS), three or more components of the MS, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, or elevated uric acid. In longitudinal analyses, remaining obese or gaining weight between waves was associated with an increased risk of developing pre-diabetes. A greater risk of developing pre-diabetes or diabetes was also observed among individuals who either maintained or acquired MS, elevated ALT, or elevated uric acid (only for diabetes) from W1 to W2.Weight gain and acquiring or maintaining MS, elevated ALT levels, or elevated uric acid were associated with a significant risk of developing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Our findings, especially in the context of the obesity epidemic in Mexico, point towards an urgent need for initiatives to help reduce excess weight in order to avert future cases of pre-diabetes and diabetes."

We examined the validity (content and construct validity) and reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) of the scale. Content validity was evaluated by the content validity index (CVI) and the average agreement CVI(S-CVI/Ave). The construct validity was assessed by exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha.The mean age of the 350 patients was 55.5±9.3years. The CVI was 0.71~1.0 and S-CVI/Ave was 0.92 respectively. By exploratory factor analysis, four factors were extracted which accounted for 52.15% of the total variance in the 23-item scale. The Chinese HFS-II displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.96).The Chinese version of HFSII had excellent psychometric properties and it could provide a useful tool for clinicians and nursing staff to assess the fear of hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W3013271562,"Studying the time course of gene expression in injured skeletal muscle would help to estimate the timing of injuries. In this study, we investigated large-scale gene expression in incision-injured mouse skeletal muscle by DNA microarray using correspondence analysis (CA). Biceps femoris muscle samples were collected 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, and RNA was extracted and prepared for microarray analysis. On a 2-dimensional plot by CA, the genes (row score coordinate) located farther from each time series (column score coordinate) had more upregulation at particular times. Each gene was situated in 6 subdivided triangular areas according to the magnitude of the relationship of the fold change (FC) value at each time point compared to the control. In each area, genes for which the ratios of two particular FC values were close to 1 were distributed along the two border lines. There was a tendency for genes whose FC values were almost equal to be distributed near the intersection of these 6 areas. Therefore, the gene marker candidates for estimation of the timing of injuries were detectable according to the location on the CA plot. Moreover, gene sets created by a specific gene and its surrounding genes were composed of genes that showed similar or identical fluctuation patterns to the specific gene. In various analyses on these sets, significant gene ontology term and pathway activity may reflect changes in specific genes. In conclusion, analyses of gene sets based on CA plots is effective for investigation of the time-dependent fluctuation in gene expression after injury."

In most riboswitches, binding of the ligand to the aptamer affects the structure of an expression platform, which regulates expression of the downstream genes. As a general rule, in an ON switch, binding of the ligand promotes expression of the regulated genes, whereas in an OFF switch, binding of the ligand leads to reduced expression of the regulated genes. In most ON switches, the effector molecule is utilized either as a substrate or exported out of the cell, resulting in a “feedforward” mechanism. In contrast, in most OFF switches, the associated genes are involved in biosynthesis or uptake of the effector molecule, resulting in a negative feedback control. The diversity of riboswitch-regulated genes and their recognized ligands leads to a number of exceptions to these general principles. Riboswitches are found primarily in bacteria, where they regulate gene expression at the level of transcription attenuation or translation initiation. Transcriptional riboswitches generally contain an intrinsic transcriptional terminator that leads to premature transcription termination. Folding of the RNA into an alternate antiterminator structure allows transcription to continue, and the gene is expressed. In an OFF switch, the antiterminator is more thermodynamically stable, and binding of the ligand causes stabilization of the terminator helix to repress gene expression. Translational riboswitches operate similarly, except that the terminator helix is replaced by a sequestrator helix that occludes the Shine–Dalgarno (SD) 2The abbreviations used are: SDShine–DalgarnoRNAPRNA polymeraseSHAPEselective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension2AP2-aminopurineNMIAN-methylisatoic anhydrideTPPthiamine pyrophosphate. region and prevents translation of the downstream gene, and the antiterminator is replaced by an antisequestrator helix that allows the ribosome to bind to the RNA and initiate translation (2Sherwood A.V.

The simplest model of riboswitch-mediated regulation suggests that the RNA senses physiological levels of the ligand and that the resulting change in RNA structure triggers the regulatory activity.

It has been proposed that, for transcriptional riboswitches, the kinetics of ligand binding and the rate of transcription play an important role in the regulatory decision (6Wickiser J.K.

During transcription, the aptamer domain is transcribed and folded first, with only a short window of opportunity for the ligand to bind before RNA polymerase (RNAP) reaches the decision point between termination and antitermination. For an OFF switch, if the aptamer domain folds and binds the ligand before RNAP completes transcription of the antiterminator sequence, the competing terminator helix forms, and termination occurs. However, if the ligand does not bind to the RNA in this timeframe, the more stable antiterminator forms, and transcription continues. Because of the speed of transcription, most transcriptional riboswitch RNAs do not reach equilibrium with the ligand before RNAP reaches the decision point (8Wickiser J.K. Cheah M.T. Breaker R.R.

Occupancy is also affected by the rate of dissociation of the ligand from the RNA (9Smith A.M. Fuchs R.T. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. The SAM-responsive SMK box is a reversible riboswitch.Mol.

Translational riboswitches differ from their transcriptional counterparts in that they can bind the ligand cotranscriptionally and posttranscriptionally. They therefore have the potential to establish thermodynamic equilibrium with their ligand (9Smith A.M. Fuchs R.T. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. The SAM-responsive SMK box is a reversible riboswitch.Mol.

If the half-life of the RNA-ligand complex is shorter than the half-life of the fully transcribed mRNA, then a translational riboswitch has the potential to make multiple reversible regulatory decisions in its lifetime. SAM-responsive S-box (SAM-I) RNAs are one of the most prevalent classes of riboswitches and are predominantly found in Firmicutes (3McCown P.J. Corbino K.A. Stav S. Sherlock M.E. Breaker R.R.

S-box riboswitches regulate genes that are involved in biosynthesis and uptake of methionine and SAM and operate primarily at the level of transcription attenuation (12McDaniel B.A. Grundy F.J. Artsimovitch I. Henkin T.M. Transcription termination control of the S box system: direct measurement of S-adenosylmethionine by the leader RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The well-characterized Bacillus subtilis yitJ transcriptional S-box riboswitch forms a highly stable complex with SAM in vitro, with a half-life of 7.2 min (7Tomsic J. McDaniel B.A. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Natural variability in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent riboswitches: S-box elements in Bacillus subtilis exhibit differential sensitivity to SAM in vivo and in vitro.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 (18039762): 823-83310.1128/JB.01034-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The high stability of the complex indicates that, when bound, SAM is not likely to dissociate in the timescale of transcription, making the binding and regulatory decision irreversible (13Lu C. Ding F. Chowdhury A. Pradhan V. Tomsic J. Holmes W.M. Henkin T.M. Ke A. SAM recognition and conformational switching mechanism in the Bacillus subtilis yitJ S Box/SAM-I Riboswitch.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 404 (20951706): 803-81810.1016/j.jmb.2010.09.059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The SMK-box (SAM-III) RNAs, another class of SAM-sensing riboswitches that regulate SAM synthetase (metK) genes at the level of translation initiation, exhibit a much less stable RNA–SAM complex with a half-life of ∼8 s (9Smith A.M. Fuchs R.T. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. The SAM-responsive SMK box is a reversible riboswitch.Mol.

A long SMK-box transcript half-life (∼3 min) provides the opportunity for multiple rounds of SAM association and dissociation, suggesting that the translational SMK-box riboswitch can act as a true reversible riboswitch and make multiple regulatory decisions in its lifetime (9Smith A.M.

SAM-responsive transcriptional S-box and translational SMK-box riboswitches employ different regulatory strategies (irreversible versus reversible) to regulate their respective genes. However, the two riboswitches are structurally different and recognize SAM using different mechanisms. Hence, it is unclear whether it is the level of regulation or the riboswitch structure that dictates the differences in the regulatory mechanisms. We therefore chose to compare the properties of transcriptional and translational SAM-responsive riboswitches from the same class in different organisms. We previously showed that different B. subtilis S-box genes show different properties (7Tomsic J. McDaniel B.A. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Natural variability in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent riboswitches: S-box elements in Bacillus subtilis exhibit differential sensitivity to SAM in vivo and in vitro.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 (18039762): 823-83310.1128/JB.01034-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); we therefore compared properties of the same gene. Our data show that the stability of the translational S-box RNA–SAM complex is significantly (8.6-fold) lower than the stability of the transcriptional S-box RNA–SAM complex, which may enable the RNA to make more than one reversible regulatory decision, unlike its transcriptional counterpart. We investigated elements within the riboswitch that might contribute to the differences in SAM binding properties and identified a nucleotide in the second internal loop of helix P3 whose identity correlates with predicted transcriptional versus translational regulation. Mutational analysis indicated that the identity of this residue affects the stability of the RNA–SAM complex, and selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis provided insight into the structural basis of the differences in ligand binding properties. These results indicate that this internal loop sequence plays an important role in determining the stability of the RNA–SAM complex in transcriptional and translational RNAs and, therefore, affects the molecular mechanism of S-box riboswitch function. Bioinformatic analyses have suggested that, in some non-Firmicutes, S-box riboswitches regulate gene expression by mechanisms other than transcription attenuation, based on the absence of a distinct terminator helix in the expression platform (16Vitreschak A.G.

The expression platform of this RNA is predicted to fold into two competing structures, a sequestrator helix that occludes the putative SD sequence and an antisequestrator helix that exposes the SD region. The metI gene encodes a putative cystathionine γ-synthase that catalyzes conversion of cysteine to cystathionine. This gene is followed by the gene encoding cystathionine β-lyase, which catalyzes conversion of cystathionine to homocysteine. In B. subtilis, these enzymes are encoded by the metIC operon (7Tomsic J. McDaniel B.A. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M.

The aptamer domain of the D. indicum metI RNA contains elements that have been shown previously to be important for SAM binding and for formation of structural elements such as the kink-turn and the pseudoknot (13Lu C.

We therefore compared the SAM binding properties of the D. indicum metI aptamer RNA with those of B. subtilis metI and other previously characterized S-box riboswitches (7Tomsic J.

Size-exclusion filtration assays were performed to determine the SAM binding affinities of the two metI riboswitches. The B. subtilis glyQS RNA, which is a T-box riboswitch that binds tRNAGly instead of SAM, was used as a negative control. The D. indicum metI aptamer RNA bound SAM with an affinity comparable with that of the B. subtilis metI RNA (Fig. 2A). A G residue in the junction between helices P1 and P2 (J1/2) has been shown previously to interact directly with SAM, and mutation of that G to C causes loss of SAM binding in the yitJ S-box aptamer RNA (13Lu C. Ding F. Chowdhury A. Pradhan V. Tomsic J. Holmes W.M. Henkin T.M. Ke A. SAM recognition and conformational switching mechanism in the Bacillus subtilis yitJ S Box/SAM-I Riboswitch.J. Mol.

Analogous mutations (G19C for D. indicum metI RNA and G39C for B. subtilis metI RNA) resulted in undetectable levels of SAM binding (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous results for yitJ. S-box riboswitches have also been shown to strongly discriminate against SAH, a natural analog of SAM (12McDaniel B.A. Grundy F.J. Artsimovitch I. Henkin T.M. Transcription termination control of the S box system: direct measurement of S-adenosylmethionine by the leader RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To test whether D. indicum S-box RNA exhibits similar selectivity against SAH, competition binding assays were performed with [3H]SAM, unlabeled SAM, and SAH. We found that unlabeled SAM but not SAH competed efficiently with [3H]SAM for binding to the aptamer RNAs, which indicates that the binding is specific for SAM (Fig. 2B). These data show that the aptamer domains of transcriptional and translational metI S-box riboswitches exhibit affinity and specificity for SAM as well as sensitivity to a mutation in J1/2, similar to that of the previously characterized S-box riboswitches (7Tomsic J.

The translational regulation model suggests that the sequestrator helix in D. indicum metI RNA undergoes a SAM-dependent structural transition that results in stabilization of the sequestrator helix that contains the SD region. We performed an RNase H cleavage assay to determine whether accessibility of the SD region decreases in response to SAM, as predicted by the model. The RNA was incubated with a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the SD region in the presence or absence of SAM, and the availability of the SD region was monitored by addition of RNase H, which cleaves RNA–DNA hybrids. A cleavage product was observed only in reactions that contained the oligonucleotide but lacked SAM (Fig. 3A), consistent with SAM-dependent stabilization of the sequestrator helix. These results indicate that the SD sequence is accessible to oligonucleotide binding (and therefore RNase H cleavage) in the absence but not in the presence of SAM, supporting the translational regulation model. SAM-dependent stabilization of the sequestrator helix is predicted to inhibit binding of the ribosome to the SD region, whereas in the absence of SAM, the formation of the antisequestrator helix should make the SD sequence available for ribosome binding. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we performed a primer extension inhibition (“toeprint”) assay. In this assay, when a transcribing RT encounters an obstacle on the RNA (e.g. the 30S ribosomal subunit or a strong secondary structure), it stalls, and primer extension is inhibited. When the initiator tRNAfMet is positioned in the P site of a bound 30S subunit, an RT stop (toeprint) is usually observed 16–17 nt downstream of the A of the AUG start codon (23Fredrick K. Noller H.F. Accurate translocation of mRNA by the ribosome requires a peptidyl group or its analog on the tRNA moving into the 30S P site.Mol.

Toeprinting assays: mapping by blocks to reverse transcriptase primer extension.Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77 (9770677): 283-295PubMed Google Scholar). D. indicum metI RNA was incubated with Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunits and initiator tRNAfMet in the presence or absence of SAM. Strong RT stops were observed at positions +16 and +17 nt downstream of the A in the AUG start codon in the absence of SAM. The intensity of the toeprint signal decreased ∼2-fold (2.1 ± 0.2; S.D., n = 3) in the presence of SAM (Fig. 3B). This suggests that addition of SAM shifts the RNA population into a conformation that inhibits ribosome binding, supporting the hypothesis that the SAM binding represses translation initiation. In the presence of SAM (Fig. S1, lane 2), RT stops were also observed at the 3′ ends of the aptamer domain (G125, C127) and the sequestrator helix (G188, A189). This suggests that both structures are stabilized in the presence of SAM, which supports our model of the OFF conformation. Interestingly, the intensity of these stops decreased upon addition of the 30S subunit and tRNAfMet (Fig. S1, lane 5), consistent with the model that binding of the 30S subunit can stabilize the ON conformation. Although the SAM-binding affinities of the transcriptional and translational RNAs were similar, the kinetics of SAM interaction may play an important role in dictating the regulatory strategies (25Coppins R.L.

The kinetics of ligand dissociation determine the stability of the RNA–ligand complex. A less stable RNA–ligand complex may provide an opportunity for multiple rounds of regulation by the riboswitch, whereas a more stable RNA–ligand complex could make the regulatory decision irreversible. We determined the stability of the translational metI S-box RNA–SAM complex using a 2-aminopurine (2AP)–based fluorescence assay. 2AP fluorescence is sensitive to local conformational changes in RNA (28Hall K.B. 2-aminopurine as a probe of RNA conformational transitions.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 469 (20946794): 269-28510.1016/S0076-6879(09)69013-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the fluorescence intensity decreases in response to base-stacking and ligand-binding interactions.

https://openalex.org/W3013238171,"Chromatin structure plays a decisive role in gene regulation through the actions of transcriptional activators, coactivators, and epigenetic machinery. These trans-acting factors contribute to gene expression through their interactions with chromatin structure. In yeast INO1 activation, transcriptional activators and coactivators have been defined through intense study but the mechanistic links within these trans-acting factors and their functional implications are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the crosstalk within transcriptional coactivators with regard to the implications of Snf2p acetylation during INO1 activation. Through various biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that both Snf2p and Ino80p chromatin remodelers accumulate at the INO1 promoter in the absence of Snf2p acetylation during induction. Furthermore, nucleosome density and histone acetylation patterns remained unaffected by Snf2p acetylation status. We also showed that cells experience increased sensitivity to copper toxicity when remodelers accumulate at the INO1 promoter due to the decreased CUP1 expression. Therefore, our data provide evidence for crosstalk within transcriptional co-activators during INO1 activation. In light of these findings, we propose a model in which acetylation-driven chromatin remodeler recycling allows for efficient regulation of genes that are dependent upon limited co-activators."
