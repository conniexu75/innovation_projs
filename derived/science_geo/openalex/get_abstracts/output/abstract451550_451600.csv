https://openalex.org/W2060531604,"Rosaceae is the most important fruit-producing clade, and its key commercially relevant genera (Fragaria, Rosa, Rubus and Prunus) show broadly diverse growth habits, fruit types and compact diploid genomes. Peach, a diploid Prunus species, is one of the best genetically characterized deciduous trees. Here we describe the high-quality genome sequence of peach obtained from a completely homozygous genotype. We obtained a complete chromosome-scale assembly using Sanger whole-genome shotgun methods. We predicted 27,852 protein-coding genes, as well as noncoding RNAs. We investigated the path of peach domestication through whole-genome resequencing of 14 Prunus accessions. The analyses suggest major genetic bottlenecks that have substantially shaped peach genome diversity. Furthermore, comparative analyses showed that peach has not undergone recent whole-genome duplication, and even though the ancestral triplicated blocks in peach are fragmentary compared to those in grape, all seven paleosets of paralogs from the putative paleoancestor are detectable."
https://openalex.org/W2114023704,"Adam Bass, Gad Getz and colleagues report whole-exome sequencing of 149 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) and whole-genome sequencing of 15 EACs. They identify a mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A>C transversions, as well as 26 genes mutated at high frequency in EACs. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 600% over the last 30 years. With a 5-year survival rate of ∼15%, the identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is greatly important. We analyze the mutation spectra from whole-exome sequencing of 149 EAC tumor-normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole-genome sequencing. We identify a mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A>C transversions at AA dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of exome data identified 26 significantly mutated genes. Of these genes, five (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, ARID1A and PIK3CA) have previously been implicated in EAC. The new significantly mutated genes include chromatin-modifying factors and candidate contributors SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1 and DOCK2. Functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 identifies increased cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway as a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2023186182,"The nuclear lamina (NL) interacts with hundreds of large genomic regions termed lamina associated domains (LADs). The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a ""molecular contact memory"" approach. In each nucleus, only ~30% of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL is linked to transcriptional repression and H3K9 dimethylation in single cells. Furthermore, we identify the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a as a regulator of NL contacts. Collectively, these results highlight principles of the dynamic spatial architecture of chromosomes in relation to gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2056079743,"In this study, the authors show that neuronal activity, induced by natural exploration, exposure to visual stimuli or optogenetic probe–mediated stimulation, can induce double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in neurons. The numbers of these DSBs were aggravated in the presence of amyloid precursor protein and depended on extrasynaptic NMDAR activity. We show that a natural behavior, exploration of a novel environment, causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons of young adult wild-type mice. DSBs occurred in multiple brain regions, were most abundant in the dentate gyrus, which is involved in learning and memory, and were repaired within 24 h. Increasing neuronal activity by sensory or optogenetic stimulation increased neuronal DSBs in relevant but not irrelevant networks. Mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), which simulate key aspects of Alzheimer's disease, had increased neuronal DSBs at baseline and more severe and prolonged DSBs after exploration. Interventions that suppress aberrant neuronal activity and improve learning and memory in hAPP mice normalized their levels of DSBs. Blocking extrasynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors prevented amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced DSBs in neuronal cultures. Thus, transient increases in neuronal DSBs occur as a result of physiological brain activity, and Aβ exacerbates DNA damage, most likely by eliciting synaptic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1966289658,"Polycystic kidney disease is marked by progressive growth of renal tubular epithelia and thus the formation of pathological cysts in the organ over time. Alessandra Boletta and her colleagues now show that this cystic growth has the hallmarks of the Warburg effect (that is, the primary reliance of cells on glycolysis for their energy demands) and that blocking this effect in vivo is sufficient to improve disease progression in two mouse models. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disorder characterized by bilateral renal cyst formation1. Recent identification of signaling cascades deregulated in ADPKD has led to the initiation of several clinical trials, but an approved therapy is still lacking2,3. Using a metabolomic approach, we identify a pathogenic pathway in this disease that can be safely targeted for therapy. We show that mutation of PKD1 results in enhanced glycolysis in cells in a mouse model of PKD and in kidneys from humans with ADPKD. Glucose deprivation resulted in lower proliferation and higher apoptotic rates in PKD1-mutant cells than in nondeprived cells. Notably, two distinct PKD mouse models treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), to inhibit glycolysis, had lower kidney weight, volume, cystic index and proliferation rates as compared to nontreated mice. These metabolic alterations depend on the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway acting in a dual manner by inhibiting the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis on the one hand while activating the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-glycolytic cascade on the other. Enhanced metabolic rates further inhibit AMPK. Forced activation of AMPK acts in a negative feedback loop, restoring normal ERK activity. Taken together, these data indicate that defective glucose metabolism is intimately involved in the pathobiology of ADPKD. Our findings provide a strong rationale for a new therapeutic strategy using existing drugs, either individually or in combination."
https://openalex.org/W2060631540,"Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed by pathologists for over a century. PGCCs contribute to solid tumor heterogeneity, but their functions are largely undefined. Little attention has been given to these cells, largely because PGCCs have been generally thought to originate from repeated failure of mitosis/cytokinesis and have no capacity for long-term survival or proliferation. Here we report our successful purification and culture of PGCCs from human ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer. These cells are highly resistant to oxygen deprivation and could form through endoreduplication or cell fusion, generating regular-sized cancer cells quickly through budding or bursting similar to simple organisms like fungi. They express normal and cancer stem cell markers, they divide asymmetrically and they cycle slowly. They can differentiate into adipose, cartilage and bone. A single PGCC formed cancer spheroids in vitro and generated tumors in immunodeficient mice. These PGCC-derived tumors gained a mesenchymal phenotype with increased expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44 and CD133 and become more resistant to treatment with cisplatin. Taken together, our results reveal that PGCCs represent a resistant form of human cancer using an ancient, evolutionarily conserved mechanism in response to hypoxia stress; they can contribute to the generation of cancer stem-like cells, and also play a fundamental role in regulating tumor heterogeneity, tumor growth and chemoresistance in human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2129905934,"Cellular decision-making is mediated by a complex interplay of external stimuli with the intracellular environment, in particular transcription factor regulatory networks. Here we have determined the expression of a network of 18 key haematopoietic transcription factors in 597 single primary blood stem and progenitor cells isolated from mouse bone marrow. We demonstrate that different stem/progenitor populations are characterized by distinctive transcription factor expression states, and through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis reveal positively and negatively correlated transcription factor pairings, including previously unrecognized relationships between Gata2, Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Validation using transcriptional and transgenic assays confirmed direct regulatory interactions consistent with a regulatory triad in immature blood stem cells, where Gata2 may function to modulate cross-inhibition between Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Single-cell expression profiling therefore identifies network states and allows reconstruction of network hierarchies involved in controlling stem cell fate choices, and provides a blueprint for studying both normal development and human disease. Gottgens and colleagues have analysed the expression of 18 haematopoietic factors in single primary blood and progenitor cells from mouse bone marrow. They delineate distinct states of expression for these transcription factors and identify regulatory relationships between the key factors Gata2, Gfi1 and Gfi2."
https://openalex.org/W2129300218,"Senescence affects the ability to utilize information about the likelihood of rewards for optimal decision-making. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we found that healthy older adults had an abnormal signature of expected value, resulting in an incomplete reward prediction error (RPE) signal in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that receives rich input projections from substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Structural connectivity between SN/VTA and striatum, measured by diffusion tensor imaging, was tightly coupled to inter-individual differences in the expression of this expected reward value signal. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) increased the task-based learning rate and task performance in some older adults to the level of young adults. This drug effect was linked to restoration of a canonical neural RPE. Our results identify a neurochemical signature underlying abnormal reward processing in older adults and indicate that this can be modulated by L-DOPA."
https://openalex.org/W2119872155,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a classic molecular marker of peptidergic primary somatosensory neurons. Despite years of research, it is unknown whether these neurons are required to sense pain or other sensory stimuli. Here, we found that genetic ablation of CGRPα-expressing sensory neurons reduced sensitivity to noxious heat, capsaicin, and itch (histamine and chloroquine) and impaired thermoregulation but did not impair mechanosensation or β-alanine itch—stimuli associated with nonpeptidergic sensory neurons. Unexpectedly, ablation enhanced behavioral responses to cold stimuli and cold mimetics without altering peripheral nerve responses to cooling. Mechanistically, ablation reduced tonic and evoked activity in postsynaptic spinal neurons associated with TRPV1/heat, while profoundly increasing tonic and evoked activity in spinal neurons associated with TRPM8/cold. Our data reveal that CGRPα sensory neurons encode heat and itch and tonically cross-inhibit cold-responsive spinal neurons. Disruption of this crosstalk unmasks cold hypersensitivity, with mechanistic implications for neuropathic pain and temperature perception.

CGRPα DRG neurons are required to sense heat and some pruritogens Cold sensation is enhanced after ablating CGRPα neurons in adult mice CGRPα afferents tonically cross-inhibit cold/icilin-responsive spinal neurons CGRPα primary sensory neurons contribute to thermoregulation and cold defense Somatosensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) detect distinct stimulus modalities, such as pain, temperature and itch, and then relay this information to postsynaptic neurons in the dorsal spinal cord (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I.

Nociceptors—noxious stimulus detectors.Neuron. 2007; 55: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the DRG, calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR) has long served as a molecular marker of peptidergic nociceptive neurons (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I. Bautista D.M. Scherrer G. Julius D. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain.Cell. 2009; 139: 267-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). CGRP-IR actually reflects expression of two peptides (CGRPα and CGRPβ) that are encoded by separate genes (Calca and Calcb), with Calca being expressed at higher levels in DRG neurons (Schütz et al., 2004Schütz B. Mauer D. Salmon A.M. Changeux J.P. Zimmer A. Analysis of the cellular expression pattern of beta-CGRP in alpha-CGRP-deficient mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 476: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite decades of research, it is unknown whether CGRP-IR DRG neurons are required to sense specific types of thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli. To facilitate functional studies of CGRP-IR DRG neurons, we recently targeted an axonal tracer (farnesylated EGFP) and a LoxP-stopped cell ablation construct (human diphtheria toxin receptor; hDTR) to the Calca locus (McCoy et al., 2012McCoy E.S. Taylor-Blake B. Zylka M.J. CGRPα-expressing sensory neurons respond to stimuli that evoke sensations of pain and itch.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This knockin mouse faithfully marked the peptidergic subset of DRG neurons as well as other cell types that express Calca. Using the GFP reporter to identify cells, we found that ∼50% of all Calca/CGRPα DRG neurons expressed TRPV1 and responded to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. Several CGRPα DRG neurons also responded to the pruritogens histamine and chloroquine. In contrast, almost no CGRPα DRG neurons expressed TRPM8 or responded to icilin, a TRPM8 agonist that evokes the sensation of cooling. Less than 10% of all CGRPα-expressing neurons stained positive for isolectin B4-binding (IB4) and few stained positive for Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), markers of nonpeptidergic and some peptidergic DRG neurons (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I.

Prostatic acid phosphatase is an ectonucleotidase and suppresses pain by generating adenosine.Neuron. 2008; 60: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggested that peptidergic CGRP-IR neurons might encode heat and itch, although direct in vivo evidence for this was lacking. To directly study the importance of CGRP-IR neurons in somatosensation, we took advantage of the LoxP-stopped hDTR that we knocked into the Calca locus. Neurons expressing hDTR can be selectively ablated through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diphtheria toxin (DTX) (Cavanaugh et al., 2009Cavanaugh D.J. Lee H. Lo L. Shields S.D. Zylka M.J. Basbaum A.I. Anderson D.J. Distinct subsets of unmyelinated primary sensory fibers mediate behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Diphtheria toxin receptor-mediated conditional and targeted cell ablation in transgenic mice.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Since Calca is expressed in cell types other than DRG neurons, we restricted hDTR expression to DRG neurons by using an Advillin-Cre knockin mouse, a line that mediates excision of LoxP-flanked sequences in sensory ganglia (Hasegawa et al., 2007Hasegawa H. Abbott S. Han B.X. Qi Y. Wang F. Analyzing somatosensory axon projections with the sensory neuron-specific Advillin gene.J.

Distinct Nav1.7-dependent pain sensations require different sets of sensory and sympathetic neurons.Nat Commun. 2012; 3: 791Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here, we provide direct evidence that CGRPα DRG neurons are required to sense heat and itch. Unexpectedly, we also found that CGRPα DRG neurons tonically inhibit spinal circuits that transmit cold signals, with ablation of CGRPα DRG neurons unmasking a form of cold hypersensitivity, a symptom that is associated with neuropathic pain. To selectively express hDTR in CGRPα-expressing DRG neurons, we crossed our Cgrpα-GFP knockin mice with Advillin-Cre knockin mice (Figure 1A) to generate double heterozygous “CGRPα-DTR+/−” mice. Histochemical studies revealed that hDTR was selectively expressed in CGRP-IR DRG neurons in CGRPα-DTR+/− mice (Figures 1B–1D; saline-treated mice) but was not expressed in other CGRP-IR cell types (data not shown). To ablate CGRPα DRG neurons, we injected CGRPα-DTR+/− mice i.p. with 100 μg/kg DTX (two injections, separated by 72 hr). Using immunohistochemistry, we observed a near-complete loss of all CGRP-IR and hDTR+ DRG neurons, with neurons defined by expression of NeuN (Figures 1E–1G, quantified in Figure 1H). We included neurons expressing low and high levels of CGRP-IR in our counts. There was also a significant reduction in the number of TRPV1+ and IB4+ DRG neurons in DTX-treated animals (Figure 1H, see Figure S1 available online), consistent with the known overlap between these markers and CGRP-IR (low and high) in the mouse (Cavanaugh et al., 2011Cavanaugh D.J.

Other sensory neuron markers were not affected (Figure 1H, Figure S1). We counted 26,616 and 20,657 NeuN+ DRG neurons in saline- and DTX-treated mice, respectively (n = 3 male mice/condition). We also looked more carefully at TRPM8+ neurons, some of which are myelinated (Neurofilament-200+; NF200+), while others are unmyelinated (NF200−) (Cain et al., 2001Cain D.M. Khasabov S.G.

Neurol. 2005; 493: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Neither of these subsets was affected in DTX-treated mice (saline-treated: n = 255 TRPM8+ cells examined, 39.0% ± 5.0% were NF200+ and 61.0% ± 5.0% were NF200−; DTX-treated: n = 253 TRPM8+ cells examined, 39.7% ± 7.8% were NF200+ and 60.3% ± 7.8% were NF200−). In the spinal cord, the axons of CGRP-IR DRG neurons terminate in lamina I, IIouter, and deeper lamina and partially overlap with IB4+ terminals (Zylka et al., 2005Zylka M.J. Rice F.L. Anderson D.J. Topographically distinct epidermal nociceptive circuits revealed by axonal tracers targeted to Mrgprd.Neuron. 2005; 45: 17-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Consistent with this fact, hDTR was colocalized with CGRP-IR in axon terminals (Figures 2A–2C) and only partially overlapped with nonpeptidergic IB4+ terminals in saline-treated mice (Figures 2G–2I). After DTX treatment, virtually all hDTR+ and CGRP-IR terminals were eliminated in the dorsal horn (Figures 2D–2F), while IB4+ terminals in lamina II remained (Figures 2J–2L). In contrast, DTX treatment did not eliminate PKCβII+ or PKCγ+ spinal neurons (Mori et al., 1990Mori M. Kose A. Tsujino T. Tanaka C.

Neurosci. 2010; 11: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and did not eliminate CGRPα-GFP+ spinal neurons in the dorsal horn (Figures 2M–2R) (McCoy et al., 2012McCoy E.S. Taylor-Blake B. Zylka M.J. CGRPα-expressing sensory neurons respond to stimuli that evoke sensations of pain and itch.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that >90% of all CGRPα DRG neurons and CGRPα afferents in spinal cord were ablated in adult CGRPα-DTR+/− mice. This ablation also eliminated ∼50% of all TRPV1+ DRG neurons. TRPV1 is the receptor for capsaicin and can be activated by thermal and nonthermal stimuli (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J.

In the epidermis of skin, CGRP-IR terminals are morphologically distinct from nonpeptidergic terminals, suggesting distinct sensory functions for peptidergic and nonpeptidergic DRG neurons (McCoy et al., 2012McCoy E.S.

To determine whether peptidergic endings were missing in DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice, we immunostained hindpaw sections with antibodies to CGRP and the pannerve fiber marker PGP9.5. We found that DTX treatment eliminated CGRP-IR terminals from the glabrous skin and hairy skin (epidermis and dermis) and from guard hairs (Figures 3A–3F, Figure S2). In contrast, DTX treatment did not eliminate CGRP-IR−, PGP9.5+ terminals, including terminals in the epidermis, hair follicles, and sweat glands (Figures 3A–3F, Figure S2, data not shown). Since ∼50% of all TRPV1+ DRG neurons were ablated in DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice (Figure 1H), we hypothesized that peripheral nerve responses to noxious heat might be impaired. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a skin-nerve preparation to quantify hot, cold, and mechanical responses of isolated C-fibers in the hindpaw of saline- and DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice (Koltzenburg et al., 1997Koltzenburg M. Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. Receptive properties of mouse sensory neurons innervating hairy skin.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; Pribisko and Perl, 2011Pribisko A.L. Perl E.R. Use of a near-infrared diode laser to activate mouse cutaneous nociceptors in vitro.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2011; 194: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We also mapped the distribution of noxious heat- and cold-receptive fields in this preparation by recording from the entire sural nerve (Figures 3G–3K). A near-infrared diode laser was used to control the intensity and location of heat stimulation (Pribisko and Perl, 2011Pribisko A.L. Perl E.R. Use of a near-infrared diode laser to activate mouse cutaneous nociceptors in vitro.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2011; 194: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In saline-treated mice, laser heat stimulation (using an intensity that is in excess of the threshold of most C-fibers) activated multiple units in all of the spots (Figures 3G, 3I, and 3K). However, in DTX-treated mice, activity was detected in only 38.1% ± 2.4% of the spots (Figures 3G, 3I, and 3K). This is a profound reduction, particularly given that a response was scored as positive if as few as one action potential was detected when recording from the entire sural nerve. When averaged over all 40 spots, significantly fewer heat-evoked action potentials were generated over the 2 s stimulation period in DTX-treated mice (Figure 3K). Furthermore, the laser heat threshold to activate isolated C-fibers was ∼2-fold higher in DTX-treated mice (Figure 3K). In contrast, there was no statistically significant change in the number of cold-responsive spots when recording from the entire sural nerve and no change in the cold threshold of activation in isolated C-fibers between groups (Figures 3H, 3J, and 3K). There was also no change in the mechanical thresholds of isolated C-fibers between saline- and DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice (Figure 3K). Taken together, these data demonstrate that ablation of CGRPα+ afferents causes a profound loss of noxious heat sensitivity in skin with no change in cold or mechanical sensitivity. To determine whether this profound physiological loss of heat sensitivity also affected behavioral responses to heat, we tested saline- and DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice using multiple heat-related behavioral assays (Table 1). For all of these experiments, we studied mice pre- and postsaline/DTX treatment and separately tested males and females. For the tail immersion assay, we placed the distal third of the tail into hot water (46.5°C or 49°C), then quantified latency to flick the tail. At both temperatures, there was a significant (∼2-fold) increase in the latency to flick in DTX-treated males and females (Table 1). Next, we placed the mice on a hot plate heated to 52°C and measured the latency to flick, lick, or shake a hindpaw. DTX-treated mice of both sexes exhibited over a 2-fold increase in withdrawal latency (Table 1). Finally, we pharmacologically activated the thermosensor TRPV1 by injecting 0.1 μg/μl capsaicin into the left hindpaw. We found that the DTX-treated male and female mice showed a 2-fold reduction in the time spent licking the capsaicin-injected hindpaw. Collectively, these experiments revealed that CGRPα DRG neurons were required to sense and behaviorally respond to noxious heat and capsaicin.Table 1Quantification of Heat, Mechanical, and Cold Behavioral AssaysBehaviorMaleFemaleHeatTail immersion (46.5°C)Latency to flick Presaline16.9 ± 1.3 s18.4 ± 1.4 s Postsaline13.6 ± 1.5 s16.7 ± 1.6 s Pre-DTX17.5 ± 1.4 s17.6 ± 1.7 s Post-DTX30.0 ± 2.7 s∗∗29.4 ± 3.5 s∗Tail immersion (49°C)Latency to flick Presaline5.3 ± 0.4 s6.1 ± 0.3 s Postsaline4.5 ± 0.4 s5.8 ± 0.5 s Pre-DTX5.7 ± 0.4 s5.8 ± 0.3 s Post-DTX13.6 ± 2.1 s∗∗17.3 ± 1.7 s∗∗∗Hot plate (52°C)Withdrawal latency Presaline14.6 ± 1.6 s17.2 ± 1.6 s Postsaline15.6 ± 2.0 s15.0 ± 1.3 s Pre-DTX14.6 ± 2.1 s18.0 ± 1.5 s Post-DTX35.9 ± 3.5 s∗∗∗37.1 ± 3.3 s∗∗∗CapsaicinTime spent licking Saline42.3 ± 3.9 s49.8 ± 1.9 s DTX18.5 ± 5.4 s∗∗24.7 ± 5.4 s∗∗MechanicalTail clipLatency to bite clip Saline5.7 ± 1.5 s3.7 ± 0.9 s DTX8.2 ± 2.0 s4.1 ± 0.4 sCotton swabPaw withdrawal frequency (%) Saline34.3% ± 7.2%56% ± 7.5% DTX51.3% ± 10.1%49% ± 5.5%ColdAcetoneTime spent licking Presaline6.4 ± 1.0 s7.1 ± 0.6 s Postsaline4.9 ± 0.7 s7.6 ± 1.0 s Pre-DTX6.0 ± 0.9 s5.8 ± 0.5 s Post-DTX10.9 ± 2.0 s∗13.0 ± 1.5 s∗∗Tail immersion (−10°C)Latency to flick Presaline48.2 ± 6.1 s39.6 ± 3.1 s Postsaline40.9 ± 5.3 s37.8 ± 6.9 s Pre-DTX56.0 ± 6.4 s40.1 ± 3.7 s Post-DTX26.3 ± 4.6 s∗∗28.6 ± 4.3 s∗IcilinNumber of flinches Saline10.9 ± 1.615 ± 1.2 DTX20.3 ± 1.7∗∗25 ± 3.4∗Cold plantar assayWithdrawal latency Presaline12.7 ± 0.8 s10.4 ± 0.8 s Postsaline12.4 ± 0.5 s10.5 ± 0.6 s Pre-DTX11.3 ± 0.6 s10.6 ± 0.6 s Post-DTX8.8 ± 0.4 s∗∗8.4 ± 0.4 s∗∗n = 6–26 mice/group, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, ∗∗∗p < 0.0005.

Heat and mechanical hypersensitivity are two common symptoms of inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I. Bautista D.M. Scherrer G. Julius D. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain.Cell. 2009; 139: 267-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). To determine whether CGRPα DRG neuron ablation impaired heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, we studied saline- and DTX-treated CGRPα-DTR+/− mice in the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain (Figures 4A–4F) and in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain (Figures 4G and 4H). We monitored heat and mechanical sensitivity before, during, and after saline/DTX treatment. We also monitored plasma extravasation in the noninflamed (contralateral) and CFA-inflamed hindpaw with Evans Blue dye. We found that plasma extravasation was increased in both groups of mice after inflammation of the hindpaw; however, plasma extravasation was significantly lower in the inflamed hindpaw of DTX-treated male and female mice (when compared to the inflamed paw of saline-treated mice; Figures 4A and 4B). This reduction supports a role for peptidergic, CGRP+ afferents in neurogenic inflammation (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I. Bautista D.M. Scherrer G. Julius D. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain.Cell. 2009; 139: 267-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). In both chronic pain models, heat withdrawal latencies increased to the cutoff time (20 s) after the second DTX injection and remained at this level for at least 2 weeks (Figures 4C, 4D, and 4G). Moreover, DTX-treated animals showed no sign of heat hyperalgesia after inflammation (CFA) or nerve injury (SNI). In contrast, mechanical sensitivity and hypersensitivity were not impaired in DTX-treated animals in either chronic pain model (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4H). Likewise, noxious (tail clip) and innocuous (cotton swab) mechanical sensitivity was not impaired in DTX-treated animals (Table 1). Taken together, these behavioral experiments provide direct evidence that CGRPα DRG neurons are required for noxious thermosensation but are not required for noxious or innocuous mechanosensation in vivo. Capsaicin-responsive DRG neurons respond to the pruritogens histamine and chloroquine (Imamachi et al., 2009Imamachi N. Park G.H. Lee H. Anderson D.J. Simon M.I. Basbaum A.I. Han S.K.

Since DTX-treated mice were less sensitive to capsaicin, we hypothesized that responses to pruritogens that act through capsaicin-responsive/TRPV1+ neurons might also be reduced. Indeed, we found that itch responses to histamine and chloroquine (CQ) were reduced by >80% in DTX-treated male and female mice (Figures 5A–5D), consistent with the observation that the number of DRG neurons expressing Mrgpra3, the receptor for CQ (Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Tang Z. Surdenikova L. Kim S. Patel K.N. Kim A. Ru F. Guan Y. Weng H.J.

In contrast, DTX-treated male and female mice showed normal itch responses to β-alanine, a pruritogen that activates Mrgprd and acts through nonpeptidergic Mrgprd+ neurons (Liu et al., 2012Liu Q. Sikand P. Ma C. Tang Z. Han L. Li Z. Sun S. LaMotte R.H. Dong X. Mechanisms of itch evoked by β-alanine.J.

Mrgprd enhances excitability in specific populations of cutaneous murine polymodal nociceptors.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8612-8619Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Figures 5E and 5F). Thus, ablation of CGRPα DRG neurons did not globally impair scratching but instead selectively impaired itch associated with capsaicin/heat-responsive neurons. Considering that ablation of CGRPα DRG neurons did not affect cold-evoked activity in peripheral nerves or the number of TRPM8+ neurons, we hypothesized that behavioral responses to cold temperature would not be altered after CGRPα neuron ablation. However, we found that DTX-treated mice (male and female) were significantly more sensitive to numerous cold and cold-mimetic stimuli, including acetone-evoked evaporative cooling of the hindpaw, tail immersion at −10°C, injection of 2.4 μg/μl icilin into the hindpaw (this concentration of icilin evokes behavioral responses that are TRPM8 dependent; Knowlton et al., 2010Knowlton W.M. Bifolck-Fisher A. Bautista D.M. McKemy D.D. TRPM8, but not TRPA1, is required for neural and behavioral responses to acute noxious cold temperatures and cold-mimetics in vivo.Pain. 2010; 150: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the cold plantar assay (Brenner et al., 2012Brenner D.S. Golden J.P. Gereau 4th, R.W. A novel behavioral assay for measuring cold sensation in mice.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e39765Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Table 1). In addition, we immobilized saline- and DTX-treated mice on a metal plate that could be set at temperatures ranging from very cold to noxious hot, then quantified hindpaw withdrawal latency (Gentry et al., 2010Gentry C. Stoakley N. Andersson D.A. Bevan S. The roles of iPLA2, TRPM8 and TRPA1 in chemically induced cold hypersensitivity.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Remarkably, DTX-treated mice withdrew their hindpaws significantly faster at 5°C and 10°C (Figures 6A and 6B ), indicating enhanced sensitivity to cold. Conversely, at temperatures at or above 45°C, DTX-treated mice took significantly longer to withdraw their hindpaws (Figures 6A and 6B), consistent with our data above showing reduced heat sensitivity after ablation. No differences were observed at any temperature between groups prior to saline/DTX treatment (Figures 6A and 6B). As an additional control, we found that DTX-treatment did not affect heat or cold sensory responses in wild-type mice or body weight (Figure S4), consistent with other studies (Cavanaugh et al., 2009Cavanaugh D.J. Lee H. Lo L. Shields S.D. Zylka M.J. Basbaum A.I. Anderson D.J. Distinct subsets of unmyelinated primary sensory fibers mediate behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9075-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We noticed that the fur of DTX-treated mice appeared disheveled and piloerected, suggesting the mice might feel cold at room temperature and/or that there was a problem with their fur (note that DTX-treated mice showed no visible shivering). Thus, to examine thermoregulation and fur barrier function, we briefly immersed (2 min) saline- and DTX-treated mice in warm water, then measured their ability to thermoregulate and to repel water (Figures 6C–6F). Immersion causes whole-body warming, as evidenced by increased core body temperature, followed by whole-body evaporative cooling when removed from the warm water. While there were no differences between the groups prior to immersion or when warmed, immediately after removal from the warm water, the core body temperature of DTX-treated mice dropped significantly lower than that of saline-treated mice and took longer to recover (Figures 6C and 6E, on days 3 and 6 after saline/DTX treatment). Moreover, on day 6, core body temperature at baseline was significantly lower in DTX-treated mice when compared to saline-treated controls (Figure 6E). These data collectively indicate that CGRPα DRG neurons play a critical role in thermoregulatory mechanisms after whole-body cooling. In the same assay, DTX-treated mice repelled water to the same extent as saline-treated mice 3 days after saline/DTX treatment (Figure 6D) b"
https://openalex.org/W2155654111,"The hippocampus frequently replays memories of past experiences during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events. These events can represent spatial trajectories extending from the animal's current location to distant locations, suggesting a role in the evaluation of upcoming choices. While SWRs have been linked to learning and memory, the specific role of awake replay remains unclear. Here we show that there is greater coordinated neural activity during SWRs preceding correct, as compared to incorrect, trials in a spatial alternation task. As a result, the proportion of cell pairs coactive during SWRs was predictive of subsequent correct or incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect was seen specifically during early learning, when the hippocampus is essential for task performance. SWR activity preceding correct trials represented multiple trajectories that included both correct and incorrect options. These results suggest that reactivation during awake SWRs contributes to the evaluation of possible choices during memory-guided decision making."

Here, the authors generated BAF53b mutant and rescue mice to show that postnatal nucleosome modeling is crucial to hippocampal synaptic plasticity, neuronal morphology and memory performance. Recent exome sequencing studies have implicated polymorphic Brg1-Associated Factor (BAF) complexes (mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes) in several human intellectual disabilities and cognitive disorders. However, it is currently unknown how mutations in BAF complexes result in impaired cognitive function. Postmitotic neurons express a neuron-specific assembly, nBAF, characterized by the neuron-specific subunit BAF53b. Mice harboring selective genetic manipulations of BAF53b have severe defects in long-term memory and long-lasting forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We rescued memory impairments in BAF53b mutant mice by reintroducing BAF53b in the adult hippocampus, which suggests a role for BAF53b beyond neuronal development. The defects in BAF53b mutant mice appeared to derive from alterations in gene expression that produce abnormal postsynaptic components, such as spine structure and function, and ultimately lead to deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our results provide new insight into the role of dominant mutations in subunits of BAF complexes in human intellectual and cognitive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2083829293,"Synaptic abnormalities and learning dysfunction are prominent characteristics of Down's syndrome. Now Huaxi Xu and colleagues show that expression of the protein SNX27 is reduced in Down's syndrome brains and that restoring its expression can ameliorate learning dysfunction in a mouse model of the disease. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a brain-enriched PDZ domain protein, regulates endocytic sorting and trafficking. Here we show that Snx27−/− mice have severe neuronal deficits in the hippocampus and cortex. Although Snx27+/− mice have grossly normal neuroanatomy, we found defects in synaptic function, learning and memory and a reduction in the amounts of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA receptors) in these mice. SNX27 interacts with these receptors through its PDZ domain, regulating their recycling to the plasma membrane. We demonstrate a concomitant reduced expression of SNX27 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) in Down's syndrome brains and identify C/EBPβ as a transcription factor for SNX27. Down's syndrome causes overexpression of miR-155, a chromosome 21–encoded microRNA that negatively regulates C/EBPβ, thereby reducing SNX27 expression and resulting in synaptic dysfunction. Upregulating SNX27 in the hippocampus of Down's syndrome mice rescues synaptic and cognitive deficits. Our identification of the role of SNX27 in synaptic function establishes a new molecular mechanism of Down's syndrome pathogenesis."

Unlike most filariae, L. loa lacks an obligate intracellular Wolbachia endosymbiont, and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the L. loa genome does not contain new metabolic synthesis or transport pathways compared to other filariae. Loa loa, the African eyeworm, is a major filarial pathogen of humans. Unlike most filariae, L. loa does not contain the obligate intracellular Wolbachia endosymbiont. We describe the 91.4-Mb genome of L. loa and that of the related filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and predict 14,907 L. loa genes on the basis of microfilarial RNA sequencing. By comparing these genomes to that of another filarial parasite, Brugia malayi, and to those of several other nematodes, we demonstrate synteny among filariae but not with nonparasitic nematodes. The L. loa genome encodes many immunologically relevant genes, as well as protein kinases targeted by drugs currently approved for use in humans. Despite lacking Wolbachia, L. loa shows no new metabolic synthesis or transport capabilities compared to other filariae. These results suggest that the role of Wolbachia in filarial biology is more subtle than previously thought and reveal marked differences between parasitic and nonparasitic nematodes."

As top predators, falcons possess unique morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow them to be successful hunters: for example, the peregrine is renowned as the world's fastest animal. To examine the evolutionary basis of predatory adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of both the peregrine (Falco peregrinus) and saker falcon (Falco cherrug), and we present parallel, genome-wide evidence for evolutionary innovation and selection for a predatory lifestyle.

https://openalex.org/W2163233331,"In the hippocampus, cell assemblies forming mnemonic representations of space are thought to arise as a result of changes in functional connections of pyramidal cells. We have found that CA1 interneuron circuits are also reconfigured during goal-oriented spatial learning through modification of inputs from pyramidal cells. As learning progressed, new pyramidal assemblies expressed in theta cycles alternated with previously established ones, and eventually overtook them. The firing patterns of interneurons developed a relationship to new, learning-related assemblies: some interneurons associated their activity with new pyramidal assemblies while some others dissociated from them. These firing associations were explained by changes in the weight of monosynaptic inputs received by interneurons from new pyramidal assemblies, as these predicted the associational changes. Spatial learning thus engages circuit modifications in the hippocampus that incorporate a redistribution of inhibitory activity that might assist in the segregation of competing pyramidal cell assembly patterns in space and time."

Additionally, dopamine-releasing events-temporally surrounding stimulus-reward associations-selectively enhance memory. These forms of plasticity may be evoked by selective modulation of stimulus representations during dopamine-inducing events. However, it remains to be shown whether dopaminergic signals can selectively modulate visual cortical activity. We measured fMRI activity in monkey visual cortex during reward-only trials apart from intermixed cue-reward trials. Reward without visual stimulation selectively decreased fMRI activity within the cue representations that had been paired with reward during other trials. Behavioral tests indicated that these same uncued reward trials strengthened cue-reward associations. Furthermore, such spatially-specific activity modulations depended on prediction error, as shown by manipulations of reward magnitude, cue-reward probability, cue-reward familiarity, and dopamine signaling. This cue-selective negative reward signal offers a mechanism for selectively gating sensory cortical plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2080422007,"The stromal compartment surrounding epithelial-derived pancreatic tumors is thought to have a key role in the aggressive phenotype of this malignancy. Emerging evidence suggests that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant cells in the stroma of pancreatic tumors, contribute to the tumor's invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapy, but the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate CAFs behavior are poorly understood. In this study, we utilized immortalized human pancreatic CAFs to investigate molecular pathways that control the matrix-remodeling and invasion-promoting activity of CAFs. We showed previously that palladin, an actin-associated protein, is expressed at high levels in CAFs of pancreatic tumors and other solid tumors, and also in an immortalized line of human CAFs. In this study, we found that short-term exposure of CAFs to phorbol esters reduced the number of stress fibers and triggered the appearance of individual invadopodia and invadopodial rosettes in CAFs. Molecular analysis of invadopodia revealed that their composition resembled that of similar structures (that is, invadopodia and podosomes) described in other cell types. Pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that protein kinase C, the small GTPase Cdc42 and palladin were necessary for the efficient assembly of invadopodia by CAFs. In addition, GTPase activity assays showed that palladin contributes to the activation of Cdc42. In mouse xenograft experiments using a mixture of CAFs and tumor cells, palladin expression in CAFs promoted the rapid growth and metastasis of human pancreatic tumor cells. Overall, these results indicate that high levels of palladin expression in CAFs enhance their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix by regulating the activity of Cdc42, which in turn promotes the assembly of matrix-degrading invadopodia in CAFs and tumor cell invasion. Together, these results identify a novel molecular signaling pathway that may provide new molecular targets for the inhibition of pancreatic cancer metastasis."

MRN exists in at least two distinct conformational states, dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Rad50 protein. Here we use an ATP analog-sensitive form of ATM to determine that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, by Rad50 is essential for MRN stimulation of ATM. Mre11 nuclease activity is dispensable, although some mutations in the Mre11 catalytic domain block ATM activation independent of nuclease function, as does the mirin compound. The coiled-coil domains of Rad50 are important for the DNA binding ability of MRN and are essential for ATM activation, but loss of the zinc hook connection can be substituted by higher levels of the complex. Nbs1 binds to the ""closed"" form of the MR complex, promoted by the zinc hook and by ATP binding. Thus the primary role of the hook is to tether Rad50 monomers together, promoting the association of the Rad50 catalytic domains into a form that binds ATP and also binds Nbs1. Collectively, these results show that the ATP-bound form of MRN is the critical conformation for ATM activation."

We found that human MAIT cells can be reprogrammed into iPSCs using a Sendai virus harboring standard reprogramming factors. Under T cell-permissive conditions, these iPSCs efficiently redifferentiate into MAIT-like lymphocytes expressing the T cell receptor Vα7.2, CD161, and interleukin-18 receptor chain α. Upon incubation with bacteria-fed monocytes, the derived MAIT cells show enhanced production of a broad range of cytokines. Following adoptive transfer into immunocompromised mice, these cells migrate to the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and intestine and protect against Mycobacterium abscessus. Our findings pave the way for further functional analysis of MAIT cells and determination of their therapeutic potential."

Here, we focused on the syndecan-1 heparan sulfate proteoglycan, a highly conserved, multifunctional receptor that we previously showed to undergo raft-dependent endocytosis upon clustering. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of three to five consecutive cytoplasmic residues at a time revealed that a conserved juxtamembrane motif, MKKK, was the only region required for efficient endocytosis after clustering. Endocytosis of clustered syndecan-1 occurs in two phases, each requiring a kinase and a corresponding cytoskeletal partner. In the initial phase, ligands trigger rapid MKKK-dependent activation of ERK and the localization of syndecan-1 into rafts. Activation of ERK drives the dissociation of syndecan-1 from α-tubulin, a molecule that may act as an anchor for syndecan-1 at the plasma membrane in the basal state. In the second phase, Src family kinases phosphorylate tyrosyl residues within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of syndecan-1, a process that also requires MKKK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecan-1 triggers the robust recruitment of cortactin, which we found to be an essential mediator of efficient actin-dependent endocytosis. These findings represent the first detailed characterization of the molecular events that drive endocytosis of a raft-dependent receptor and identify a novel endocytic motif, MKKK.

It is increasingly accepted that the refractory feature of GBM to current therapies stems from the existence of few tumorigenic cells that sustain tumor growth and spreading, the so-called glioma-initiating cells (GICs). Previous studies showed that cytokines of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family induce differentiation of the GICs, and thus act as tumor suppressors. Molecular pathways that explain this behavior of BMP cytokines remain largely elusive. Here, we show that BMP signaling induces Smad-dependent expression of the transcriptional regulator Snail in a rapid and sustained manner. Consistent with its already established promigratory function in other cell types, we report that Snail silencing decreases GBM cell migration. Consequently, overexpression of Snail increases GBM invasiveness in a mouse xenograft model. Surprisingly, we found that Snail depletes the GBM capacity to form gliomaspheres in vitro and to grow tumors in vivo, both of which are important features shared by GICs. Thus Snail, acting downstream of BMP signaling, dissociates the invasive capacity of GBM cells from their tumorigenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2058240476,"Constrained ligands activate a canonical ER pathway via a common structural mechanism, whereas dynamic ligands rewire the canonical pathway; DBD-dependent activity interferes with canonical ER proliferative signals and associates with a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Ligand-binding dynamics control allosteric signaling through the estrogen receptor-α (ERα), but the biological consequences of such dynamic binding orientations are unknown. Here, we compare a set of ER ligands having dynamic binding orientation (dynamic ligands) with a control set of isomers that are constrained to bind in a single orientation (constrained ligands). Proliferation of breast cancer cells directed by constrained ligands is associated with DNA binding, coactivator recruitment and activation of the estrogen-induced gene GREB1, reflecting a highly interconnected signaling network. In contrast, proliferation driven by dynamic ligands is associated with induction of ERα-mediated transcription in a DNA-binding domain (DBD)-dependent manner. Further, dynamic ligands showed enhanced anti-inflammatory activity. The DBD-dependent profile was predictive of these signaling patterns in a larger diverse set of natural and synthetic ligands. Thus, ligand dynamics directs unique signaling pathways and reveals a new role of the DBD in allosteric control of ERα-mediated signaling."

However, the source of Wnt ligands and their targeting cells and action mechanism in tooth organogenesis remain largely elusive. Here we show that epithelial inactivation of Gpr177, the mouse Wntless (Wls) whose product regulates Wnt sorting and secretion, leads to arrest of tooth development at the early cap stage and abrogates tooth-forming capability of the dental epithelium. Gpr177 in the epithelium is necessary for the activation of canonical Wnt signaling in the dental epithelium and formation of a functional enamel knot. Epithelial deletion of Gpr177 results in defective gene expression and cellular behavior in the dental epithelium but does not alter odontogenic program in the mesenchyme. Furthermore, deletion of Axin2, a negative intracellular regulator of canonical Wnt signaling, rescues the tooth defects in mice carrying Gpr177 mutation in the dental epithelium. Together with the fact that active Wnt canonical signaling is present predominantly in the dental epithelium during tooth development, our results demonstrate that Gpr177-mediated Wnt ligands in the dental epithelium act primarily in an intra-epithelial context to regulate enamel knot formation and subsequent tooth development.

https://openalex.org/W1968575141,"Polyamine biosynthesis is a key drug target in African trypanosomes. The “resurrection drug” eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine), which is used clinically to treat human African trypanosomiasis, inhibits the first step in polyamine (spermidine) biosynthesis, a highly regulated pathway in most eukaryotic cells. Previously, we showed that activity of a key trypanosomatid spermidine biosynthetic enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, is regulated by heterodimer formation with a catalytically dead paralog (a prozyme). Here, we describe an expansion of this prozyme paradigm to the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase, which is required for spermidine-dependent hypusine modification of a lysine residue in the essential translation factor eIF5A. Trypanosoma brucei encodes two deoxyhypusine synthase paralogs, one that is catalytically functional but grossly impaired, and the other is inactive. Co-expression in Escherichia coli results in heterotetramer formation with a 3000-fold increase in enzyme activity.

Conclusion: Trypanosomatid DHS is a complex between catalytically impaired and inactive DHS subunits. Significance: This activation mechanism uniquely evolved for two independent enzymes within the trypanosomatid polyamine pathway. Trypanosomatid parasites cause several fatal vector-borne human diseases, including the following: human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), 3The abbreviations used are: HAT, human African trypanosomiasis; AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase; TbDHSc, T. brucei deoxyhypusine synthase (catalytic subunit); TbDHSp, T. brucei deoxyhypusine synthase prozyme (activating) subunit; HsDHS, human DHS; eIF5A, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A prior to hypusine modification; eIF5A-h, eIF5A with hypusine modification; BSF, bloodstream form T. brucei; GC7, N1-guanyl-N7-diaminoheptane; Tet, tetracycline; Dox, doxycycline; SKO, single knockout cell line; cDKO, Tet-regulated conditional double knockout cell line; qPCR, quantitative PCR.

Kinetoplastids: related protozoan pathogens, different diseases.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Together, these parasites infect more than 20 million people primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. In particular, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense, the causative agents of HAT, are endemic in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and are responsible for a debilitating neurological disease that invariably leads to death if untreated. Eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine) is a suicide inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Fig. 1A), which in combination with nifurtimox, is a front line treatment for HAT, demonstrating the importance of polyamine function for parasite growth (2Willert E. Phillips M.A. Regulation and function of polyamines in African trypanosomes.Trends Parasitol. 2012; 28: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cationic polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) are essential for growth of most eukaryotic cells and have been explored as potential targets for the treatment of both infectious disease and cancer (2Willert E.

Polyamine catabolism and disease.Biochem. J. 2009; 421: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Spermidine has been implicated in the regulation of translation and transcription, modulation of chromatin structure, and ion channel function (4Pegg A.E. Casero Jr., R.A.

Mammalian polyamine metabolism and function.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In addition, in trypanosomatids spermidine is used in the synthesis of trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), required to maintain intracellular thiol-redox balance (6Fairlamb A.H.

Biosynthesis and metabolism of polyamines are tightly controlled; in mammalian cells regulation is orchestrated by a complex array of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms (3Casero R.A.

Current status of the polyamine research field.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 720: 3-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that are generally lacking in trypanosomatids. Instead, these parasites have evolved a novel mechanism to control activity and expression of a key enzyme required for spermidine biosynthesis, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) (2Willert E. Phillips M.A. Regulation and function of polyamines in African trypanosomes.Trends Parasitol. 2012; 28: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that the functional trypanosomatid AdoMetDC was a heterodimer between a catalytically impaired subunit and a catalytically dead paralog, both of which were essential for cell growth (8Willert E.K. Fitzpatrick R. Phillips M.A. Allosteric regulation of an essential trypanosome polyamine biosynthetic enzyme by a catalytically dead homolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8275-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Willert E.K. Phillips M.A. Regulated expression of an essential allosteric activator of polyamine biosynthesis in African trypanosomes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We defined the term prozyme to describe activating subunits that arose via gene duplication of their partner enzyme. Heterodimer formation between AdoMetDC and the AdoMetDC prozyme led to a 1200-fold activation of AdoMetDC activity. Furthermore, the AdoMetDC prozyme protein levels appear to be translationally regulated, suggesting T. brucei modulates prozyme expression to control AdoMetDC activity and flux through the polyamine pathway (9Willert E.K. Phillips M.A. Regulated expression of an essential allosteric activator of polyamine biosynthesis in African trypanosomes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A specialized yet essential function of the polyamine spermidine in eukaryotic cells is to serve as a precursor for the hypusine modification of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) (10Park M.H. Nishimura K. Zanelli C.F. Valentini S.R. Functional significance of eIF5A and its hypusine modification in eukaryotes.Amino Acids. 2010; 38: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Hypusine-modified IF5A is present in both eukaryotes and archaea; although its functions are poorly understood, eIF5A is essential in yeast and mammalian cells (11Nishimura K. Lee S.B. Park J.H. Park M.H. Essential role of eIF5A-1 and deoxyhypusine synthase in mouse embryonic development.Amino Acids. 2012; 42: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the eIF5A homolog elongation factor P, which is lysinylated instead of hypusinated, was shown to relieve ribosome stalling in the presence of polyproline tracks (12Ude S. Lassak J. Starosta A.L. Kraxenberger T. Wilson D.N. Jung K.

Peske F. Urlaub H. Rodnina M.V. EF-P is essential for rapid synthesis of proteins containing consecutive proline residues.Science. 2013; 339: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In yeast, eIF5A associates with translating ribosomes in a hypusine-dependent manner and is required for translation elongation (14Saini P. Eyler D.E. Green R. Dever T.E. Hypusine-containing protein eIF5A promotes translation elongation.Nature. 2009; 459: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Li C.H. Ohn T. Ivanov P. Tisdale S. Anderson P. eIF5A promotes translation elongation, polysome disassembly, and stress granule assembly.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Synthesis of hypusine requires two enzymatic reactions catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. DHS catalyzes the modification of eIF5A to eIF5A-deoxyhypusine in a four-step NAD+-dependent reaction that proceeds through two imine intermediates (Fig. 1A and Scheme 1) (16Wolff E.C. Wolff J. Park M.H. Deoxyhypusine synthase generates and uses bound NADH in a transient hydride transfer mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9170-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reaction is highly specific and unique to eIF5A. The x-ray structure of human DHS (HsDHS) shows the protein is a homotetramer formed from a dimer of dimers with each containing two active sites at the interface between monomers (17Umland T.C. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. A new crystal structure of deoxyhypusine synthase reveals the configuration of the active enzyme and of an enzyme·NAD·inhibitor ternary complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28697-28705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Genomes of kinetoplastids such as T. brucei and Leishmania species encode two homologs of HsDHS, one of which appears to be catalytically dead. In Leishmania donovani, one of these homologs was shown to be essential and to encode a functional DHS, although it was significantly less active than the mammalian enzyme (18Chawla B. Jhingran A. Singh S. Tyagi N. Park M.H. Srinivasan N. Roberts S.C. Madhubala R. Identification and characterization of a novel deoxyhypusine synthase in Leishmania donovani.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The functional role of the second DHS homolog was not established. Here, we examine the roles of both homologs in T. brucei and demonstrate that both are required for optimal enzyme activity. Similar to AdoMetDC, we show that the two T. brucei DHS genes encode one catalytically active DHS subunit and one catalytically dead subunit that associate as a heterotetramer to form the active enzyme commensurate with a 3000-fold increase in catalytic activity. We also show that both genes are essential for parasite growth and infectivity in vivo and that the functional form of DHS in the parasite is the heterotetramer. These data demonstrate that the trypanosomatids have independently evolved an analogous strategy to activate two key enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis through oligomerization with a catalytically dead paralog. Trypanosomatids represent the only known species where this strategy is used to generate the catalytically active species of both DHS and AdoMetDC. Animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Review Committee at the University of Dundee and performed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 (UK Home Office Project License PPL 60/4039) in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC). To minimize animal suffering, mice with a terminal parasitemia (>108 cells ml−1) were humanely killed. Antibodies were raised in rabbits by Covance Inc., Denver, PA, against recombinant TbDHSc and TbDHSp purified from Escherichia coli (see below). Generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to T. brucei dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (TbDHODH) was described previously (19Arakaki T.L. Buckner F.S. Gillespie J.R. Malmquist N.A.

DHS sequences were obtained using NCBI BLASTP searches of the kinetoplastid protein database with HsDHS (P49366) as the search query. Sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega (version 1.1.0). Phylogenetic trees were constructed with Mega5 software using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm with Kimura-2 parameters. DHS sequence accession numbers are listed in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1. Genes (TriTrypDB accession numbers are as follows: TbDHSp, Tb927.1.870; TbDHSc, Tb927.10.2750; and TbEIF5A, Tb11.03.0410) were PCR-amplified from T. brucei single marker genomic DNA, cloned into pCR®8/GW/TOPO® (Invitrogen), and sequenced (Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and capillary instrumentation) to confirm that no mutations were introduced (see Table 1 for primers). No nucleotide polymorphisms were identified compared with the published genomic sequence of T. brucei gambiense. In addition, the 5′UTRs from both TbDHSc and TbDHSp genes were cloned by PCR from total RNA using the splice leader sequence as a forward primer and gene-specific reverse primers and sequenced in their entirety (Table 2).TABLE 1Cloning primers Open table in a new tab TABLE 2UTR sequence of TbDHSc and TbDHSp5′UTR for Tb927.1.8705′GCAGTGTCTACAACGCCATAAGGGGGGGGGGTGGTGTGCCGAGCTGTTTGTAGGGCGGCTGGAACGTT TGCAATAGGAGATCGGAAGCAGGAGGGTGATAGCAGTTATAGCCTTTACGGACCATCTTAAGTGAGAAATCCAACTTCAATT CTGCATCCGTTCTTTGAGGTACAAAAAACAAAAAGAGTGCGCACGGTGCCTTGGCAGTTGCTGTCGTGCGGTTC(ATG)5′UTR for Tb927.1.27505′ACTACCGTTTCTTCCCTTCCGGGTCTTGCAACAGCTCGTGCTCTGAGGAAGTGCGTGTTTTGTCTTCA CATCACTTCGTTATTGGGCTTCTTTTCACCAACAACCAACACCACAAATCGTCACACCTCGTCACGCCGTCGCCGTTCTTGT AAATTTTTTTCTTCTGTCTAAGCCACTCAGGTTGGAGTTGTCGATTTTATCGCCAGGGAAAGCAGGATAAGTGGTAAGGGGA TAAAACTAAAAAGCCTCTTATTTGCAACTCCAGACCGCGTGTGAAGTGGAGAATAAGG(ATG) Open table in a new tab Mammalian bloodstream forms (BSF) of T. brucei were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in HMI-11 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated tetracycline (Tet)-free fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Bio) as described (20Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Axenic culture of African trypanosome bloodstream forms.Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 80-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BSF single marker cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor were used for genetic experiments (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in T. brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed with an Amaxa Nucleofector II as described (22Burkard G. Fragoso C.M. Roditi I. Highly efficient stable transformation of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 153: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) using NotI-linearized DNA (5 μg) followed by selection with the appropriate antibiotic. Antibiotic concentrations were as follows: 2 μg ml−1 G418 (Sigma), 2.5 μg ml−1 phleomycin (InvivoGen), 2 μg ml−1 blasticidin S (Sigma), 2 μg ml−1 hygromycin B (Sigma), and 1 μg ml−1 Tet (RPI). Cell growth was monitored with a hemocytometer; cell number was defined as cell density × culture volume × dilution factor. For GC7 EC50 determination, cell density was monitored using PrestoBlue (20 μl, Invitrogen) after 72 h of incubation with GC7 (0.01–1000 μm). Chicken serum was used for these studies to avoid polyamine oxidase-mediated toxicity of GC7. Fluorescence (560 nm excitation/590 nm emission) was measured using a SynergyTM H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek), normalized to untreated cells, and data were fitted to Equation 1 using GraphPad Prism. (Y=Ymax/1+(X/EC50)))(Eq. 1) Constructs were generated with and without N-terminal tags to allow expression of either native TbDHSc and TbDHSp, AU1-tagged TbDHSc, or FLAG-tagged TbDHSp. Forward PCR primers contained the DNA sequence of the desired tag as follows: AU1 tag (amino acids MDTYRYI) or FLAG tag (amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDK). Untagged genes and AU1-tagged TbDHSc were then subcloned using HindIII and BamHI into pLew100v5 (phleomycin resistance (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in T. brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar)), whereas FLAG-tagged TbDHSp was cloned into pLew300 (blasticidin resistance (9Willert E.K. Phillips M.A. Regulated expression of an essential allosteric activator of polyamine biosynthesis in African trypanosomes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). Both vectors allow integration of the plasmid into the rRNA locus and support Tet-inducible expression of the tagged gene in T. brucei. PCR fragments containing 5′- and 3′-flanking regions for the TbDHSc and TbDHSp genes on either side of the blasticidin or hygromycin resistance genes were generated by fusion PCR from T. brucei single marker genomic DNA. The 5′-flanking region of the TbDHSc (374 bp) or the TbDHSp genes (437 bp) were amplified with gene-specific primers (Table 1, flank primer sets). The reverse primer included an overhang complementing the blasticidin resistance gene (19 bases) or hygromycin resistance gene (21 bases). Similarly, the 3′-flanking regions of the TbDHSc (384 bp) or TbDHSp genes (499 bp) were amplified starting directly after the annotated stop codon, and the forward primer included an overhang to complement the resistance gene. The hygromycin resistance gene was amplified from the pLew90 vector (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in T. brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) and the blasticidin resistance gene from the pLew300 vector (9Willert E.K. Phillips M.A. Regulated expression of an essential allosteric activator of polyamine biosynthesis in African trypanosomes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Amplified fragments were gel-purified and used in a second PCR with the TbDHSc or TbDHSp nesting primers (Table 1) and the amplified blasticidin or hygromycin resistance gene. PCR mixtures (50 μl) contained the following: 1× Phusion HF buffer, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 μm nesting primers, 20 ng of flanking fragment, 50 ng of resistance gene, and 1 unit of Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. This reaction led to the joining of the TbDHSc or TbDHSp flanking regions in a cassette containing the resistance marker for replacement of the allele. The PCR product was gel-purified using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science) and transfected into T. brucei parasites directly. For transfections, the first allele of the TbDHSc or TbDHSp gene was replaced with the hygromycin resistance gene, and clonal lines were obtained by limited dilution. The resultant single knock-out (SKO) cells were then transfected with the tagless TbDHSc- or TbDHSp-regulatable gene expression constructs and selected using phleomycin. Confirmation of ectopic expression upon Tet induction was obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a primer in the ectopic UTR and a primer within the gene (Table 1) and by Western blot using rabbit antiserum to recombinant T. brucei DHS. Expression levels from the Tet-induced ectopic copy were considerably higher than from the genomic DHS alleles. SKO cell lines that were confirmed to show good expression from the ectopic gene copy were then used to create conditional double knock-out (cDKO) cell lines by replacement of the second allele with the blasticidin resistance gene. Knock-outs were confirmed by PCR. Tet-regulatable cDKO cell lines were propagated in media containing Tet to maintain expression of TbDHSc or TbDHSp and with G418, hygromycin B, phleomycin, and blasticidin to maintain selection. To study the effects of DHS knockdown, TbDHSc and TbDHSp cDKO cells were washed three times with Tet-free media prior to plating in fresh media. Growth curves were analyzed for n = 3 biological replicates. A second independent set of cDKO clones was generated at University of Dundee and used for in vivo studies. Methods were essentially as described (23Jones D.C. Alphey M.S. Wyllie S. Fairlamb A.H. Chemical, genetic, and structural assessment of pyridoxal kinase as a drug target in the African trypanosome.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using flanking primers and PCR (Table 1) to generate gene replacement constructs for TbDHSc and TbDHSp containing the hygromycin or puromycin resistance genes. These cell lines showed similar in vitro behavior to those characterized in Fig. 2, A and C. Wild-type and cDKO BSF T. brucei parasites were cultured in the absence of selectable drugs for 24 h with cDKO cells grown ±Tet. Cells were used to infect n = 3 mice per group (dosed ± doxycycline (Dox)) by a single intraperitoneal injection of 104 parasites as described (24Sienkiewicz N. Jarosl̸awski S. Wyllie S.

Microbiol. 2008; 69: 520-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TbDHSc, TbDHSp, and TbEIF5A genes were cloned into pE-SUMO Kan (Life Sensors) for expression as N-terminal His6-SUMO-tagged fusion proteins. PCR fragments generated with primers shown in Table 1 were digested with BsaI/XbaI and cloned directly into BsaI-linearized pE-SUMO. Untagged TbDHSp was also cloned into the HindIII-KpnI site of the pT7-FLAGTM-MAT-Tag®-2 vector (Sigma) where the C-terminal His tag was removed by insertion of a stop codon. HsDHS (P49366.1) and human eIF5A (HseIF5A) (P63241.2) sequences were codon-optimized for E. coli, synthesized by GenScript, and cloned into pE-SUMO Kan as above. Genes were expressed in T1 phage-resistant E. coli BL21(DE3) cells selected with kanamycin (50 μg ml−1) for single gene expression or kanamycin (50 μg ml−1) and ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) for co-expression of SUMO-TbDHSc and TbDHSp. Protein expression was induced at A600 of 0.5 with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.25 mm) for 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g for 0.5 h), resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), and lysed by high pressure disruption (EmulsiFlex-C5, Avestin). Lysate was clarified (15,000 × g for 0.5 h), and protein was purified from the soluble fraction by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (HiTrap Chelating HP column, GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient from 50 to 320 mm imidazole in Buffer A for elution. SUMO tag was removed by treatment with Ulp1 (5 μg/ml final) (purified as described below) for 16 h at 4 °C. Sample was then diluted 20-fold in Buffer A, and the now tagless DHS was separated from the His6-SUMO by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. DHS-containing fractions (flow-through) were combined and dialyzed against DHS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The TbDHSc-TbDHSp complex was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 Prep Grade (GE Healthcare) using DHS buffer. Purified protein concentrations were calculated using the following A280 extinction coefficients: TbDHSc, 46.4 cm−1 mm−1; TbDHSp, 25.9 cm−1 mm−1; TbDHSc-TbDHSp, 72.3 cm−1 mm−1; TbeIF5A, 4.1 cm−1 mm−1; HsDHS, 39.9 cm−1 mm−1, and HseIF5A, 4.5 cm−1 mm−1 (computed using ProtParam, ExPASy, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). The pET28b-Ulp1 expression construct was a gift from Dr. Kim Orth (University of Texas Southwestern). The protein was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced as above except 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was used, and induction was for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells lysates were prepared as above and protein-purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography as above except protein was eluted with Buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole in a single step. Activity was measured at 37 °C in 1-h reactions using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay to detect the incorporation of [3H]spermidine into eIF5A as described (25Wolff E.C. Lee S.B. Park M.H.

Reaction mixture (20 μl) contained recombinant DHS (4–40 nm HsDHS, 10–40 μm TbDHSc, or 5–20 nm TbDHSc-TbDHSp), eIF5A (0.1–100 μm), and [3H]spermidine (7.5 μm hot or a hot-cold mixture ranging in concentration from 0.2 to 150 μm), NAD+ (0.5–1000 μm), DTT (1 mm), and glycine-NaOH buffer (0.2 m, pH 9.3). Initial rates of velocity data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism. The catalytic rate constant, kcat, was calculated based on active monomer concentration. For GC7 IC50 determination, velocity data were fitted to Equation 1 using GraphPad Prism. Data were collected in triplicate, and error represents the mean ± S.D. TbDHSc-TbDHSp complex (0.5 ml) was prepared at a range of concentrations (A280 0.7, 0.2, and 0.05) in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and then loaded into ultracentrifuge cells assembled with sapphire windows after overnight incubation at 4 °C. A280 and interference data were collected at 20 °C in an An-50 Ti rotor monitored continually for 16 h at 40,000 rpm in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter). Complete sedimentation was observed by 5 h. Interference data were analyzed using SEDFIT (27Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D.

https://openalex.org/W2005439670,"Brahma (BRM) is a novel anticancer gene, which is frequently inactivated in a variety of tumor types. Unlike many anticancer genes, BRM is not mutated, but rather epigenetically silenced. In addition, histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) inhibitors are known to reverse BRM silencing, but they also inactivate it via acetylation of its C-terminus. High-throughput screening has uncovered many compounds that are effective at pharmacologically restoring BRM and thereby inhibit cancer cell growth. As we do not know which specific proteins, if any, regulate BRM, we sought to identify the proteins, which underlie the epigenetic suppression of BRM. By selectively knocking down each HDAC, we found that HDAC3 and HDAC9 regulate BRM expression, whereas HDAC2 controls its acetylation. Similarly, we ectopically overexpressed 21 different histone acetyltransferases and found that KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7 induce BRM expression, whereas KAT2B and KAT8 induce its acetylation. We also investigated the role of two transcription factors (TFs) linked to either BRM (GATA3) or HDAC9 (MEF2D) expression. Knockdown of either GATA3 and/or MEF2D downregulated HDAC9 and induced BRM. As targets for molecular biotherapy are typically uniquely, or simply differentially expressed in cancer cells, we also determined if any of these proteins are dysregulated. However, by sequencing, no mutations were found in any of these BRM-regulating HDACs, HATs or TFs. We selectively knocked down GATA3, MEF2D, HDAC3 and HDAC9, and found that each gene-specific knockdown induced growth inhibition. We observed that both GATA3 and HDAC9 were greatly overexpressed only in BRM-negative cell lines indicating that HDAC9 may be a good target for therapy. We also found that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway regulates both BRM acetylation and BRM silencing as MAP kinase pathway inhibitors both induced BRM as well as caused BRM deacetylation. Together, these data identify a cadre of key proteins, which underlie the epigenetic regulation of BRM."
https://openalex.org/W1973538529,"The taxanes are effective microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of various solid tumors. However, the emergence of drug resistance hampers their clinical efficacy. The molecular basis of clinical taxane resistance remains poorly understood. Breast cancer 1, early onset gene, BRCA1, is a tumor-suppressor gene, whose expression has been correlated with taxane sensitivity in many solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between BRCA1 (B1) expression and taxane activity remains unclear. To this end, we created a stable B1 knockdown A549 cell line (B1-KD) to investigate B1’s role in microtubule biology and response to taxane treatment. We show that B1-KD rendered A549 cells resistant to paclitaxel (PTX), phenocopying clinical studies showing that low B1 expression correlated with taxane resistance. As previously reported, we show that loss of B1 enhanced centrosomal γ-tubulin localization and microtubule nucleation. Interestingly, we found that the B1-KD cells exhibited increased microtubule dynamics as compared with parental A549 cells, as assessed by live-cell confocal microscopy using enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged α-tubulin or EB1 protein. In addition, we showed that loss of B1 impairs the ability of PTX to induce microtubule polymerization using immunofluorescence microscopy and a cell-based tubulin polymerization assay. Furthermore, B1-KD cells exhibited significantly lower intracellular binding of a fluorescently labeled PTX to microtubules. Recent studies have shown that PTX-stabilized microtubules serves as a scaffold for pro-caspase-8 binding and induction of apoptosis downstream of induced-proximity activation of caspase-8. Here we show that loss of B1 reduces the association of pro-caspase-8 with microtubules and subsequently leads to impaired PTX-induced activation of apoptosis. Taken together, our data show that B1 regulates indirectly endogenous microtubule dynamics and stability while its loss leads to microtubules that are more dynamic and less susceptible to PTX-induced stabilization conferring taxane resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2084228049,"A tetrameric thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (ht-ADH) has been mutated at an aromatic side chain in the active site (Trp-87). The ht-W87A mutation results in a loss of the Arrhenius break seen at 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme and an increase in cold lability that is attributed to destabilization of the active tetrameric form. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are nearly temperature-independent over the experimental temperature range, and similar in magnitude to those measured above 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that the rigidification in the wild-type enzyme below 30 °C does not occur for ht-W87A. A mutation at the dimer-dimer interface in a thermolabile psychrophilic homologue of ht-ADH, ps-A25Y, leads to a more thermostable enzyme and a change in the rate-determining step at low temperature. The reciprocal mutation in ht-ADH, ht-Y25A, results in kinetic behavior similar to that of W87A. Collectively, the results indicate that flexibility at the active site is intimately connected to a subunit interaction 20 Å away. The convex Arrhenius curves previously reported for ht-ADH (Kohen, A., Cannio, R., Bartolucci, S., and Klinman, J. P. (1999) Nature 399, 496-499) are proposed to arise, at least in part, from a change in subunit interactions that rigidifies the substrate-binding domain below 30 °C, and impedes the ability of the enzyme to sample the catalytically relevant conformational landscape. These results implicate an evolutionarily conserved, long-range network of dynamical communication that controls C-H activation in the prokaryotic alcohol dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1985772838,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is regarded as the main mediator of inflammatory symptoms. In addition, it also plays an important role in tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the mechanism of PGE2-induced angiogenic response. We show that in the absence of proteoglycan syndecan-4 (Sdc4), PGE2-induced ERK activation is decreased significantly, as is endothelial cell migration and cord formation in a two-dimensional Matrigel assay. In vivo, PGE2-induced angiogenesis is reduced dramatically in Sdc4(-/-) mice. The mechanism was traced to Sdc4-dependent activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα). Transduction of an Sdc4 S183E mutant (a cytoplasmic domain mutation that blocks Sdc4-dependent PKCα activation) into Sdc4(-/-) endothelial cells was not able to rescue the loss of PGE2-induced ERK activation, whereas a transduction with full-length Sdc4 resulted in full rescue. Furthermore, PGE2-induced angiogenesis was also reduced in PKCα(-/-) mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PGE2-induced activation of angiogenesis is mediated via syndecan-4-dependent activation of PKCα."
https://openalex.org/W2020260724,"This study was carried out to explore the molecular mechanism for down-regulation of TRPC6 expression in the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/PKC signaling in kidney cells. In cultured human mesangial cells, H2O2 and TNF-α inhibited TRPC6 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of NF-κB reversed both H2O2- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced decrease in TRPC6 protein expression. Activation of NF-κB by knocking down IκBα using siRNA could mimic the suppressive effect of ROS/PKC on TRPC6. a Ca2+ imaging study showed that activation and inhibition of NF-κB significantly decreased and increased the TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ entry, respectively. Further experiments showed that PMA, but not its inactive analog 4α-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), caused phosphorylation of IκBα and stimulated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits. The PMA-dependent IκBα phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by Gö6976. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that PMA stimulated DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, specific knockdown of p65, but not p50, prevented an H2O2 inhibitory effect on TRPC6 protein expression, suggesting p65 as a predominant NF-κB subunit repressing TRPC6. In agreement with a major role of p65, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that PMA treatment induced p65 binding to the TRPC6 promoter. Moreover, PMA treatment increased the association of p65 with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and decreased histone acetylation at the TRPC6 promoter. Consistently, knockdown of HDAC2 by siRNA or inhibition of HDAC with trichostatin A prevented a H2O2-induced decrease in TRPC6 mRNA and protein expressions, respectively.

MCs were cultured in low glucose (5.6 mm) DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 4 mm glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% FBS. Cells were growth-arrested with 0.5% FBS medium during treatments. Only subpassages less than nine generations were used this study. All siRNA oligonucleotides, including scramble control sequences, were transiently transfected into MCs using DharmaFECT 2 transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) following the protocols provided by the manufacturer and described in Ref. 14Graham S.

Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were either harvested for Western blot or used for a fura-2 study. The MTT assay was conducted to evaluate cell viability in the presence of H2O2. MCs were plated in one 96-well with ∼30 × 103/100 μl/well 1 day before the assay. Cells were treated with 10 μl of the 12 mm MTT (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) stock solution and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The medium was then removed, and 50 μl of DMSO were added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, absorbance at 540 nm with a reference wavelength of 570 nm was measured. The total RNA was isolated from cultured human MCs using a PerfectPure RNA cultured cell kit (5 Prime, Inc., Hamburg, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Human TRPC6 primers (forward, GCCAATGAGCATCTGGAAAT; reverse, TGGAGTCACATCATGGGAGA) and β-actin primers (forward, ACTGTGTGGATTACATGGGCCAGA; reverse, AGGATTGCCTCCACAATCCGTACA) were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, Iowa). iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used for RT reactions with 1.0 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 20 μl following the manufacturer's reaction protocol. Real time PCR used 0.2 μg of RT product, 100 nm primer, and was performed using iQ SYBR Green supermix ( Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 20 μl. The PCR mix was denatured at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of melting at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 57 °C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 15 s. After amplification, a melting curve analysis from 65 to 95 °C with a heating rate of 0.02 °C/s with a continuous fluorescence acquisition was made. The assay was run on a C1000TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The average Ct (threshold cycle) of fluorescence units was used to analyze the mRNA levels. The TRPC6 mRNA levels were normalized by β-actin mRNA levels. Quantification was calculated as follows: mRNA levels = 2Δ(ΔCt), where ΔCt = Ct,TRPC6 − Ct,actin·Δ(ΔCt) = ΔCt,T - ΔCt,0, where ΔCt,T represents ΔCt at different time points of H2O2 treatment, and ΔCt,0 represents ΔCt without H2O2 treatment. Preparation of nuclear extracts from human MCs was performed using Thermo Scientific NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. The extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. As described in our previous publication (5Graham S. Gorin Y. Abboud H.E. Ding M. Lee D.Y. Shi H. Ding Y. Ma R. Abundance of TRPC6 protein in glomerular mesangial cells is decreased by ROS and PKC in diabetes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301: C304-C315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with primary TRPC6, actin, phospho-IκBα (Ser-32), IκBα, p50, p65, and lamin A/C antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized with Super Signal West Femto (all proteins except actin) or Pico (for actin) Luminol/Enhancer Solution (Thermo Scientific). The specific protein bands were visualized and captured using an AlphaEase FC Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The IDT of each band was measured by drawing a rectangle outlining the band using AlphaEase FC software with auto background subtraction. If a protein had double bands, a total IDT by summation of each band IDT was used, The expression levels of TRPC6, phospho-IκBα, and IκBα proteins were quantified by normalization of the IDTs of those protein bands to that of actin bands on the same blot. In Fig. 10, the expression levels of nuclear p50 and p65 proteins were normalized to lamin A/C. Nuclear extracts (50 μg) from human MCs with various treatments (Fig. 11A) were incubated with 2 μg of p65 primary antibody to pull down the nuclear p65 protein following the protocol described in our previous publication (31Sours-brothers S. Ding M. Graham S. Ma R. Interaction between TRPC1/TRPC4 assembly and STIM1 contributes to store-operated Ca2+ entry in mesangial cells.Exp. Biol. Med. 2009; 234: 673-682Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were resolved by regular Western blot and probed with a HDAC2 antibody. A nuclear protein, lamin A/C, from 10 μg of the corresponding nuclear extracts was used as an input. Human MCs were plated on 22 × 22–1 mm glass coverslips. Cells with or without pretreatments as indicated in Fig. 7C were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the cells were then incubated with ice-cold acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. After 30 min of incubation with blocking buffer, the cells were incubated with either p50 or p65 primary antibody at 1:400 and 1:100, respectively, in PBS plus 10% donkey serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBS, the cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (for p50) or with Alexa Fluor 488 (for p65) (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI (Invitrogen) was used for staining nuclei. For a fluorescent staining control, equal amounts of rabbit IgG were used instead of the primary antibodies. Localization of NF-κB subunits were visualized by Leica Confocal Laser Scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). EMSA was performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding sequence for κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), in which the underlined sequence represents the κB binding consensus. The nucleotides were end-labeled with biotin using a biotin 3′ end DNA labeling kit (Thermo Scientific). Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated in 1× binding buffer containing 2.5% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 4 pmol of biotin-labeled oligonucleotide in a total volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × Tris borate EDTA as the running buffer. For competition studies, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. After transfer to nylon membrane at 100 V for 30 min at 4 °C, the membrane was then cross-linked for 60 s in a UV cross-linker. The binding complexes were then developed using Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module from Thermo Scientific following the manufacturer's protocol. After MCs were treated as indicated in FIGURE 10, FIGURE 11B, cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Glycine was then added at a final concentration of 0.125 m to neutralize formaldehyde. After two washes with PBS, cells were scraped and collected by centrifugation (750 × g). Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation (1350 × g) and lysed in lysis buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The pelleted chromatin was then resuspended in lysis buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, and proteinase inhibitor). After sonication, a 110 volume of 10% Triton X-100 was added to the lysates followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of p65 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or a control rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, the samples were incubated with 25 μl of Magnetic A/G beads (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature, and the immune complexes were collected by Magnetic Stand and washed 4 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.5) followed by 2 washes with Tris-EDTA buffer with 50 mm NaCl. Then 50 μl of 10% Chelex 100 were added to the washed bead pellets, and the samples were boiled for 10 min at 100 °C. The pellets were then incubated with RNase for 1 h and proteinase K for 30 min at 55 °C. The supernatants were collected after maximum speed centrifugation (20,000 × g) at room temperature and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR or regular PCR. A volume of 2 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (25 μl reaction mixture) using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Specificity of the assay was tested by amplification of GAPDH gene not bound by NF-κB (negative control). Primers flanking the κB sites at the TRPC6 promoter were 5′-CGC TAC CAC CAG CGG CCC-3′ and 5′-GCC CAC TGG CCC GGG GAA AA-3′, designed to amplify a 143-bp product. The primers flanking the κB sites at the IκBα promoter were 5′-GAA GGA CTT TCC AGC CAC TC-3′ and 5′-GGA ATT TCC AAG CCA GTC AG-3′, designed to amplify a 163-bp product. The primers for GAPDH were 5′-ATG GTT GCC ACT GGG GAT CT-3′ and 5′-TGC CAA AGC CTA GGG GAA GA-3′, designed to amplify a 174-bp product. A volume of 2 μl of the immunoprecipitated chromatin from the cells with different treatments was analyzed by real-time PCR. The PCR was performed in duplicate using iQ SYBR Green Supermix reagents (Bio-Rad). Real time-PCR conditions used were 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles with 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Melting curves were measured in the PCR machine between 60 and 95 °C with a resolution of 0.5 °C. Measurements of [Ca2+]i in MCs using fura-2 were performed using dual excitation wavelength fluorescence microscopy. MCs grown on a coverslip (22 × 22 mm) were loaded with fura-2 by incubation for 50 min at room temperature in the dark in physiological saline solution containing 2 μm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/AM), 0.09 g/dl DMSO, and 0.018 g/dl Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) followed by washing 3 times. The cells were then incubated with fura-2-free physiological saline solution for an additional 20 min. The coverslip was then placed in a perfusion chamber (Warner, Model RC-2OH) mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored by a ratio technique (excitation at 340 and 380 nm, emission at 510 nm) using NIS Elements ARTM software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) at room temperature. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the software following the manufacturer's instructions. Calibrations were performed in vivo at the end of each experiment, and conditions of high [Ca2+]i were achieved by the addition of 5 μm ionomycin, whereas conditions of low [Ca2+]i were obtained by the addition of 5 mm EGTA. The siRNA oligonucleotides against human IκBα, p50, and p65 were designed and synthesized by Cell Signaling Technology. The control scramble siRNA (Non-targeting siRNA #1, D-001810-01-20) was purchased from Thermo Scientific. InSolutionTM NF-κB activation inhibitor and helenalin were purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-IκBα and rabbit anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser32) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse anti-p50, rabbit anti-p65, and rabbit anti-Lamin A/C antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). The anti-p65 antibody used in ChIP experiments was purchased from Abcam. The rabbit anti-acetyl histone H3 antibody was purchased from Millipore. DAPI was purchased from Invitrogen. Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other primary antibodies and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Data are reported as the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance plus Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis and Student's unpaired t test were used to analyze the differences among multiple groups and between two groups, respectively. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). We have previously demonstrated that H2O2 reduced the abundance of TRPC6 protein in human MCs through a PKC mechanism (5Graham S. Gorin Y. Abboud H.E. Ding M. Lee D.Y. Shi H. Ding Y. Ma R. Abundance of TRPC6 protein in glomerular mesangial cells is decreased by ROS and PKC in diabetes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301: C304-C315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether the H2O2 effect was at a transcriptional or translational level, we conducted quantitative real-time RT-PCR using samples from human MCs either without H2O2 treatment or with H2O2 treatment for various time periods. As shown in Fig. 1, H2O2 induced a time-dependent decrease in TRPC6 mRNA steady-state levels, and a significant decrease was observed after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 1). These data suggest that H2O2 inhibited TRPC6 expression by suppression of TRPC6 gene. NF-κB is a well known transcription factor downstream of both ROS and PKC (32Canty T.G. Boyle E.M. Farr A.

https://openalex.org/W2094969429,"Neurotrophin 4 (NT-4) belongs to the family of neurotrophic factors, and it interacts with the tyrosine kinase B (trkB) receptor. NT-4 has neuroprotective effects following cerebral ischemia. Its role might be similar to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), because both interact with trkB. Exercise also improves neural function by increasing neurotrophic factors. However, expression profiles of NT-4 in the brain during exercise are unknown. Here, we assessed the expressions of NT-4 and its receptor, trkB, following cerebral ischemia and hypothesized that exercise changes the expressions of NT-4 and trkB. Results showed that in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model, ischemia decreased NT-4 and trkB expression. Immunohistochemistry showed their immunoreactivities around the region of the ischemic area. Treadmill exercise changed the expression of NT-4, which increased in the contralateral hemisphere in rats with ischemic injury. TrkB also showed similar patterns to its neurotophins. The change in NT-4 suggested that exercise might have primed NT4 production so that further injury causes slightly greater increases in NT4 compared with non-exercise controls."

CNG and HCN channels are unique in the voltage-gated channel superfamily in that their gating from closed to open is promoted by direct binding of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP.

The core of the CNBD consists of an eight-stranded β-roll followed by two α-helices, the B- and C-helices (Fig. 1B). Extensive contacts are made between the cyclic phosphate and ribose moieties of the cyclic nucleotide and residues in the β-roll and a short helix between the sixth and seventh β-strands called the P-helix. The C-helix caps the ligand-binding site by forming interactions with the purine ring of cAMP or cGMP. A mechanism for the activation of eukaryotic cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels has been proposed based on electrophysiological and biochemical studies (1Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. CNG and HCN channels: two peas, one pod.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In this model, initial contact is made between the ligand and the β-roll/P-helix. Mutations in this region of the channel have effects on cyclic nucleotide affinity, with little effect on the efficacy of the ligand to promote channel opening (4Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D.

Subsequent to ligand binding, the C-helix is thought to translate toward the binding pocket and form contacts with the ligand.

Methods. 2009; 6: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overall, the apo-structure is very similar to the ligand-bound structure, but it differs in two key regions. The F′-helix of the C-linker adopts a nonhelical coil structure in the absence of agonist. Although the position of the proximal C-helix is quite similar between the apo- and ligand-bound HCN2 structures, the distal half of the C-helix is not resolved in the apo-structure. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectra reveal a marked increase in the helical content of the HCN2 C terminus in the presence of cAMP (22Brelidze T.I. Carlson A.E. Zagotta W.N.

Chem. 2009; 284: 27989-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results raise the intriguing possibility that the C-helix becomes more ordered upon cyclic nucleotide binding and that this secondary structural transition may be coupled to the gating conformational change that opens the channel. In this study, we used transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) and electrophysiology to investigate the hypothesis that cyclic nucleotide binding stabilizes the secondary structure of the C-helix. tmFRET is a FRET technique that uses small, covalently attached fluorophores as donor molecules and colored transition metal ions (e.g. Ni2+ and Co2+) bound to pairs of histidine residues as acceptors (6Taraska J.W.

This method can report very short distances (8–20 Å), virtually eliminates the orientation dependence of classical FRET, and allows the experimenter to tune the dynamic range of distance measurements by changing the acceptor ion. Previously, a comparison of tmFRET measurements in the absence and presence of cAMP demonstrated that the C-helix undergoes a translation toward the β-roll in the presence of cyclic nucleotide (6Taraska J.W. Puljung M.C. Olivier N.B. Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. Mapping the structure and conformational movements of proteins with transition metal ion FRET.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transition metal ion Ni2+ bound more tightly to pairs of histidines in the C-helix spaced four residues apart in the presence of cAMP than in its absence, suggesting cAMP causes a stabilization of the secondary structure of the C-helix (6Taraska J.W. Puljung M.C. Olivier N.B. Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. Mapping the structure and conformational movements of proteins with transition metal ion FRET.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we used tmFRET within the C-helix and between the B- and C-helices of the purified HCN2 C-terminal domain to demonstrate further that the C-helix undergoes a secondary structural transition, becoming more ordered upon binding cAMP. Using patch clamp electrophysiology on intact, functioning ion channels, we show that this secondary structural transition is coupled to channel opening and is therefore part of the gating conformational change in cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels that translates ligand binding into channel opening. The gene encoding the cysteine-free C-terminal fragment (amino acids 443–640) of the mouse HCN2 ion channel (HCN2) was synthesized by Blue Heron Biotechnology (Bothell, WA) and cloned into the pMALc2T vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) (6Taraska J.W.

The vector encodes an N-terminal maltose-binding protein tag that is separated from the gene product of interest by a thrombin-cleavable linker. CNGA1Q was subcloned into the pGEMHE vector (26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Subunit stoichiometry of a mammalian K+ channel determined by construction of multimeric cDNAs.Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). This construct contains the full-length CNGA1 channel with all of the native cysteines mutated, with the exception of Cys-481 and the native Ni2+ potentiation site mutated to a glutamine (H420Q) (16Matulef K.

All mutations were created using standard PCR techniques and verified using automated sequencing (Genewiz, Seattle, WA). To make RNA for Xenopus oocyte expression experiments, cDNAs encoding CNGA1Q constructs were linearized with NheI (New England Biolabs) and transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine Ultra kit with T7 polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). Soluble HCN2 constructs were prepared as described previously (28Puljung M.C. Zagotta W.N. Labeling of specific cysteines in proteins using reversible metal protection.Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 2513-2521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, all constructs were expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacteria (New England Biolabs), grown in 2-liter cultures, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were lysed and centrifuged to remove insoluble cellular material. MBP-HCN2 constructs were purified on an amylose affinity column. The maltose-binding protein tag was removed by thrombin digest followed by ion exchange chromatography. Labeling of cysteine residues inserted into the HCN2 construct via mutagenesis was carried out during purification after the thrombin digest but prior to ion exchange chromatography. Protein was eluted from the amylose affinity column into ∼20 ml of buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 50 mm d(+)-maltose monohydrate, 10% glycerol, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Fluorophores (monobromobimane or dibromobimane) were added to the buffer at a final concentration of 100 μm from a 100 mm stock in DMSO, which was stored at −80 °C. At this concentration, the fluorophore was in molar excess of the cysteines intended for labeling. The solution was placed on an orbital shaker (60–80 rpm) for 1 h at 20–25 °C. Unincorporated fluorophore was removed during the ion exchange step. Labeling efficiency was not quantitated for the subsequent experiments as any unlabeled protein would not be expected to contribute to the fluorescence signal. Absorbance spectra of 1 mm Ni2+ and Co2+ bound to the peptide ACAAKAAAKHAAAHKA (3 mm) were acquired in a Beckman DU460 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were acquired using a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer outfitted with a MicroMax plate reader (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). The excitation wavelength was 390 nm, and emission was measured between 440 and 600 nm in 1-nm increments with a 0.1-s integration time and slit widths set between 5 and 14 nm on the excitation and emission monochromators. For FRET experiments, peak emission was averaged over a 7-nm window, usually between 477 and 483 nm. Bimane-labeled HCN2 constructs were diluted to a concentration between 30 nm and 6 μm. Experiments were conducted in a buffer containing 150–300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at 20°−25 °C. Data were acquired from 250-μl samples in black, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Corning; Lowell, MA) through fiber optics in the plate reader connected to the sample compartment of the fluorometer. To reduce the amount of scattered excitation light collected by the emission fiber optic, a 425-nm long pass filter was placed in line with the emitted light path. To each sample was added 7.5 μl of water or cAMP (sodium salt, monohydrate) diluted to the desired concentration from a 10 mm aqueous stock. Unless otherwise noted, the final cAMP concentration was 300 μm. 2.5 μl of water or aqueous stocks of NiCl2·6H2O or CoSO4·7H2O were also added to each well. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conducted using 200-μl samples in a standard quartz cuvette. The Fluorolog-3 was outfitted with Glan-Thompson polarizers. Data were acquired in the L format with excitation set to 390 nm and emission recorded at 480 nm with 5-nm slit widths. Anisotropy was calculated as described elsewhere (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 353-382Crossref Google Scholar). cRNAs encoding CNGA1Q constructs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes prepared as described previously (30Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Gating of single Shaker potassium channels in Drosophila muscle and in Xenopus oocytes injected with Shaker mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recordings were carried out in the inside-out patch clamp configuration with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized with an ITC-16 analog/digital converter (Instrutech/HEKA, Bellmore, NY). Data were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. All data were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA). Both pipette and bath solutions contained 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with N-methyl-d-glucamine. Bath solutions were supplemented with cGMP or inosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (cIMP) and NiCl2·6H2O as indicated. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire polished to a resistance of 0.2–0.6 megohms. Rapid solution exchange was achieved using an RSC-100 solution changer (Biologic, Claix, France). All recordings were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). CNGA1 currents exhibit a time-dependent run-up following patch excision (31Molokanova E. Trivedi B. Savchenko A. Kramer R.H. Modulation of rod photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by tyrosine phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9068-9076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To account for this phenomenon, the patches were repetitively pulsed in the presence of 200 μm cGMP until the current magnitude stabilized, typically 15–20 min. All data were blank-corrected by subtracting spectra recorded from solutions with the same components but no fluorescent protein. Because we used a plate reader for our fluorescence measurements of HCN2 constructs, it was impossible to determine the exact path length of the excitation and emission light and therefore not possible to mathematically correct for the inner filter effect of the absorbance of ions and fluorophore in our samples. Rather, we corrected for this experimentally by dividing normalized (to no metal ± 300 μm cAMP) fluorescence data from constructs containing bimane-conjugated cysteines and introduced di-histidine metal-binding sites by normalized fluorescence data from constructs containing the same fluorophore configuration but no metal-binding site. Not only did this partially account for the inner filter effect, but it eliminated the low affinity quenching component observed in proteins lacking an exogenously introduced metal-binding site, which is likely the result of quenching by ions in solution. Corrected fluorescence data were plotted as a function of total metal (Ni2+ or Co2+) concentration and fit with a single binding site model as shown in Equation 1, FFno site=-[M2+]+[protein]-Kd+([M2+]-[protein]+Kd)2+4•Kd•[protein]2•[protein]•EFRET+1-FFRET(Eq. 1) where F/Fno site is corrected fluorescence; [M2+] is the total transition metal ion concentration; [protein] is the total concentration of the HCN2 protein being used; Kd is the apparent metal binding affinity, and EFRET is the FRET efficiency, i.e. the amount of quenching at saturating metal concentrations. The cAMP concentration dependence of tmFRET was fit with Equation 2, FF0=-[cAMP]+[protein]-Kd+([cAMP]-[protein]+Kd)2+4•Kd•[protein]2•[protein]•(1-FcAMPF0)+FcAMPF0(Eq. 2) where [cAMP] is the total cAMP concentration; F0 is the fluorescence in the absence of cAMP; FcAMP is the fluorescence in the presence of saturating cAMP, and all other terms are as defined above. Distances between FRET donors and acceptors were calculated using the Förster (Equation 3), R=R0•(1EFRET-1)16(Eq. 3) where R is the distance between the donor and acceptor; R0 is the distance at which FRET efficiency is 0.5, and EFRET is the FRET efficiency. R0 for each FRET pair was calculated as described previously (6Taraska J.W. Puljung M.C. Olivier N.B. Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N.

Current records were leak- and capacitance-corrected by subtracting off currents from the same patch in a solution with no cyclic nucleotide. Current magnitudes reported were the mean currents from steps to −60 mV for cyclic nucleotide concentration-response relationships and steps to −100 mV for Ni2+ potentiation experiments. Currents in every patch were normalized to the current magnitude at 10 mm cGMP. Cyclic nucleotide concentration-response relationships were fit with the Hill Equation 4, llmax,cGMP=AcNMP[cNMP]nKdn+[cNMP]n(Eq. 4) where Imax, cGMP is the maximal current response in 10 mm cGMP; AcNMP is the fractional activation in cNMP; [cNMP] is the free cyclic nucleotide concentration; Kd is the apparent affinity for cyclic nucleotide, and n is the Hill coefficient. Ni2+ concentration-response relationships were determined in the presence of 16 mm cIMP. Ni2+ concentration-response relationships for the CNGA1Q construct, which exhibited block, but no potentiation, were fit with a single binding site model of Equation 5, lNi2+lno Ni2+=Kb[Ni2+]+Kb(Eq. 5) where Kb is the apparent affinity for Ni2+ block. Ni2+ concentration-response data for the CNGA1Q E595H,Q599H construct were fit with Equation 6, which describes two independent components, Ni2+ potentiation and Ni2 block, lNi2+lno Ni2+=(Kb[Ni2+]+Kb)•(1+P[Ni2+][Ni2+]+Kb)(Eq. 6) where P is the fractional potentiation by Ni2+, and Kp is the apparent affinity for Ni2+ potentiation. Because the E595H,Q599H mutation should not affect the Ni2+ block of the channel pore, Kb was fixed to the value determined from the CNGA1Q fit to Equation 5, reducing the fit of Equation 6 to only two free parameters. To determine the ΔΔG for stabilization of the open state of CNGA1Q E595H,Q599H by Ni2+ binding to the C-helix, we first had to calculate L, the equilibrium constant for channel opening. Because the Ni2+ potentiation experiments were conducted at saturating concentrations of the partial agonist cIMP, the gating scheme was simply represented as shown in Equation 7, C↔LO(Eq. 7) In this scheme, L for each agonist is defined by Equation 8, L=Popen1-Popen=llmax1-llmax(Eq. 8) where Popen is the probability of channel opening, and Imax is the current at maximal open probability. In wild type CNGA1 channels, maximal current is measured in saturating cGMP and 1 μm Ni2+, where Popen has been directly measured to be near unity (33Sunderman E.R. Zagotta W.N. Mechanism of allosteric modulation of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 601-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the CNGA1Q constructs, this determination was not possible because the native Ni2+ potentiation site was mutated (H420Q). To determine Imax, we assumed that the relative efficacy of cGMP and cIMP was preserved between wild type and our mutant constructs. This is a reasonable assumption as we did not mutate any of the amino acids that were expected to contact the ligand. We then used Equation 9 to calculate Imax, LcIMPLcGMPlcIMPlmax1-lclMplmaxlcGMPlmax1-lcGMPlmax(Eq. 9) where LcIMP/LcGMP was set equal to 0.06, based on the value reported in the literature (18Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Molecular mechanism for ligand discrimination of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Equation 9 was rearranged to make Equation 10, lmax=0.94•lcGMPlclMPlcIMP-0.06•lcGMP(Eq. 10) Our experimentally determined values of IcGMP and IcIMP were then used to calculate Imax and L for CNGA1Q E595H,Q599H with and without Ni2+. ΔΔG was then calculated using Equation 11, ΔΔG=-RTln(LNiL)(Eq. 11) where R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. Data were analyzed and fit"

The underlying method allows a versatile control of parasite cAMP.Optogenetic parasite strains offer valuable tools for dissecting cAMP-mediated processes.The method is applicable to other gene-tractable intertwined systems. Successful infection and transmission of the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii depends on its ability to switch between fast-replicating tachyzoite (acute) and quiescent bradyzoite (chronic) stages. Induction of cAMP in the parasitized host cells has been proposed to influence parasite differentiation. It is not known whether the parasite or host cAMP is required to drive this phenomenon. Other putative roles of cAMP for the parasite biology also remain to be identified. Unequivocal research on cAMP-mediated signaling in such intertwined systems also requires a method for an efficient and spatial control of the cAMP pool in the pathogen or in the enclosing host cell. We have resolved these critical concerns by expressing a photoactivated adenylate cyclase that allows light-sensitive control of the parasite or host-cell cAMP. Using this method, we reveal multiple roles of the parasite-derived cAMP in host-cell invasion, stage-specific expression, and asexual differentiation. An optogenetic method provides many desired advantages such as: (i) rapid, transient, and efficient cAMP induction in extracellular/intracellular and acute/chronic stages; (ii) circumvention of the difficulties often faced in cultures, i.e. poor diffusion, premature degradation, steady activation, and/or pleiotropic effects of cAMP agonists and antagonists; (iii) genetically encoded enzyme expression, thus inheritable to the cell progeny; and (iv) conditional and spatiotemporal control of cAMP levels. Importantly, a successful optogenetic application in Toxoplasma also illustrates its wider utility to study cAMP-mediated signaling in other genetically amenable two-organism systems such as in symbiotic and pathogen-host models."
https://openalex.org/W2080709676,"Studies of post-mortem brains from Alzheimer disease patients suggest that oxidative damage induced by mitochondrial amyloid β (mitAβ) accumulation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the regulation of mitAβ metabolism is unknown. One of the proteases involved in mitAβ catabolism is the long insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) isoform (IDE-Met(1)). However, the mechanisms of its expression are unknown, and its presence in brain is uncertain. We detected IDE-Met(1) in brain and showed that its expression is regulated by the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway (PGC-1α/NRF-1). A strong positive correlation between PGC-1α or NRF-1 and long IDE isoform transcripts was found in non-demented brains. This correlation was weaker in Alzheimer disease. In vitro inhibition of IDE increased mitAβ and impaired mitochondrial respiration. These changes were restored by inhibition of γ-secretase or promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results suggest that IDE-Met(1) links the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway with mitAβ levels and organelle functionality."

The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a master regulator of xenobiotic metabolism, and its activity is critical toward understanding the pathophysiology of several diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and steatosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that ketoconazole binds to ligand-activated PXR and antagonizes receptor control of gene expression. Structure-function as well as computational docking analysis suggested a putative binding region containing critical charge clamp residues Gln-272, and Phe-264 on the AF-2 surface of PXR. To define the antagonist binding surface(s) of PXR, we developed a novel assay to identify key amino acid residues on PXR based on a yeast two-hybrid screen that examined mutant forms of PXR. This screen identified multiple ""gain-of-function"" mutants that were ""resistant"" to the PXR antagonist effects of ketoconazole. We then compared our screen results identifying key PXR residues to those predicted by computational methods. Of 15 potential or putative binding residues based on docking, we identified three residues in the yeast screen that were then systematically verified to functionally interact with ketoconazole using mammalian assays. Among the residues confirmed by our study was Ser-208, which is on the opposite side of the protein from the AF-2 region critical for receptor regulation. The identification of new locations for antagonist binding on the surface or buried in PXR indicates novel aspects to the mechanism of receptor antagonism. These results significantly expand our understanding of antagonist binding sites on the surface of PXR and suggest new avenues to regulate this receptor for clinical applications."

DNA polymerases are responsible for the accurate replication of DNA. Kinetic, single-molecule, and x-ray studies show that multiple conformational states are important for DNA polymerase fidelity. Using high precision FRET measurements, we show that Klentaq1 (the Klenow fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase 1) is in equilibrium between three structurally distinct states. In the absence of nucleotide, the enzyme is mostly open, whereas in the presence of DNA and a correctly base-pairing dNTP, it re-equilibrates to a closed state. In the presence of a dNTP alone, with DNA and an incorrect dNTP, or in elevated MgCl2 concentrations, an intermediate state termed the ""nucleotide-binding"" state predominates. Photon distribution and hidden Markov modeling revealed fast dynamic and slow conformational processes occurring between all three states in a complex energy landscape suggesting a mechanism in which dNTP delivery is mediated by the nucleotide-binding state. After nucleotide binding, correct dNTPs are transported to the closed state, whereas incorrect dNTPs are delivered to the open state."
https://openalex.org/W2038821140,"Most chemotherapeutical drugs kill cancer cells chiefly by inducing DNA damage, which unfortunately also causes undesirable injuries to normal tissues, mainly due to p53 activation. We report a novel strategy of normal tissue protection that involves p53/NF-κB coordinated metabolic regulation. Pretreatment of untransformed cells with low doses of arsenic induced concerted p53 suppression and NF-κB activation, which elicited a marked induction of glycolysis. Significantly, this metabolic shift provided cells effective protection against cytotoxic chemotherapy, coupling the metabolic pathway to cellular resistance. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated an absolute requirement of functional p53 in arsenic-mediated protection. Consistently, a brief arsenic pretreatment selectively protected only normal tissues, but not tumors, from toxicity of chemotherapy. An indispensable role of glycolysis in protecting normal tissues was demonstrated by using an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose, which almost totally abolished low-dose arsenic-mediated protection. Together, our work demonstrates that low-dose arsenic renders normal cells and tissues resistant to chemotherapy-induced toxicity by inducting glycolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2064782044,"The efficient transport of micron-sized beads into cells, via a non-endocytosis mediated mechanism, has only recently been described. As such there is considerable scope for optimization and exploitation of this procedure to enable imaging and sensing applications to be realized. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of fluorescent microsphere-based cellular delivery agents that can also carry biological cargoes. These core-shell polymer microspheres possess two distinct chemical environments; the core is hydrophobic and can be labeled with fluorescent dye, to permit visual tracking of the microsphere during and after cellular delivery, whilst the outer shell renders the external surfaces of the microspheres hydrophilic, thus facilitating both bioconjugation and cellular compatibility. Cross-linked core particles were prepared in a dispersion polymerization reaction employing styrene, divinylbenzene and a thiol-functionalized co-monomer. These core particles were then shelled in a seeded emulsion polymerization reaction, employing styrene, divinylbenzene and methacrylic acid, to generate orthogonally functionalized core-shell microspheres which were internally labeled via the core thiol moieties through reaction with a thiol reactive dye (DY630-maleimide). Following internal labeling, bioconjugation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to their carboxyl-functionalized surfaces was successfully accomplished using standard coupling protocols. The resultant dual-labeled microspheres were visualized by both of the fully resolvable fluorescence emissions of their cores (DY630) and shells (GFP). In vitro cellular uptake of these microspheres by HeLa cells was demonstrated conventionally by fluorescence-based flow cytometry, whilst MTT assays demonstrated that 92% of HeLa cells remained viable after uptake. Due to their size and surface functionalities, these far-red-labeled microspheres are ideal candidates for in vitro, cellular delivery of proteins."

Moreover, some aggregates, both amorphous ones and those that lead to highly ordered amyloid fibrils, are toxic to cells and have been implicated in a variety of protein folding diseases (5Luheshi L.M.

Cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to overcome the problems associated with protein aggregation. A specialized class of molecular chaperones, the “disaggregases,” can perform the energetically uphill process of reversing protein aggregation. Thus far, studies of disaggregases have been dominated by the Clp/Hsp100 family of AAA+ 3The abbreviations used are: AAA+ATPases associated with various cellular activitiescpSRPchloroplast signal recognition particleLHClight-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-bindingLHCPLHC proteinTMtransmembraneAβamyloid βTEMtransmission electron microscopyAFMatomic force microscopyThTthioflavin TANS1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonateLDAOn-dodecyl-N,N,-dimethylamine-N-oxideDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranosideβ-OGn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranosideBNGn-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranosideMTSSL1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonateNEMN-ethyl-maleimideGdmHClguanidinium hydrochloride. ATPases (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), such as ClpB in prokaryotes and Hsp104 in yeasts (3Doyle S.M. Wickner S. Hsp104 and ClpB: protein disaggregating machines.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Both are large hexameric rings (>500 kDa) powered by mechanical forces from ATP hydrolysis and require additional co-chaperones to efficiently disassemble a variety of protein aggregates (8Doyle S.M.

The complexity of these disaggregase systems and the promiscuity in their substrate selection have made it difficult to pinpoint their molecular mechanisms of action. Further, AAA+ disaggregase machines were only found in prokaryote and yeast, and no homologues have been identified in higher eukaryotes outside of plastids and mitochondria. It is conceivable that alternative mechanisms of disaggregation, such as the recently described Hsp110–70–40 system (10Duennwald M.L. Echeverria A. Shorter J.

An understanding of alternative disaggregase systems can shed light on novel principles and mechanisms by which cellular chaperones overcome protein aggregates.

Previously, we identified an efficient disaggregase activity in the chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 subunit (cpSRP43) (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This provides an example in which a relatively small protein scaffold (38 kDa) can recognize and disrupt large protein aggregates in an ATP-independent mechanism (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in contrast to the Clp/Hsp100 family of disaggregases. cpSRP43 is part of the protein targeting machinery, the cpSRP, that mediates the delivery of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (LHC) family of proteins to the thylakoid membrane (13Schuenemann D.

The most abundant member of the LHC family, LHCP, comprises ∼30% of the proteins on the thylakoid membrane and is arguably the most abundant membrane protein on earth. The sheer abundance of these proteins and their highly hydrophobic nature demands highly effective chaperones that protect them from aggregation before arrival at the membrane. In the chloroplast stroma, this chaperone function is provided by cpSRP43, which effectively protects LHC proteins from aggregation and can even reverse preformed large LHC protein aggregates (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that the specific interaction of cpSRP43 with the L18 motif is crucial for the chaperone and disaggregase activity of cpSRP43 (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This and other observations led us to propose that, in the absence of external energy input, cpSRP43 uses specific binding energy with its substrate proteins to remodel and rescue LHC protein aggregation (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the molecular mechanism that underlies the novel disaggregase activity of cpSRP43, we need to first understand the nature of the LHC aggregate and identify the structural features that facilitate its disassembly by cpSRP43. To this end, we examined the nature and structure of the LHC aggregate using biophysical and biochemical techniques. We show that LHC proteins form disc-like particles with a relatively amorphous hydrophobic core, but exhibit a defined interior/exterior organization in which the L18 recognition motif is displayed on the solvent-exposed surface. This suggests an attractive mechanism for cpSRP43 to recognize the LHC aggregates and thus initiate their disassembly. LHCP, Lhcb5, and their mutants were purified under denaturing conditions as described (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that 6 m GdmHCl was used instead of 8 m urea for Lhcb5. Aβ1–40 and recrystallized thioflavin T (ThT) were generous gifts from Dr. J. W. Kelly. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and bis-ANS were from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. n-Dodecyl-N,N,-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (β-OG), and n-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (BNG) were from Anatrace. Triton X-100 was from Sigma, and SDS was from Bio-Rad. Urea and GdmHCl were molecular biology grade from MP and Sigma, respectively. 1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) was from Toronto Research Chemicals, N-ethyl-maleimide was from Sigma, and N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide was from Invitrogen. Light scattering experiments were performed as described previously (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For formation of aggregates (see Fig. 3, black), unfolded LHCP in 8 m urea was directly diluted into Buffer D (50 mm KHEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl) to the desired final concentration; the final concentration of urea was equalized among different samples. The critical micelle concentration is obtained as the x-intercept from the linear fit of the data (19Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Transthyretin aggregation under partially denaturing conditions is a downhill polymerization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For serial dilution experiments (see Fig. 3, red), the sample at 1 μm LHCP was serially diluted (by 2-fold) into fresh Buffer D and allowed 10–30 min to equilibrate before the measurement. LHCP aggregates were formed by diluting unfolded LHCP in 8 m urea into Buffer D to a final concentration of 2 μm. After incubation at 25 °C for 5 min, the sample was diluted 5-fold and immediately deposited onto a glow-discharged 200-mesh Formvar grid (Ted Pella Inc.). After a 45-s adsorption time, the grid was washed in water and then stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 45 s. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a 120-kV Tecnai T12 electron microscope coupled with a CCD camera. The diameters of the particles were measured using ImageJ (20Abramoff M.D. Magelhães P.J. Ram S.J. Image processing with Image J.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). 1 μm LHCP aggregate in Buffer D was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C to allow equilibration. The wafer was rinsed with Millipore water and dried under the weak flux of nitrogen. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken immediately after the sample was prepared. A Digital Instrument Nanoscope IIIA AFM system in tapping mode was used throughout at ambient conditions. A sharp TESP tip (Veeco) was used in the experiment. Typical values for the force constant, resonance frequency, and tip radius were 42 newtons/m, 320 kHz, and 8 nm, respectively. Particle sizes were obtained by calculating the projected area of each particle at half-maximal height onto the surface. This is because the apparent lateral size of surface features is usually overestimated due to the broadening effect of the AFM tip. The cross-sectional area at half the maximum height provides a more realistic distribution of sizes of the particles. All fluorescence experiments were carried out in Buffer D using a FluoroLog 3-22 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). For bis-ANS experiments, 1 mm bis-ANS was added to Buffer D with or without 1 μm LHCP aggregate. The samples were excited at 395 nm and then scanned from 410 to 620 nm, with excitation and emission band passes of 2 and 5 mm, respectively. For ThT experiments, 20 mm recrystallized ThT was added to Buffer D containing no aggregate, aggregates from 1 or 5 μm LHCP, or 15 μm freshly sonicated Aβ1–40 amyloid. The samples were excited at 440 nm and then scanned from 470 to 570 nm, with the excitation and emission band passes of 3 and 7 mm, respectively. For comparison, ThT fluorescence from 1 and 5 μm unfolded LHCP in 8 m urea was measured. For pyrene excimer experiments, DTT-reduced single cysteine mutants of Lhcb5 in 6 m GdmHCl were labeled with a 30-fold molar excess of pyrene maleimide at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. Excess pyrene was removed by gel filtration, and the efficiency of spin labeling (90–100%) was determined by LC-MSDSL 1100 series (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The samples were prepared by diluting pyrene-labeled Lhcb5 pairs into Buffer D for a final concentration of 1.5 μm for each variant. Spectra were obtained from excitation at 317 nm and then scanned from 360 to 560 nm, with excitation and emission band passes of 3 and 6 mm, respectively. The amount of excimer fluorescence, indicated by a red shift to 445 nm, is normalized against the nonexcited fluorescence signal at 376 nm. Statistically, when two variants A and B are mixed, there is a population distribution of homo-pairs (e.g. 25% A-A and 25% B-B) and hetero-pairs (50% A-B). The equation below corrects for the real hetero-pair excimer (FAB) FAB=2×(FAB,app−0.25FA−0.25FB)(Eq. 1) where FAB,app is the apparent ratio of excimer fluorescence (I445/I376) between two pyrene-labeled variants, and FA and FB is the ratio of excimer fluorescence of each individual variants measured separately. Unfolded LHCP was diluted to 10 μm in Buffer D and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Aggregation was complete, judged by the absence of LHCP in the supernatant after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved with 50 μl of detergent or chemical denaturants at different concentrations for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixtures were then spun at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min, and soluble and pellet fractions were boiled and visualized by SDS-PAGE. For Fig. 2B, the assay was performed as described for amyloid fibrils (21Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Analysis of prion factors in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, aggregation of 10 μm LHCP in Buffer D preceded for 5 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then mixed with 2% SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated at either 25 °C or 100 °C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Only the proteins that migrated into the resolving gel (e.g. solubilized portion) were visualized. Spin labeling reactions were performed in 6 m GdmHCl, 50 mm KHEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA. Reduced and degassed single cysteine mutants of Lhcb5 were labeled with a 3–5-fold molar excess of MTSSL at room temperature in the dark for 2–3 h. Excess MTSSL was removed by gel filtration, and the efficiency of spin labeling (80–100%) was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl peperidine-N-oxyl calibration curve according to manufacturer's instructions (Bruker). EPR spectra were acquired using a 9.4-GHz (X-band) EMX EPR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with an ER 4119HS cavity at 20–23 °C. To form the aggregate, the individual spin-labeled proteins in GdmHCl were diluted into Buffer D. The concentrations of the aggregate samples were 30–100 μm. Data acquisition was as previously described (22Lam V.Q. Akopian D. Rome M. Henningsen D. Shan S. Lipid activation of the signal recognition particle receptor provides spatial coordination of protein targeting.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutants of Lhcb5 in 6 m GdmHCl were reduced with 2.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at room temperature for 2 h. Each mutant was diluted into Buffer D to a final concentration of 3.3 μm and incubated on ice for 10 min to form the aggregate followed by the addition of 100 μm N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM). The reaction was quenched with 50 mm DTT at various time points, concentrated under vacuum, and redissolved in 0.2% formic acid, and ∼25 pmol of protein was analyzed on an LC-MSD SL 1100 series (Agilent). The samples were chromatographed on a 2.1 × 150-mm ZORBAX 300SB-C3 column (Agilent) using a gradient consisting of 0.2% formic acid and 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile (89.8%) and methanol (10%). Intact masses were measured in the single quadrupole and quantified using the software ChemStation software (Agilent). Control experiments where different ratios of unalkylated and alkylated proteins were mixed and subjected to MS analysis show the quantification of ratios of alkylated species to be reliable (see Fig. 6E). The reported accessibilities were calculated as a ratio between the alkylation of each cysteine mutant under aggregation Buffer D versus denaturing 6 m GdmHCl. To characterize the surface features of LHC protein aggregates, we used an established collection of small molecule dyes. Exposure of hydrophobic patches or crevices within aggregates can be probed by extrinsic fluorescent molecular dyes such as ANS and bis-ANS (23Stryer L. The interaction of a naphthalene dye with apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin. A fluorescent probe of non-polar binding sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 24Rosen C.G. Weber G. Dimer formation from 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate catalyzed by bovine serum albumin. A new fluorescent molecule with exceptional binding properties.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We tested whether the aggregates of LHCP, the most abundant member of the LHC protein family, share this feature. Indeed, the fluorescence of both ANS (data not shown) and bis-ANS (Fig. 1A) increased significantly in the presence of 1 μm LHCP aggregate, accompanied by a blue shift of the fluorescence emission spectra. These results strongly suggest that LHCP aggregates contain exposed hydrophobic microdomains that allow the binding of these dyes, consistent with the highly hydrophobic nature of this protein. We next used ThT to probe the structural organization of the LHCP aggregate. ThT is often used as a diagnostic for the formation of amyloid fibrils generated by amyloid-β (Aβ), α-synuclein, and other amyloidogenic proteins (25LeVine H. Quantification of β-sheet amyloid fibril structures with thioflavin T.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Similar to bis-ANS, the fluorescence of ThT exhibited a significant increase in intensity and a blue shift in spectrum in the presence of the LHCP aggregate (Fig. 1B, blue lines). The extent of these fluorescence changes is comparable with that induced by mature amyloid fibrils generated by the Aβ1–40 peptide (Fig. 1B, red versus blue, and Fig. 1C). As microscopy analyses did not indicate fibril formation in the LHCP aggregate (see below), these results suggest that ThT is not highly specific for amyloid fibrils, consistent with recent work observing ThT fluorescence of nonfibrillar aggregates of β-lactoglobulin and transthyretin (19Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Transthyretin aggregation under partially denaturing conditions is a downhill polymerization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 26Carrotta R. Bauer R. Waninge R. Rischel C. Conformational characterization of oligomeric intermediates and aggregates in β-lactoglobulin heat aggregation.Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Instead, this dye possibly binds to hydrophobic grooves that are often present in amyloid fibrils but can also be generated by other types of aggregates (27Groenning M. Olsen L. van de Weert M. Flink J.M. Frokjaer S. Jørgensen F.S. Study on the binding of thioflavin T to β-sheet-rich and non-β-sheet cavities.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To probe the stability of the LHCP aggregate, we tested its solubility in various detergents, including LDAO, DDM, β-OG, BNG, and Triton X-100. By analyzing the amount of proteins in the soluble and insoluble fractions after medium speed sedimentation (see “Experimental Procedures”), we showed that none of these detergents were able to solubilize the LHCP aggregate at or above their respective concentrations typically used for membrane protein solubilization (Fig. 2A). In addition, we tested the solubility of the LHCP aggregate in SDS using an established protocol for amyloid fibrils (21Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Analysis of prion factors in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This assay evaluated solubility of the aggregate based on the mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE after incubation with SDS-containing buffer at room temperature (see “Experimental Procedures”). “SDS-insoluble” amyloid fibrils or oligomeric protein aggregates cannot enter the resolving gel unless boiled (21Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Analysis of prion factors in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). LHCP aggregate showed significant resistance to 2% SDS in this procedure as only 24% of the aggregates could be solubilized and migrated into the gel without boiling (Fig. 2B, right panel). SDS could solubilize large LHCP aggregates only after extensive incubation and boiling of the sample (Fig. 2B, left panel). Taken together, the detergent resistance of the LHC protein aggregate suggests the presence of highly stable packing interactions within the aggregate that must be overcome by cpSRP43. Formation of large LHC aggregates can be monitored based on light scattering at 360 nm (12Jaru-Ampornpan P. Shen K. Lam V.Q. Ali M. Doniach S. Jia T.Z. Shan S. ATP-independent reversal of a membrane protein aggregate by a chloroplast SRP subunit.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The scattering intensity increases linearly with LHCP concentration above ∼100 nm (Fig. 3, black), suggesting that aggregate formation was complete under these conditions. However, the linearity broke down at lower LHCP concentrations (Fig. 3 and inset, black). This was not due to limitations in instrument sensitivity; when preformed LHCP aggregates were diluted, linearity in light scattering intensity was observed at all concentrations and extrapolated through zero (Fig. 3 and inset, red). These observations show that: (i) the LHCP aggregate is kinetically stable and virtually irreversible once it has formed; and (ii) formation of the LHCP aggregate requires a critical protein concentration, reminiscent of the critical micelle concentration during micelle formation. An analogous, “critical aggregate concentration” of 125 nm was obtained for the LHCP aggregates from these data (see “Experimental Procedures”). This micelle-like characteristic begins to suggest a globular morphology of the LHC aggregates. To directly observe the global structure of LHC aggregates, we examined them using TEM and AFM. Negatively stained TEM images revealed LHCP aggregates to be circular particles (Fig. 4, A and B). Analysis of the size of these particles resulted in a distribution that fits well to a Gaussian function, with diameters of 12 ± 2 nm (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the EM images, AFM analysis also showed LHCP aggregates to be disc-shaped particles (Fig. 5, A and B) with mean area of 214 ± 94 nm2 (Fig. 5C) or mean diameter of 16 ± 5 nm, in good agreement with the EM measurements. Strikingly, the heights of the aggregates measured by AFM are “quantized” and peaked at integrals of 0.7–0.8 nm (Fig. 5D and inset). These results suggest that LHC proteins form disc-shaped aggregates with a height of 0.7–0.8 nm, and these discs can further stack upon one another.FIGURE 5AFM analysis of LHCP aggregates.

The D-stem of the selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA(Sec)) contains 2 additional base pairs, which replace tertiary interactions 8-14 and 15-48 universally present in all other cytosolic tRNAs. To study the role of these additional base pairs in the tRNA(Sec) function, we used the instant evolution approach. In vivo screening of six combinatorial gene libraries provided 158 functional variants of the Escherichia coli tRNA(Sec). Analysis of these variants showed that the additional base pairs in the D-stem were not required for the tRNA(Sec) function. Moreover, at lower temperatures, these base pairs notably harmed the tRNA(Sec) activity. However, at elevated temperatures, these base pairs became essential as they made the tRNA structure more stable. The alternative way to stabilize the structure through formation of the standard tertiary interactions was not an option for tRNA(Sec) variants, which suggests that the absence of these interactions and the resulting flexibility of the tertiary structure are essential for tRNA(Sec) function."
https://openalex.org/W2118779880,"Dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in the dentin, where it plays a major role in the mineralization of dentin. However, we and others have shown that in addition to being present in the dentin, DPP is also present in nonmineralizing tissues like the kidney, lung, and salivary glands, where it conceivably has other functions such as in calcium transport. Because annexins have been implicated as calcium transporters, we examined the relationships between DPP and annexins. In this report, we show that DPP binds to annexin 2 and 6 present in a rat ureteric bud cell line (RUB1). Immunofluorescence studies show that annexin 2 and DPP colocalize in these cells. In addition, DPP and annexin 2 colocalize in the ureteric bud branches of embryonic metanephric kidney. In the RUB1 cells and ureteric bud branches of embryonic kidney, colocalization was restricted to the cell membrane. Studies on calcium influx into RUB cells show that in the presence of anti-DPP, there was a 40% reduction of calcium influx into these cells. We postulate that DPP has different functions in the kidney as compared with the odontoblasts. In the odontoblasts, its primary function is in the extracellular mineralization of dentin, whereas in the kidney it may participate in calcium transport. Dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in the dentin, where it plays a major role in the mineralization of dentin. However, we and others have shown that in addition to being present in the dentin, DPP is also present in nonmineralizing tissues like the kidney, lung, and salivary glands, where it conceivably has other functions such as in calcium transport. Because annexins have been implicated as calcium transporters, we examined the relationships between DPP and annexins. In this report, we show that DPP binds to annexin 2 and 6 present in a rat ureteric bud cell line (RUB1). Immunofluorescence studies show that annexin 2 and DPP colocalize in these cells. In addition, DPP and annexin 2 colocalize in the ureteric bud branches of embryonic metanephric kidney.

Consequently, GCPII inhibition has been of interest for the treatment of central and peripheral nervous system diseases associated with excess glutamate. Recently, it was reported that GCPII can also serve as an endopeptidase cleaving amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and that its inhibition could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease by increasing brain Aβ levels. This study aimed to corroborate and extend these new findings. We incubated Aβ peptides (20 μM) with human recombinant GCPII (300 ng/ml) and monitored the appearance of degradation products by mass spectrometry. Aβ peptides remained intact after 18 h incubation with GCPII. Under the same experimental conditions, Aβ1–40 (20 μM) was incubated with neprilysin (300 ng/ml), an endopeptidase known to hydrolyze Aβ1–40 and the expected cleavage products were observed. GCPII was confirmed active by catalyzing the complete hydrolysis of NAAG (100 μM). We also studied the hydrolysis of [3H]-NAAG (30 nM) catalyzed by GCPII (40 pM) in the presence of Aβ peptides (picomolar to micromolar range). The addition of Aβ peptides did not alter [3H]-NAAG hydrolysis. We conclude that GCPII is not an amyloid peptide-degrading enzyme.—Alt, J., Stathis, M., Rojas, C., Slusher.

https://openalex.org/W2136537950,"The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide is thought to be a major causative mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ accumulation could be caused by dysregulated processing of amyloid precursor protein, yielding excessive amounts of Aβ, and/or by inefficient proteolytic degradation of the peptide itself. Several proteases have been described as Aβ degradation enzymes, most notably metalloendopeptidases, aspartic endopeptidases, and some exopeptidases. Recently a report suggested that another metallopeptidase, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), can also cleave Aβ. GCPII is a zinc exopeptidase that cleaves glutamate from N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate in the central nervous system and from pteroylpoly-γ-glutamate in the jejunum. GCPII has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target for disorders caused by glutamate neurotoxicity. However, an Aβ-degrading activity of GCPII would compromise potential pharmaceutical use of GCPII inhibitors, because the enzyme inhibition might lead to increased Aβ levels and consequently to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we analyzed the reported Aβ-degrading activity of GCPII using highly purified recombinant enzyme and synthetic Aβ. We did not detect any Aβ degradation activity of GCPII or its homologue even under prolonged incubation at a high enzyme to substrate ratio. These results are in good agreement with the current detailed structural understanding of the substrate specificity and enzyme-ligand interactions of GCPII."
