https://openalex.org/W2152667145,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are essential for proper extracellular matrix remodeling. We previously found that a membrane-anchored glycoprotein, RECK, negatively regulates MMP-9 and inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis. Here we show that RECK regulates two other MMPs, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, known to be involved in cancer progression, that mice lacking a functional RECK gene die around E10.5 with defects in collagen fibrils, the basal lamina, and vascular development, and that this phenotype is partially suppressed by MMP-2 null mutation. Also, vascular sprouting is dramatically suppressed in tumors derived from RECK-expressing fibrosarcoma cells grown in nude mice. These results support a role for RECK in the regulation of MMP-2 in vivo and implicate RECK downregulation in tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000580034,"Coating of the X chromosome by Xist RNA is an essential trigger for X inactivation. However, little is known about the early chromatin remodeling events that transform this signal into transcriptional silencing. Here we report that methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 on the inactive X chromosome occurs immediately after Xist RNA coating and before transcriptional inactivation of X-linked genes. X-chromosomal H3 Lys-9 methylation occurs during the same window of time as H3 Lys-9 hypoacetylation and H3 Lys-4 hypomethylation. Histone H3 modifications thus represent the earliest known chromatin changes during X inactivation. We also identify a unique ""hotspot"" of H3 Lys-9 methylation 5' to Xist, and we propose that this acts as a nucleation center for Xist RNA-dependent spread of inactivation along the X chromosome via H3 Lys-9 methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1977872674,"To identify functions of the IKKα subunit of IκB kinase that require catalytic activity, we generated an IkkαAA knockin allele containing alanines instead of serines in the activation loop. IkkαAA/AA mice are healthy and fertile, but females display a severe lactation defect due to impaired proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. IKKα activity is required for NF-κB activation in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and in response to RANK ligand but not TNFα. IKKα and NF-κB activation are also required for optimal cyclin D1 induction. Defective RANK signaling or cyclin D1 expression results in the same phenotypic effect as the IkkαAA mutation, which is completely suppressed by a mammary specific cyclin D1 transgene. Thus, IKKα is a critical intermediate in a pathway that controls mammary epithelial proliferation in response to RANK signaling via cyclin D1."
https://openalex.org/W2008899120,"KChIP2, a gene encoding three auxiliary subunits of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, is preferentially expressed in the adult heart, and its expression is downregulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice deficient for KChIP2 exhibit normal cardiac structure and function but display a prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The KChIP2−/− mice are highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward potassium current, Ito, and a marked increase in action potential duration. These studies demonstrate that a defect in KChIP2 is sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias, establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a loss of the transmural gradient of Ito."
https://openalex.org/W4230713695,"Separation of sister chromatids in anaphase is mediated by separase, an endopeptidase that cleaves the chromosomal cohesin SCC1. Separase is inhibited by securin, which is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we demonstrate that high CDC2 activity inhibits anaphase but not securin degradation. We show that separase is kept inactive under these conditions by a mechanism independent of binding to securin. Mutation of a single phosphorylation site on separase relieves the inhibition and rescues chromatid separation in extracts with high CDC2 activity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that, in intact cells, there is complete phosphorylation of this site in metaphase and significant dephosphorylation in anaphase. We propose that separase activation at the metaphase-anaphase transition requires the removal of both securin and an inhibitory phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2059530064,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), a phosphoprotein of unknown function, is believed to be a component of a membrane-associated viral replication complex. The determinants for membrane association of NS5A, however, have not been defined. By double label immunofluorescence analyses, NS5A was found to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or an ER-derived modified compartment both when expressed alone or in the context of the entire HCV polyprotein. Systematic deletion and green fluorescent protein fusion analyses allowed us to map the membrane anchor to the amino-terminal 30 amino acid residues of NS5A. Membrane association occurred by a posttranslational mechanism and resulted in properties of an integral membrane protein. Circular dichroism structural studies of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NS5A membrane anchor, designated NS5A(1-31), demonstrated the presence of an amphipathic alpha-helix that was found to be highly conserved among 280 HCV isolates of various genotypes. The detergent-binding properties of this helical peptide together with the nature and location of its amino acids suggest a mechanism of membrane insertion via the helix hydrophobic side, yielding a topology parallel to the lipid bilayer in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane. These findings have important implications for the structural and functional organization of the HCV replication complex and may define novel targets for antiviral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2082143788,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mothers and daughters have distinct fates. We show that Cbk1 kinase and its interacting protein Mob2 regulate this asymmetry by inducing daughter-specific genetic programs. Daughter-specific expression is due to Cbk1/Mob2-dependent activation and localization of the Ace2 transcription factor to the daughter nucleus. Ectopic localization of active Ace2 to mother nuclei is sufficient to activate daughter-specific genes in mothers. Eight genes are daughter-specific under the tested conditions, while two are daughter-specific only in saturated cultures. Some daughter-specific gene products contribute to cell separation by degrading the cell wall. These experiments define programs of gene expression specific to daughters and describe how those programs are controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2127255821,"One of the key mediators of the hypoxic response in animal cells is the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) complex, in which the α-subunit is highly susceptible to oxygen-dependent degradation. The hypoxic response is manifested in many pathophysiological processes such as tumor growth and metastasis. During hypoxia, cells shift to a primarily glycolytic metabolic mode for their energetic needs. This is also manifested in the HIF-1-dependent up-regulation of many glycolytic genes. Paradoxically, tumor cells growing under conditions of normal oxygen tension also show elevated glycolytic rates that correlate with the increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters (the Warburg effect). A key regulator of glycolytic flux is the relatively recently discovered fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). Steady state levels of F-2,6-P2 are maintained by the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/F2,6-Bpase, which has both kinase and phosphatase activities. Herein, we show that one isozyme, PFKFB3, is highly induced by hypoxia and the hypoxia mimics cobalt and desferrioxamine. This induction could be replicated by the use of an inhibitor of the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes responsible for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL)-dependent destabilization and tagging of HIF-1α. The absolute dependence of the PFKFB3 gene on HIF-1 was confirmed by its overexpression in VHL-deficient cells and by the lack of hypoxic induction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts conditionally nullizygous for HIF-1α.

The absolute dependence of the PFKFB3 gene on HIF-1 was confirmed by its overexpression in VHL-deficient cells and by the lack of hypoxic induction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts conditionally nullizygous for HIF-1α. The rate of glucose utilization via the glycolytic pathway is highly regulated and depends upon the energetic and metabolic needs of the cell. It is coordinated with other pathways of energy generation and utilization, notably gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the citric acid cycle.

F-2,6-P2 is an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), the key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis as well as an inhibitor of frucrose-1,6-bisphosphatase (1Kawaguchi T. Veech R.L.

The synthesis and degradation of F-2,6-P2 depends upon a single enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase), which has both kinase and phosphatase activities. This bifunctional enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that are dependent upon intracellular cAMP levels (4Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase synthesis can be induced by mitogens, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines, implicating its role in setting the glycolytic rate under multiple physiologic and pathologic conditions (5Chesney J. Mitchell R. Benigni F. Bacher M. Spiegel L., Al- Abed Y. Han J.H. Metz C. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These isoenzymes differ not only in their tissue distribution but also in their kinetic and regulatory properties. The PFKFB3 isozyme has the highest kinase:phosphatase activity ratio and thus maintains elevated F-2,6-P2 levels, which in turn sustains high glycolytic rates (5Chesney J. Mitchell R. Benigni F. Bacher M. Spiegel L., Al- Abed Y. Han J.H. Metz C. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3047-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10Sakakibara R. Kato M. Okamura N.

Significantly, this isoform is constitutively expressed in several human cancer cell lines having high proliferative rates that require the elevated activity of the enzyme for the synthesis of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, a precursor for purines and pyrimidines (5Chesney J. Mitchell R. Benigni F. Bacher M. Spiegel L., Al- Abed Y. Han J.H. Metz C. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3047-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Boada J. Roig T.

Thus, this could serve as an explanation for the high glycolytic rates present in transformed cells even under normal oxygen tension (the Warburg effect). Hypoxia is a potent inducer of gene expression. It is also an important component of many pathophysiological processes including tumor growth and metastasis (13Maxwell P.H. Dachs G.U. Gleadle J.M.

McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar). In hypoxic conditions, as oxidative phosphorylation is impaired, cells turn to glycolysis to meet their energetic demands (the Pasteur effect). During the adaptive response to hypoxia, the expression of genes encoding several of the glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters is increased (15Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

In animals, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) complex mediates the activation of these genes. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of two subunits: a constitutively expressed β-subunit, and an α-subunit for which expression and activity are controlled by intracellular oxygen concentration (reviewed in Refs. 17Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Storey K.B. Environmental Stress and Gene Regulation. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1999: 25-45Google Scholar and 18Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). During normoxia, HIF-1α is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system, whereas exposure to hypoxic conditions prevents its degradation (19Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl.

The enzymatic hydroxylation of proline 564 of HIF-1α controls the turnover of the protein by tagging it for interaction with the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein (22Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W.

White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9630-9636Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The VHL protein forms a multiprotein complex that contains, at a minimum, elongins B and C, Cul2, and Rbx, and acts as the ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF-1α for degradation. The effect of hypoxia on Pro-564 hydroxylation can be mimicked by transition metals like cobalt, iron chelators and by inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (22Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W.

Despite its importance in regulating glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the role of PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase enzyme in the hypoxic response pathway in mammals has not been characterized. We report here that hypoxia, cobalt, and iron chelators produce a significant induction of PFKFB3 mRNA in several human and mouse cell lines. Furthermore, by utilizing conditional knock-out cell lines of the HIF-1αgene, we demonstrate that the hypoxia inducibility of this gene is dependent on the presence of an active HIF-1 complex. Cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine were purchased from Sigma. Dimethyloxalylglycine was a gift of Peter Ratcliffe (Oxford, UK). Fetal calf serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). [32P]UTP (800 Cu/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, RNase inhibitor, and DNase I (Rnase free) where from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human hepatoma Hep-3B cells and RPE (human retinal pigment epithelial) cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with pyruvate, 10–15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (wild-type and HIF-1α-deficient cell lines) were obtained from R. S. Johnson (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) (14Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Western blot analysis of this conditionally nullizygous fibroblasts for HIF-1α has shown the absence of HIF-1α mRNA and protein (14Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M.

The pVHL-deficient 786-0 renal carcinoma cells and a stable transfectant cell line expressing wild-type pVHL were provided by Nikolai Kley (Bristol-Myers Squibb). For hypoxic treatment, the culture plates were placed for 6 h in a modular incubator chamber (Billup-Rothenburg, Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) and flushed with a gas mixture containing 0.5% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 94% nitrogen. This low oxygen concentration was chosen to obtain maximal HIF-1α hypoxic stimulation, as reported by Jiang et al. (42Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cell lines using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 2 ml of guanidine isothiocyanate solution (UltraPure) (4 mguanidine isothiocyanate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol) directly in the plates. Sequentially, 0.2 ml of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 2 ml of phenol (water-saturated), and 0.4 ml of a chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:1) were added to cell lysate with thorough mixing after the addition of each reagent. RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of 2-propanol. RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and dissolved in nuclease-free water. The plasmid for synthesis of human 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) probe for ribonuclease protection assay was created by synthesis of a cDNA using total RNA from Hep-3B cells and oligo(dT) followed by cloning. PFKFB3 cDNA was amplified using forward primer (5′-GGCCGCATCGGGGGCGACTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTGCGTCTCAGCTCAGGGAC-3′). These oligonucleotides correspond to nucleotide sequences 901–920 and 2250–2231 of the human PFKFB3 cDNA, respectively (GenBankTM accession number NM004566) (9Manzano A. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Perez J.X. Nadal M. Estivill X. Ambrosio S. Gil J. Bartrons R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was cloned into plasmid pCR II-TOPO using TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). AnEcoRI-Eco47III fragment from this plasmid corresponding to nucleotide sequences 901–1218 of the human PFKFB3 cDNA was recloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using EcoRI and EcoRV sites. Following digestion with XbaI, this plasmid was utilized to create a 419-base radiolabeled antisense probe for ribonuclease protection assay. This probe recognizes a common region expressed in both the inducible and ubiquitous PFKFB3 isoforms. A similar procedure was utilized for the synthesis of a mouse probe using mouse spleen total RNA as template. The forward primer (5′-GGCAAGATTGGGGGCGACTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′GGCTCCAGGCGTTGGACAAG-3′) correspond to nucleotide sequences 1112–1131 and 1440–1421 of the mouse PFKFB3 cDNA, respectively (GenBankTM accession number AF294617). The final PCR fragment was cloned into plasmid pCR II-TOPO and following digestion with BamHI was utilized for the mouse PFKFB3 probe generation. The human Glut-1 probe was created by synthesis of a cDNA using total RNA from HeLa cells and oligo(dT) followed by cloning. Glut-1 cDNA was amplified using forward primer (5′-CCATGGAGCCCAGCAGCAAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ATGGCAGCTGGACGTGGACC-3′). These oligonucleotides correspond to nucleotide sequences 178–197 and 1390–1371 of the human Glut-1 cDNA, respectively (GenBankTM accession number NM006516). Following cloning and insertion into pBluescript II KS+, the plasmid was digested with XbaI to create a 478-base radiolabeled antisense probe. The plasmid for synthesis of mouse Glut-1 probe for ribonuclease protection assays was created by synthesis of a cDNA using total RNA from mouse lungs and oligo(dT) followed by cloning. Glut-1 cDNA was amplified using forward primer (5′-CCATGGAGCCCAGCAGCAAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CACACCGATGATGAAGCGGC-3′). These oligonucleotides correspond to nucleotide sequences 188–207 and 582–563 of the mouse Glut-1 cDNA, respectively (GenBankTM accession number M23384). PCR fragment of Glut-1 cDNA was cloned into plasmid pCR II-TOPO. This plasmid was digested with HindIII to make a 443-base radiolabeled antisense probe. The probe utilized for the human VEGF ribonuclease protection assay has been already described (27Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid for synthesis of mouse 18 S probe was created by synthesis of a cDNA using mouse lung total RNA and reverse primer followed by cloning of the cDNA, essentially as described above. The oligonucleotides utilized correspond to nucleotide sequences 233–251 and 860–843 of mouse 18 S rRNA, respectively (GenBankTMaccession number X00686). A PstI-XbaI fragment was recloned into pBluescript II SK+, and following digestion with XbaI, this plasmid was utilized to generate a 435-base radiolabeled antisense probe that was used to analyze mouse and human total RNA. All constructs were verified by sequencing the inserts and found to be 100% identical to the published sequences. Synthesis of radiolabeled probes was performed following Roche protocols using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α32P]UTP. For ribonuclease protection assays, water solutions of total RNA were dried under vacuum and dissolved in 25 μl of 80% formamide hybridization buffer containing labeled probes. Samples were preincubated for 5 min at 85 °C and then incubated for 16 h at 45 °C as described previously (27Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted, protected probe fragments were run on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer for 2 h at 50 mA. The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at −70 °C. Expression of mRNA was quantified using storage phosphor technology (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Intensity of each mRNA band was normalized for 18 S ribosomal RNA level. Gel shift assays where performed as already described (25Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Sang N. King M. Minchenko A. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts from normoxic and hypoxic cells. The 18-mer radiolabeled probe used for the gel shift assay contained the HRE consensus sequence from the erythropoietin gene. Western blots utilized total cell extracts as described (25Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Sang N. King M. Minchenko A. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Anti-HIF-2α antibody was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and antiVHL antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For supershift assays, anti-HIF-1α from Novus Biologicals was utilized. To examine the effects of hypoxia, cobalt and desferrioxamine on PFKFB3 gene expression, mRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assays. As shown in Fig.1 a, hypoxia, cobalt, and desferrioxamine greatly stimulated PFKFB3 and Glut-1 mRNA expression in Hep-3B cells. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.1 b, mRNA accumulation is visible by 2 h following treatment with desferrioxamine and is maximal at 18 h. A similar pattern of induction is seen for Glut-1 mRNA. The effect of hypoxia and desferrioxamine was also tested in ρo cells that lack mitochondrial DNA and have no functional respiratory electron transport (25Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Sang N. King M. Minchenko A. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These cells depend exclusively on glycolysis for their energetic needs, and there have been conflicting reports on their response to hypoxia as both normal and abnormal (25Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I.

Blood. 2001; 98: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 c, ρo cells, as well as their parental control cells, have a normal induction of the PFKFB3 gene in response to hypoxia and desferrioxamine. Unexpectedly, no induction of PFKFB3 was observed in HeLa cells (not shown). To test the role of HIF-1 in the hypoxic response of the PFKFB3 gene, we utilized a mouse fibroblast cell line with a conditional deletion of the HIF-1α gene (14Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type cells and HIF-1α negative cells were exposed to hypoxia for 6 h, and PFKFB3 was analyzed using the RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig.2 a, although HIF-1α positive cells have a substantial induction of PFKFB3 mRNA in hypoxia, no changes were seen in the HIF-1α negative cells. Similar effects were observed for the Glut-1 and VEGF genes, for which the response to hypoxia is known to be dependent on HIF-1. The gel shift in Fig. 2 b shows the hypoxic induction of the HIF-1 complex in the control HIF-1α (+), whereas no such complex is seen in the negative cells. The presence of HIF-1α in the hypoxic HIF-1α (+) cells was confirmed by supershift assay (Fig. 2 b). Oxygen sensing is mediated by an oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation) domain of HIF-1α protein. This reaction is mediated by specific iron-dependent prolyl hydroxylases, which utilize oxoglutarate as a co-substrate (30Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.-M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J.

Inhibition of these enzymes can induce HIF-1α under normoxic conditions (23Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A.V. Hebestreti H.F. Mukherju M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell Ph.H. Pugh C, W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4391) Google Scholar). We utilized dimethyloxalylglycine, a cell-permeable competitive inhibitor of oxoglutarate, to examine the effects of enzyme inhibition on PFKBF3 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.3 a, dimethyloxalylglycine treatment for 6 h results in the accumulation of PFKFB3 and Glut-1 mRNA to a degree equivalent to that produced by hypoxic stimulation in two different cell lines. As expected, dimethyloxalylglycine stimulates HIF-1α expression as shown by Western blot analysis in Fig. 3 b. HIF-1α hydroxylation at Pro-564, and possibly at others residues (32Masson N. William C. Maxwell P.H., C.W. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), facilitates its interaction with pVHL, which ultimately targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal system. Cells deficient in pVHL have been shown to over-express HIF-α proteins and up-regulate HIF-1-dependent genes such as VEGF and Glut-1 (33Maxwell P.H. Wiesner M.D. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4087) Google Scholar). To test the role of pVHL on PFKFB3 mRNA expression, we utilized the pVHL-deficient 786-0 renal carcinoma cell line. These cells contain a missense VHL mutation and fail to produce a functional VHL protein. As shown in Fig.4 a, VHL-deficient (−) cells overexpress PFKFB3, Glut-1, and VEGF messengers. The expression of these genes is attenuated in 786-0 cells with stable transfection of a plasmid expressing the wild form of pVHL (+). Fig. 4 bshows the increased levels of pHIF-2α in the VHL (−) cells corresponding to the absence of pVHL. The hypoxic response of an organism is manifested both at the systemic and at the cellular level. When oxygen becomes limited, cells switch from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis. Fructuose-2,6-biphosphate is the most potent activator of glycolysis and exerts control over the rate of glucose utilization (1Kawaguchi T. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28554-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Hue L. Rousseau G.G. Adv.

It allosterically activates PFK-1 and inhibits the gluconeogenic enzyme fructuose-1,6-bisphosphatase. PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase controls the levels of Fru-(2,6)-P2 by catalyzing its synthesis and degradation. Among the PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase isoforms of mammalian origin, PFKFB3 has the highest kinase:phosphatase activity. It is also the isoform most highly expressed in transformed cells, suggesting that it may contribute to the high glycolytic rate observed in tumors (5Chesney J. Mitchell R. Benigni F. Bacher M.

Komada Y. Tominaga N. Shimojo M Fukasawa M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although several studies have demonstrated that the genes coding for some of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway are activated during hypoxia, the response of the PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase gene has not been characterized. Our studies with the PFKFB3 isoform demonstrate that exposure to hypoxia produced a significant increase in its mRNA in several cell lines. However, HeLa cells, which have a high basal level of expression, did not show responses to hypoxia. The response to hypoxia was mimicked by exposure to the iron chelator desferrioxamine and the transition metal cobalt. Furthermore, the induction of thePFKFB3 gene was not affected by the absence of oxidative phosphorylation, as shown by the normal response in ρocells. These cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA and depend exclusively on glycolysis, have yielded conflicting results with respect to their responses to hypoxia (25Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Sang N. King M. Minchenko A. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M.

Blood. 2001; 98: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The results presented here confirm that gene activation in response to hypoxia is independent of the presence of an active mitochondrial respiratory chain. The role of HIF-1 was investigated using cells deficient in the HIF-1α subunit. It has been shown that the HIF-1α (−/−) cells have decreased growth rate under hypoxic conditions as well as impaired glycolytic response to hypoxia (Pasteur effect), manifested by lower ATP levels, decreased lactic acid production, and decreased acidosis (34Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E., Lu, H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The response to hypoxia of the PFKFB3 and the Glut-1 genes was completely suppressed in (−/−) cells, indicating an absolute requirement of a functional HIF-1 complex. Under normoxic conditions, pHIF-1α is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome system (19Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar, 20Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which oxygen regulates the half-life of pHIF-1α involves the hydroxylation of Pro564 (and possibly other residues) by specific prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (22Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar, 23Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I.

Following hydroxylation, HIF-1α interacts with pVHL, which acts as a ubiquitin ligase, thus targeting it for degradation. We examined the role of VHL and prolyl hydroxylation in the up-regulation of PFKFB3 using pVHL-deficient cells and competitive inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes. VHL-deficient cells overexpress several of the HIF-1-dependent genes as a result of their inability to degrade HIF-α proteins (33Maxwell P.H. Wiesner M.D. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4087) Google Scholar). The VHL-deficient 786-0 cells show elevated basal levels of PFKFB3, VEGF, and Glut-1 mRNAs that could be partially, but significantly, suppressed by the expression of a functional VHL protein. HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are a group of recently described enzymes that post-translationally modify HIF-1α in an oxygen concentration-dependent manner (30Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.-M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). The structural analysis and catalytic mechanisms of members of oxygenases of this type have demonstrated the requirement for iron and oxoglutarate for their activity. Jaakkola and co-workers (23Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A.V. Hebestreti H.F. Mukherju M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell Ph.H. Pugh C, W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4391) Google Scholar) showed that the enzymatic activity of the HIF-prolyl hydroxylases could be inhibited by 2-oxoglutarate analogs. The present studies demonstrate that N-oxalylglycine results in a significant up-regulation of PFKFB3 and Glut-1 mRNA expression. The results discussed above suggest that the HIF complex mediates the activation of the PFKFB3 gene. The structure of thePFKFB3 gene has been well characterized. The gene spans more than 26 kb containing at least 16 exons (36Navarro-Sabate A. Manzano A. Riera L. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Bartrons R. Gene. 2001; 264: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This accounts for the reported ubiquituous and inducible forms generated by alternative splicing of exon 15. Our probe, which included sequences from nucleotides 901–1218, could not differentiate between these two isoforms. Computer data base analysis of the promoter region of the PFKFB3 gene revealed a TATA box and potential binding sites for several transcription factors. Several G + C-rich regions present in the proximal 5′-end are consistent with putative motifs for the binding of Sp1 and AP-2 factors (35Fukasawa M. Takayama E. Shinoniya N. Okumura A. Rocutanda M. Yamamoto N. Sakakibara R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Navarro-Sabate A. Manzano A. Riera L. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Bartrons R. Gene. 2001; 264: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Potential HRE sequences (5′-RCGTG-3′) are found at several positions in the 5′ flanking region of the gene. One of them, at position −103 to −108 from the transcription start site, conforms to the consensus HRE found in most of the glycolytic enzymes and Glut-1 (18Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact HIF-1 binding site involved in the hypoxic regulation of the PFKFB3 gene has not been yet determined. In addition, a possible effect of hypoxia on the stability of PFKFB3 mRNA has not been studied. Phosphofructuokinase is the key enzyme that regulates glycolysis in mammalian cells. It is allosterically activated by ADP and AMP and inhibited by ATP. It is believed that F-(2,6)-P2 is the most potent activator of the enzyme. Furthermore, the levels of F-(2,6)-P2 are controlled by a balance of the kinase and phosphatase activities of PFK-2/F-2,6-BPase, which vary in different cell types and are modulated under various metabolic conditions (3Okar D.A. Lange A.J. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that hypoxia increases the expression of the PFKFB3 isoform is compatible with an adaptive response that enhances glycolysis during periods of oxygen deficiency. Tumor growth and expansion depends on their ability to generate new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and their capacity to adapt their metabolism to the hypoxic conditions created by their own growth. The activation of the HIF-1 complex is a critical response in tumor cells. It results in the enhanced transcription of a variety of genes that increase oxygen and nutrient supply (17Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Storey K.B. Environmental Stress and Gene Regulation. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1999: 25-45Google Scholar, 18Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). These adaptations, as shown here, are likely to include PFKFB3, with activation of the glycolytic pathway. It should be noted that hypoxia is not the only condition that stabilizes and activates HIF-1α. Certain hormones and growth factors, including insulin, angiotensin II, and platelet-derived growth factor, and cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor can also lead to HIF-1α stabilization (37Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Thornton R. Lane P. Borghaei R. Paese E. Caro J. Mochan E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In tumors, HIF-1α is often expressed constitutively, even under normoxic conditions as is the case in VHL mutations, or as a consequence of other oncogenic activities (39Talks K.L. Turley H.

It is tempting to speculate that in those cases PFKFB3 may be over-expressed, thus providing an explanation for the Warburg effect, which is so often found in tumor cells (43Warburg O.

https://openalex.org/W2082514511,"Mechanistic understanding of mammalian mRNA turnover remains incomplete. We demonstrate that the 3' to 5' exoribonuclease decay pathway is a major contributor to mRNA decay both in cells and in cell extract. An exoribonuclease-dependent scavenger decapping activity was identified that follows decay of the mRNA and hydrolyzes the residual cap. The decapping activity is associated with a subset of the exosome proteins in vivo, implying a higher-order degradation complex consisting of exoribonucleases and a decapping activity, which together coordinate the decay of an mRNA. These findings indicate that following deadenylation of mammal mRNA, degradation proceeds by a coupled 3' to 5' exoribonucleolytic activity and subsequent hydrolysis of the cap structure by a scavenger decapping activity."

Some rely on the activation of preformed components, whereas others depend on changes in transcriptional activity. Using cDNA arrays comprising 13,000 unique expressed sequence tags, changes in the transcriptome of<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were monitored after attempted infection with the bacterial plant pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> carrying the avirulence gene<i>avrRpt2</i>. Sampling at four time points during the first 24 h after infiltration revealed significant changes in the steady state transcript levels of ∼650 genes within 10 min and a massive shift in gene expression patterns by 7 h involving ∼2,000 genes representing many cellular processes. This shift from housekeeping to defense metabolism results from changes in regulatory and signaling circuits and from an increased demand for energy and biosynthetic capacity in plants fighting off a pathogenic attack. Concentrating our detailed analysis on the genes encoding enzymes in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, phenylpropanoids, and ethylene, we observed interesting differential regulation patterns. Furthermore, our data showed potentially important changes in areas of metabolism, such as the glyoxylate metabolism, hitherto not suspected to be components of plant defense."

Previous reports have shown that architectural DNA-bending/looping chromosomal proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 (formerly known as HMG1 and HMG2), which function in a number of biological processes including transcription and DNA repair, interact in vitro with p53 and stimulate p53 binding to DNA containing p53 consensus sites.

Both HMG box domains of HMGB1, A and B, interact with p73α. Association of HMGB1 with p73, like the demonstrated ability of HMGB1 to stimulate p73 binding to different p53-responsive elements, requires the oligomerization region and/or region between DNA-binding domain and oligomerization domain of p73 (residues 312–381). Transient transfections revealed that ectopically expressed or endogenous HMGB1 and HMGB2 (antisense strategy) significantly inhibit in vivo both p73α/β- and p53-dependent transactivation from the Baxgene promoter (and much less from Mdm2 andp21waf1 promoters) in p53-deficient SAOS-2 cells. In contrast, HMGB1 and HGMB2 stimulate p73- or p53-dependent transactivation in p53-deficient H1299 cells, irrespective of the promoter used.

This concept is supported by the fact that loss of p53 functions by genetic alternations represents the most common genetic lesions in human cancers occurring in over than 50% of all the tumors (14Oren M. Cell. 1997; 90: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). p53 gives rise to a variety of cellular outcomes, most notably cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (14Oren M. Cell. 1997; 90: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These activities are due, at least in part, to the ability of p53 to form homotetramers that bind to specific DNA sequences and activate transcription of a great number of its downstream genes, such as the Mdm2 gene (the product of which, the Mdm2 protein, is a key player in the regulation of stability of p53), a cell cycle-control gene p21 (also known as WAF1), and a apoptosis-inducing gene Bax (Bcl2-associated protein X). p53 has three functional domains: 1) the amino-terminal region involved in transactivation (TA), 2) the central region (the “core domain”) involved in specific DNA-binding (DBD), and 3) the carboxyl-terminal region involved in homooligomerization (oligomerization domain (OD)) and regulation of DNA binding. A p53-related gene,p73 (15Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar), encodes six spliced variants (α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ; Ref. 16Ichimiya Sh. Nakagawara A. Sakuma Y. Kimura S. Ikeda T. Satoh M. Takahashi N. Sato N. Mori M. Pathol. Int. 2000; 50: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The p73 isoforms possess all the functional domains found in p53. Further analyses of p73 showed that not only the primary amino acid sequence (63% identity to p53 within the core domain) but also its function resembles that of p53 (14Oren M. Cell. 1997; 90: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). p73 diverges from p53 most prominently in the COOH terminus. p73α (but not other isoforms) contains a potential protein-protein interaction module, the SAM domain, that is frequently found in proteins involved in developmental regulation. Although the core domain of p53is the most frequent target for genetic alternations (mainly single point mutations in half of all tumors), very rare mutations inp73 have been found so far despite extensive efforts (16Ichimiya Sh.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3568-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). p73, like p53, is induced by treatment of the cells with DNA damaging agents such as ionizing irradiation and anticancer drug cisplatin (19Strano S. Rossi M. Fontemaggi G. Munarriz E. Soddu S. Sacchi A. Blandino G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, p73 can transactivate in vivogenes containing p53-responsive promoters. It was shown previously that HMGB1 could significantly stimulatein vivo p53-mediated transactivation in p53-deficient H1299 cells (13Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.Ch. Murthy K., G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The latter finding was explained as a consequence of an HMGB1-mediated enhancement of p53 binding to p53-responsive elements as a result of interactions of HMGB1 with the p53 “core domain” (12Brickman J. Adam M. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10679-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other authors reported that HMGB1 could bind to p53 exclusively via the extreme basic C-terminal domain (20Imamura T. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nomoto M. Iwamoto Y. Kohno J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7534-7540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that HMGB1 physically interacts in vitro with two splicing variants of p73, α and β. Both HMG boxes of HMGB1, A and B, interact with p73α. Association of HMGB1 with p73, like the demonstrated ability of HMGB1 to stimulate p73 binding to the Bax and Mdm2 promoters by gel-shift assays, requires the oligomerization region and/or region between DNA-binding domain and oligomerization domain of p73 (amino acids 312–381). Transient transfections revealed that ectopically expressed or endogenous HMGB1 and HMGB2 (antisense strategy), significantly inhibit in vivo p73α/β- or p53-dependent transactivation from the Bax gene promoter (and much less from Mdm2 andp21waf1 promoters) in p53-deficient SAOS-2 cells. In contrast, HMGB1 and HMGB2 stimulate p73- or p53-dependent transactivation in p53-deficient H1299 cells, irrespective of the used promoter. Our results suggest that ubiquitously expressed HMGB1 and HMGB2 have potential tocell- and promoter-specifically down- or up-regulate in vivo transcriptional activity of several members of the p53 family. A possible mechanism of HMGB1-mediated modulation of p73- and p53-dependent transactivation is discussed. A polyclonal HMGB1 antiserum, generated against calf thymus HMG1, was purified by affinity chromatography on a Sepharose column with covalently linked bacterially expressed rat HMGB1. Polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP-2X) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal p53 (Ab-6 or DO-1) and p73 (Ab-1, Ab-2, and Ab-3) antibodies were from Calbiochem. Human p53 and p73(plus truncated forms) were amplified from the corresponding cDNAs by PCR using the Pfu DNA polymerase and specific oligonucleotide primers. Sense and antisense HMGB1 andHMGB2 were prepared by PCR from the corresponding human cDNAs as above. The amplified DNA samples were gel-purified, and cloned in-frame into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All plasmid constructs were dideoxy-sequenced on both strands. HMGB1, p53, p73 and truncated forms were synthesized in vitro from the corresponding cDNAs in the presence of either l-[35S]methionine (Amersham catalog no. AG1094; >37 TBq/mmol) or unlabeledl-Methionine in reticulocyte lysates using the TNT® T7 polymerase quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The wild-type p53 and p73 as well as the different p73 deletion mutants were in vitrotranscribed/translated with the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The lysate with labeled proteins was pre-cleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by addition of GST-HMGB1 or truncated forms of GST-HMGB1 and incubation by rotation for at least 2 h at 4 °C in PD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The glutathione-Sepharose beads were then added, and the samples were rotated for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with the PD buffer and mixed with 40 μl of 4× concentrated Laemmli buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. The bound proteins were then resolved by electrophoresis on SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained in Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, and soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 30 min. The dried gels were finally exposed to Fuji RX-U films using two intensifying screens at −80 °C. HMGB1 was isolated under nondenaturing conditions from calf thymus and highly purified to near homogeneity on fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (6Štros M. Muselı́ková E. J.

Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar), and total protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). p73 and the truncated polypeptides were synthesized in vitro using the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) in the presence of unlabeledl-methionine. DNA for EMSA was directly32P-labeled by PCR of the human Bax (from −138 to −19 from the start site of transcription; Ref. 20Imamura T. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nomoto M. Iwamoto Y. Kohno J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures contained 1× EMSA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40) and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin as described (13Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.Ch. Murthy K., G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Double-stranded poly(dI-dC), approximately 0.2–1 μg/reaction, was present as a competitor DNA. The protein-DNA complexes were loaded onto native 4 or 5% polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide/N,N′-methylene-bis(acrylamide)) containing 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The electrophoresis buffer was in 0.5× TBE containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The samples were loaded while the gel was running at 50 V, and the gel was then run at 250 V for 3–4 h at ∼4–8 °C, followed by vacuum drying onto Whatman no. 3MM chromatography paper. Gels were exposed to Fuji RX-U films using two intensifying screens at −80 °C. Quantification of the bands intensity was performed on a PhosphorImager Storm (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant 4.1 software for data processing. For the permanent record, the gels were scanned and subsequently adjusted for contrast/brightness using Adobe Photoshop. p53-deficient SAOS-2 and H1299 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The SAOS-2 or H1299 cells (2.5–5 × 104 cells/well of a 12-well plate) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. Transfection mixtures contained one or two expression vectors (encoding human p53, p73, HMGB1/HMGB2, or antisense HMGB1/HMGB2 in pcDNA3 plasmid; typically 250 ng each) and two different reporter constructs, the pRL family Renilla luciferase control reporter vector with the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK vector; 40 ng) and a construct of firefly (Photinus pyralis) cDNA under the control of a promoter containing p53-responsive elements (pGL3-p21waf1 -luc, kindly provided by K.

Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system, according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer (Promega). It was reported earlier that HMGB1 physically associates with p53 (13Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.Ch. Murthy K., G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Imamura T. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nomoto M. Iwamoto Y. Kohno J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7534-7540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HMGB1 (Fig.1, panel A) can also interact with other members of p53 family, pull-down assays were carried out with HMGB1 and in vitro synthesized (reticulocyte lysate) isoforms of p73, α and β. Lysates were incubated with GST-HMGB1 or domains, followed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads and subsequent washing of the beads. Proteins that were associated with glutathione beads were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 1 (panels C andD), HMGB1, like its isolated A domain, could clearly bind both isoforms of p73, α and β (binding of c-Abl SH2/3 domains to p73α, a positive control in panel C, was very weak in the pull-down assay as compared with the previously reported in vivo interactions (27Agami R. Blandino Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), possibly because of the lack of post-translational modifications). The B domain of HMGB1 could bind p73α only when it contained a seven-residue NH2-terminal extension (85TKKKFKD91) (Fig. 1, compare B domain polypeptides designated as B and B7 in panels A andC). Similar results were obtained using the pull-down assay with p53, 2M. Štros, unpublished results. explaining the previously reported inability of the B domain to bind p53 (20Imamura T. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nomoto M. Iwamoto Y. Kohno J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7534-7540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These finding provided the first evidence that the NH2-terminal85TKKKFKD91 sequence of the HMGB1 B domain is essential not only for binding to DNA (7Štros M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Štros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also for interaction with proteins. To determine which region(s) of p73 is involved in binding of HMGB1, pull-down assays were carried out with lysates containing in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled truncated forms of p73α. As shown in Fig. 2 (panel A), binding of p73α lacking the extreme C-terminal region (peptide 1–550) to HMGB1 was significantly weaker (∼10-fold) relative to the full-length p73α. On the other hand, binding of p73 lacking both the extreme C-terminal and the SAM domain (peptide 1–484), or p73 truncated up to the middle of the TA2 domain (peptide 1–427), to HMGB1 was similar to the full-length p73α. These results suggest that, in the absence of the extreme C-terminal region, the SAM domain only slightly reduces (<2-fold) the ability of HMGB1 to bind p73 in free solution. Removal of the extreme C-terminal region, SAM, and TA2 domains significantly decreased binding (>20-fold) of the p73 peptide (residues 1–381) to HMGB1, with no binding observed with the p73 peptide containing only the TA and DBD (peptide 1–311). The above results indicate that the amino acid residues 312–381 (OD and residues between DBD and OD) are essential for interaction of p73 with HMGB1, with residues 382–426 (TA2) enhancing p73 binding to HMGB1 (Fig.2). It was shown previously that HMGB1 could stimulate p53 binding to DNA fragments containing the p53 consensus sites (13Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.Ch. Murthy K., G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the possibility whether HMGB1 could also enhance specific DNA binding of p73. As shown in Fig.3, binding of in vitrosynthesized p73α to the Bax or Mdm2 promoters was barely detectable (lanes 4), in agreement with the reported inhibitory role of the extreme COOH-terminal region of p73α on specific DNA binding in vivo and in vitro(25Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, HMGB1 could slightly enhance binding of p73α to DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 5 in panels A andB). Partial deletion of the COOH terminus (peptides 1–550 or 1–381; see Fig. 2 B for the design of the used truncated p73 peptides) resulted in a significantly increased binding of the truncated p73α to the Mdm2 promoter (lanes 6and 8 in Fig. 3 B), with no visible binding to theBax promoter (lanes 6 and 8 in Fig.3 A; higher affinity of truncated p73 for Mdm2promoter was likely the result of the presence of two consensus sequences, unlike a single and imperfect consensus sequence within theBax promoter, Ref. 28Kaku S. Iwahashi Y. Kuraishi A. Albor A. Yamagishi T. Nakaike S. Kulesz-Martin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1989-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, binding of the latter p73 peptides to both promoters was markedly enhanced in the presence of HMGB1 (lanes 7 and 9 in Fig. 3; the absence of free DNA probe in panel B (lanes 7 and9), is a result of binding of excessive amount of the p73 peptides to DNA probe, whereas the absence of most of the free DNA probe in panel A (lane 9) is caused by a prolonged electrophoresis for better resolution of the complexes). Interestingly, very little, if any, DNA binding was observed with p73 peptide containing only transactivation domain and DBD (peptide 1–311), irrespective of the presence of HMGB1 (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11). Our results suggest that amino acid residues 312–381 are required for binding of p73 to both HMGB1 and specific DNA sites that are otherwise recognized by the “core domain” of p73 (Fig. 2 B). Previously it was demonstrated that HMGB1 could stimulate the p53-dependent transactivation from thecyclin G promoter in p53-deficient H1299 cells (12Brickman J. Adam M. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10679-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To find out whether HMGB1 could also stimulate p73-dependent transcriptional activation and whether the effect of HMGB1 is distinct on different promoters, transient transfections were carried out with reporter plasmids containing the Bax, Mdm2, orp21waf1 promoters in H1299 cells (endogenous p73 protein is undetectable in H1299 cell extracts by direct Western blot analysis (Ref. 29Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), but a weak signal corresponding to p73 m-RNA is to be detected after 25 cycles of reverse transcription-PCR). 3J. Shimbo, unpublished results. The latter promoters, when placed upstream of the luciferase gene, were previously shown to be activated to varying degree by p73 (25Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zeng X. Chen J. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin W.G.J. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection of plasmids encoding p73α significantly stimulated transcription from all the studied reporter plasmids. Cotransfection of plasmids encoding p73α and HMGB1 into H1299 cells resulted in up to ∼2-fold enhancement of the p73-dependent transactivation from the Bax, Mdm2, orp21waf1 promoters, with no clear differences among the tested promoters (Fig. 4). Similarly, HMGB1 could stimulate the p53-dependent transactivation from all the promoters studied,2 as also reported preciously for the cyclin G promoter (13Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.Ch. Murthy K., G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that HMGB1 can up-regulate both the p53- and p73-dependent transactivation in H1299 cells. It was previously demonstrated that the extent of p73-dependent transactivation in SAOS-2 cells was proportional to the amount of plasmids encoding p73α and β (30Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4993-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To find out whether the effect of HMGB1 on the p73- or p53-dependent transactivation iscell-specific, transfection experiments were carried out with p53-deficient osteosarcoma (SAOS-2) cells exhibiting only very low levels of endogenous p73 protein or p73 m-RNA (31Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection of plasmids encoding p73α (or the alternatively spliced p73β) or p53 with plasmid encoding HMGB1 into SAOS-2 cells resulted in significant (up to ∼4-fold) inhibition of p73/p53-dependent transactivation from the Baxpromoter (Fig. 5). The observed inhibition was proportional to the amount of the plasmid encoding HMGB1 (Fig. 5). The HMGB1-mediated inhibition of transcriptional activation from the Bax promoter was also observed using p73 truncated up to the OD, peptide 1–381 in Fig. 5 C (nuclear localization of the p73-(1–381) peptide was confirmed by confocal microscopy).2 Our results may indicate that the region encompassing the OD, and/or the region between the OD and DBD (amino acids 312–381), is required for HMGB1-mediated inhibition of transactivation. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that truncated p73 containing only TA and DBD (peptide 1–311) was unable to bind HMGB1 (pull-down assay; Fig. 3), explaining the inability of HMGB1 to enhance binding of the p73 peptide to specific DNA sites (EMSA; Fig.3). In contrast to transient transfections with the Baxpromoter, cotransfections of reporter plasmids containing either theMdm2 promoter (Fig. 6,panel A) or the p21waf1 promoter2 with plasmids encoding p53 or p73α and HMGB1 resulted in only a slight (up to ∼20%) inhibition of the p53- and p73-dependent transactivation in SAOS-2 cells. These results gave evidence that HMGB1 can specifically inhibit p53- and p73-dependent transactivation from the Baxpromoter in SAOS-2 cells. HMGB1 is a relatively abundant architectural nuclear protein, and it is possible that not all HMGB1 molecules are engaged in chromatin structure and may also serve other functions in the cell. To test whether endogenous HMGB1 could affectin vivo transcriptional activity of p53 or p73, plasmids encoding p73α/β or p53 were transiently transfected into SAOS-2 cells together with reporter constructs and plasmid encoding human antisense HMGB1. Expression of antisense (or sense) HMGB1 had little effect on p53- or p73α/β-mediated transactivation from the humanMdm2 (Fig. 6, panel A) orp21waf1 promoters.2 However, similar experiments with the Bax-luciferase reporter plasmid revealed a reproducibly enhanced (>2-fold) p53 or p73α/β-dependent transactivation when the SAOS-2 cells were co-transfected with a construct producing antisense HMGB1 (Fig. 6,panel B). These results clearly demonstrated that endogenous HMGB1 suppresses in vivo transcriptional activity of p53 and two splicing variants of p73, α and β. HMGB1 is not the only abundant HMG protein in the nucleus. A closely related HMGB2 protein is present in the nucleus in comparable amounts relative to HMGB1. We have there"

In addition, using an in vitroMatrigel assay system, we studied the potential role of caveolin-1 in capillary-like tubule formation (i.e. endothelial cell differentiation) using human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). We showed that the level of endogenous caveolin-1 expression increased in a time-dependent manner when endothelial cells underwent differentiation and that the maximum level of caveolin-1 expression occurred just prior to the formation of capillary-like tubules. Interestingly, overexpression of caveolin-1, via an adenoviral gene delivery system, clearly accelerated endothelial cell differentiation/tubule formation and led to a dramatic ∼3-fold increase in the number of capillary-like tubular structures. Conversely, down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression, via an antisense adenoviral approach, reduced the number of capillary-like tubules formed by >10-fold. Consistent with the unique function of caveolin-1 in interacting with key signaling molecules, delivery of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain into the cytoplasm of living endothelial cells was also sufficient to enhance capillary-like tubule formation.

But once they receive an appropriate stimulus, endothelial cells rapidly proliferate and form new blood vessels by a process called angiogenesis. How do endothelial cells determine whether to remain quiescent or to become proliferative? In this regard, our greatest insights into the regulation of the angiogenic process are derived from the study of embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Several growth factors responsible for endothelial cell growth and differentiation have been identified and characterized. These activators include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 also termed vascular permeability factor (2Ortega N. Hutchings H. Plouet J. Front.

In addition to these activators, negative regulators of angiogenesis are also involved in controlling the formation of new blood vessels (9Folkman J. Mol.

These inhibitors block angiogenic activator-induced endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and blood vessel formation (11O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E.

Although a variety of angiogenesis activators and inhibitors have been identified and characterized, there is very little information on the mechanisms by which angiogenesis activators and inhibitors regulate the state of endothelial cells. Recently, we demonstrated that angiogenesis activators and inhibitors reciprocally regulate caveolin-1 expression and caveolae formation (18Liu J. Razani B. Tang S. Terman B.I. Ware J.A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15781-15785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Overexpression of caveolin-1 inhibits the VEGF receptor (Flk-1)-mediated mitogenic signaling cascade, suggesting that caveolin-1 might be a cellular target for angiogenesis regulators. Three mammalian caveolin genes encoding four proteins have been identified and characterized (19Razani B. Schlegel A. Liu J. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These include caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3. Caveolin-1α and caveolin-1β are derived via alternative initiation during translation (20Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are coexpressed and form a hetero-oligomeric complex (21Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) in many cell types, with particularly high levels in adipocytes, endothelia, epithelia, and fibroblasts, whereas caveolin-3 expression is muscle-specific (22Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 23Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports the idea that caveolins interacts with a number of signaling molecules, including receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor, Neu, and Src family tyrosine kinases), protein kinase C, heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (24Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Domain mapping studies revealed that interaction of caveolins with these signaling molecules is mediated by a membrane-proximal region of the caveolins termed the caveolin scaffolding domain (residues 82–101 in caveolin-1). The caveolin scaffolding domain recognizes a specific caveolin-binding motif (i.e. consisting of closely spaced aromatic amino acids) located within the catalytic domain of a given signaling molecule (24Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar,25Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In general, interaction with caveolins or the caveolin scaffolding domain inhibits the activity of caveolin-binding signaling molecules. Although expressed in many cell types, caveolin-1 is down-regulated or absent in oncogene (v-abl, bcr-abl, Ha-ras)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (26Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) as well as in human cancer cells (27Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 28Racine C. Belanger M. Hirabayashi H. Boucher M. Chakir J. Couet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpression of caveolin-1 in Ha-ras- and v-abl-transformed NIH 3T3 cells abrogates their anchorage-independent growth by directly inhibiting the Ras-MAPK (p42/44) signaling cascade (29Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of caveolin-1 in human breast cancer cells (possessing no detectable caveolin-1) inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation (27Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Conversely, targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 by the expression of antisense caveolin-1 is sufficient to induce cell transformation and tumor formation apparently by the activation of MAPK (ERK1/2) (30Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin-1 expression is down-regulated in rapidly dividing cells and dramatically up-regulated in confluent cells (30Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). These results suggest that caveolin may function as a transformation suppressor gene (19Razani B. Schlegel A. Liu J. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that caveolin-3 expression is elevated during the differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts (31Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30315-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and this differentiation process is prevented by down-regulation of caveolin-3 expression. Consistent with a role for caveolin-1 in cell differentiation, Gumbleton and co-workers (32Campbell L. Hollins A.J. Al-Eid A. Newman G.R. von Ruhland C. Gumbleton M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) observed up-regulation of caveolin-1 expression with concomitant formation of caveolae as alveolar epithelial type II lung cellstrans-differentiate into alveolar epithelial type I cells. These results imply a potential role for caveolins in cellular differentiation. Angiogenesis is a complex process that involves a series of discrete stages or phases, including (i) an initial proliferative phase and (ii) a terminal differentiation phase. In this work, we show that caveolin-1 is down-regulated by endothelial growth factors that stimulate the initial proliferative phase; this is consistent with previous evidence demonstrating that caveolin-1 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Conversely, we evaluated the effect of caveolin-1 expression on endothelial cell differentiation. This was experimentally achieved by plating the endothelial cells at confluency to avoid the known negative effects of caveolin-1 on cell proliferation. Under these conditions of complete confluency, we show that caveolin-1 expression stimulates endothelial cell differentiation and tubule formation. This is also consistent with the previous observations that caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 are most highly expressed in terminally differentiated cell types and that caveolin gene expression is up-regulated during a variety of differentiation processes. Consistent with this interpretation, we also show that caveolin-1 levels are normally transiently up-regulated during the endothelial cell differentiation process. Thus, caveolin-1 expression is down-regulated during the proliferative phase and up-regulated during the differentiation phase of angiogenesis. Furthermore, our current findings are the first demonstration that caveolin-1 expression can stimulate a differentiation process. Similarly, we have shown previously that caveolin-1 can reverse the oncogenic behavior of transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in culture (29Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody directed against caveolin-1 (clone 2297, recognizing residues 61–71) (20Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez (BD-Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Reagents and other supplies were obtained from the following commercial sources. VEGF, PDGF, and basic fibroblast growth factor were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). HGF and a monoclonal antibody directed against β-actin were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against PECAM-1, VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1), GFP, and c-Myc were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The angiogenesis assay kit was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Penetratin-caveolin-1 peptides were synthesized by the NIH-designated Peptide Core Facility of Tufts Medical School (Boston, MA). The ProLong Anti-fade reagent was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (normal growth medium). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were grown in MCDB 131 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (normal growth medium), as described previously (33Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using antibodies against PECAM-1 and VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1) confirmed the endothelial origin of HMEC-1 cells. 2J. Liu, X. Wang, D. S. Park, and M. P. Lisanti, unpublished data. To study the effect of growth factors on caveolin-1 expression, BAECs (1 × 104 cells/well) or HMEC-1 cells (2 × 104cells/well) were treated with VEGF, PDGF, or HGF in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and prepared for Western blot analysis as described below. The construction of recombinant Myc epitope-tagged caveolin-1 adenovirus (Ad-Cav-1), green fluorescent protein adenovirus (Ad-GFP), and tetracycline transactivator adenovirus (Ad-tTA) were as we described previously (34Zhang W. Razani B. Altschuler Y. Bouzahzah B. Mostov K.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20717-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This adenoviral vector system is inducible and requires a coactivator for expression (Ad-tTA) as previously described (34Zhang W. Razani B. Altschuler Y. Bouzahzah B. Mostov K.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20717-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The adenovirus harboring antisense caveolin-1 (Ad-Cav-1-AS) is not inducible and was constructed and characterized as we previously described (35Park D.S. Razani B. Lasorella A. Schreiber-Agus N. Pestell R.G. Iavarone A. Lisanti M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 104 cells/ml in six-well plates and co-incubated with Ad-Cav-1 and Ad-tTA in serum-free medium for 1 h, followed by incubation in growth medium for 24 h. The level of caveolin-1 expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using a specific monoclonal antibody directed against either caveolin-1 or the c-Myc epitope tag. A combination of various titers of Ad-Cav-1 and Ad-tTA was employed to achieve optimum levels of caveolin-1 expression. The efficiency of the infection was determined by immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against caveolin-1. As a control, HMEC-1 cells were co-infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-tTA or infected with Ad-Cav-1 alone. For antisense caveolin-1 studies, HMEC-1 cells seeded at a density of 8 × 104 cells/ml in six-well plates were incubated with Ad-Cav-1-AS in serum-free medium for 1 h, followed by incubation in growth medium for 24 h. The level of caveolin-1 down-regulation was assessed by Western blot analysis using a specific monoclonal antibody directed against caveolin-1. The formation of capillary-like tubular structures was assessed in Matrigel-coated multiwell plates essentially as described previously (36Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 cells were infected with or without adenovirus harboring sense or antisense caveolin-1 for 24 h as described above. Cells were then seeded at a density of 30 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium in Matrigel-coated multiwell plates and incubated at 37 °C for a period of 0–24 h. To study the effect of caveolin-1 peptides on tubule formation, HMEC-1 cells (30 × 104 cells/ml) were incubated in Matrigel-coated multiwell plates at 37 °C for 1 h to allow cells to attach to the Matrigel, followed by treatment with penetratin-caveolin-1 fusion peptides (5 μm) for 20 h. The formation of tubular structures was examined using an Olympus IX70 microscope. The expression levels of caveolin-1 were determined by Western blot analysis. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmsodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, and protease inhibitors. Total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence. Prior to loading, the protein concentration of the samples was measured by the BCA method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. After incubation with biotin-penetratin (B-Pen) or biotin-penetratin-caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (B-Pen-C1-SD) fusion peptides (at a concentration of 2 μm) in growth medium at 37 °C for 2 h, HMEC-1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Internalized peptides were visualized by incubation of the cells with rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin in the permeabilization buffer. The internalized peptides were visualized using the Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with a photometric CCD camera under the rhodamine channel. We have previously shown that angiogenic growth factors down-regulate caveolin-1 expression in ECV 304 cells (18Liu J. Razani B. Tang S. Terman B.I. Ware J.A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15781-15785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting that caveolin-1 may be important in angiogenesis. After publication of our results, the endothelial origin of ECV 304 cells was recently questioned (37Brown J. Reading S.J. Jones S. Fitchett C.J. Howl J. Martin A. Longland C.L. Michelangeli F. Dubrova Y.E. Brown C.A. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To re-evaluate the possible effects of angiogenic factors on caveolin-1 expression in endothelial cells, we next treated primary BAECs and a well established human endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) (33Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a panel of different angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF, PDGF, and HGF and examined the level of caveolin-1 expression in these cells. Fig. 1 A shows that treatment of BAECs with either VEGF or PDGF at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 24 h dramatically down-regulated caveolin-1 expression. Similarly, treatment of rat capillary endothelial cells with an angiogenic factor (basic fibroblast growth factor) led to down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of HMEC-1 cells with VEGF, PDGF, or HGF caused the dose-dependent down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression (Fig. 1 B). Our current results are consistent with our previous observations, indicating that caveolin-1 may be a bona fide cellular target for angiogenesis regulators in endothelial cells. Importantly, however, angiogenic growth factors did not affect caveolin-1 expression in confluent endothelial cells (data not shown). Angiogenesis involves the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of endothelial cells. To test the hypothesis that caveolin-1 plays an important role in angiogenesis, we next employed an in vitro angiogenesis assay system. To focus on the possible effects of caveolin-1 on endothelial cell differentiation, we seeded HMEC-1 cells at super-confluency (see “Experimental Procedures”) to minimize the effects of caveolin-1 on cell proliferation. We have recently shown that in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated in rapidly dividing cells, but dramatically increased in confluent cells; in these confluent cells, caveolin-1 was specifically concentrated at the areas of cell-cell contact (30Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 38Volonte D. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results suggest a potential role for caveolin-1 in regulating contact inhibition and perhaps cellular differentiation. Indeed, we (31Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30315-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and others (32Campbell L. Hollins A.J. Al-Eid A. Newman G.R. von Ruhland C. Gumbleton M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that caveolins are critical for the differentiation of muscle cells as well as epithelial cells. Based on these observations, we would predict that caveolin-1 should increase during the process of endothelial cell differentiation/tubule formation. Fig. 2 A shows that incubation of HMEC-1 cells on Matrigel from 0 to 24 h caused the time-dependent formation of tubular structures. These tubular structures first appeared after 12 h of incubation and developed into a well organized capillary-like network after 24 h of incubation. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that caveolin-1 levels steadily increased in a time-dependent manner and reached their maximum after 8 h of incubation (Fig.2 B), ∼4 h prior to the beginning of tubule formation (Fig.2 A). Conversely, caveolin-1 levels then decreased from 12 to 24 h and returned to basal levels after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that a transient increase in caveolin-1 levels may be functionally important in the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation/tubule formation. To better assess the potential role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation, we next transiently up-regulated or down-regulated the levels of caveolin-1 in confluent HMEC-1 cells. For this purpose, we employed a series of well characterized adenoviral vectors that harbor the caveolin-1 cDNA either in the sense or antisense orientation. Fig. 3 shows the dose-dependent overexpression of caveolin-1 in HMEC-1 cells co-infected with Ad-Cav-1 and Ad-tTA. A maximum level of caveolin-1 expression was obtained by infecting HMEC-1 cells with both Ad-Cav-1 and Ad-tTA (200 pfu/cell each) (Figs. 3 and 5 B). Longer exposures were required to reveal endogenous caveolin-1 expression in the HMEC-1 cells (see Fig. 5 B). Importantly, there was no transduced expression of caveolin-1 either in cells infected with Ad-Cav-1 alone or in cells co-infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-tTA, although co-infection of Ad-GFP and Ad-tTA led to GFP expression (Figs. 3 and 5 B).Figure 5Expression of caveolin-1, but not GFP , enhances endothelial tubule formation. Twenty-four hours post-infection, HMEC-1 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in Matrigel-precoated 96-well plates and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. A, bright-field views of non-infected cells (Mock; panel a), caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-overexpressing cells (panel b), GFP-overexpressing cells (panel c), and cells infected with Ad-Cav-1 alone (panel d) are shown after 20 h of incubation on Matrigel. Panel a, mock transduction;panel b, Ad-Cav-1 (200 pfu/cell) plus Ad-tTA (200 pfu/cell);panel c, Ad-GFP (200 pfu/cell) plus Ad-tTA (200 pfu/cell);panel d, Ad-Cav-1 alone (200 pfu/cell). B, the number of capillary-like tubules formed after 20 h was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 4. Data are the means ± S.D. from three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Also, an aliquot of the cells from each group was lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a specific antibody probe directed against caveolin-1. Note that the level of transduced caveolin-1 expression was dramatically higher than that of endogenous caveolin-1 expression (see arrows). Expression of GFP under these conditions was also confirmed (data not shown; see Fig. 3). The same membrane was reprobed with a monoclonal antibody directed against β-actin as a control for equal protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If caveolin-1 expression is important for the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation, we would predict that premature up-regulation of caveolin-1 might lead to early endothelial tubule formation.

The p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway also serves to protect primary cells against oncogenic transformation. We have used a genetic screen in mouse neuronal cells, conditionally immortalized by a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen, to identify genes that allow bypass of senescence. Using retroviral cDNA expression libraries, we have identified TBX-3 as a potent inhibitor of senescence. TBX-3 is a T-box gene, which is found mutated in the human developmental disorder Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome. We have shown that TBX-3 potently represses expression of both mouse p19ARF and human p14ARF. We have also shown here that point mutants of TBX-3, which are found in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome, have lost the ability to inhibit senescence and fail to repress mouse p19ARF and human p14ARF expression. These data suggest that the hypoproliferative features of this genetic disorder may be caused, at least in part, by deregulated expression of p14ARF.

These data suggest that the hypoproliferative features of this genetic disorder may be caused, at least in part, by deregulated expression of p14ARF. The high frequency of p53 mutation found in different types of human cancers suggests a central role for p53 in suppression of tumorigenesis. The p53 tumor suppressor protein functions as a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in a variety of cellular processes, including induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The regulation of p53 is complex and involves post-translational mechanisms such as protein degradation, phosphorylation, and acetylation (1Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In a normal cell the levels of p53 are low because the protein is prone to rapid proteasomal degradation. p53 activation can be induced by a variety of stimuli and results in stabilization of the protein and regulation of its target genes. Activation of p53 can be the result of cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, or ribonucleotide deprivation (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 appears to play a central part in the cellular response to stress. Cells deficient for p53 continue to proliferate after exposure to genotoxic stress, whereas cells expressing wild-type p53 arrest in order to repair the DNA damage or undergo apoptosis (3Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar). The ability of p53 to respond to DNA damage either by induction of cell cycle arrest or activation of a suicide program might explain why loss of p53 function allows the survival of cells with mutated DNA, leading to the rapid accumulation of multiple oncogenic mutations. p53 is also involved in limiting the proliferative capacity of primary rodent cells. Rodent fibroblasts lacking p53 proliferate indefinitely in tissue culture without undergoing replicative senescence (4Harvey M. Sands A.T. Weiss R.S. Hegi M.E. Wiseman R.W. Pantazis P. Giovanella B.C. Tainsky M.A. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2457-2467PubMed Google Scholar), a program that arrests wild-type cells after a limited number of divisions in vitro. When cells are cultured in vitro they accumulate increasing levels of p19ARF, p53, p21CIP1 and p16INK4Aover time and undergo a permanent arrest, which is dependent on the presence of the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins (5Sherr C.J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Activation of p19ARF appears to be critical for the induction of senescence, as cells lacking p19ARF have an indefinite lifespan in vitro (referred to as “immortality”) (8Kamijo T. Zindy F.

The human ortholog of p19ARFis p14ARF. We here use the term ARFwhen we refer to both the human and mouse genes. The ARF protein interacts with Mdm2 (9Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J.

Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In addition, ARF binding to Mdm2 inhibits the ubiquitin-ligase activity of Mdm2 toward p53 and inhibits p53 loading with ubiquitin molecules (12Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The result of activation of p19ARF is stabilization of transcriptionally active p53, which in turn can activate target genes like p21CIP1. Indeed, p19ARFexpression in cells containing wild-type p53 is able to induce a senescence-like arrest, whereas expression of p19ARFin cells lacking p53 does not inhibit proliferation (8Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway is also required to protect primary cells against oncogenic transformation. Aberrant mitogenic signaling induced by activation of oncogenes like c-myc, adenovirus E1A, E2F-1, andrasV12 causes increased p19ARFlevels, leading to stabilization and activation of p53 (13Zindy F.

Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 by RasV12 or E2F-1 is known to cause a senescence response (17Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar, 18Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), whereas high levels of c-Myc or the viral oncogene E1A render the cell susceptible to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis (13Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 14de Stanchina E. McCurrach M.E. Zindy F.

Which factors influence the suicidal tendencies of the p19ARF-p53 pathway is not yet clear. One possible explanation could be that anti-apoptotic activities of RasV12 promote senescence rather than apoptosis, while the promitogenic functions of c-Myc and E1A may bypass the senescence arrest making a cell susceptible to undergo apoptosis. Especially for E1A this is a likely scenario as its ability to bind and inactivate the retinoblastoma family proteins explains a bypass of senescence, as cells lacking these proteins are immortal and unresponsive to high levels of p19ARF (6Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 7Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The relevance of the p19ARF-p53-mediated antiproliferative response in tumorigenesis is best documented for therasV12 and c-myc oncogenes. In contrast to wild-type cells, cells deficient for either p19ARF or p53 continue to proliferate in the presence of oncogenic rasV12 and are fully transformed (8Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). For c-myc a dramatic increase in tumorigenesis is observed when mice overexpressing c-myclack one allele of p19ARF (19Jacobs J.J. Scheijen B. Voncken J.W. Kieboom K. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2678-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 20Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It is likely that the function of the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway to restrict the proliferative response following oncogene activation is as important to prevent tumorigenesis as the ability of p53 to prevent the accumulation of viable cells with damaged DNA. Given the central role of the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway in proliferation and senescence, we have performed a genetic screen to find new genes, which when overexpressed can modify the activity of the components of this pathway. We have used a mouse embryonic striatum cell line, conditionally immortalized by expression of a temperature-sensitive allele of the SV40 T antigen (22Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and retroviral cDNA expression library screens to identify genes that mediate escape from senescence. This strategy allowed the isolation ofTBX-3 as a gene that results in a bypass of senescence by down-regulation of p19ARF expression. TBX-3is found to be mutated in the human Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome, a genetic developmental disorder accompanied by hypoproliferation of cells in a number of tissues, including the breast (23Bamshad M. Lin R.C. Law D.J. Watkins W.C. Krakowiak P.A. Moore M.E. Franceschini P. Lala R. Holmes L.B. Gebuhr T.C. Bruneau B.G. Schinzel A. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jorde L.B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We show that point mutants in TBX-3, which are found in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome (24Bamshad M., Le, T. Watkins W.S. Dixon M.E. Kramer B.E. Roeder A.D. Carey J.C. Root S. Schinzel A. Van Maldergem L. Gardner R.J. Lin R.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Wallerstein R. Moran E. Sutphen R. Campbell C.E. Jorde L.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1550-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), have lost the ability to repress the human p14ARF promoter. We propose that the developmental defects seen in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome are caused, at least in part, by deregulated expression of human p14ARF. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Ecotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transfection of phoenix packaging cells by calcium-phosphate precipitation. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the tissue culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral supernatant was used for infection of cells after addition of 4 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were infected for at least 6 h and allowed to recover for 48 h with fresh medium. ST.Hdh Q111 mouse striatum cells express a mutant version of the huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine repeat from a knock-in Hdh allele and a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 T antigen, introduced by retroviral transduction. ST.Hdh Q111 mouse striatum cells were cultured at 32 °C and were shifted to the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) when indicated. For growth curves, 1.5 × 104 cells were plated in 12-well plates, and relative cell numbers were measured as described (17Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). To measure immortalization of wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), 1MEFmouse embryo fibroblastHAhemagglutininCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase primary MEFs of FVB genetic background at passage 5 were infected with retroviral supernatants and cultured for one passage. At passage 7 cells were used for growth curves. mouse embryo fibroblast hemagglutinin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase High titer retroviral library supernatants derived from human placenta tissue or whole mouse embryo libraries (CLONTECH) were used to infect 2 × 106 ST.Hdh Q111 striatal cells. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were plated at a density of 0.8 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish and 48 h after infection the cells were shifted to 39 °C (the non-permissive temperature for the transforming SV40 T antigen). Colonies of cells appeared only in the library-infected populations. These colonies were picked and expanded. To analyze whether the rescue was indeed due to expression of a retroviral library-derived cDNA, a second round screen was performed, in which cells were infected with wild-type replication competent Moloney virus (MoMuLV) to mobilize the integrated proviruses. Supernatant containing the mobilized proviruses was used to infect fresh ST.Hdh Q111 striatal cells at 32 °C. Retroviral cDNA inserts were PCR-amplified using specific retroviral primers. Specific TBX-3 primers were used to isolate the TBX-3 coding sequence and to clone it into a pBABE-puro retroviral vector. L143P and Y149S mutants of TBX-3 were generated by PCR and sequence verified and cloned into a HA tag containing pBSK vector. Finally, HA-tagged versions of mutant and wild-type TBX-3 were cloned into the pLIB retroviral vector or into pcDNA 3.1. Western blots were carried out on whole cell extracts, separated on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The p19ARF (R562) antibody was obtained from Abcam, Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect HA-tagged versions of TBX-3, and rabbit polyclonal serum was used to detect TBX-2 (25Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained. Second antibodies used were TEXAS-RED goat anti-rabbit (1:75, Vector Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:75, DAKO). COS-7 cells were transfected at 40% confluency by calcium-phosphate precipitation with the human p14ARF (−19 to +54) promoter CAT construct in combination with 0–5 μg of pcDNA 3.1 TBX-2 or TBX-3 expression vector. All transfections contained equal amounts of pCDNA3 vector. Transfection efficiencies were measured by co-transfection of 1 μg of pSV-βgal (Promega). CAT and β-galactosidase activities were analyzed 48 h after transfection by standard methods. As a system to isolate cDNAs that prevent the induction of replicative senescence in rodent cells, we used ST.Hdh Q111 cells: primary mouse striatum cells derived from knock-in mice expressing a mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded glutamine repeat, which were conditionally immortalizedin vitro by retroviral transduction of a temperature-sensitive mutant (tsA58) of SV40 large T antigen (22Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Immortalization by ts-LT transduction occurred at a much lower frequency in primary striatum cells expressing the expanded huntingtin repeat, and these cells show lower spontaneous escape frequencies from the senescence response after shift to the non-permissive temperature than their wild-type counterparts. The stress induced by the expression of the mutant Hdh protein might explain the more robust senescence response after shift to the non-permissive temperature (22Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum Mol Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). ST.Hdh Q111 cells proliferate rapidly at the permissive temperature (32 °C) but enter into a synchronous senescence-like arrest when shifted to the non-permissive temperature (39 °C, Fig. 1 A). We favored the use of ST.Hdh Q111 cells for the experiments described below, because they have a lower spontaneous immortalization frequency compared with both ts-LT-immortalized wild-type striatum cells and ts-LT-immortalized wild-type MEFs (data not shown). The low spontaneous immortalization frequency greatly facilitates the detection of a rare retrovirus-mediated immortalization event. To identify cDNAs, which when overexpressed inhibit this robust senescence response, we infected these cells at the permissive temperature (32 °C) with a whole mouse embryo retroviral cDNA library, a human placenta cDNA library or control green fluorescent protein retrovirus. After a shift to the non-permissive temperature the vast majority of cells were arrested and rare non-senescent proliferating colonies were observed only in the cDNA library-infected populations. To distinguish the colonies that were truly rescued by a retrovirally encoded cDNA from those that escaped senescence spontaneously, the proliferating colonies were expanded and infected with wild-type MoMuLV. This leads to packaging of library-derived retroviruses through the production of retroviral coat proteins by the wild-type MoMuLV. This supernatant was then used in a second round to infect fresh ST.Hdh Q111 cells. After temperature shift, infected cells were again tested for rescue of senescence. For each cDNA library, several independent colonies were identified of which the integrated provirus was able to inhibit senescence of ST.Hdh Q111 cells in second round infection (Fig.1 B). Because the T-box protein TBX-2 efficiently inhibits senescence in primary murine fibroblasts (25Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we used immunofluorescence to discard the colonies, which were rescued by retrovirally encoded TBX-2. Indeed all three colonies obtained following infection with the whole mouse embryo cDNA library overexpressed TBX-2. From the human placenta cDNA library five out of the ten colonies that rescued senescence in second round selection overexpressed TBX-2, even though all colonies that were rescued by a retroviral cDNA displayed a similar cellular morphology (Fig.2 A). Colonies that did not show TBX-2 expression were used to recover the retrovirally encoded cDNA by PCR. One of these clones appeared to contain a ∼3-kb cDNA insert, which after sequence identification proved to beTBX-3, a member of the T-box family, which is found mutated in the human Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome (23Bamshad M. Lin R.C. Law D.J. Watkins W.C. Krakowiak P.A. Moore M.E. Franceschini P. Lala R. Holmes L.B. Gebuhr T.C. Bruneau B.G. Schinzel A. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jorde L.B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Consistent with its identification from a human placenta cDNA library, TBX-3is highly expressed in placental tissue (24Bamshad M., Le, T. Watkins W.S. Dixon M.E. Kramer B.E. Roeder A.D. Carey J.C. Root S. Schinzel A. Van Maldergem L. Gardner R.J. Lin R.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Wallerstein R. Moran E. Sutphen R. Campbell C.E. Jorde L.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1550-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hybridization of the cDNAs present in other rescued colonies with a TBX-3probe shows that TBX-3 was isolated in four independent colonies (Fig. 2 B). In total, we isolated nine cDNAs that were active in second round selection; five of these encoded TBX-2 and the remaining four TBX-3. To verify that TBX-3 alone is able to rescue senescence, the open reading frame of TBX-3was cloned in a retroviral vector. Fig.3 A shows that TBX-2and TBX-3 were both very active in preventing senescence of ST.Hdh Q111 cells at the non-permissive temperature.Figure 3TBX-3 down-regulates p19ARF in ST. HdhQ111 cells and immortalizes wild-type MEFs.

No virus control sample was derived from MEFs at passage 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ask whether TBX-3 could also inhibit senescence in primary MEFs we introduced TBX-3 in wild-type MEFs and monitored the ability of these MEFs to become immortal. Fig.3 B shows that both TBX-2 and TBX-3prevent the induction of senescence in primary MEFs. TBX-3-expressing MEFs can be cultured indefinitely without showing any signs of senescence (data not shown). Co-introduction of TBX-3 and arasV12 oncogene in primary MEFs results in escape from RasV12-induced senescence, without causing complete oncogenic transformation as TBX-3 andrasV12 co-expressing cells were unable to grow in soft agar (data not shown). Similar observations have been made recently for TBX-2 and rasV12co-expressing cells (25Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In primary MEFs senescence induction requires elevation of p19ARFexpression, which occurs when the cells are cultured in vitro. MEFs lacking the transcription factor DMP1 (which activates the p19ARF promoter) or MEFs deficient for p19ARF will escape the senescence response (8Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E.

Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1797-1809PubMed Google Scholar). Since TBX-3 is a transcriptional repressor (27He M. Wen L. Campbell C.E., Wu, J.Y. Rao Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10212-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and because TBX-2 has been shown to act as a repressor of p19ARF expression, we analyzed the expression of p19ARF in theTBX-3-immortalized clones. As shown by immunofluorescence, the p19ARF signal in a TBX-3 immortalized clone is lower than in the senescent ST.Hdh Q111cells grown at the non-permissive temperature, even though the subcellular localization of p19ARF was not affected (Fig. 2 A). Western blot of ST.Hdh Q111cells, 48 h after infection with a TBX-3 orTBX-2 retrovirus at the permissive temperature showed that the reduction of p19ARF protein is an early event (Fig. 3 C). Haplo-insufficiency forTBX-3 results in the developmental Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome (23Bamshad M. Lin R.C. Law D.J. Watkins W.C. Krakowiak P.A. Moore M.E. Franceschini P. Lala R. Holmes L.B. Gebuhr T.C. Bruneau B.G. Schinzel A. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jorde L.B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of TBX-3 found to cause the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome often give rise to truncated protein products, but point mutants in the T-box have also been found (24Bamshad M., Le, T. Watkins W.S. Dixon M.E. Kramer B.E. Roeder A.D. Carey J.C. Root S. Schinzel A. Van Maldergem L. Gardner R.J. Lin R.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Wallerstein R. Moran E. Sutphen R. Campbell C.E. Jorde L.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1550-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To examine the activity of these point mutants of TBX-3 we constructed retroviral vectors expressing HA-tagged versions of wild type, [L143P]TBX-3 or [Y149S]TBX-3. Expression of wild type, but not the L143P or Y149S mutant forms of TBX-3, resulted in bypass of senescence in ST.Hdh Q111 cells after shift to the non-permissive temperature (Fig.4 A), even though the wild-type and mutant TBX-3 proteins were expressed at comparable levels in these cells (Fig. 4 B). Infection of primary MEFs at passage 5 with wild-type or mutant forms of TBX-3 showed that the mutant proteins are inactive in inhibiting senescence in fibroblasts (Fig. 4 C). Analysis of p19ARF expression levels shows that the mutant TBX-3-infected populations fail to show p19ARFdown-regulation at the protein level (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the observed down-regulation of p19ARFexpression by wild-type TBX-3 was transcriptional, we performed a reporter assay using the human p14ARF promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene. Fig.5 A shows that TBX-2 and TBX-3 are able to mediate transcriptional repression of a p14ARF promoter region spanning from −19 to +54 in a dose-dependent manner. This promoter region does not contain a consensus T-box site (GTGGTA) (28Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that T-box proteins bind to a non-consensus T-box site in the p14ARF promoter or that T-box proteins interact indirectly with the p14ARF promoter. Importantly, the point mutants of TBX-3, which were not able to immortalize the ST.Hdh Q111 cells or the primary MEFs, were severely compromised in their ability to repress the p14ARF promoter (Fig. 5 A) while they were expressed at similar levels compared with wild-type TBX-3 (Fig.5 B). In this study we have described a genetic screen to identify novel regulators of the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway. We have used a striatal cell line that expresses a mutated form of the huntingtin protein and was conditionally immortalized by overexpression of a ts SV40 large T allele. Upon inactivation of the ts large T oncogene (by a temperature shift to 39 °C) p53 is no longer inactivated, resulting in the induction of p53 target genes like p21CIP. The result of this conditional p53 response is a homogeneous cell cycle arrest that resembles replicative senescence. Indeed introduction of HPV-16 E6, which degrades p53, results in a bypass of this antiproliferative arrest (data not shown). However, the precise nature of the senescence response downstream of p53 is not clear since p21CIP1-deficient MEFs do undergo both spontaneous and rasV12-induced senescence (29Pantoja C. Serrano M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4974-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover there is currently little insight in how the p19ARF-p53 pathway is activated upon prolonged culturing of primary cells in vitro, or by stress evoked by oncogenes like c-myc and rasV12 (13Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar,16Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Given the high frequency of mutations in p14ARF and p53 in human tumors, genes involved in the regulation of ARF expression or execution of the senescence response downstream of p53, potentially encode cancer-relevant genes. The highly stringent senescence response of our conditionally immortalized ST.Hdh Q111 cell line allowed a genetic approach to identify genes that mediate bypass of this response. This resulted in the isolation of multiple independently cloned TBX-3 cDNAs from a placental cDNA library. The T-box family member TBX-3 is not only able to immortalize the ST.Hdh Q111 cell line, but also efficiently inhibits senescence in wild-type MEFs. This validates the ST.Hdh Q111 cell system used to identify inhibitors of senescence as it demonstrates that the gene identified in the ST.Hdh Q111 cells also prevents spontaneous immortalization in primary fibroblasts that do not harbor a mutant huntingtin gene. TBX-3 induces immortalization by repression of both murine and human ARF expression. The repression ofARF appears to be transcriptional as a reporter construct containing the −19 to +54 sequences of the human p14ARF promoter was repressed by TBX-3. These results add TBX-3 to a growing list of proteins that affect the activity of the p19ARF promoter. Of these, TBX-2 (25Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M.

ARFactivity seems to be regulated mainly at the level of transcription, and a strong selective pressure for loss of ARF expression is observed during tumorigenesis, often resulting from mutation or methylation of the ARF locus. Therefore it is not surprising that many of the genes that affect ARF promoter activity either by a direct or indirect mechanism also play a role in tumorigenesis. Loss of the transcripional activator DMP-1 for instance results in a tumor prone phenotype in mice (26Inoue K. Wen R. Rehg J.E. Adachi M. Cleveland J.L. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1797-1809PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of the transcriptional repressor BMI-1 results in lymphomagenesis (36Alkema M.J. Jacobs H. van Lohuizen M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At this time we do not know whether TBX-3 is overexpressed in human cancer, but our data clearly warrant a detailed investigation for its role in cancer development. TBX-3 is found mutated in the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome, where haplo-insufficiency for TBX-3 appears to be the cause of the developmental defects in this disease (23Bamshad M. Lin R.C. Law D.J. Watkins W.C. Krakowiak P.A. Moore M.E. Franceschini P. Lala R. Holmes L.B. Gebuhr T.C. Bruneau B.G. Schinzel A. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jorde L.B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In patients suffering from the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome, limb, dental, external genitalia, apocrine-gland, and hair abnormalities are observed. In agreement with this TBX-3 is widely expressed in adult tissues (24Bamshad M., Le, T. Watkins W.S. Dixon M.E. Kramer B.E. Roeder A.D. Carey J.C. Root S. Schinzel A. Van Maldergem L. Gardner R.J. Lin R.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Wallerstein R. Moran E. Sutphen R. Campbell C.E. Jorde L.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1550-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Breast hypoplasia seen in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome patients, suggest a role forTBX-3 in regulation of proliferation. Consistent with a role for TBX-3 in proliferation, we have cloned TBX-3due to its ability to drive cell proliferation in our genetic senescence bypass screen. This could suggest that the ability ofTBX-3 to drive proliferation resulting in a senescence bypass is the same activity, which upon loss in the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome results in tissue hypoplasia. Indeed point mutations inTBX-3 that result in the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome in humans (24Bamshad M., Le, T. Watkins W.S. Dixon M.E. Kramer B.E. Roeder A.D. Carey J.C. Root S. Schinzel A. Van Maldergem L. Gardner R.J. Lin R.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Wallerstein R. Moran E. Sutphen R. Campbell C.E. Jorde L.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1550-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have lost the potential to bypass senescence in our system. This is correlated with a defect in repression of the human p14ARF promoter, making deregulated p14ARF levels a likely cause for the hypoproliferation seen in these patients. Coupling deregulatedARF expression to developmental defects might appear at odds with the absence of any developmental defects in p19ARF-deficient mice. However, mice deficient for the p19ARF-repressor Bmi-1 manifest cerebellar defects, which can be rescued by crossing Bmi-1-deficient mice to INK4a −/− mice (35Jacobs J.J. Kieboom K. Marino S. DePinho R.A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). This suggests strongly that elevated p19ARF expression is causally related to the observed brain pathology in theBmi-1 −/− mice. By analogy, haplo-insufficiency for TBX-3 might lead to supraphysiological levels of p14ARF expression, which interfere with normal proliferation of the tissues that are affected in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome.

This leads to fibroblast activation and enhanced collagen synthesis, but the underlying mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. In this study, we have begun to identify and characterize mechanical strain-responsive elements in the rat procollagen α1(I) (COL1A1) gene and show that the activity ofCOL1A1 promoter constructs, transiently transfected into cardiac fibroblasts, was increased between 2- and 4-fold by continuous cyclic mechanical strain. This was accompanied by a ∼3-fold increase in the levels of total active transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) released into the medium. Inclusion of a pan-specific TGF-β neutralizing antibody inhibited strain-induced COL1A1promoter activation. Deletion analysis revealed the presence of two potential strain response regions within the proximal promoter, one of which contains an inverted CCAAT-box overlapping a GC-rich element. Both mechanical strain and exogenously added TGF-β1 enhanced the binding activity of CCAAT-binding factor, CBF/NF-Y, at this site. Moreover, this element was sufficient to confer strain-responsiveness to an otherwise unresponsive SV40 promoter. In summary, this study demonstrates that strain-induced COL1A1 promoter activation in cardiac fibroblasts is TGF-β-dependent and involves increased binding of CCAAT-binding factor at the proximal promoter. Furthermore, these findings suggest a novel and potentially important TGF-β response element in the rat COL1A1gene.

Cells of the cardiopulmonary system are constantly exposed to mechanical stimulation from shear and tensile stresses, and in a number of pathological states, e.g. systemic hypertension, these stresses are significantly exaggerated (1Bishop J.E. Lindahl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that mechanical strain plays an important role in maintaining normal tissue architecture by influencing cell function and behavior and may also be involved in the pathogenesis of disease (2Watson P.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This area of research has recently gained much interest with respect to tissue remodeling seen in fibrosis and tissue repair in major organs, including the heart and lung, because increased mechanical force (strain, shear stress, and pressure) has been shown to activate a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways and alter the expression of a large number of genes in cells from these organs (1Bishop J.E. Lindahl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Liu M. Tanswell A.K. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L667-L683PubMed Google Scholar). In the cardiopulmonary system, interstitial fibroblasts are believed to play a central role in orchestrating tissue remodeling in response to mechanical strain, both by increasing the release of auto/paracrine factors leading to proliferation and by altering their expression of extracellular matrix genes (1Bishop J.E. Lindahl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Type I collagen, the most abundant protein in the interstitium of major organs, plays a critical structural role and influences numerous cellular responses (4Chambers R.C. Laurent G.J. Crystal R.D. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 709-727Google Scholar). Excessive production of type I collagen is a key feature of fibrotic disorders of the lung, liver, kidney, skin, and heart and multisystem diseases such as systemic sclerosis and hypertension, often leading to severe organ dysfunction (5McAnulty R.J. Laurent G.J. Phan S.H. Thrall R.S. Pulmonary Fibrosis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 135-171Google Scholar, 6Varga J. Jimenez S.A. Ann. Intern.

Novel therapeutic approaches for these disorders will come from a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the type I collagen genes in such pathological conditions. The expression of the genes COL1A1 and COL1A2, encoding the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen, respectively, is controlled primarily at the level of transcription and is tightly regulated to allow physiologic modulation during development and tissue repair (8Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Karsenty G. Park R.W. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Numerous mediators, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), 1TGF-βtransforming growth factor-βCBF/NF-YCCAAT-binding factorTAK1transforming-growth factor β-activated kinaseCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1EMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assaysTAETGF-β activation elementwtwild type connective tissue growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, prostaglandine-E2, and interferon-γ, have been shown to up- or down-regulate type I collagen gene expression in vitro. Moreover, changes in the relative levels of these mediators have been associated with fibrotic disorders (4Chambers R.C. Laurent G.J. Crystal R.D. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 709-727Google Scholar). TGF-β1, a member of a family of cytokines with pleiotropic effects on fibroblasts, has emerged as a pivotal mediator in tissue repair (10O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and in the development of fibrosis (11Sime P.J. Xing Z. Graham F.L. Csaky K.G. Gauldie J. J. Clin.

It was recently reported that transforming-growth factor-β-activated kinase, TAK1, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, is activated as a delayed response to mechanical stress in mouse myocardium. Furthermore, a constitutively active form of TAK1 expressed in the mouse heart was sufficient to cause cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and severe myocardial dysfunction (13Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that increased mechanical load enhances the expression of the COL1A1 gene both in vivo(1Bishop J.E. Lindahl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and in isolated fibroblasts in vitro (14Butt R.P. Bishop J.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this change remain poorly understood. There is evidence from studies in mesangial (15Hori Y. Katoh T. Hirakata M. Joki N. Kaname S. Fukagawa M. Okuda T. Ohashi H. Fujita T. Miyazono K. Kurokawa K. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1616-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (16Gutierrez J.A. Perr H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1074-G1080PubMed Google Scholar) that enhanced COL1A1 expression in response to mechanical strain is TGF-β-dependent. Increased activation of TGF-β has also been demonstrated for fibroblasts subjected to strain (17Lee A.A. Delhaas T. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); however, whether this was sufficient to cause an increase in COL1A1 expression was not examined. A major TGF-β1 response element has been reported at position −1624 in the rat COL1A1 gene (18Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the functional importance of this site has subsequently been questioned (19Stoddart J.H., Jr. Ladd D. Bronson R.T. Harmon M. Jaworski J. Pritzker C. Lausen N. Smith B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, results from two studies, including the original report, suggest the existence of other, as yet unidentified, response elements (18Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20King S.L. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. Xie R. Long G.L. Absher M.P. Cutroneo K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13156-13161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several additional regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors have been implicated in TGF-β transactivation of type I collagen genes in other species. Because of the high sequence homology in certain regions of the type I collagen promoters across species, these elements may represent potential additional candidates for mediating the response to TGF-β and mechanical strain in the ratCOL1A1 gene. These elements have been shown to bind transcription factors Sp1, NF-I, and AP1 (1Bishop J.E. Lindahl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and more recently also Smad proteins (21Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), the major effector molecules responsible for propagating TGF-β signaling following receptor activation (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early activation of the human procollagen α2(I) (COL1A2) gene by TGF-β was shown to involve interaction of Smad3/Smad4 with Sp1 in both fibroblasts (23Zhang W., Ou, J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and mesangial cells (24Poncelet A.C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Smad proteins can also interact with components of the AP1 complex, as has been demonstrated in the activation of the collagenase I promoter (25Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, there is accumulating evidence that Smad3 plays a major role in mediating the fibrotic responses of TGF-β (26Roberts A.B. Piek E. Bottinger E.P. Ashcroft G. Mitchell J.B. Flanders K.C. Chest. 2001; 120: 43S-47SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether Smad complexes are directly involved in the activation of the type I collagen genes during prolonged cellular stress leading to fibrosis remains to be established. With this background we hypothesized that transcriptional activation of the rat COL1A1 gene in cardiac fibroblasts subjected to mechanical strain is mediated by autocrine stimulation by TGF-β and that this activation involves TGF-β response elements in the promoter region of the gene. To address this hypothesis, rat cardiac fibroblasts were transiently transfected with rat COL1A1promoter/reporter gene constructs and subjected to mechanical strain. Here we show that cyclic mechanical strain activates the ratCOL1A1 promoter in cardiac fibroblasts via a TGF-β-dependent pathway. Furthermore, at least two regions in the proximal promoter, including an inverted CCAAT-box at position −100/−94, appear to be involved in the response. Finally, increased binding of CBF/NF-Y to this inverted CCAAT-box was shown to contribute to the transcriptional activation by mechanical strain. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanism by which mechanical force increases COL1A1 gene activation. Importantly, these findings identify an as yet unappreciated role for CBF/NF-Y in regulating COL1A1 transcription in response to extracellular signals associated with enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. Primary cultures of fetal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac fibroblasts were prepared by collagenase digestion as previously described (27Butt R.P. Laurent G.J. Bishop J.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 330-335PubMed Google Scholar), and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Cells were used at passages 6–9 and plated on collagen I-coated elastic silicon membranes in 6-well (25-mm diameter) Flex I plates (FlexCell International). Confluent cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM containing serum replacement 1 and HEPES buffer (Sigma), glutamine, and antibiotics. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, either alone or supplemented with either 50 ng/ml mithramycin (Sigma), 1 ng/ml porcine TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), 75 μg/ml pan-specific TGF-β neutralizing antibody (AB-100-NA, R&D Systems, which, according to the manufacturer, was sufficient to block 90% of the effect of 1 ng/ml TGF-β1), or equivalent amounts of IgG control antibody. The TGF-β neutralizing antibody and mithramycin was added 1 h prior to subjecting the cells to mechanical strain. The cells were subjected to mechanical strain for 24–48 h using the Flexercell FX-3000 apparatus (Flexcell International), which applies controlled cyclic or static strain to cell monolayers in culture. The strain applied was such as to give an average of 10% elongation of the membrane and a cycle frequency of 1 Hz. This strain regimen was chosen because it is similar to physiological/pathological tension experienced by cells in the heart (28Ono S. Waldman L.K. Yamashita H. Covell J.W. Ross J., Jr. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). pColCAT3.6/1.6 (also denoted B16) was a gift from A. Lichtler and D. Rowe (University of Connecticut Health Center). This plasmid construct is identical to B15, described by Breault et al. (29Breault D.T. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31241-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except an EcoRV site in the polylinker has been converted to a ClaI site. The construct contains sequences between −3518 and +1594 (relative to the transcription start site) of the rat COL1A1 gene, which includes the upstream promoter region, the first exon (the translational start site, ATG, has been converted to a NotI site), and most of the first intron (3.6/1.6 refers to 3.6 kb of upstream promoter sequence and 1.6 kb of downstream sequence). To create the promoter deletion constructs pCOLCAT-1.3/1.6 and −0.4/1.6, B16 was digested with NheI (all restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas) at position −3382, together with Tth111I at −1282 to create pColCAT-1.3/1.6, or MunI at −395 to create pColCAT-0.4/1.6. The ends were blunted and the constructs religated. The intronless pColCAT3.6/0 has the first intron and the distal third of the first exon replaced with the 16 S splice donor site from the SV40 virus (compare B47 in Ref. 29Breault D.T. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31241-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The set of proximal promoter deletion constructs were generated using an ExoIII/Mung Bean deletion kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommendations.MunI restriction enzyme was used to linearize B16 after which exonuclease treatment generated small deletions of various lengths in both directions. The constructs were subsequently digested with NheI and religated to generate promoter fragments with different 5′ ends but which were ligated to an identical upstream cloning site, equivalent to that of constructs pCOLCAT-1.3/1.6 and −0.4/1.6. The exact extent of the deletions and the sequence across cloning sites were determined by automated DNA sequencing (377 DNA Sequencer, Applied Biosystems) using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The sequence numbering in the proximal promoter is according to the rat COL1A1 promoter sequence reported by Lichtler et al. (30Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number J04464). The heterologous promoter constructs were generated by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutated Region A sequence (Fig. 4 A), with additional restriction enzyme sites at either end, to the SV40 promoter-driven (enhancer-less) luciferase pGL2P vector (Promega). The correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing as described above. Transfections of rat COL1A1 promoter-reporter constructs into rat cardiac fibroblasts (at ∼90% confluence) were performed using the calcium phosphate ProFection Mammalian Transfection System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations 3 h after the addition of fresh serum-containing medium. At least two different plasmid DNA preparations (EndoFree, Qiagen) were tested to eliminate potential preparation artifacts. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA per well (25-mm diameter) overnight (16 h), rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated as described above. At the appropriate time points, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured as chemiluminescence in a TD-20/20 luminometer from Turner designs (Promega) using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The data are presented as relative light units (RLU). Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) protein levels in the cell lysates were measured by ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), were within the linear range of the standard curve and expressed as relative absorbance units (RAU). Because many viral promoters driving reporter genes in transfection control plasmids are regulated by mechanical strain (personal observation), a Hirt's assay was performed as described in Clark et al. (31Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to determine the relative transfection efficiency between constructs used and between experimental conditions. Briefly, a DNA fragment from the vector backbone part of the COL1A1 promoter/reporter construct was radiolabeled and used as a probe in hybridizations to DNA from 30 μl of cell lysate that had been denatured and immobilized on a nylon membrane. The relative radioactive signal representing the amount of plasmid DNA in the cell lysate was measured by phosphorimaging densitometry. No significant difference in transfection efficiency was observed between the constructs or between experimental conditions. Transfections were performed three or more times in triplicate wells, unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Because the study was performed using primary fibroblasts and significant variation was observed in the fold induction of promoter activity between experiments, the data presented are from one representative experiment showing mean and standard error within that experiment. The statistical significance of the data was, however, evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U test of combined experiments. Levels of total active TGF-β in the conditioned medium was determined using the method developed by Abeet al. (32Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the capability of TGF-β to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression and uses mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) stably transfected with a truncated PAI-1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Porcine TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) was used to generate a standard curve for the estimation of active TGF-β concentrations in the medium. The statistical significance was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney Utest using the raw data (relative luciferase activity). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) from mechanically strained and rigid rat cardiac fibroblasts that had been pooled from six wells. Briefly, dishes were placed on ice and the cells washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Nuclear proteins were extracted in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics). The concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Extracts were stored in aliquots at −80 °C prior to use and only freeze-thawed once. EMSAs, using radiolabeled probes, were performed essentially as described previously (34Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 3 μg of nuclear extract per binding reaction using standard conditions of a gel-shift kit from Promega. For competition assays, 125-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides used are listed in Fig.4 A and were purchased from Invitrogen when custom made and Santa Cruz Biotechnology for standard transcription factor consensus binding sites. Antibody supershift assays were performed using anti-CBF-A or anti-NF-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nonimmune IgG control antibodies added to the nuclear extracts and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides. The protein/DNA complexes were separated in a 4% acrylamide/bis (29:1) gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The relative intensities of the complex bands were calculated from the radioactive signal measured by phosphorimaging densitometry. Previous work has shown that COL1A1 mRNA levels are increased in rat cardiac fibroblasts subjected to mechanical strain (14Butt R.P. Bishop J.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To begin to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms involved, we initially used four rat COL1A1 promoter CAT-reporter constructs in transient transfection assays and exposed rat cardiac fibroblasts to continuous cyclic mechanical stretch (strain) for 48 h. All responses were compared with cells transfected with the same construct, but kept static under otherwise identical conditions (rigid controls) (Fig. 1). The full-length construct, pColCAT-3.6/1.6, contains 3.6 kb of the 5′ upstream promoter sequence and 1.6 kb of sequence downstream of the transcription start site, including the first exon and most of the first intron. This construct was chosen because these regions of the COL1A1 gene, including the first intron, are known to contain potentially important positive and negative regulatory sequences (29Breault D.T. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31241-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Raisz L.G. Fall P.M. Petersen D.N. Lichtler A. Kream B.E. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2818-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and it therefore provides a suitable starting point for modeling responses of the endogenous gene. Cells transfected with the full-length pColCAT-3.6/1.6 construct displayed an ∼2-fold increase in CAT protein levels in response to continuous cyclic strain for 48 h compared with rigid control cells. Similar responses were obtained with a deletion construct in which sequences upstream of position −1.3 kb had been removed (pColCAT-1.3/1.6), whereas the response with a construct lacking sequences upstream of −0.4 kb (pColCAT-0.4/1.6) was significantly greater (p < 0.01). Taken together, these results indicate that repressor element(s) located in the region between −0.4 and −1.3 kb may dampen the stimulatory effect of mechanical strain. We also tested a construct in which the first intron had been deleted, pColCAT-3.6/0. The response to strain was greater compared with that obtained with construct pColCAT-3.6/1.6 containing the intron, suggesting that the first intron is unlikely to contain important strain response elements and that sequences within the intron may be involved in modulating the magnitude of the transcriptional response. The data suggest that increased COL1A1 gene expression by mechanical strain is mediated, at least in part, by increased transcription and that regulatory sequences around the transcription start site, within the −0.4/1.6 construct, are involved in mediating this response. In addition, because the pColCAT-3.6/1.6 and pColCAT-1.3/1.6 constructs responded in a similar manner, the only previously reported TGF-β activation element (TAE) in the ratCOL1A1 gene at position −1624 (18Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) appears not to be involved. This raised two possibilities: either the induction of COL1A1 transcriptional activation by mechanical strain in rat cardiac fibroblasts is independent of TGF-β or other important TGF-β response elements, apart from the site reported (18Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), are present in the rat COL1A1 gene. To examine whether TGF-β activity is necessary for strain-induced transactivation of the COL1A1promoter, we determined the effect of mechanical strain on the activity of a promoter construct lacking the previously described TAE at position −1624 (pColCAT-1.3/1.6) in the presence of a pan-specific TGF-β neutralizing antibody. Fig.2 A shows that mechanical strain increased activation of the pColCAT-1.3/1.6 construct ∼3-fold and that this increase was almost completely blocked in the presence of the antibody. In addition, the activity of this promoter construct was strongly induced by TGF-β1 added exogenously as a positive control. Involvement of TGF-β was further examined by determining levels of total active TGF-β in the media from mechanically strained and rigid control cells using a TGF-β bioassay based on Mv1Lu stably transfected with a TGF-β-responsive PAI-1 promoter luciferase reporter construct (32Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). PAI-1 promoter activity of these cells in the presence of conditioned medium from mechanically strained cells was 2.6-fold higher compared with medium from rigid control cells (Fig.2 B). These concentrations were equivalent to 30 and 12 pg/ml of active TGF-β, respectively, extrapolated from a TGF-β1 standard curve. Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of the rat COL1A1 promoter by mechanical strain in cardiac fibroblasts requires TGF-β and that mechanical strain leads to the release of active TGF-β into the medium"

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Specific arginine residues of these domains are di-methylated in vivo, and this enhances the affinity for SMN, indicating that SMN preferentially interacts with post-translationally modified RG-rich protein targets (23Friesen W.J.

The known targets of the SMN complex are all components of RNPs and have diverse roles in several aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. These functions include transcription and processing of most cellular pre-mRNAs and rRNAs. This observation suggests that the SMN complex likely functions in some essential steps of RNA metabolism. Previous studies have provided evidence that the SMN complex functions in the assembly of spliceosomal snRNPs, pre-mRNA splicing, and transcription (16Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The SMN complex may also play a role in the metabolism of snoRNPs involved in processing and modification of ribosomal RNA (18Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms of SMN function are not yet known, these findings have led to the proposal that the SMN complex is a macromolecular machine, which functions in the assembly and function of several RNP complexes (15–26). Understanding the function of the SMN complex at the molecular level is necessary to uncover the defect responsible for SMA. To identify all the components of the SMN complex and to characterize its biochemical, structural, and functional properties, we developed a system for the purification of native SMN complexes. We generated stably transfected HeLa cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged SMN or Gemin2 fusion proteins and used these cell lines to affinity-purify endogenous SMN complexes. Unlike complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation with currently available antibodies to SMN or Gemin2, these complexes can be eluted from the antibodies with the FLAG peptide and thus are obtained in native form. The purified SMN complexes likely contain all the core components in their native conformation, correct stoichiometry, and proper post-translational modifications. From these experiments, novel proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and peptide microsequencing. Here, we characterized one of these proteins, Gemin6, as a novel component of the SMN complex. The open reading frames of SMN and Gemin2 fused at their 5′-end to the sequence encoding the epitope (FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2) were generated by PCR amplification using specific primers. The inserts were cloned into the pTRE vector (CLONTECH). The cDNA corresponding to Gemin6 was generated by PCR amplification using the EST clone N. 4764576 (IMAGE) as a template. The inserts were cloned downstream of the CMV promoter into modified pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) containing either the myc-tag or the FLAG-tag sequences at the amino terminus. Gemin6 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-5X vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to obtain the amino-terminal GST fusion. DNA constructs encoding myc-tagged Sm proteins were described previously (11Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). All constructs were analyzed by automated DNA sequencing. Human Gemin6 sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AF453443. HeLa PV, HeLa Tet-ON, or 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method. Following overnight incubation with DNA, cells were washed and fresh medium added. HeLa Tet-ON cells (CLONTECH) that constitutively express the tetracycline transactivator were co-transfected with the pTRE plasmids encoding FLAG-SMN or FLAG-Gemin2 (25 μg) and the pTK-Hyg plasmid (1.25 μg) carrying the hygromycin resistance gene. Stable clones were obtained by double selection in the presence of G418 (100 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Individual clones were isolated and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 following induction by doxycycline (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 cell lines were grown in the presence of G418 (100 μg/ml), hygromycin (100 μg/ml), and doxycycline (5 μg/ml). HeLa Tet-ON (control) cells were grown in the presence of G418 and doxycycline. Total cell extracts were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in RSB-100 (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2 100 mm NaCl) buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Cells were passed five times through a 27-gauge needle and sonicated briefly. Following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatants were passed through a 0.2-μm filter and added to anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) pre-washed with the same buffer. Extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and beads were extensively washed with RSB-100 containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Three high salt washes were performed with ten bed volumes of RSB-500 (500 mm NaCl) buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min at 4 °C. Following three washes with RSB-100 containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40, bound complexes were eluted with 10 bed volumes of the same buffer containing 0.25–0.5 mg/ml 3X-FLAG peptide (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bands were excised from a single one-dimensional or two-dimensional silver-stained polyacrylamide gel and in gel digested with trypsin as described previously (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides in the supernatant were analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (28Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) using a QSTAR (MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Comprehensive protein and expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases were searched using the Protein and Peptide Software Suite (MDS Proteomics). No limitations on protein molecular weight and species of origin were imposed. Antibodies used in these experiments were as follows: 2B1, mouse IgG1 monoclonal anti-SMN (14Liu Q. Dreyfuss G.

Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from 293T total cell extracts as previously described (29Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Western blot and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). HeLa cells, plated on glass coverslips, were briefly washed with PBS, fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Double-label immunofluorescence experiments were performed by separate sequential incubations of each primary antibody, diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, followed by the specific secondary coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or TXRD. All incubations were at room temperature for 1 h. Indirect epifluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Digital images were collected with a Cook Sensicam high performance camera and processed with the IP laboratory software. Recombinant GST and GST-Gemin6 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro binding experiments were carried out using purified recombinant GST or GST-Gemin6 (5 μg) proteins bound to glutathione beads and Sm proteins translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 as previously described (15Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We wished to establish a cell system that would allow isolation of the native endogenous SMN complex for the characterization of its composition, structure, and function. To do so, we generated stable cell lines that express epitope-tagged SMN and Gemin2. The open reading frames encoding SMN or Gemin2 fused at the amino terminus to the FLAG epitope (FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2) were generated by PCR amplification and were cloned into the pTRE vector downstream of a promoter containing the tetracycline-responsive element (pTRE-FLAG-SMN and pTRE-FLAG- Gemin2). HeLa Tet-ON cells were transfected either with pTRE-FLAG-SMN or with pTRE-FLAG-Gemin2, and stably integrated clones were selected with antibiotics (see “Experimental Procedures”). Over 50 clones were isolated and analyzed for the expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins in the presence of doxycycline (a tetracycline analogue) in the medium. To avoid possible side effects of SMN or Gemin2 overexpression, we selected those stable cell lines that express sub-stoichiometric levels of the FLAG-tagged proteins (as determined by Western blotting using anti-SMN antibodies) and whose morphology, growth, and division rates are indistinguishable from those of the parental cell line (HeLa Tet-ON). Fig.1 shows Western blot analysis of FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 expression in representative clones after 48 h of incubation in the absence or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of doxycycline. The expression levels of FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 directly correlate with the amount of doxycycline over a wide range of concentrations and do not exceed 20% of the corresponding endogenous proteins. We did not observe changes in the endogenous levels of any of the SMN complex components upon expression of FLAG-SMN or FLAG-Gemin2 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that the expression of the FLAG-tagged SMN or Gemin2 has no effects on the metabolism of the respective cell lines. Next we carried out affinity purification of SMN complexes from these cell lines. In all the experiments described below, cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Total cell extracts from the FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 stable cell lines, and the parental HeLa Tet-ON strain as a control, were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound proteins were eluted by competition with an excess of FLAG peptide and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Fig. 2 A shows that several specific proteins are detected in the immunoprecipitate from the FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 cell extracts as compared with the control extract. Silver staining and Western blot analysis indicate that high salt washes greatly improve the purity of the complexes without compromising the association of the SMN complex components (Fig.2 A and data not shown). Moreover, the protein composition of the complexes isolated via FLAG-SMN or FLAG-Gemin2 is identical and they likely contain all the integral components of the SMN complex (Fig. 2 B). Among the specific proteins, all the known components of the complex, SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4 are present in similar relative stoichiometry to that observed in complexes purified with anti-SMN or anti-Gemin2 antibodies (Ref. 10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar and see below). The presence of smaller amounts of Sm and U1A proteins, whose association is partially labile to high salt washes, was confirmed either by mass spectrometric peptide sequencing or by Western blot analysis with specific monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). We conclude that this system is suitable for the purification of native SMN complexes containing all the core components of the complex with correct stoichiometry, native conformation, and putative post-translational modifications. Both cell lines grow in suspension allowing large-scale purification of the SMN complex. The availability of purified native SMN complexes will play an important role in future studies of the structure and molecular function of this macromolecular machine. Several not yet identified proteins that co-purified with complexes isolated via FLAG-tagged SMN or Gemin2 are very likely to be novel components of the SMN complex (Fig. 2). We analyzed several of the more prominent proteins by peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. Additionally, sub-stoichiometric amounts of additional proteins with molecular masses in the 68 to 160 kDa range specifically co-purify with both FLAG-SMN and FLAG-Gemin2 (brackets in Fig. 2 A). In particular, a 70-kDa protein co-purifies reproducibly with the SMN complex. Western blotting indicated that the 70-kDa protein is neither the U1 70K protein nor the heat shock cognate 70 protein (data not shown). The identification of this protein and whether it represents a genuine component of the SMN complex is currently under investigation. The 175-kDa polypeptide, also described by Meister et al.(31Meister G. Buhler D. Pillai R. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), is a novel protein component of the SMN complex, termed Gemin5, that binds to SMN and localizes to gems (13Gubitz, A. K., Mourelatos, Z., Abel, L., Rappsilber, J., Mann, M., and Dreyfuss, G. (November 19, 2001) J. Biol. Chem.10174/jbc.M109448200Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis and peptide sequencing of the 16-kDa protein band, which is specifically purified via FLAG-SMN and FLAG- Gemin2, indicated the presence of SmD1, SmD2, and SmD3 proteins as well as of unrelated proteins (arrow in Fig. 2). In earlier work (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), two SMN complex components of ∼16 and 15 kDa, named SIP2 and SIP3, respectively, were identified in anti-SMN immunoprecipitates (see also Fig. 3, 2B1 panel). To demonstrate directly the presence of both these proteins, we compared the immunoprecipitates obtained from total HeLa cell extracts labeled with [35S]methionine using anti-SMN (2B1) or control (SP2/0) antibodies and the complexes purified via FLAG-SMN by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or silver staining. Fig. 3 shows that, in addition to SmF, specific proteins of ∼16 and 15 kDa, previously referred to as SIP2 and SIP3, respectively (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), are present in both SMN immunoprecipitates. The spots corresponding to these proteins were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were sequenced by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptide sequences obtained from both proteins revealed that they are unknown proteins matching perfectly to two different EST sequences in the data base. Below we present the characterization of the 16-kDa protein (SIP2) as a novel component of the SMN complex that we name Gemin6. The peptide (VQDLIEGHLTASQ) obtained from the 16-kDa protein (Gemin6) matched perfectly to several EST sequences in the data base, and the corresponding cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification. Gemin6 cDNA contains both start and stop codons, and an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initial methionine indicates that the cDNA represents the full-length transcript. Gemin6 cDNA encodes a protein of 167 amino acids of predicted molecular mass (18 kDa) and isoelectric point (pI = 4.84) consistent with the size and the pI of the protein eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Fig.4 shows the alignment of putative Gemin6 orthologues that are found in mouse (identity 86%, similarity 96%) and C. elegans (identity 22%, similarity 41%). SMN is found in several organisms, including S. pombe and D. melanogaster (5Owen N. Doe C.L. Mellor J. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Paushkin S. Charroux B. Abel L. Perkinson R.A. Pellizzoni L. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whose entire genome sequence has been completed. We were unable to identify Gemin6 orthologues in these organisms possibly due to the evolutionary divergence of its amino acid sequence. Indeed, Gemin2 orthologue of S. pombe was identified based on its interaction with SMN and not based on its amino acid sequence conservation (7Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that Gemin6 is not present in these organisms. Data base searches revealed that Gemin6 has no significant homology to other proteins and contains no known motifs that may suggest possible functions. The observation that Gemin6 co-purifies with SMN under highly stringent conditions indicates that it is a novel core component of the SMN complex. To confirm this, we transiently transfected 293T cells with a vector encoding a FLAG-tagged Gemin6 fusion protein (FLAG-Gemin6) or with an empty vector as a control (mock). Total extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fig.5 shows that FLAG-Gemin6 is expressed and efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies. All the components of the SMN complex, SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4, are co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Gemin6. The immunoprecipitation is specific, because the abundant protein hnRNP A1 is not immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Gemin6 and none of the proteins are immunoprecipitated from a control extract that does not express Gemin6. These results demonstrate that Gemin6 is a novel component of the SMN complex.Figure 5Gemin6 is a component of the SMN complex. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3 vector encoding FLAG-tagged Gemin6 (Gemin6) or empty pcDNA3 vector (mock). Total extracts were prepared from these cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies against the proteins indicated on the left. total represents 10% of the extract used for the immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SMN localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is highly concentrated in gems (14Liu Q.

Gems are nuclear bodies that are similar in size and number to Cajal bodies and can be found, depending on the cell type or tissue analyzed, either separated or associated with them (14Liu Q.

In contrast, most targets of SMN complex interaction such as snRNPs and snoRNPs localize to Cajal bodies but not to gems when these structures are found separated (14Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 35Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To further characterize Gemin6, we sought to analyze its subcellular localization. To do so, we transiently transfected myc-tagged Gemin6 in HeLa PV cells and carried out indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig.6 A shows that Gemin6 localizes to discrete nuclear domains in addition to the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. These nuclear domains are gems, because they colocalize perfectly with SMN (Fig. 6, A–C) but not with coilin (Fig.6, D–F), the marker of Cajal bodies (30Andrade L.E. Tan E.M. Chan E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similar to all previously identified components of the SMN complex (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), Gemin6 staining without coilin can be observed in transfected cells. In HeLa S3 cells that typically display fused gems and Cajal bodies, Gemin6 coincides with both SMN and coilin (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that Gemin6 is a novel component of the SMN complex and is localized similarly in cells. We further studied the interactions of Gemin6 in vitro with the other known components of the SMN complex, including SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, and Gemin5, as both purified recombinant and in vitro translated proteins. No specific direct interaction of Gemin6 with these components could be detected in vitro(data not shown). Therefore, it is presently not clear with which of the core components of the SMN complex Gemin6 interacts. It is possible that Gemin6 interacts with an additional component yet to be identified. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, Gemin6 association may depend on the presence of multiple components of the complex and/or on some post-translational modifications missing in thein vitro translated proteins. Next, we investigated the interactions of Gemin6 with the Sm proteins of spliceosomal snRNPs, the best characterized targets of SMN complex interaction and function. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Sm proteins were incubated with purified recombinant GST-Gemin6 or GST, as a control. Fig.7 shows that Gemin6 interacts specifically with SmD2 and SmE and, to a lesser extent, with SmB and SmD3. No interactions of Gemin6 with SmD1, SmF, and SmG or of any of the Sm proteins with GST were detected. These experiments demonstrate that, consistent with its presence in the SMN complex, Gemin6 interacts specifically with a subset of Sm proteins. Each of the core components of the SMN complex, except Gemin2, interacts with a distinct set of Sm proteins. Upon oligomerization, SMN interacts avidly with the symmetrically dimethylated arginines of the carboxyl-terminal RG-tails of SmD1 and SmD3 and with SmB (15Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc.

Gemin6 is the SMN complex component that interacts most avidly with SmD2 and SmE. Sm proteins form a heptameric ring, known as the Sm core, on the Sm site of all spliceosomal snRNAs (36Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the SMN complex associates with all the Sm proteinsin vivo and mediates their assembly possibly by delivering the Sm proteins to the snRNA (10Liu Q.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Our previous and present studies indicate that individual components of the SMN complex interact with distinct sets of Sm proteins, providing direct evidence for multiple contacts between the Sm proteins and the SMN complex. It is possible that these multiple interactions may not take place simultaneously but that individual Sm proteins change binding partners within the SMN complex as a result of spatial rearrangements associated with the Sm core assembly on the snRNA. With the identification of Gemin6 the inventory of the integral constituents of the SMN complex appears to be nearly complete. The system described here for purification of the native SMN complex will facilitate further studies of its interactions, structure, and function. We thank Dr. Eng Tan for anti-p80 coilin antibodies.

In this paper, we demonstrate that one of the Nedd4-binding proteins, N4WBP5, belongs to a small group of evolutionarily conserved proteins with three transmembrane domains. N4WBP5 binds Nedd4 WW domains via the two PPXY motifs present in the amino terminus of the protein. In addition to Nedd4, N4WBP5 can interact with the WW domains of a number of Nedd4 family members and is ubiquitinated. Endogenous N4WBP5 localizes to the Golgi complex. Ectopic expression of the protein disrupts the structure of the Golgi, suggesting that N4WBP5 forms part of a family of integral Golgi membrane proteins. Based on previous observations in yeast, we propose that N4WBP5 may act as an adaptor for Nedd4-like proteins and their putative targets to control ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting and trafficking.

In an initial ATP-requiring step, a thioester is formed between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and an internal cysteine residue of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1).1 Activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a specific cysteine of one of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2). E2 enzymes may donate ubiquitin directly to protein substrates, resulting in branched protein conjugates in which the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin is linked by an isopeptide bond to specific internal lysine residues of target proteins. Substrates are also recognized by associated substrate-recognition proteins known as E3 proteins or ubiquitin-protein ligases, which play a major role in defining the substrate specificity of the ubiquitin system (1Hochstrasser M.

Nedd4 was originally identified as a developmentally regulated gene that is highly expressed in the mouse embryonic central nervous system (5Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that the expression ofNedd4 is not restricted to the embryonic central nervous system, and that it is expressed at varying levels in several embryonic and adult tissues (6Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The Nedd4 protein has three types of protein domains, an amino-terminal C2 domain (involved in Ca2+-dependent binding of membrane phospholipids and proteins), three or four WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a Hect ubiquitin-protein ligase domain at the carboxyl terminus. WW domains consist of ∼35 amino acids and are often found in proteins in multiple copies (7Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). They bind to several target sequences including the PY motif (PPXY), PPLP motif, and phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues (8Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M.

The Nedd4 family consists of a number of proteins that share the same modular structure as Nedd4 (12Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the function of the majority of the Nedd4 family members is not known, these proteins have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including endocytosis, TGF-β signaling, virus budding, transcription, and protein trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 12Harvey K.F.

Nedd4 homologues exist in bothSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccahromyces pombe. The S. cerevisiae protein, Rsp5 is the best studied of all Nedd4 family members. Rsp5 is an essential protein in yeast that regulates the ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and/or turnover of several membrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 13Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J.

Additionally, Rsp5 is believed to play a role in minichromosome maintenance (15Yashiroda H. Oguchi T. Yasuda Y. Toh-E A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell.

Although mammalian Nedd4, a widely expressed protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, much less is known about the specific pathways and proteins regulated by Nedd4. The best characterized targets of Nedd4 and its close homologue Nedd4–2/KIAA0439 are the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) subunits, which interact with Nedd4 WW domains via the PY motifs present in the cytosolic carboxyl termini of each subunit (22Staub O.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As the widespread expression of Nedd4 suggests that it may have additional targets, we carried out a far-Western protein expression screen using the WW domains of Nedd4 as a probe and identified eight new Nedd4 WW domain-binding proteins from mouse embryo cDNA libraries (29Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Of these, one encoding a novel protein, which we named N4WBP5, was represented in 25% of clones obtained from the screen (29Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have further characterized N4WBP5 and report that it is a novel evolutionarily conserved protein with a potential role in Golgi structure and function. Hydrophobicity of the N4WBP5 protein was estimated using the Kyte-Doolittle program, and transmembrane domains were predicted using the TMPRED program. Multiple sequence alignments and construction of phylogenetic trees were carried out using bionavigator software packages Protpars and Protml at the Australian National Genome Information Services server. A full-length mouse N4WBP5 cDNA was used as a probe for RNA blot analysis using a multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from mouse tissues (CLONTECH). A β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH) was used as a loading control probe. A full-length human N4WBP5 cDNA probe was used to probe a human multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+ RNA samples normalized against eight housekeeping mRNAs. The expression constructs used to generate the various WW domain proteins fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) have been described previously (24Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The constructs for N4WBP5-GST fusion proteins that were used as probes in far-Western assays and for antibody production were generated by PCR amplification of the N4WBP5 cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 113 residues and cloning intoBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). N4WBP5 PY motif mutants in which the Tyr residue was replaced by Ala were generated by PCR mutagenesis and verified by automated sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (24Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The purified N4WBP5-GST fusion protein was used to inoculate two rabbits (0.5 mg of protein/rabbit). Rabbits were boosted three times at three-week intervals with 0.5 mg of protein/boost/rabbit. Sera were collected and tested on recombinant protein. The serum sample that showed the highest reactivity with N4WBP5 was affinity-purified. Initially polyclonal antibodies were passed through a column of GST coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to remove GST-specific antibodies. Flow through from this step was affinity-purified against N4WBP5-GST coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4. Bound proteins were eluted into Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and dialysed against phosphate-buffered saline. Affinity-purified antibodies were diluted in 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. 32P-Labeled protein probes were produced by directly labeling the appropriate GST fusion protein using protein kinase A (New England Biolabs). Glutathione beads containing bound fusion protein were incubated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline, and labeled protein was eluted with glutathione buffer. To prepare WW domain protein filters, ∼1 μg of each induced GST fusion protein lysate was resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in Hyb75 (30Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K.

Membranes were washed three times in Hyb75 and exposed to x-ray film. pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG was generated by PCR 2Primer sequences are available upon request. amplification of the N4WBP5 open reading frame with a FLAG tag engineered at the carboxyl terminus and cloning into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG with PY motifs mutated was generated by PCR mutagenesis and verified by automated sequencing. pCXN2-Nedd4 was generated by relieving the open reading frame of Nedd4 usingHaeII and Sap I (New England Biolabs) end filling using T4 DNA polymerase and cloning into pCXN2 (31Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). The pCXN2-Nedd4 cysteine mutant was produced by subjecting a pBluescript-Nedd4 construct to Kunkel mutagenesis (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Mutant clones were verified by sequencing, and then the mutagenized open reading frame of Nedd4 was subcloned into pCXN2. pcDNA3-Nedd4 WW domains (N4WBP5/Nedd4 WW) were generated by PCR amplification of the region of Nedd4 encoding for the WW domains and cloning into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. The HA-ubiquitin expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann (Aab Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, NY). All cell lines with the exception of HEK 293T were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer instructions. Immunoprecipitations were performed by harvesting cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubating lysates for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody and then for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed using the following primary antibodies anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1/1000, Nedd4ab1 (1/4000) (6Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), anti-N4WBP5 (1 μg/ml), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) at 1/2000 and secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For the anti-N4WBP5 immunoblot, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture) and disrupted by freeze thaw. An equivalent amount of protein from each cell type was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Detection of bound antibody was achieved using ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For pulse-chase experiments, COS cells were transfected in triplicate with 1 μg of pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG alone or with 1 μg of pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG and 3 μg of pCXN2, pCXN2-Nedd4 (Nedd4), or pCXN2-Nedd4 cysteine mutant and incubated for 24 h. Cells were incubated in methionine and cysteine-free medium (ICN) for 20 min and labeled for 2 h in the same medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]l-Met (ICN). Cells were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and chased in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum for up to 24 h. Where indicated, culture medium was supplemented with 10 μm lactacystin, 50 μm MG132, or 0.4 mm chloroquine. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and lysates immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. Band intensities were quantitated using Image QuaNT version 4.2a (Molecular Dynamics). N4WBP5 half-lives were calculated using SigmaPlot 4.0 software assuming first order decay. N18 cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Where indicated, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of brefeldin A (BFA) at 37 °C for 45 min prior to fixing. The fixed cells were stained with affinity-purified anti-N4WBP5 polyclonal antibody (7.25 μg/ml) and anti-GM130 monoclonal (BD Transduction Laboratory) at 6.25 μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at 10 μg/ml (Chemicon) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at 10 μg/ml (Chemicon) for 30 min at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal bovine serum. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with pcDNA3-NWBP5-FLAG. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with cycloheximide for 4 h to prevent new protein synthesis. Cells were fixed and double labeled with antibodies to the FLAG (data not shown) or the affinity-purified N4WBP5 antibody together with antibodies to GM130 as above. Full-length cDNA for N4WBP5 was identified in a far-Western screen of a day 16 embryonic mouse cDNA library (29Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). N4WBP5 is a 221 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 26 kDa containing two PPXY (PY) motifs within the amino-terminal region (Fig.1 A). N4WBP5 contains three hydrophobic regions in the carboxyl-terminal region that correspond to three predicted transmembrane domains using the TMPRED software. A TBLASTN search of GenBankTM revealed a human counterpart of mouse N4WBP5 (GenBankTM hypothetical protein MGC10924 similar to Nedd4 WW-binding protein 5) and highly related homologous proteins in mammals that we have termed N4WBP5A (GenBankTM accession number AAL05872). N4WBP5A shares 52% identity and 79% similarity to N4WBP5 (Fig. 1 B). N4WBP5A proteins also contain the two conserved PY motifs, which correspond to the PY motifs in N4WBP5. A homologue of N4WBP5 and N4WBP5A inDrosophila melanogaster (CG8056, GenBankTMaccession number AAF49316) indicates that these proteins form an evolutionarily conserved family (Fig. 1 C). An amino acid sequence alignment of mouse, human, and Drosophila N4WBP5 and mouse and human N4WBP5A is shown (Fig. 1 B). A single PY motif exists in Drosophila N4WBP5. The three predicted transmembrane domains are conserved between each of the proteins. The construction of a phylogenetic tree indicated that theDrosophila protein is more closely related to N4WBP5 than N4WBP5A and suggests that mammalian N4WBP5 and N4WBP5A are likely to have evolved from the Drosophila N4WBP5 gene. An analysis of the human genome sequence in public data bases suggests that N4WBP5 and N4WBP5A are not linked and are located on chromosomes 5q24 and 13q23, respectively. Northern blot analysis of RNA derived from mouse tissues suggested that N4WBP5 has two transcripts of 2.1 and 1.2 kb (Fig.2 A). Expression is highest in the adult liver, brain, kidney, and heart with the larger transcript predominating in these tissues. Lower level expression is apparent in the adult lung and testis, and in the testis a similar amount of both transcripts is present. A human multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH) was probed with a full-length human N4WBP5 cDNA probe to determine the sites of expression in the human. The N4WBP5 transcript is detected in most adult tissues (Fig. 2,B and C). High levels of expression are seen in adult brain tissues including the left and right cerebellum, pituitary and thalamus. High expression is also seen in the kidney, liver, testis, salivary gland, and placenta of the adult and in the brain, kidney, and lung of the fetus. However, very low or no expression can be detected in a range of human cell lines (Fig. 2, B andC,column 10). We have previously shown that either individually or together the WW domains of mouse Nedd4 can interact with the PY motifs of N4WBP5 (29Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mutation of PY motif 1 of N4WBP5 greatly reduces the interaction between the 32P-labeled GST fusion protein containing all three WW domains of Nedd4 and N4WBP5, whereas the mutation of PY motif 2 had little effect. Individually, each WW domain of Nedd4 was also able to interact with the PY motifs of N4WBP5. The mutation of either PY motif of N4WBP5 had little effect on the interaction with WW domain 1, suggesting that this weak interaction is not mediated via the PY motifs. However, the mutation of PY motif 1 greatly reduced the interaction between WW domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4 and N4WBP5 (29Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction between Nedd4 and N4WBP5, we carried out far-Western analysis in which the WW domains of mouse Nedd4 expressed as GST fusion proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3 A) and probed with32P-labeled GST fusions containing both PY motifs of N4WBP5. The PY motifs of N4WBP5 interacted with wild type WW domains 1–3 of mNedd4 or mutants in which one WW domain was mutated (Fig.3 B). The mutation of PY motif 1 of N4WBP5 greatly reduced these interactions, whereas the mutation of PY motif 2 has little effect, indicating that PY1 has a much higher affinity for the WW domains of Nedd4 than PY2 (Fig. 3, C and D). When individual WW domains of mouse Nedd4 were expressed as GST fusions, wild type N4WBP5 interacted strongly with WW domains 2 and 3 but not with WW1 (Fig. 3 B). Again, the mutation of PY1 of N4WBP5 almost completely abolished this interaction, whereas the mutation of PY2 somewhat reduced this interaction (Fig. 3, C andD). Although PY1 is clearly the main contributor to WW domain binding, because the PY1 mutant showed small but significant binding to Nedd4 WW2, both PY motifs of N4WBP5 may contribute to Nedd4 binding, albeit with significantly different affinities. To investigate the possible interaction between N4WBP5 and Nedd4 in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed in transfected COS cells. Cells were cotransfected with pCXN2-Nedd4, and either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG (N4WBP5) or pcDNA3-N4WBP5-FLAG with both PY motifs mutated and immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum or rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Nedd4 (N4). In cells cotransfected with Nedd4 and N4WBP5, the proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Nedd4 antiserum, indicating that the proteins interact in vivo (Fig.4 A). Only a very weak interaction was seen when N4WBP5 lacking functional PY motifs was coexpressed with Nedd4, indicating that the association between these proteins in vivo is predominantly mediated via PY-WW interactions. Control immunoblotting experiments showed that both N4WBP5 and N4WBP5 PYm proteins were efficiently expressed in transfected cells (Fig. 4 B), and that both sets of transfected cells have roughly equivalent amounts of Nedd4 protein (Fig. 4 C). To test whether N4WBP5 can interact with other proteins of the Nedd4 family, we analyzed the binding of the GST-WW domains from various Nedd4-like proteins with N4WBP5 by far-Western analysis (Fig.5). Previous studies have shown that the binding between WW domains of Nedd4 family members and their ligands is very specific. For example, ENaC subunits only interact with the WW domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4–2, both of which are known to regulate ENaC, and not to the WW domains of KIAA0322, Smurf1, WWP2/AIP2, AIP4, and Itch (27Harvey K.F. Dinudon A. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of GST-WW domain fusion proteins, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Filters were probed with a32P-labeled GST-N4WBP5 fusion protein and exposed to x-ray film. Interestingly, N4WBP5 bound to the WW domains of human Nedd4, Nedd4–2, KIAA0322, WWP2/AIP2, AIP4, and mouse Itch with varying affinities but failed to interact with the WW domains of Smurf1 (Fig.5 B). In control experiments, under identical conditions, only Nedd4 and Nedd4–2 WW domains interacted with ENaC subunits (data not shown). These results suggest that in vivo N4WBP5 may interact with a number of Nedd4 family members, not only Nedd4 itself. A portion of overexpressed N4WBP5 migrates as high molecular mass complex when subjected to SDS-PAGE. COS cells were transfected with N4WBP5-FLAG, and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. A short immunoblot exposure time shows a single band corresponding to the N4WBP5-FLAG protein migrating at its expected size of 26 kDa (Fig.6 A, short). Longer exposure times reveal a portion of N4WBP5 migrating as a high molecular mass complex (Fig. 6 A, medium andlong). To determine whether the high molecular mass complex reflects a pool of ubiquitinated N4WBP5, COS cells were cotransfected with ubiquitin-HA and pcDNA3 or N4WBP5-FLAG, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with a control antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. The blot was probed with anti-FLAG to show immunoprecipitation of N4WBP5 (Fig. 6 C) and anti-HA to identify ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 6 B). Where cells were cotransfected with N4WBP5 and ubiquitin-HA, ubiquitinated forms of N4WBP5 could be detected. These higher molecular mass forms of N4WBP5 reflect monoubiquitinated (34 kDa), diubiquitinated (42 kDa), and polyubiquitinated (high molecular mass complexes) forms of N4WBP5 (Fig. 6 B). Pulse-chase experiments were carried out to assess the stability of N4WBP5-FLAG in cells cotransfected with Nedd4 or a catalytically inactive cysteine mutant of Nedd4. COS cells were cotransfected with N4WBP5-FLAG and pCXN2-Nedd4 or the catalytically inactive cysteine mutant of Nedd4 pCXN2-Nedd4 cm. Following metabolic labeling, cultures were chased for up to 24 h in the absence of the label. N4WBP5 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. Initial pulse-chase experiments revealed that the half-life of N4WBP5 was ∼10 h in COS cells. When cotransfected with the vector control, ∼25% N4WBP5 remained by 24 h. In comparison, when cotransfected with pCXN2-Nedd4, only 5% N4WBP5 remained by this time point. Cotransfection with the catalytic cysteine mutant of Nedd4 led to ∼20% of labeled N4WBP5 remaining by 24 h (Fig.7, A and B). Consistent with the results in Fig. 7, A and B, the calculated half-lives of N4WBP5 under various conditions were 10.3 ± 1.4 h for N4WBP5 + vector, 5.4 ± 0.4 h for N4WBP5 + Nedd4, and 8.2 ± 0.9 h for N4WBP5 + Nedd4 cm. Thus, cotransfection with the active form of Nedd4 significantly increased the turnover rate of N4WBP5, suggesting that N4WBP5 is a target f"
https://openalex.org/W2039518230,"Serum response factor and the (CC(A/T)6GG) (CArG) box interact to promote the transcription of c-fos and muscle genes; this tissue-specific activity may require co-regulators for serum response factor. The α1 integrin promoter contains twocis-elements besides the CArG box: a TAAT sequence, a consensus binding site for homeoproteins, and a GATA-binding box. As a candidate TAAT-binding factor, we cloned an NK family homeobox gene,Nkx-3.2, which is expressed mainly in smooth muscle tissues and skeletal structures. Nkx-3.2, serum response factor, and GATA-6 were co-expressed only in the medial smooth muscle layer of arteries. These three transcription factors formed a complex with their corresponding cis-elements and cooperatively transactivated smooth muscle genes, including α1 integrin,SM22α, and caldesmon. Cardiac muscle-specific members of the NK and GATA families exist, and the triad of Nkx-2.5, serum response factor, and GATA-4 also transactivated the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor gene, which contains a CArG-like box, a GATA-binding box, and an NK-binding element. Our findings demonstrate that smooth and cardiac muscle have a shared transcriptional machinery and that the GATA and NK families confer muscle specificity on the serum response factor/CArG interaction. Serum response factor and the (CC(A/T)6GG) (CArG) box interact to promote the transcription of c-fos and muscle genes; this tissue-specific activity may require co-regulators for serum response factor. The α1 integrin promoter contains twocis-elements besides the CArG box: a TAAT sequence, a consensus binding site for homeoproteins, and a GATA-binding box. As a candidate TAAT-binding factor, we cloned an NK family homeobox gene,Nkx-3.2, which is expressed mainly in smooth muscle tissues and skeletal structures. Nkx-3.2, serum response factor, and GATA-6 were co-expressed only in the medial smooth muscle layer of arteries. These three transcription factors formed a complex with their corresponding cis-elements and cooperatively transactivated smooth muscle genes, including α1 integrin,SM22α, and caldesmon. Cardiac muscle-specific members of the NK and GATA families exist, and the triad of Nkx-2.5, serum response factor, and GATA-4 also transactivated the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor gene, which contains a CArG-like box, a GATA-binding box, and an NK-binding element. Our findings demonstrate that smooth and cardiac muscle have a shared transcriptional machinery and that the GATA and NK families confer muscle specificity on the serum response factor/CArG interaction. The vertebrate muscle system consists of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles derived from the mesoderm. After differentiation, all three muscle types are equipped with the contractile apparatus for force generation. Actin and myosin are essential components in the contractile apparatus, and their interactions are regulated by muscle type-specific regulatory proteins such as tropomyosin, troponins, caldesmon, and myosin light chain kinase. Interestingly, most of the muscle type-specific contractile proteins have tissue- or phenotype-dependent isoforms. This is true of actin (1Saga H. Kimura K. Hayashi K. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, SRF is expressed at high levels in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles (19Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and more recent studies demonstrated that targeted disruption of the mammalian SRFgene leads to malformation of the mesoderm (20Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a variety of biological roles for SRF might be directed by co-regulators. In fact, ternary complex factor is a co-regulator of SRF in c-fos transcription (21Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). A homeoprotein that is specific for cells of the cardiac muscle lineage, Nkx-2.5/Csx (22Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), is a reported co-regulator of SRF in the transcription of the genes forcardiac α-actin (10Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4648-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, GATA-4, a member of the GATA family, is coordinately involved in the transcription of cardiac genes with Nkx-2.5/Csx (25Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 26Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the importance of the SRF/CArG interaction and suggest that auxiliary factors may also be necessary for muscle-specific transcription. α1 Integrin is localized exclusively to SMCs, and its expression is SMC phenotype-dependent; the SRF/CArG interaction is critical for its transcription (11Obata H. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Momiyama T. Uchida A. Ochi T. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26643-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we identified two additional cis-elements, a TAAT sequence and a GATA box, in α1 integrin's promoter region. As a candidate TAAT-binding transcription factor, we cloned an NK family homeobox gene, Nkx-3.2, which is expressed mainly in smooth muscle tissues and skeletal structures and co-localizes with SRFand GATA-6 in the medial SMC layer of arteries. The triad of Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 formed a complex with their correspondingcis-elements and strongly activated the transcription of smooth muscle genes, including SM22α andcaldesmon as well as α1 integrin. Interestingly, both the NK and GATA families contain cardiac muscle-specific isoforms, Nkx-2.5/Csx and GATA-4, and their partial involvement in cardiac gene transcription has been reported as described above. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a well-characterized cardiac gene that contains three putativecis-elements, a GATA and CArG-like box and an NK family binding consensus sequence. Here, we demonstrate that Nkx-2.5/Csx, SRF, and GATA-4 dramatically activated ANF transcription and suggest that the cooperative interactions between the NK, SRF, and GATA families are also involved in the transcription of cardiac muscle genes. In this study, we hypothesize for the first time that there is a shared transcriptional machinery for both smooth and cardiac muscle cells. Chicken α1 integrin (−258 to +281; Ref. 11Obata H.

Mutations were introduced using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expression vector of wild-type human SRF (pSG5-SRF) was a kind gift of Dr. M. Seiki (Tokyo University). Full-length human SRF and the NH2 terminus, MADS domain, and COOH terminus of human SRF were subcloned into the pGEX 6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Homeobox genes expressed in smooth muscle tissues were cloned from a chicken gizzard cDNA library (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Full-length chicken Nkx-3.2 (wt; aa 1–274) and the NH2-terminal deletion (ΔN; aa 149–274), COOH-terminal deletion (ΔC; aa 1–208), homeodomain deletion (ΔHD; aa 1–148 and 209–274), homeodomain alone (HD; aa 149–208), and homeodomain plus the NH2-terminal-flanking 10 amino acids (10+HD; aa 139–208) of chicken Nkx-3.2 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pCS2+MT. Similarly, Nkx-3.2 derivatives were introduced into the pGEX-6P-2 plasmid. The full-length open reading frames of chicken Nkx-2.5 (GenBank™ accession number X91838) and GATA-4, -5, and -6 (GenBank™ accession numbers U11887, U11888, and U11889) were amplified from cDNA and inserted into pCS2+MT and pcDNA-3.1-FLAG vectors, respectively. Full-length chicken GATA-6 (wt; aa 1–387) and the NH2 terminus (N; aa 1–178), COOH terminus (C; aa 291–387), and ZF1-ZF2-basic domain (ZFB; aa 179–290) of chicken GATA-6 were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA-3.1-FLAG vector (Invitrogen). The GATA-6 derivatives were subcloned into pGEX-6P-1. All of the plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Solid-phase DNase I footprinting was performed (27Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using nuclear protein extracts prepared from large arteries, including the aorta and gizzard, of chicken embryos at E15 (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A sense primer positioned from −246 to −223 of the α1 integrin promoter region was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and an antisense primer positioned from +24 to +47 was biotinylated, respectively. In situ hybridization, promoter assay, EMSA, pull-down assay, and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described elsewhere (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Primary cardiomyocytes were prepared from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (28Mohamed S.N. Holmes R. Hartzell C.R. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), except that the original enzyme solution was replaced with Blendzyme 3 (Rosh). EMSA probes of α1 integrin were prepared as follows. A distal probe (TAAT-CArG) positioned from −230 to −172 and a proximal probe (CArG-GATA) positioned from −191 to −111 were subcloned into pBS-SKII(+) vector (Stratagene) and excised with BamHI and PstI digestion. Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared using 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS as detergents. DNA footprinting analysis revealed three putative cis-elements that bind to nuclear proteins prepared from vascular and visceral SMCs in the α1 integrin promoter region (indicated by FP1−FP3 in Fig.1). FP1 corresponds to the repetitive TAAT core sequence, which is a consensus-binding site for homeoproteins (29Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). FP2 and FP3 mapped to the CArG box and GATA binding sequences, respectively. Of these, we previously identified the CArG box sequence in the α1 integrin promoter region as an SRF-bindingcis-element. These findings suggest that at least one homeoprotein and GATA family protein are putative co-regulators for SRF in the transcription of smooth muscle genes. To isolate the smooth muscle-related homeobox genes, we designed a degenerate oligoprobe mixture against the third homeodomain helix, which is highly conserved among the homeoproteins (29Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). After screening 4 × 105plaques from a chicken gizzard SMC cDNA library, 16 positive clones were isolated: 7 clones of Nkx-3.2, 3 clones ofBarx1b, 2 clones of Gax, and 1 clone each ofHox A5, Hox B3, Hox B4, and Hox B5. To examine whether these homeoproteins are expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle tissues, we performed in situ hybridization of chicken embryos at E15 (Fig.2 A). The Nkx-3.2transcripts were located exclusively in skeletal structures and smooth muscle tissues, including smooth muscle in the esophagus, crop, gizzard, and hindgut. In addition to Nkx-3.2,Barx1b transcripts accumulated in the SMC layer of the digestive tract (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Hox cluster genes were distributed throughout the whole body, and Gax was highly expressed in striated muscles as well as in SMCs (data not shown). Thus, the Nkx-3.2 and Barx1b homeoproteins seem to be good candidates fortrans-factors that bind to the TAAT core sequence. However, Barx1b did not bind to the AT-rich sequence of the β-tropomyosin promoter (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), nor did it bind to the TAAT motifs of the α1 integrin promoter (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on Nkx-3.2 as a TAAT-binding partner. The Nkx-3.2 clone encoded an open reading frame of 276 amino acid residues (GenBankTM accession number AB042507) (Fig.2 B). A search for homology in the GenBankTM data base shows that the homeodomain of Nkx-3.2 was significantly similar to that of Drosophila bagpipe (GenBankTM accession number L17133), mouse Bapx1 (GenBankTMaccession number NM_007524), human BAPX1(GenBankTM accession number AF005260), and chickenNKX3.2 (GenBankTM accession number AF138905) (Fig. 2 C). The identities were 86%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The deduced primary structure of our clone was essentially same as that of chicken NKX3.2, but there were differences in amino acid residues 103–132, and 2% of theNkx-3.2 nucleotide sequence was mismatched with the reported cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF138905). It is possible that our clone and NKX3.2 are distinct avian orthologues of Drosophila bagpipe, so we designated this clone as chicken Nkx-3.2. The NH2-terminal sequences of mouse Bapx1 and human BAPX1 are relatively conserved but are distinct from those of Drosophila bagpipe and chicken Nkx-3.2. The homeodomain of chicken Nkx-3.2 also showed 70% identity with a member of the NK homeoprotein family, mouse Nkx-2.5 (GenBankTM accession number X75415). Indeed, chicken Nkx-3.2 contained an NK domain downstream of the homeodomain and a TN domain in its NH2 terminus (30Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). As we reported previously (17Nakamura M. Nishida W. Mori S. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the TN domain consensus overlaps completely with the FIL domain of Barx family. Furthermore, a sequence of 10 residues upstream of the homeodomain was highly conserved between mouse Bapx1, human BAPX1, and chicken Nkx-3.2. The GATA family is another candidate for SRF co-regulators in α1 integrin transcription, and only GATA-6 is reported to be expressed in vasculature (31Narita N. Heikinheimo M. Bielinska M. White R.A. Wilson D.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To compare the fine localization of Nkx-3.2, SRF, andGATA-6, we performed in situ hybridization of chicken arteries (Fig. 3). α1 Integrin, SM22α,and GATA-6 transcripts were strictly located in the medial SMC layer of branch from thoracic aorta at E15 and ascending aorta at posthatched day 7. SRF and Nkx-3.2 were detected at high levels in the medial SMC layer but were also expressed in the adventitia and the endothelium/intima (Fig. 3 A). In the gizzard SMC and glandular layers, SRF and Nkx-3.2were highly expressed. GATA-6 was totally absent in the gizzard SMC layer and was expressed only in the glandular layer (Fig.3 B). Thus, our data indicate that the expression of these three transcription factors overlaps only in the medial SMC layer of the arteries, where smooth muscle genes are expected to be expressed. We examined the possibility that Nkx-3.2 and GATA-6 are involved in the transcription of α1 integrin as SRF co-regulators (Fig.4). In this experiment, we used 10T1/2 cells to prevent possible interference by endogenous smooth muscle-specific transcription factors. When only the α1 integrin reporter gene was transfected, it showed no significant promoter activity. Co-transfection with Nkx-3.2 resulted in 5-fold activation. SRF or GATA-6 expressed alone resulted in activation rates of less than 3-fold. When the cells were co-transfected with combinations of SRF and Nkx-3.2, GATA-6 and Nkx-3.2, or SRF and GATA-6, the promoter activities reached 9-, 19-, and 5-fold, respectively. A 45-fold activation was achieved when all three factors, Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6, were co-transfected. In contrast, transfection of other homeoproteins expressed in smooth muscle tissues, Gax or MHox, with or without SRF and GATA-6 did not show significant effects. These results indicate that Nkx-3.2 and GATA-6 specifically transactivated the α1 integrin promoter in combination with SRF (Fig. 4 A). Three variants of the α1 integrin reporter gene containing a mutated TAAT sequence (mTAAT), CArG box (mCArG), or GATA box (mGATA) had almost no promoter activity, even in the presence of all three transcription factors, indicating the critical involvement of these sequences as cis-elements (Fig.4 B). We further examined the effectiveness of three GATA family proteins in this cis-element-dependent activation. When equimolar levels of GATA proteins were expressed with Nkx-3.2 and SRF, GATA-4 and -5 showed 56% and 76% of the promoter activity seen with GATA-6 (Fig. 4 B). Finally, we confirmed whether the coordinated transactivation by a triad consisting of Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 also worked for other smooth muscle gene promoters. Sequence analysis revealed that the chicken caldesmon promoter contains a GATA box (−314) immediately upstream of the CArG box (−309) and a repetitive TAAT sequence (−544). The mouse SM22α promoter also contains a GATA box and TAAT core sequence at −478 and −508, respectively. As expected, the promoter activities of chicken caldesmon and SM22α significantly increased (by 22 and 28-fold, respectively) when this triad of transcription factors was co-expressed with the promoter construct. In contrast, the human c-fos promoter containing a serum response element flanked by an ets domain failed to exhibit cumulative activation in the presence of the triad (Fig. 4 C). We examined the interactions between Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 with their correspondingcis-elements. Because the promoter region spanning threecis-elements is so long for an EMSA probe to reveal a complex formation, we divided the region into two parts as shown in Fig. 1. First, we analyzed the interaction between Nkx-3.2 and SRF with a 32P-labeled TAAT-CArG probe (Fig.5 A). SRF formed a complex with the probe (lane 1, black arrowhead), and this complex was displaced by an excess amount of the unlabeled probe (lane 2). The complex was further supershifted by anti-SRF antibody (lane 3) but not by anti-GST antibody or normal rabbit IgG (data not shown), confirming a specific complex formation. Because GST-fused full-length Nkx-3.2 was easily degraded during purification, we used GST-Nkx-3.2-ΔC in this experiment. GST alone did not form a complex (lane 4). GST-Nkx-3.2-ΔC bound to the 32P-labeled probe (lane 5, white arrowhead) in a DNA probe-specific manner (lane 6), and this complex was also supershifted by anti-GST antibody (lane 7) but not by anti-SRF antibody or normal rabbit IgG (data not shown). We then investigated interactions between SRF and Nkx-3.2 with the 32P-labeled TAAT-CArG probe (lanes 8–13). When increasing amounts of SRF were added to a fixed amount of GST-Nkx-3.2-ΔC, a new, slowly migrating complex (asterisk) appeared in an SRF dose-dependent manner (lanes 9–11). This newly formed complex was also displaced by an excess amount of unlabeled probe (data not shown) and supershifted by anti-SRF or anti-GST antibody, respectively (lanes 12 and13). Mobility shift of the complex was not influenced in the presence of normal rabbit IgG (data not shown). Next, we examined the interaction between SRF and GATA-6 with the32P-labeled CArG-GATA probe (Fig. 5 B). SRF bound to the probe (lane 14, black arrowhead), and an excess amount of unlabeled probe displaced the complex formation (lane 15). This complex was also supershifted with anti-SRF antibody (lane 16) but not by anti-GST antibody or normal rabbit IgG (data not shown). Because the molecular weight of the wild-type GATA-6 fusion protein is similar to that of SRF, we used a truncated mutant of GATA-6 containing only the zinc finger and basic domains (GST-GATA-ZFB). In the following experiment, we confirmed that the zinc finger and basic domains of GATA-6 are essential for the physical interaction with SRF (Fig. 6). GST-GATA-ZFB bound to the 32P-labeled CArG-GATA probe (Fig.5 B, lane 18, white arrowhead), and the complex was specifically displaced by an excess amount of unlabeled probe (lane 19). This complex was supershifted by the anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5 B, lane 20) but not by anti-SRF antibody or normal rabbit IgG (data not shown). In this experiment, a new, slowly migrating complex was also seen (Fig.5 B, asterisk) when increasing amounts of SRF were added to a fixed amount of GST-GATA-ZFB (lanes 23–25). This complex formation was inhibited by an excess amount of unlabeled probe (data not shown). The complex was supershifted by anti-GST or anti-SRF antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 26 and 27) but was not influenced in the presence of normal rabbit IgG (data not shown). Thus, we demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex of SRF and Nkx-3.2 or GATA-6 with the TAAT-CArG or CArG-GATA probes, respectively. To define the binding domains of Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 interactions, we performed a series of pull-down assays. First, we analyzed the Nkx-3.2 and SRF interaction. GST-fused full-length SRF (GST-SRF-wt) or the NH2 terminus (GST-SRF-N), MADS domain (GST-SRF-MADS), or COOH terminus (GST-SRF-C) of SRF was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel matrix and then incubated with in vitro-translated 35S-labeled chicken Nkx-3.2 (Fig.6 A). 35S-labeled Nkx-3.2 bound to GST-SRF-wt and GST-SRF-MADS (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1 and 4), but not to GST-SRF-N or GST-SRF-C (lanes 2 and3). We further investigated the domain of Nkx-3.2 that interacts with SRF (Fig. 6 B). GST-fused full-length Nkx-3.2 (GST-Nkx-wt) or the NH2 terminus (GST-Nkx-N), COOH terminus (GST-Nkx-C), homeodomain alone (GST-Nkx-HD), or the homeodomain plus 10 NH2-terminal-flanking residues (GST-Nkx-10+HD) of Nkx-3.2 was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose gel matrix that had been incubated with 35S-SRF. GST-Nkx-wt, GST-Nkx-HD, and GST-Nkx-10+HD bound to the 35S-SRF (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1, 4, and 5), but GST-Nkx-N and GST-Nkx-C did not (lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that the homeodomain of Nkx-3.2 and the MADS domain of SRF are required for the interaction. We then studied the interaction between SRF and GATA-6. The GST-fused variants of SRF described above were incubated with35S-GATA-6 (Fig. 6 C). GST-SRF-wt and GST-SRF-MADS bound to 35S-GATA-6 (Fig. 6 C,lanes 1 and 4), but GST-SRF-N and GST-SRF-C did not (lanes 2 and 3). To elucidate the domain of GATA-6 required for SRF binding, we performed similar experiments (Fig.6 D). 35S-labeled full-length GATA-6 (GATA-wt) and the NH2-terminal deletion (GATA-ΔN), COOH-terminal deletion (GATA-ΔC), COOH terminus (GATA-C), or zinc fingers plus basic domain (GATA-ZFB) of GATA-6 were incubated with GST-SRF-wt immobilized on a Sepharose gel matrix. GATA-wt, GATA-ΔN, GATA-ΔC, and GATA-ZFB were pulled-down with GST-SRF-wt (Fig. 6 D,lanes 1, 2, 3, and 5), but GATA-C was not (lane 4). These results indicate that the MADS domain of SRF and the ZFB domain of GATA-6 directly interact with each other. To confirm the physical interactions between three transcription factors in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 6 E). FLAG-SRF, FLAG-GATA-6, and myc-Nkx-3.2 expression vectors were co-transfected into 10T1/2 cells. The cell lysates were incubated with an anti-SRF rabbit polyclonal antibody, and the SRF complex was precipitated using protein A-Sepharose. Transcription factors thus precipitated were identified with an anti-FLAG or anti-myc monoclonal antibody. FLAG-GATA-6 and myc-Nkx-3.2 were successfully precipitated with SRF. Thus, Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 clearly interacted with each other in living cells. We investigated the minimum domains of Nkx-3.2, SRF, and GATA-6 required for the cooperative activation of the α1 integrin gene using 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 7). We examined the effects of chicken Nkx-3.2 mutants on the α1 integrin promoter activity. Nkx-wt, Nkx-ΔC, or Nkx-10+HD in cooperation with SRF and GATA-6 activated the promoter activity, but Nkx-ΔN, Nkx-ΔHD, and Nkx-HD did not. Interestingly, Nkx-10+HD retained the same activity as Nkx-wt, and Nkx-ΔC further increased the promoter activity about 2-fold. We then analyzed the functional domains"
https://openalex.org/W2005090865,"The chromatin high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a very abundant and conserved protein that is structured into two HMG box domains plus a highly acidic C-terminal domain. From the ability to bind DNA nonspecifically and to interact with various proteins, several functions in DNA-related processes have been assigned to HMGB1. Nevertheless, its functional role remains the subject of controversy. Using a phage display approach we have shown that HMGB1 can recognize several peptide motifs. A computer search of the protein data bases found peptide homologies with proteins already known to interact with HMGB1, like p53, and have allowed us to identify new potential candidates. Among them, transcriptional activators like the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), repressors like methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), and co-repressors like the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (pRb) and Groucho-related gene proteins 1 (Grg1) and 5 (Grg5) can be found. A detailed analysis of the interaction of Grg1 with HMGB1 confirmed that the binding region contained the sequence homologous to one of the peptides identified. Our results have led us to propose that HMGB1 may play a central role in the stabilization and/or assembly of several multifunctional complexes through protein-protein interactions.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a revised nomenclature) is one of the most abundant non-histone proteins. HMGB1 has been shown to be essential because knock-out mice die 24 h after birth (2Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voitländer T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). HMGB1 is highly conserved, particularly in mammals and to a lesser extent throughout the animal kingdom. HMGB1 is structured into three domains, two basic HMG boxes (HMG domains A and B) and a highly acidic C-terminal domain, which confer an overall dipolar appearance to this protein (see Refs.3Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 5Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar for reviews). Each of the HMG boxes is formed by two short and one long α-helix that upon folding produce an L- or V-shaped three-dimensional domain structure (6Read C.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Driscoll P.C. Norman D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Weir H.M. Kraulis P.J. Hill C.S. Raine A.R. Laue E.D. Thomas J.O.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16596-16607Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whereas the acidic C-terminal domain is presumably involved in the modulation of HMGB1 activity, the HMG box domains allow the protein to bind to linear DNA with moderate affinity and to highly structured (3- and 4-way junction DNA, cruciform DNA) or distorted DNA (bent or kink DNA, bulged DNA, cisplatin-modified DNA) with higher affinity, but always without sequence specificity. The concave surface of the L- or V-shaped HMG box domain contacts the DNA in the minor groove in two slightly different ways introducing important modifications in the structure of DNA, in particular a strong bend (reviewed in Ref. 5Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Presumably, these features will be of relevance for the biological functions in which HMGB1 has been involved (DNA repair, recombination, replication, and transcription). high mobility group protein 1 retinoblastoma protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K methyl-CpG binding protein 2 Groucho-related gene protein 1 Groucho-related gene protein 5 glutathione S-transferase high mobility group protein 1 retinoblastoma protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K methyl-CpG binding protein 2 Groucho-related gene protein 1 Groucho-related gene protein 5 glutathione S-transferase The activity of HMGB1 is not solely mediated by its ability to bind to DNA. Indeed, HMGB1 and the related HMGB2 protein can interact through their HMG box domains with a broad range of proteins ranging from nuclear cell proteins to viral proteins. Interactions of HMGB1 have been described with the recombination activation gene protein RAG1 (9Aidinis V. Bonaldi T. Beltrame M. Santgata S. Bianchi M.E. Spanopoulou E. Mol. Cell.

Beard P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5943-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The consequences of these interactions are multiple. HMGB1 in general increases the DNA binding affinity of those factors and depending on the context and the assay conditions HMGB1 has been shown to have a positive or a negative effect on transcription (14Oñate S.A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the case of RAG1 and Rep68/78 HMGB1 enhances the rate of the sequence-specific DNA cleavage reaction (19Costello E. Saudan P. Winocour E. Pizer L. Beard P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5943-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HMGB1 can also stimulate the ATPase activity of Rep78 (19Costello E. Saudan P. Winocour E. Pizer L. Beard P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5943-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The two HMG box domains of HMGB1 appear to have a similar but not identical behavior with respect to their protein-interacting features. Thus, HMG box A is important for binding to hTBP and p53, whereas the binding to Oct factors, HOX factors, and hormone receptors can take place through boxes A or B (11Zwilling S. König H. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Zappavigna V. Faciola L. Citterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7534-7540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the interaction with RAG requires both HMG box domains (9Aidinis V. Bonaldi T. Beltrame M. Santgata S. Bianchi M.E. Spanopoulou E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6532-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To date, neither the HMG box surface that is involved in the interaction with other proteins nor the required amino acids of HMGB1 are known. On the other hand, sequence analysis of the factors interacting with HMGB1 does not suggest any apparent homology or similarity. For instance, the interaction with RAG1, Oct, and HOX factors occurs at the homeodomain. In the case of hTBP, it is the H2′ α-helix of the core and with Rep78, two different regions are recognized. From these data, no consensus can be defined. The fast progress of genomics and proteomics has made it obvious that an important focus in understanding biological processes is to characterize how proteins interact in macromolecular complexes. Attempts to define general rules for predicting specific recognition between proteins have been unsuccessful because each protein-protein interaction has its own properties. Nevertheless, some indications are emerging. The development of powerful tools has led to the discovery that one type of recognition involves asymmetric interactions that occur between a particular domain and a short region, often less than 10 amino acids in length, within the other protein. A recent review (23Kay B.K. Kasanov J. Knight S. Kurakin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recapitulated several examples of protein domains involved in these kinds of interactions like SH3 (Src homology 3), phosphotyrosine-binding WW, EH (Eps15 homology), PDZ modules (PSD-95/dlg/ZO1), as well as pRb and the ER. Some of them, like the ER, could interact in several modes with different peptides, in a manner that depends on the bound ligand. In the present study we have explored the molecular recognition properties of HMGB1 by ligand selection from a large library of heptapeptides displayed on phages. Our results do not give support to one unique strong consensus sequence but rather to a few different kinds of peptide sequences. A BLAST search enabled us to predict new proteins that may interact with HMGB1. We have tested and confirmed the interactions with a few of these and have shown that HMGB1 can interact not only with transcriptional activators but also with repressors and co-repressors. Taken together the data suggest a complex network of protein-protein interactions that will clarify the biological function(s) of HMGB1. The plasmids pT7-HMGB1bA, pT7-HMGB1bB, and pET14b-HMGB1 used for the expression of rat HMGB1 box A, box B, and full-length HMGB1, respectively, have already been described. The procedure for the expression and purification of the three recombinant proteins was as described previously (17Sutrias-Grau M. Bianchi M.E. Bernues J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1628-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Native calf thymus HMGB1 was purified as described previously (24Bernués J. Espel E. Querol E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 866: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A phage display heptapeptide library kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used to screen for peptides binding to HMGB1 box domains A and B. The kit contained a random combinatorial collection of heptapeptides fused via a flexible linker sequence to the N terminus of protein pIII of bacteriophage M13. Each phage expressed at the tip of the cover 3–5 copies of the unique peptide it encoded. The library complexity contained all the possible combinations of the 20 natural amino acids taken as 7-mer sequences. For the phage biopanning process, we followed the kit instructions as indicated by the manufacturer. Four independent experiments were run in which 30–40 μg of HMGB1 box A or B were immobilized overnight at 4 °C on 96-well microtiter plates (Costar 3690). Wells were then blocked for 1 h at 4 °C with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. 2 × 1011plaque-forming units of the phage library were added per well and incubated for an additional hour at room temperature. Wells were washed ten times with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for the first round. For subsequent rounds of washing, Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 was used to increase stringency. Finally, phages were either eluted at room temperature by incubation with 0.2 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.2 for 10 min or affinity eluted by incubation for 1 h with 30–40 μg of the respective HMGB1 box A or B. Phage amplification, titration, and purification were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Automatic phage DNA sequencing used the −96gIII primer (5′-CCCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3′) and was performed by the Serveis Cientı́fico-Tècnics of the Universitat de Barcelona. The data base search for homology with the sequences selected in the phage display experiments was performed using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program (NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information) (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). The alignments were obtained using the MultAlin program (Multiple Sequence Alignment, INRA, Institut National de Recherche Agronomique, Toulouse, France) (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). All GST constructs were prepared using the pGEX-4T3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The twelve peptides selected to be further analyzed as GST fusions were amplified from the phages with PCR using the following primers 5′-TGGTACCTTTGAATTCTCACTC-3′ and 5′-TCAACAGTGTCGACCGAACC-3′, which introducedEcoRI and SalI sites, respectively (underlined). The PCR products were inserted between these sites in the pGEX-4T3 plasmid. pGEX-Grg1 and pGEX-Grg5 were constructed by inserting theNaeI/XhoI fragments obtained from the pBS-Grg1 and pBS-Grg5 (kindly provided by Dr. C. Lobe) into pGEX-4T3 digested with SmaI and XhoI. pGEX-Grg Q-GP-CcN was produced by inserting a NaeI/SmaI fragment from pBS-Grg1 into a SmaI site of the pGEX vector. pGEX-Grg SP-WD was generated by inserting a SmaI/XhoI fragment of pBS-Grg1 into the same sites of the pGEX vector. pGEX-Grg Q was obtained by digesting pGEX-Grg1 with Bpu1102I andXhoI. The vector was blunt-ended and then self-ligated. pGEX-Grg GP-CcN was prepared by digestion of pGEX-Grg1 Q-GP-CcN withBamHI and Bpu1102I. The vector was blunt-ended and then self-ligated. pGEX-Grg ΔGP-CcN was obtained by inserting aBamHI/XhoI fragment obtained by PCR from the pGEX-Grg1 construct by using the primers 5′-TTCAGCCTCCTGGATCCCCG-3′ and 5′-GTTTTCTCGAGGTGAGTGTG-3′ (restriction sites underlined) into pGEX 4T3 digested with the same enzymes. pGEX-Grg SP was generated by inserting a SmaI/XhoI fragment obtained as above by PCR with primers 5′-ACTCACCCCGGGAAAACG-3′ and 5′-GTTGATCTCTCGAGCATGTCG-3′ into pGEX 4T3 digested with the same enzymes. All constructions were verified by manual or automated DNA sequencing. pGEX-MeCP2-(207–492) was obtained from Dr. A. Bird. pGEX-KG-hn RNP K was a gift of Drs. S. K. Jong and J. H. Kim. pGEX-pRb-(379–928) and pGEX-p53 were obtained from Dr. M. A. Martı́nez-Balbás. All the GST fusions were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) and purified according to standard methods as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST-peptide fusions were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 40 mm glycine, 0.05% SDS, 20% methanol) to nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran BA-85, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1–2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated overnight in 10 ml of D buffer without glycerol (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10–20 μg of either HMGB1 or its derivatives, HMGB1 box A or B. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween, membranes were incubated with a primary chicken anti-HMGB1 antibody raised in our laboratory against recombinant HMGB1 deleted of the C-terminal domain and subsequently with a secondary anti-chicken IgY-HRP antibody (Jackson Laboratories) and detected using ECL reagents. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were loaded with the different GST fusion proteins as suggested by the manufacturer and washed five times with 450 μl of D buffer containing 20% glycerol. Then, they were incubated with HMGB1 box A or B for 1 h at 4 °C in the same buffer and washed six times more with the same buffer. Beads were finally boiled in protein-loading buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies. In an attempt to identify targets that could be potentially recognized by HMGB1, and because other general approaches like yeast two-hybrid analysis were not possible (likely due to toxic effects of the expression of HMGB1 boxes in yeast, results not shown) a peptide library screening approach was carried out. A highly complex library containing the whole collection of natural heptapeptide sequences displayed on phage M13 was used. Four rounds of selection were carried out for each of the four independent experiments that were performed using highly purified recombinant HMGB1 boxes A or B as bait proteins. During the biopanning process stringency was increased by using higher detergent concentrations in the washing buffer. Bound phages were recovered by either a nonspecific acid elution (experiment 1) or by affinity competition using HMGB1 boxes A or B free in solution (experiments 2–4). Several peptides were selected as potentially interacting with HMGB1 with some specificity (TableI). From these results, it became clear from their sequences that they were not related to a single strong consensus sequence, suggesting that either the interactions between HMGB1 and the peptides were weak or that HMGB1 boxes could interact with several unrelated motifs. We noted that the frequency of appearance of some amino acids in the selected peptides clearly deviated from the random theoretical level indicating that the selection process was successful. That is, if interactions of HMGB1 were specific they should be independent of the particular growth features of the phages and their statistics should clearly differ from those of the unselected phages in the biopanning assays and be due to their ligand-binding requirements. For example, positively and negatively charged amino acids usually presented frequencies lower than expected in the selected peptides, suggesting that the interactions did not mainly rely on electrostatic forces despite the highly basic character of the HMGB1 boxes. Also, a high rate of aromatic residues was observed, in particular a high level of tryptophan in experiment number 4, which contrasts with the observation that this amino acid tends to decrease naturally without selection. A remarkable level of proline was also obtained in experiment number 3. Hydrophilic amino acids, which tend to be involved in hydrogen-bond recognition, showed some decrease as well. These data indicate that selection had in fact occurred in the presence of the HMGB1 boxes although no clear-cut consensus could be easily drawn.Table IAmino acid sequences of the heptapeptides bound to HMG boxes A and B of HMGB1Exp. 1 box A1-aPeptides eluted unspecifically by low pH.Exp. 2 box A1-bPeptides eluted by affinity with the same HMG-box used for the biopanning.Exp. 3 box B1-bPeptides eluted by affinity with the same HMG-box used for the biopanning.Exp. 4 box B1-bPeptides eluted by affinity with the same HMG-box used for the biopanning.71-cNumber of peptides sequenced per experiment.311-cNumber of peptides sequenced per experiment.291-cNumber of peptides sequenced per experiment.201-cNumber of peptides sequenced per experiment.HWGMWSYSSPHNHS (6)1-dThe number of clones encoding the same peptide for each experiment is indicated in parentheses.IQSPHFF (8)HWGMWSY (5)NWGMWSYHAIYPRH (6)LPLTPLP (7)HSWLWWP (5)PHWTWVLQISFMAN (4)NQDVPLF (2)LAMPQYE (2)HMSKPVQTLTTPIL (2)WPKLASH (2)KLWVIPQSSGTHAKHWGMWSYSPAHAAKSHWFWSWYNINIRPISIPRTMASMSVAIHAIYPRHNYTQTVPTPAHNDYAWLPWAKSRPHTSDFHMGQPFMPNRTANHYWWWPRAPTPVKLNLPAYTSSSSSHPTHMALNxVCSSVETHPGAQLTKMHSLSYRGTPTLxSSTTLRYFWHWWPxLVMPWVHKGETRAPLYAPRLRSVQASNSNAPPTRNQGNSLRWDSAPQILLDTDPPGLHeptapeptide amino acid sequences deduced from phage sequencing are recapitulated here for each independent experiment.1-a Peptides eluted unspecifically by low pH.1-b Peptides eluted by affinity with the same HMG-box used for the biopanning.1-c Number of peptides sequenced per experiment.1-d The number of clones encoding the same peptide for each experiment is indicated in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Heptapeptide amino acid sequences deduced from phage sequencing are recapitulated here for each independent experiment. Despite the fact that the sequences selected were very variable (as shown in Table I), the appearance of several copies of the same peptide in each experiment indicated a high enrichment and specificity in the screening. Note also that some peptides (e.g. HWGMWSY, HAIYPRH) were selected in independent experiments with both HMGB1 domains. Despite this variability in the peptide sequences it was also clear that amino acid distribution in the peptides was not random (Table I). Thus, peptides could be grouped into at least two classes: proline-rich and tryptophan-rich. Two peptides enriched in tryptophan, HWGMWSY and HSWLWWP, accounted for 50% of the clones in experiment 4, and HWGMWSY appeared also in experiments 1 and 2. A minimal consensus WXXW motif could be a potential site for interaction. In the case of proline-enriched peptides it was more difficult to define a consensus given the diversity of these sequences. Because of the high complexity in the peptide sequences retrieved in the phage display experiments we were concerned about the potential existence of false positives in the selected set of peptides. As a second approach to confirm the bona fide association of HMGB1 with those peptides, we performed in vitro assays in which peptide sequences were fused to GST. The twelve peptides were used among those selected with HMGB1 boxes A and B and were representative of the different kinds of peptides obtained. They were fused to the C terminus of GST to facilitate their expression and purification in E. coli. As a control a GST with an extended, unrelated, and never selected peptide was included (GST-KG). Because direct GST pull-down assays did not work, likely because of steric hindrance of the GST moiety to the very small peptide (not shown), Far-Western experiments were performed (Fig.1). In contrast to the negative control, all the other peptides showed interaction with HMGB1 box B (Fig.1 B). The relative intensity of each band varied from experiment to experiment indicating that the results were not quantitative. Nevertheless, these interactions were always detectable, whereas interaction with the control was never detected (Fig.1 B, lane GST-KG). Moreover, the same assays were also done using either HMGB1 box A or HMGB1 full-length and the results were the same (not shown). We noted that none of the peptides selected was represented in the sequence of HMGB1. Because HMGB1 can only very inefficiently interact with itself forming a homodimer (27Ranatuga W. Lebowitz J. Axe B. Pavlik P. Kar S.R. Scovell W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and HMG box domains do not interact with each other inside the HMGB1 molecule (28Ramstein J. Locker D. Bianchi M.E. Leng M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this suggested that the peptides selected were representative of reasonable rather than very weak interactions. Once our results were confirmed it was of interest to look for proteins containing regions of homology to the peptides selected in the phage display assay in order to perform a survey. This point was addressed by searching the available data bases with the BLAST program for nuclear proteins. HWGMWSY was a peptide that generated interesting candidates and among them appeared ER, a factor previously identified to interact with HMGB1 (15Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We noted a potential WXXW consensus motif (TableIIB) for the factors belonging to this group. These factors were not studied in detail because in comparison another peptide, LPLTPLP, generated the most interesting homologies and allowed the identification of a new set of nuclear proteins that could potentially interact with HMGB1. These putative factors are summarized in Table IIA. Once again, two other factors, p53 and PR, already described to interact with HMGB1 appeared (10Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijhon D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interestingly, the region homologous to our peptide in p53 was highly conserved in mammals. Remarkably, all the proteins listed presented a potential PXXPXP consensus motif, and among them components for many transcription factor complexes can be found. In this list we had only included the proteins containing the sequence motifs homologous to the peptide that were conserved among mammalian species. Note that in some cases two conserved motifs could be found (e.g. Grg1, p53). Also, the two orientations of the motif were considered because similar proline-rich motifs were reported to be recognized by SH3 domains independently of their orientation (Ref. 29Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M.

https://openalex.org/W1979772434,"We demonstrate through cell ablation, molecular genetic, and pharmacological approaches that during C. elegans male mating behavior, the male inserts his copulatory spicules into the hermaphrodite by regulating periodic and prolonged spicule muscle contractions. Distinct cholinergic neurons use different ACh receptors and calcium channels in the spicule muscles to mediate these contractile behaviors. The PCB and PCC sensory neurons facilitate periodic contraction through muscle-encoded UNC-68 ryanodine receptor calcium channels. The SPC motor neurons trigger prolonged contraction through EGL-19 L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The male gonad then lengthens the duration of EGL-19-mediated prolonged muscle contraction. This regulation of muscle contraction provides a paradigm to explain how animals initiate, monitor, and maintain a behavioral motor program."

Cytochrome c maturation of Escherichia coliis one of the best known examples for posttranslational maturation events that convert simple polypeptides into correctly targeted, folded, and modified proteins with biological activity. The critical step of cytochrome c biogenesis is the covalent attachment of the heme cofactor to the polypeptide. Two thioether bonds between the heme vinyl groups and the cysteines of a conserved sequence motif within the polypeptide, CXXCH, are formed in a stereospecific reaction referred to as heme ligation, which is catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome c heme lyase (1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This enzyme is known from yeast and Neurospora crassamitochondria and defines the so-called system III maturation (3Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); corresponding genes have also been found in higher eukaryotes. Bacteria, archaea, plants, and protozoa possess different sets of cytochrome c maturation genes. Cytochrome cmaturation of these organisms can be divided into system I and system II (2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

However, in both systems, at least one gene encodes an integral membrane protein with an unusual tryptophan-rich motif of the consensus WGXXWXWD. In E. coli, three genes encoding proteins with tryptophan-rich sequences are found, and each is involved in the maturation of c-type cytochromes, which occurs in the periplasm (4Thöny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The simplest member is CcmC, which contains six transmembrane helices and is needed for maturation of allc-type cytochromes. Two conserved histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif in the second periplasmic domain were shown to be essential for the function of the protein (5Schulz H. Pellicioli E. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CcmC is needed for the covalent insertion of heme into CcmE, a periplasmic heme chaperone that is an obligatory intermediate of the system I cytochrome cmaturation pathway and that binds heme transiently. CcmC can therefore be viewed as a CcmE heme lyase. It has been shown that CcmC interacts directly with heme and with CcmE and that the histidines as well as the tryptophan-rich motif are required for the latter interaction (6Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another protein containing a tryptophan-rich motif is CcmF, also an essential cytochrome c maturation factor in E. coli (7Throne-Holst M. Thöny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Grove J. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 332-341PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, by analogy to its homologue fromRhodobacter capsulatus (10Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), has 11 transmembrane helices, and its tryptophan-rich motif resides in the third periplasmic domain (Fig. 1). CcmF is required at a step after heme binding to CcmE,i.e. for the transfer of heme from CcmE to apocytochromec. It has been proposed to be the bacterial cytochromec heme lyase; however, no biochemical evidence confirming this role has yet been reported. Strikingly, E. coli also possesses a paralogue of CcmF, NrfE (9Grove J. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 332-341PubMed Google Scholar). CcmF and NrfE share 39% identity and 52% similarity over the entire amino acid sequence. NrfE is encoded in the nrfABCDEFG operon (11Hussain H. Grove J. Griffiths L. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and serves the ligation of heme to the unusual fifth heme-binding site CWSCK of the pentaheme c-type cytochrome NrfA (12Eaves D. Grove J. Staudenmann W. James P. Poole R.K. White S.A. Griffiths I. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between CcmF orthologues from different bacteria is higher than that between the CcmF and NrfE paralogues: for example,E. coli CcmF shares 44 and 47% sequence identity with CycK from Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Ccl1 from R. capsulatus, respectively. Besides the tryptophan-rich motif, four histidines have been described to be conserved in presumably periplasmic domains (His-92, His-173, His-261, and His-303) (10Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We noticed a fifth, presumably cytoplasmic, invariant histidine, His-491. Because in CcmC two invariant histidines have been proven to be important for the function of the protein, we assumed that conserved histidines of CcmF could also play an essential role for ligation of heme to apocytochrome c. If CcmF is a heme lyase of system I cytochrome c maturation, it is expected to release heme from the heme chaperone CcmE and to transfer it onto apocytochrome c. This implies that CcmE and CcmF interact directly, if not as subunits of a maturase complex composed of several Ccm proteins, then at least transiently for heme delivery. In addition, we expect CcmF to also interact with either apocytochrome c or a factor that binds and recruits apocytochrome c. The former type of interaction would be transient, whereas the latter might be steady, in particular, if a maturase complex exists. A candidate for such a factor is CcmH, for various reasons (13Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thöny-Meyer L. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): (i) it is essential for cytochrome cmaturation; (ii) it functions in the second segment of maturation,i.e. after heme binding to CcmE; (iii) it is believed to be a redox carrier keeping the heme-binding site of apocytochromec reduced; and (iv) it has orthologues in NrfF and NrfG, which are similar to its N- and C-terminal portions, respectively. NrfF and NrfG might therefore be the proteins determining the selectivity for the unusual heme-binding site in NrfA and guide NrfA to the specific heme lyase NrfE. Here, we report on the construction and analysis of ccmF mutants and on the interaction of CcmF with various other Ccm proteins in order to establish the mechanism of heme transfer from the CcmE chaperone to cytochrome c.

The pellets were resuspended in 13 μl of 2× SDS loading dye and neutralized with 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). These samples corresponded to about 300 μg of protein. For the preparation of periplasmic fractions, 300 ml of bacterial culture were harvested, and periplasmic proteins were obtained after treatment with polymyxin sulfate as described previously (6Ren Q.

Holo-cytochromec 550 and holo-CcmE formation was analyzed qualitatively by SDS-PAGE and heme staining (5Schulz H. Pellicioli E. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol.

Agarose beads were washed three times with solubilization buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound material and then treated with 2× SDS loading dye (containing 50 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were visualized by immunoblot analysis. 1 mg of total cell lysates were solubilized and precipitated with 10 μl of undiluted CcmF or anti-His tag antibodies according to the method described previously (6Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antisera against the tetra-His tag, CcmE, or cytochrome c 550 as indicated. In theccmF in-frame deletion mutant EC50(ΔP168-D243), the predicted transmembrane helices III and IV plus a number of adjacent residues including His-173 and the tryptophan-rich motif are deleted. The truncated protein is inactive in cytochromec maturation, whereas heme binding to CcmE still occurs (19Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mutant was complemented for cytochrome cbiosynthesis with plasmid pEC424, which carries a wild-typeccmF gene expressed from the arabinose promoter fused to six histidine codons at the 3′ end. The resulting CcmF-H6protein is functional in cytochrome c maturation (Fig. 2,lane 1). Equivalent plasmids expressing the CcmF-H6 versions with single histidine to alanine exchanges at five conserved positions and the tryptophan-rich motif mutant (W*; residues 236–243 WGGWWFWD changed to AAAWAFAA) were constructed. The mutant H92A showed full activity in cytochrome c formation (lane 2). Mutants H173A, H261A, and H303A lacked detectable amounts of cytochrome c (lanes 3–5). This suggests that these three periplasmic histidines are essential for CcmF function. Mutant H491A produced low levels of holo-cytochromec (lane 6). His-491 is predicted to reside in a cytoplasmic domain and apparently is not required strictly for cytochrome c maturation. The W* mutant did not produce detectable amounts of cytochrome c, indicating that the tryptophan-rich motif is also essential for the function CcmF. As the non-essential His-92 resides in an N-terminal 95-amino acid periplasmic domain that has the least degree of sequence conservation within CcmF homologues (not shown), this domain together with the adjacent transmembrane helix (Fig. 1) was deleted. The resulting mutant produced low levels of holo-cytochromec (lane 8), suggesting that the N-terminal 119 amino acids are not required strictly for heme incorporation into cytochrome c. It was confirmed by immunoblot that all mutants produced stable CcmF polypeptides (Fig.2 B). In another experiment, the influence of CcmF on the levels of bound heme in CcmE was investigated. If CcmF alone is able to catalyze the detachment of heme from CcmE, a decrease of holo-CcmE can be expected in the presence of wild-type CcmF but not in the presence of mutant CcmF, proteins that are affected in residues participating in heme detachment. We analyzed levels of CcmE peptide, holo-CcmE, and CcmF in cells deleted in the entire ccm operon (EC06) and containing plasmid pEC78 encoding ccmABCDE plus a plasmid encoding either the wild-type or a mutant CcmF-H6. In this system, formation of holo-CcmE is guaranteed, but maturation of cytochromec is blocked by the absence of CcmG and CcmH. The results presented in Fig. 3 show that all mutants produced normal levels of apo-and holo-CcmE. However, in the negative control (lane 2), when the empty vector pISC-3 was introduced instead of a plasmid encoding CcmF, a similar level of holo-CcmE was found. We cannot distinguish whether (i) this is due to a high ratio of heme attachment/heme detachment, which leads to a constant excess of CcmE; (ii) the steady state conditions in our experiments are not suitable to detect the event of heme detachment; or (iii) there is another factor needed to aid heme release from CcmE. It has been speculated previously that the tryptophan-rich motif contained in several cytochromec maturation factors functions in heme binding. When we tested whether CcmC, the CcmE heme lyase, can physically interact with hemin-agarose, we found a specific interaction of CcmC and heme; however, heme binding was independent of the tryptophan-rich motif as well as the two conserved histidines in CcmC (6Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the possible interaction of CcmF with heme in experiments performed by analogy to and including the control of those reported for CcmC. CcmF-H6 was produced in the Δccm strain EC06 from plasmid pEC424. Membrane proteins from cell lysates were solubilized in 0.5% laurylsarcosine or 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and incubated with either agarose or hemin-agarose. Under these conditions, specific binding of CcmF to hemin-agarose in comparison with agarose could not be detected (not shown). This is consistent with the view that the substrate for CcmF-dependent heme transfer is holo-CcmE rather than free heme. So far, we have not found a chemical method by which we can remove covalently bound heme from holo-CcmE without breaking peptide bonds within the protein. Assuming that an enzymatic activity is needed for the detachment of heme from CcmE, CcmF is a good candidate enzyme. This would imply a protein-protein interaction between CcmE and CcmF. The physical interaction of CcmF with CcmE was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Proteins from cell-free extracts were precipitated with anti-CcmF antibodies (Table III). Subsequent Western blot analysis of the precipitates revealed that in the presence of CcmF antigen, CcmE polypeptide could be precipitated (lane 3), whereas it was not detected in the absence of CcmF (lane 2). As a control, cell extracts were also analyzed for the presence of similar levels of CcmE and CcmF protein (Fig.4, B and C, respectively). The CcmF point mutants were also tested and showed an unaltered interaction with CcmE (Fig. 4, lanes 4–8). The inverse precipitation using CcmE antiserum and detection of co-precipitates with CcmF antibodies revealed nonspecific signals (Table III).Table IIICo-immunoprecipitation experimentsAntibody for immunoprecipitationα-CcmCα-CcmEα-CcmFα-CcmH-His3-aAn antibody against a tetra-His tag was used with a CcmH-H6 antigen.Antibody forWestern blotα-CcmC++n.d.3-bn.d., not determined.n.d.α-CcmE+++α-CcmFn.d.n.s.3-cn.s., non-specific signal.+n.s.α-CcmH-His3-aAn antibody against a tetra-His tag was used with a CcmH-H6 antigen.n.d.++α-Cyt cn.d.n.d.3-a An antibody against a tetra-His tag was used with a CcmH-H6 antigen.3-b n.d., not determined.3-c n.s., non-specific signal. Open table in a new tab Preparation of the heme-binding site CXXCH of apocytochrome c is believed to be exerted by reduction of the cysteines via an interaction with CcmH that is reduced by CcmG. CcmH might therefore recruit apocytochromec into the maturation machinery by interacting with CcmF. Thus, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with CcmF and CcmH (Table III). CcmH was produced as a C-terminal His-tagged protein to allow detection with anti-His antibodies. Cell-free extracts were precipitated with anti-CcmF serum, and precipitates were analyzed for the presence of CcmH-H6 by Western blot analysis (Fig.5 A). When CcmF was present, the wild type (lane 3) as well as the point mutants (lanes 4–8) co-precipitated CcmH polypeptide, whereas in the absence of CcmF, no CcmH was detected (lane 2). CcmF-H6 and CcmH-H6 were present in cell-free extracts before precipitation, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis using the anti-His serum for detection of both polypeptides (Fig.5 B) and using anti-CcmF serum for the specific detection of CcmF (Fig. 5 C). The recipient for heme in the ligation mediated by CcmF is cytochromec. We also tested by co-immunoprecipitation whether CcmF can interact with cytochrome c directly, yet no signals were observed (data not shown). Such detection may be difficult because apocytochrome c degrades rapidly when not converted to its holo form (16Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If CcmH keeps the heme-binding site of apocytochrome creduced, it is expected to interact with its target protein. However, this interaction might be short-lived and thus difficult to detect. We co-expressed CcmH-H6 and apocytochromec 550 (16Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and tested co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. No specific interaction between CcmH and apocytochrome c was observed (not shown), which may be due to the transient nature of such an interaction. CcmF is the best candidate for a cytochrome c heme lyase in E. coli. When a plasmid expressingccmABCDE but lacking ccmFGH is expressed in a mutant deleted for all ccm genes, cells progress through cytochrome c maturation up to the synthesis of and covalent attachment of heme to the heme chaperone CcmE but cannot transfer heme to cytochrome c (8Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Also, a ccmF in-frame deletion mutant produces holo-CcmE but not cytochrome c(19Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, CcmF is needed for the transfer and/or ligation of heme from the CcmE chaperone to apocytochrome c. In addition, CcmG and CcmH are required for these steps. CcmG/DsbE is a periplasmic protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase that obtains electrons from the integral membrane protein DsbD (20Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and is believed to pass them to CcmH, which in turn keeps the heme-binding cysteines of apocytochromec reduced (13Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thöny-Meyer L. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1947-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear a priori whether CcmF or CcmH represent the heme lyase or perhaps are subunits of a heme lyase complex. For catalysis of the release of heme from CcmE, where the cofactor is bound covalently, an interaction of the responsible enzyme with the CcmE polypeptide is expected. For catalysis of the thioether bond formation between heme and apocytochrome c, an interaction with the cytochrome polypeptide is predicted. In this work, we tested by co-immunoprecipitation the interaction of CcmF, for which we obtained specific and sensitive peptide antibodies, with different possible target polypeptides. We showed co-immunoprecipitation of CcmE with CcmF but not with CcmH (data not shown), suggesting that CcmF releases heme from CcmE. In addition, CcmF co-precipitated with CcmH but not with cytochrome c (data not shown). This is in agreement with the view that CcmF and CcmH form a heme lyase complex in which CcmH recruits the apocytochrome and CcmF recruits the heme moieties for ligation. To test the interaction between CcmH and cytochromec, we also tried to co-precipitate the two polypeptides, but we could not show their direct interaction. In previous experiments, we had tried to detect the formation of mixed disulfides between the active site cysteines of CcmH and the heme-binding cysteines of apocytochrome c without success. 1R. Fabianek, unpublished results. Most likely, cytochrome c binds only transiently to CcmH and is released quickly after heme attachment. Our results suggest that the protein-protein interactions between CcmE-CcmF and CcmF-CcmH are stronger, perhaps because a stable complex between these cytochromec maturation factors is formed. Table III summarizes all interactions between E. coli Ccm proteins that have been tested thus far. The resulting model for how the proteins are organized in a maturase complex is presented in Fig.6. The cooperation of CcmF and CcmH parallels the finding of the NrfEFG paralogues in E. colifor attachment of heme to the unusual CWSCK heme-binding site of NrfA. NrfE is a homologue of CcmF lacking 66 amino acids in the region encompassing the putative transmembrane helices VIII and IX and a short cytoplasmic loop. NrfF is similar to the N-terminal half of CcmH (CcmHN) corresponding to Ccl2 and CycL of R. capsulatus and B. japonicum, respectively, and NrfG is similar to the C-terminal portion of CcmH (CcmHC, also called CcmI), which corresponds to CycH of other bacteria. If the two heme lyases can discriminate between a normal CXXCH and an NrfA-specific CWS/TCK heme-binding site, one might expect specifically conserved amino acids present only in CcmF/CcmH but not in NrfE/NrfF/NrfG homologues and vice versa. Although the CcmF/NrfE and CcmHN/NrfF paralogues are well conserved, the CcmHC/NrfG paralogues are the least conserved. Therefore, CcmHc/NrfG might be the best candidates for a function in recognizing the apocytochrome heme-binding site. We propose that CcmF, together with CcmHN and CcmHC, which in E. coli are fused in the single CcmH polypeptide, form a cytochromec heme lyase complex that releases heme from CcmE and transfers it to cytochrome c. Like CcmC, CcmF contains a periplasmically oriented tryptophan-rich motif and several conserved histidines. Our results show the importance of these signature sequences except the first conserved histidine His-92. In fact, His-92 is not conserved in the Deinococcus radiodurans CcmF sequence. Our deletion of the first 119 amino acids of CcmF includes His-92 and still allows some activity in cytochrome c maturation. Apparently, this entire domain of the protein is not essential. Although three of the four functionally important histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif reside in periplasmic domains of CcmF, the fourth histidine His-491 is predicted to be cytoplasmic according to the topology model (10Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, this histidine is not required strictly for the cytochrome cmaturation. The idea of the tryptophan-rich motif serving as a hydrophobic platform for heme binding and the conserved histidines acting as axial heme ligands has become less attractive in the context of CcmC, where these sequences were not necessary for heme binding but were involved in the interaction of CcmC with CcmE. In this work, we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of heme to CcmF, but we discovered a direct interaction of CcmE and CcmF. Our results are in agreement with holo-CcmE serving as a heme donor. However, the conserved signature amino acids of CcmF were needed individually neither for the CcmF-CcmE nor for the CcmF-CcmH interaction. To address the possibility that the conserved amino acids of CcmF are involved in the detachment of heme from CcmE, the levels of holo-CcmE were compared in the wild type and in the different mutants. If CcmF releases heme from CcmE, then one could predict that the levels of holo-CcmE in a strain expressing ccmABCDE exceed those produced in a strain expressing ccmABCDE + wild-type ccmF. However, we found that under our experimental conditions, similar amounts of holo-CcmE can be detected in either case, and thus it is not surprising that the mutants also show the same phenotype. Thus, we cannot draw any conclusions about the involvement of conserved amino acids of CcmF in the mechanism of heme release from CcmE. The functional coordination of various Ccm proteins in cytochromec maturation may be based on structural features,i.e. the formation of stable complexes and supercomplexes in the membrane. The formation of a complex between the CcmABCD homologues of R. capsulatus has been reported previously (22Goldmann B.S. Beckman D.L. Bali A. Monika E.M. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). InE. coli, an interaction of CcmC, CcmD, and CcmE was proposed based on genetic analyses as well as co-immunoprecipitation (5Schulz H. Pellicioli E. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our current finding of CcmE-CcmF and CcmF-CcmH interactions extends the prediction of a maturase complex as shown in Fig. 6. We propose that the components CcmCDEFH form a structurally defined system for heme delivery to apocytochrome c, which is recruited by CcmH, with heme entering the system through CcmC. It is still not clear whether CcmC also contributes to heme translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. The heme delivery apparatus thus consists of a CcmE heme lyase (CcmC), a heme chaperone (CcmE), and a cytochromec heme lyase (CcmFH). In addition, it remains to be seen whether the ABC transporter CcmAB, whose function is still in question (23Goldman B.S. Kranz R.G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), is also a part of the maturase complex. In addition, the thioredoxin CcmG may be a part of the complex. This protein interacts with DsbD for uptake of electrons (20Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and as an oxidoreductase, may interact with CcmH only transiently. We thank R. Fabianek, E. Pellicioli, and H. Schulz for the construction of some plasmids used in this work, and we thank K. Fischer for technical assistance."

The latter play diverse roles in modulating the gating, stability, and trafficking of Kv1 channels. The crystallographic structure of the Kvβ2 subunit revealed surprising structural homology with aldo-keto reductases, including a triosephosphate isomerase barrel structure, conservation of key catalytic residues, and a bound NADP+ cofactor (Gulbis, J.

Similar to the trafficking results in COS-1 cells, mutations within the cofactor binding pocket reduced axonal targeting of Kv1.2, whereas those in the catalytic tyrosine did not.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001: 131-140Google Scholar). Mammalian Kv1 channels are composed of four voltage-sensing and pore-forming transmembrane Kv1 α subunits, and up to four cytoplasmic Kvβ subunits (3Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Archer S.L. Rusch N.J. Potassium Channels in Cardiovascular Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2001: 163-175Crossref Google Scholar). A tremendous diversity in Kv channel structure arises from the combinatorial assembly of the products of 18 α subunit and 4 β subunit genes present in the mammalian genome (4Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Moreover, different Kv1 α and Kvβ subunit combinations yield functionally distinct potassium channels (5Pongs O. Leicher T. Berger M. Roeper J. Bahring R. Wray D. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Storm J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Different Kvβ subunits, namely Kvβ1.1, Kvβ1.2, Kvβ2, and Kvβ3, have distinct effects on channel function, most obviously on fast inactivation because of the “ball” inactivation peptide present on the N terminus of some but not all Kvβ subunits (6Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The distinct N-terminal domains also mediate subtype-specific interaction with the cytoskeleton (7Nakahira K. Matos M.F. Trimmer J.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which can further impact Kvβ subunit effects on inactivation (8Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Outside of these distinct N-terminal domains, the primary sequence of Kvβ subunits is highly conserved, such that all Kvβ subunits exhibit >85% amino acid identity over this ≈330-amino acid “core” region. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of this core domain led to the proposal (9McCormack T. McCormack K. Cell. 1994; 79: 1133-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that Kvβ subunits may be members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1 enzyme family, which reduce aldehyde or ketone functional groups to primary or secondary alcohols. The crystal structure of the Kvβ2 core domain extended this analysis and revealed remarkable structural similarity to AKR family members (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The core domain of Kvβ2 consists of a 4-fold symmetrical triosephosphate isomerase barrel structure with bound NADP+cofactor. The essential features of catalysis by AKRs involve hydride transfer from the nicotinamide ring to a carbonyl carbon of the substrate, followed by proton transfer from a donor group on the enzyme to the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. The Kvβ2 structure (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) predicts that Tyr-90 acts as the proton donor of Kvβ2 (Fig. 1) in analogy to the Tyr-48 residue of human aldose reductase (10Bohren K.M.

Residues Trp-57, Arg-189, Trp-243, Ser-244, and Arg-264 are important for creating the NADP+binding pocket (Fig. 1). Despite the striking structural homology between Kvβ2 and bona fide AKRs, it has not been demonstrated experimentally that Kvβ subunits in fact have enzymatic activity and if so, the identity of their physiological substrates. One subsequent study has revealed that catalytic and cofactor binding site mutants are deficient in their ability to confer N-type inactivation to Kv1.5, suggesting that Kvβ AKR activity and Kv1 channel inactivation may be coupled (11Bahring R.

Similar Kvβ2-mediated effects on surface expression were observed for Kv1.1-Kv1.2 heteromeric channels (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Increases in the amplitude of potassium currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing certain Kv1 α subunits have also been observed upon Kvβ2 coexpression (21Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies together imply that in addition to the role of Kvβ subunits as components of plasma membrane Kv channel complexes, Kvβ subunits may play a fundamental biosynthetic role in regulating intracellular trafficking and surface expression of Kv channels. In this study, we first addressed whether all members of the Kvβ subunit gene family, each of which contains the highly conserved core region with key catalytic site and cofactor binding site residues, could affect Kv1.2 channel intracellular trafficking and surface expression as was observed previously for Kvβ2 (15Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Despite dramatic differences in their effects on channel gating, each of the Kvβ subunits displayed robust trafficking effects. A recent study has shown that a double mutation (D85A/Y90F) in the Kvβ2 catalytic domain reduces the ability of Kvβ2 to promote plasma membrane trafficking of Kv1.4 in Xenopus oocytes (22Peri R. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 738-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we address further the role for AKR activity in Kv1 channel trafficking by mutating only the side chain hydroxyl group of this critical catalytic tyrosine residue in Kvβ1.1 (Y124F) and Kvβ2 (Y90F), and using a variety of biochemical and cell biological assays to analyze the effects of this mutation on Kv1.2 trafficking in mammalian cells. We also investigate the role of key cofactor binding site residues in Kvβ-mediated trafficking of Kv1.2 through structure-based mutagenesis. Finally, we show that Kvβ subunits that enhance cell surface expression of Kv1.2 in COS-1 cells can also induce the targeting of Kv1.2 to axons in cultured hippocampal neurons, recapitulating the subcellular localization of Kv1.2 observed in mammalian central and peripheral neurons.

Surfaceversus total immunofluorescence staining was scored under narrow wavelength fluorescein and Texas Red filter sets. Surface expression index (SEI) values were determined as the percentage of Kv1.2-transfected cells with Kv1.2 surface staining and represent the mean ± S.D. determined from 100 transfected cells from each of three dishes. Fluorescent images of cells were captured into Adobe Photoshop from either a SPOT (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) or a Zeiss Axiocam (Oberkochen, Germany) cooled CCD 24-bit color digital camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope with a 40×, 1.3 numerical aperture plan neofluar objective, or a 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture plan neofluar objective, using the software supplied with the cameras. Confocal images were generated on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope system with an Axiovert microscope using a 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture plan neofluar objective. Alexa 594 (red) immunofluorescence signals were obtained using a 560 nm long pass filter after excitation with a helium neon laser at 543 nm. Alexa 488 (green) immunofluorescence signals were obtained using a 505–530 band pass filter after excitation with an argon laser at 488 nm. Red and green signals were generated and collected individually on a frame-by-frame basis. Similar pinhole sizes and amplifier settings were used to obtain all images, and no further manipulation of image files was performed. Each individual image represents a three-dimensional projection of the entire cell derived from a z-series taken as an average of eight sweeps at 1024 × 1024 resolution and vieweden face relative to the apical surface. Projections were exported as Photoshop files for presentation. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses of cell lysates prepared from transfected cells were performed as described (15Shi G. Nakahira K.

Coverslips were placed in wells face up but did not contact the glia because of the presence of paraffin wax pedestals. Most (>85%) of the neurons in these cultures developed the characteristic morphology of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Cultured hippocampal neurons at 7 daysin vitro were transfected by the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Lim S.T. Antonucci D.E. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S.

In brief, 1 μg of DNA was diluted into 100 μl of serum-free transfection medium to which 10 μl of PLUS reagent was added, the solution was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent was diluted into serum-free dilution medium in a second tube and mixed. Precomplexed DNA and diluted LipofectAMINE reagent were combined, mixed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-PLUS-LipofectAMINE reagent complexes were added to face up coverslips in individual wells of six-well tissue culture plates.

All Kvβ subunits have a highly conserved ≈330-amino acid core domain that follows divergent N termini of 30–70 amino acids. Previous studies have shown that coexpression with either Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2 increased 125I-dendrotoxin binding in cells expressing Kv1.2 (15Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and that the autonomous highly conserved core domain is sufficient to mediate increases in current amplitude of coexpressed Kv1.4 α subunits (21Accili E.A.

We addressed whether each wild-type Kvβ subunit harboring this core domain would display the effects on Kv1.2 intracellular trafficking and surface expression observed previously for Kvβ2 (15Shi G.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were coexpressed with the rat Kv1.2 α subunit in COS-1 cells. We performed double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies specific for Kv1.2 extracellular (prior to detergent permeabilization) and intracellular (after detergent permeabilization) domains to determine the relative amount of Kv1.2 surface expression in the transfected cells. In the absence of any Kvβ subunit coexpression, the majority of Kv1.2-expressing cells exhibited robust perinuclear Kv1.2 staining, which we have previously shown corresponds to ER-localized Kv1.2 (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and no detectable surface staining (Fig.2 A, top panel). A minority of the transfected COS-1 cells expressing Kv1.2 alone had Kv1.2 surface staining (Fig. 2 B). Upon coexpression with Kvβ1.1 the vast majority of cells (Fig. 2 B) now exhibited robust Kv1.2 surface staining (Fig. 2A bottom panel). In fact, regardless of the Kvβ subunit used, significant increases in the number of cells expressing Kv1.2 on the cell surface were observed upon Kvβ subunit coexpression (Fig. 2 B). Thus, despite disparate effects of these different Kvβ subunits on Kv1 channel inactivation (32Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 33Morales M.J. Castellino R.C. Crews A.L. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), each Kvβ subunit affects intracellular trafficking and surface expression of coexpressed Kv1.2 channels. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Kv1.2 polypeptide contains a single N-linked glycosylation site located in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments S1 and S2 (4Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Differences in processing of N-linked oligosaccharide chains at this site can be used as an independent biochemical marker of intracellular trafficking via shifts in apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE gels (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lower (≈60 kDa) molecular mass forms of Kv1.2 carry simple high mannose chains and correspond to ER pools, whereas higher (≈86 kDa) molecular mass forms, similar to Kv1.2 in rat brain membranes, carry sialylated complex chains and correspond to Golgi and plasma membrane pools (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found the bulk of Kv1.2 present in COS-1 cells expressing Kv1.2 alone in the lower molecular mass ER form (Fig. 2 C) (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, coexpression with Kvβ2 yields a dramatic increase in amount of Kv1.2 in the higher molecular mass post-ER form, similar to the Kv1.2 found in rat brain (Fig. 2 C). Coexpression with other Kvβ subunits yielded similar increases in the amount of Kv1.2 that had undergone post-ER processing of the N-linked oligosaccharide chain (data not shown). Together, these cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that coexpression with Kvβ subunits increases the cell surface expression of Kv1.2 α subunits with a concomitant decrease in retained ER pools. Previous studies on AKR family members have revealed a critical role for the hydroxyl group of a specific catalytic site tyrosine in proton transfer to the substrate carbonyl oxygen (10Bohren K.M. Grimshaw C.E. Lai C.J. Harrison D.H. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Gabbay K.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Kvβ2 (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) defines Tyr-90 as this residue in Kvβ2 (Fig. 1). Mutation of the analogous tyrosine (Tyr-48) in human aldose reductase to phenylalanine (Y48F), which preserves both the spatial fit and hydrophobicity of the tyrosine residue yet eliminates the possibility of any general acid catalysis by removing the tyrosine hydroxyl group, led to a completely inactive enzyme (10Bohren K.M. Grimshaw C.E. Lai C.J. Harrison D.H. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Gabbay K.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the potential Kvβ subunit enzymatic activity in Kv1 channel trafficking experimentally, we made the analogous tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Y90F) in Kvβ2. A less subtle Kvβ2 Y90A mutation was also made. When coexpressed with Kv1.2 in COS-1 cells at a fixed α/β subunit cDNA ratio of 1:4, the Kvβ2 Y90F mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type Kvβ2 in its effects on promoting increased surface expression of Kv1.2 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the Kvβ2 Y90A mutant failed to induce increased surface expression of Kv1.2 and was not significantly different from no Kvβ subunit addition (Fig. 3 A). In these experiments the steady-state expression level of wild-type Kvβ2 and the two different mutant proteins was similar (data not shown). Moreover, dose-response curves show that the respective phenotypes of the wild-type and mutant Kvβ2 isoforms shown in Fig. 3 A are maintained over an 8-fold range (1:1–1:8) of α/β subunit cDNA ratios (data not shown). As such, the lack of activity of Kvβ2 Y90A is not simply the result of differences in expression level. To confirm and extend these cell biological assays, quantitative biochemical assays of Kv1.2 cell surface expression were performed. Cells expressing Kv1.2 with and without coexpressed wild-type and mutant Kvβ2 subunits were treated with proteinase K, a relatively nonspecific protease that when externally applied cleaves the ectodomains of cell surface proteins (28Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cell extracts prepared from proteinase K-treated and control cultures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. We have established previously the utility of this assay in analyses of trafficking and surface expression of Kv1 α subunits (20Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S"

In mammalian cells, Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by the concerted operation of several pumps and exchangers located in the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (1Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). In contrast to most mammalian cells, in the slime moldDictyostelium discoideum, there are two non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores, one that is sensitive to the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (possibly the endoplasmic reticulum) (2Europe-Finner G.N. Newell P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 887: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and another that is acidic (3Rooney E.K. Gross J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence has accumulated that this acidic compartment is related to the contractile vacuole complex ofD. discoideum. Initial studies using a45Ca2+ uptake assay and isolated cell fractions identified a major ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport system associated with intracellular vesicles (5Milne J.L. Coukell B. Biochem.

Furthermore, a gene encoding a plasma membrane-type calcium ATPase (PMCA) Ca2+-ATPase (pat1) was cloned, and its protein product (PAT1) was found to co-localize with bound calmodulin to membranes of the contractile vacuole (11Moniakis J.

Buravkov S. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Schlatterer C. Walther P. Muller M. Mendgen K. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These granules are similar in their chemical composition to the polyphosphate bodies described in many microorganisms (15Meyer A. Bot. Zeit. 1904; 62: 113-152Google Scholar, 16Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), including D. discoideum (17Gezelius K. Arch. Microbiol. 1974; 98: 311-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and to the more recently described acidocalcisomes of trypanosomatids and apicomplexan parasites (18Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J.

Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In trypanosomatids and apicomplexan parasites, the acidocalcisomes have also been shown to contain proton and calcium pumps and several exchangers in their limiting membranes (20Lu H.-G.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the presence of such transporters has not been investigated in the mass-dense granules or polyphosphate bodies of D. discoideum, and the relationship between these granules, the acidosomes, and the contractile vacuole complex of D. discoideum remains undefined. One of the pumps present in the acidocalcisomes of parasitic protozoa is the H+-pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase). H+-PPases have also been described in plants, algae, and bacteria (28Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). A pyrophosphate activity was detected in total membrane extracts of D. discoideum (30MacDonald J.I.S. Weeks G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although its subcellular localization was not investigated. We report here the isolation of the mass-dense granules of D. discoideum and provide evidence for the presence of several pumps in their limiting membranes. An H+-PPase with characteristics similar to those of the plant and acidocalcisomal enzyme was located by biochemical and immunological techniques in these organelles and in the contractile vacuoles, where it co-localizes with the V-H+-ATPase and the Ca2+-ATPase PAT1. Polyphosphate was also detected biochemically and by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining in both the mass-dense granules and contractile vacuoles. These results support the idea that mass-dense granules, polyphosphate bodies, and acidocalcisomes are members of the same class of organelles and that there is a close relationship between these organelles and the contractile vacuole complex in D. discoideum. D. discoideum (strain AX-3) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown axenically in ATCC culture medium 1034/modified PYNFH medium (containing 10 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 1 g/liter yeast nucleic acid, 15 mg/liter folic acid, 1 mg/liter hemin, 18.1 g/liter KH2PO4, 25 g/liter Na2HPO4, and 10% fetal bovine serum at a final pH of 6.5) at room temperature and harvested at the late exponential growth phase. ATP, Dulbecco's PBS, antibody against calmodulin, acetazolamide, and reagents for marker enzyme assays were from Sigma. Silicon carbide (400 mesh) was obtained from Aldrich. Iodixanol (40% solution; OptiPrep, Nycomed) was obtained from Invitrogen. Bafilomycin A1 was from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Monoclonal antibody N-2 against the 110-kDa accessory protein of the V-H+-ATPase of D. discoideum (31Fok A.K. Clarke L.M. Allen R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the Monoclonal Antibody Center of the University of Hawaii. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to hydrophilic loop IV (antibody PABTK or 324) of plant V-H+-PPase (32Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP) (33Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P.

A monoclonal antibody against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to hydrophilic loop XII ofTrypanosoma cruzi H+-PPase (34Hill J. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was prepared at the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. Molecular mass markers and Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent were from Bio-Rad. The EnzChek phosphate assay kit and H2DIDS were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Professor Arthur Kornberg (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) kindly provided Escherichia coli strain CA38 pTrcPPX1. All other reagents were analytical grade. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and once with lysis buffer (125 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm K-Hepes, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, and 10 μm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pH 7.2). The cell pellet was mixed with 1.5× silicon carbide (wet weight) and lysed by grinding with a pestle and mortar for 45 s. Lysis was monitored by optical microscopy. The lysate was clarified first by centrifugation at 144 ×g for 5 min and then at 325 × g for 10 min. The second pellet was washed under the same conditions, and the supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,500 × g. The pellet was homogenized with a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer with the aid of a 22-gauge needle and applied to a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol, with 4-ml steps of 24, 28, 34, and 37% iodixanol diluted in lysis buffer (26Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 60 min. The mass-dense granule fraction pelleted on the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. Gradient fractions were assayed as previously described for succinate-cytochrome creductase (mitochondrial marker) and alkaline phosphatase and alkaline phosphodiesterase (contractile vacuole markers) (35Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), acid phosphatase (lysosomal marker) (36Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S.

J. 1991; 280: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and H+-PPase (phosphate release) (26Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107 to 1 × 108) were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and treated to extract either long- or short-chain polyphosphate. Different samples were used in each case. Long-chain polyphosphate extraction was performed as described by Ault-Riché et al. (39Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.-M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PPi and short-chain polyphosphate extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4(2 ml/g of cells (wet weight)). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 m KOH and 0.6 m KHCO3. Precipitated KClO4was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s, and the extracted supernatant was used for polyphosphate and PPi determination. Polyphosphate levels were determined from the amount of Pi released upon treatment with an excess of purified recombinant exopolyphophatase (PPX1) fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae as previously described (40Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PPi levels were determined from the amount of Pi released upon treatment with inorganic pyrophosphatase (final activity, 10 units/ml; Sigma) as previously described (40Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphatase was assayed by measuring released phosphate using the EnzChek phosphate assay as described (21Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 μmEGTA, 0.1 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 0.4 units/ml purine-nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.2–0.4 mg of electron-dense vacuole fraction, and PPi as indicated in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Activity was recorded at 360 nm and 30 °C in a PowerWave 340i plate reader (Bio-tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Aliquots (15 μl, ∼20 μg of protein) of the D. discoideum mass-dense granule fraction were mixed with 15 μl of electrophoresis buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 7, 10% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and kept overnight at 4 °C. A 1:10,000 dilution of antibody 324 against H+-PPase in blocking buffer was applied to blots at room temperature for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 20 min each with PBS (containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) before the addition of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 30 min. Immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared) were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% albumin for 5 min, and prepared for immunofluorescence with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal antibody 324 or anti-PAT1 or anti-calmodulin antibody and a 1:100 dilution of monoclonal antibody N-2 or a monoclonal antibody against T. cruzi H+-PPase (41Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a rhodamine-coupled goat anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:150), respectively. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum or without the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope using optical sections of 0.1 μm (40Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For polyphosphate localization, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 106cells/ml. 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg of DAPI. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with the Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope using optical sections of 0.1 μm and an argon laser for detection of polyphosphate (40Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For imaging whole cells and electron-dense vacuole fractions, the preparations were washed with 0.25 m sucrose, and a 5-μl sample was placed on a Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grid, allowed to adhere for 10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly with a Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV (21Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis was done at the Electron Microscopy Center of Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL). Specimen grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Fine probe sizes were adjusted to cover the electron-dense vacuoles (or a similar area of the background), and x-rays were collected for 100 s by utilizing a thin-window detector (Norvar). Analysis was performed using a Noran Voyager III analyzer with a standardless analysis identification program. For osmotic shock treatment, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS diluted 1:10. After 5 min of incubation, samples were placed on Formvar-coated copper grids and observed as described above. Cells (107) were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. Then, acetazolamide (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm), H2DIDS (250, 400, and 500 μm), bafilomycin A1 (1, 2, and 5 μm), or AMDP (20 μm) was added, and the cell suspension was placed in a hemocytometer and examined by light microscopy using a Zeiss photomicroscope. The contractile vacuole cycle is defined as the time (in seconds) between two vacuolar discharges on the same cell. Two contractile vacuole cycles per cell of at least 10 cells per condition were measured. Results are expressed as an average of the values obtained in two different incubations from three independent experiments. Carbonic anhydrase activity was measured as described (42Armstrong J.M. Myers D.V. Verpoorte J.A. Edsall J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5137-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl acetate, different concentrations of acetazolamide, and 10 μl of the sample were mixed in a final volume of 300 μl. Changes in absorbance at 348 nm and 30 °C were determined in the PowerWave 340i plate reader. Mass-dense granules are recognized by their high electron density when they are observed in transmission electron micrographs of cryosectioned cells (13Schlatterer C. Buravkov S. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Schlatterer C. Walther P. Muller M. Mendgen K. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Abundant vacuoles with high electron density of varying diameter (average of 200 nm) were seen when whole D. discoideum amebas were observed by transmission electron microscopy without fixation and staining (Fig.1 A). X-ray microanalysis was performed on these vacuoles (Fig. 1 B). The spectrum shown is the one that yielded the most counts in 100 s (of 10 spectra obtained), but all other spectra taken from mass-dense granules were qualitatively similar: counts for phosphorus were ∼3-fold greater than counts for calcium, which were about the same as counts for magnesium. Peaks for calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were not present in spectra taken from the background (Fig. 1 C). Peaks for copper arose from the grid. To purify these mass-dense granules and to investigate their chemical and enzymatic content, we adapted the purification procedure used for the isolation of similar electron-dense vacuoles (acidocalcisomes) fromT. cruzi (26Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Assaying marker enzymes (Fig.2) assessed the utility of the method. Pyrophosphatase (a marker of acidocalcisomes) was assessed as the pyrophosphate hydrolytic activity sensitive to the specific H+-PPase inhibitor AMDP (33Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Its yield in the polyphosphate body fractions (fractions 1 and 2) was 25%, whereas the yield of protein in the same fractions was only 0.9%, a 125-fold purification. This may actually be a large underestimate of the degree of purification of the polyphosphate bodies, as a pyrophosphatase activity was also present in the contractile vacuole bladders ofD. discoideum (see below). Mitochondria (marked by succinate-cytochrome c reductase), lysosomes (marked by acid phosphatase), and contractile vacuoles (marked by alkaline phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase) (35Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were not enriched in this fraction. The polyphosphate body fractions (fractions 1 and 2) contained ∼20% of the total V-H+-ATPase (measured as the 0.5 μm bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATP hydrolytic activity), 36% of the Ca2+-ATPase (measured as the 10 μm calcium-stimulated ATP hydrolytic activity) (Fig. 2), 36% of the total amount of PPi, and >35 and 45% of the total amounts of short- and long-chain polyphosphates, respectively (Fig. 3). Electron microscopy of the mass-dense granule fractions (fractions 1 and 2) by observation of air-dried samples (Fig. 1 D) showed the presence of electron-dense granules with the same appearance as the mass-dense granules observed in the preparation of whole cells (Fig.1 A). The results of x-ray microanalysis of the isolated granules (Fig. 1 E) were similar to those obtained with whole cells (Fig. 1 B), except that proportionally less calcium and magnesium were detected, probably due to ionic changes occurring during the fractionation procedure.Figure 3Distribution of pyrophosphate and short- and long-chain polyphosphates on iodixanol gradients. PPiand short- and long-chain polyphosphates (SC PolyP andLC PolyP, respectively) were concentrated in fractions 1 (mass-dense granule fraction) and 15 (contractile vacuole fraction).

Control pyrophosphatase activity was 0.16 ± 0.009 μmol of pyrophosphate consumed per min/mg of protein (means ± S.E. of results from five separate experiments) and was inhibited by 30 μm AMDP by 63 ± 8.3% (means ± S.E. from four experiments). The effects of monovalent cations on AMDP-inhibitable pyrophosphate hydrolysis are shown in TableI. Replacing 130 mm KCl with 250 mm sucrose in the buffer resulted in lower pyrophosphatase activity, which was further reduced by replacement of 130 mm KCl with 130 mm NaCl. Use of a buffer containing equimolar concentrations of NaCl (65 mm) and KCl (65 mm) or NaCl (65 mm) and 125 mmsucrose resulted in lower pyrophosphate hydrolysis than in the presence of 130 mm KCl or 65 mm KCl and 125 mm sucrose. These results suggest that K+stimulated this activity, whereas Na+ was inhibitory.Table IEffect of buffer composition on pyrophosphatase activity in the Dictyostelium mass-dense granule fractionExperimental conditionsPyrophosphatase activity% of control130 mmKCl100 ± 5.6250 mmsucrose38.4 ± 3.4130 mm NaCl12.5 ± 4.765 mm KCl, 65 mm NaCl29.5 ± 7.865mm KCl, 125 mm sucrose125.2 ± 5.265 mm NaCl, 125 mmsucrose23.6 ± 6.3Rates are relative (%) to the 130 mm KCl buffer (control buffer).

It involves translocation of single-stranded DNA across membranes through a type IV secretion system. A coupling protein links the DNA-processing nucleoprotein complex, the relaxosome, with the transport apparatus during cell mating. In Escherichia coli plasmid R388 such a protein is TrwB, a basic integral inner-membrane nucleoside-triphosphate-binding protein. TrwB is the structural prototype for the type IV secretion system coupling proteins, a family of proteins essential for macromolecular transport between cells and export. The structure of a soluble TrwB variant unveils an elongated molecule with six equivalent protein units featuring a spherical quaternary structure, leaving a central channel. The structures of the non-liganded protein and four different complexes with substrate analogues and products allow the precise description of the active site architecture. The active sites are located at the interface between protomers, each of them shaped mainly by residues of one monomer, but including two crucial arginine residues belonging to the adjacent molecule. Upon substrate binding and putative hydrolysis, conformational changes are transferred from the external surface to the interior central channel.

Transport of DNA across cell membranes occurs in different biological processes such as viral infection, cell division, sporulation, or conjugation. The latter is mediated by conjugative plasmids aimed to transfer DNA unidirectionally between bacteria, from a donor to a recipient cell, which then becomes a potential donor. It is the main process by which bacterial pathogens acquire antibiotic resistance and constitutes a widespread tool to shuttle genes between different species of bacteria. Even trans-kingdom gene transfer can be achieved through a conjugation-like system, from bacteria to fungal or plant cells (1Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev.

The transfer utilizes a type IV secretion system (6Salmond G.P.C. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 181-200Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a multiprotein transmembrane organelle, and requires physical contact between donor and recipient cells. Genes contained in the plasmid transference (tra) region, further subdivisible into dtr andmpf, control conjugation (5Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Mpf proteins are required for mating pair formation and assembly of the conjugative or sex-pilus. The region ofDNA transfer and replication genes,dtr, includes oriT, the origin of transfer, and genes encoding proteins involved in plasmid DNA processing. Establishment of stable intercellular contacts may trigger a signal that is transmitted to a specialized nucleoprotein complex, the relaxosome (1Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), made up by the DNA region at oriT, and Dtr proteins that cleave and unwind DNA.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), just made up byoriT, trwA, trwB, and trwC. TrwC acts as a relaxase and helicase. It is responsible for both nick cleavage at oriT and T-strand unwinding (14Llosa M. Grandoso G. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Grandoso G. Llosa M. Zabala J.C. de la Cruz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TrwA is a small-sized tetrameric protein, which binds two sites atoriT and enhances TrwC relaxase activity, while repressing transcription of the trwABC operon (16Moncalián G. Grandoso G. Llosa M. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These two proteins constitute, together with oriT DNA and the host-encoded integration host factor, the relaxosome of plasmid R388 (12Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Integration host factor has a modulator role in conjugation (17Rice P.A. Yang S.-W. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), because it inhibits TrwC nic cleavage, probably by affecting the topology of the TrwC DNA target site (18Moncalián G. Valle M. Valpuesta J.M. de la Cruz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The third protein encoded by R388 dtr region, TrwB, is a basic (pI = 10) integral inner-membrane protein of 507 residues (12Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol.

It features a nucleosyl-triphosphate (NTP)-binding site (NBS), reminiscent of those of helicases (20Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 21Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar) and the α and β subunits of F1-ATPase (1Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev.

Sequence analysis predicts the transmembrane part to comprise the seventy N-proximal residues (two transmembrane helices and a small periplasmic domain in between), so TrwB was overproduced and purified as a soluble fragment lacking these residues (TrwBΔN70). This fragment has been shown to bind ATP (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TrwBΔN70 interacts with both ss and double-stranded (ds) DNA with approximately the same affinity as supercoiled dsDNA (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This DNA binding is nonspecific, independent of NTP binding, and associated with TrwC nick cleavage enhancement, possibly due to a topological modification of DNA around oriT, favoring its ss nature. The protein couples the unwound T-strand in its relaxosome complex with the type IV transport pore (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and is the prototype for a family of membrane-bound type IV secretion system coupling proteins (T4CPs). T4CPs bridge the relaxosome with the structures responsible for cell-to-cell contact in all conjugative DNA-transfer systems studied so far (5Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lessl M. Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6099-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Cabezón E.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4093-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are also present in as distinct systems as agrobacterial transfer-DNA translocons or pathogenicity-related protein secretion systems. This family has a similar arrangement of possible transmembrane segments, and its members possess at least one NTP-binding domain (NBD; see Fig. 1 a). Besides TrwB, it further includes TraD of plasmid F, TraG of plasmid RP4, VirD4 from the Ri and Ti plasmids (25Hirayama T. Muranaka T. Ohkawa H. Oka A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and TrsK from pGO1 (26Morton T.M. Eaton D.M. Johnston J.L. Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4436-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), among more than 40 additional homologues. Interestingly, some of these proteins can be functionally exchanged for another member of the family (27Cabezón E. Lanka E. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4455-4458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a further interesting functional similarity is found between TrwB-like proteins and the SpoIIIE/FtsK bacterial protein family (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F.

SpoIIIE and FtsK are supposed to drive DNA across the annulus during sporulation and cell division, respectively (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). TrwB has the same molecular organization as SpoIIIE/FtsK-like proteins (see Fig.1 a) and shares sequence similarities, in particular around the helicase NTP-binding motifs, suggesting a relationship in function. We briefly described the structure of non-liganded TrwBΔN70 (32Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Here we present its fully refined structure and its binary complexes with non-hydrolyzable GTP and ATP analogues, with ADP·Mg2+ and with a sulfate anion. Accordingly, we show the enzyme in different states, the apo protein, two equivalent “substrate” complexes, and two different “product” complexes, respectively. These data unveil detailed structural features of the active site. The soluble 437-residue variant of TrwB, TrwBΔN70, was produced by overexpression and purified as described previously (19Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized in two crystal forms (P3121 and P21) from equivolumetric drops of protein solution and precipitant agent solution employing the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method (32Gomis-Rüth F.X.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Complexes between TrwBΔN70 and adenosine- and guanosine-5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (ADPNP and GDPNP, respectively) and ADP were obtained by a 20- to 30-min soak of trigonal crystals grown from tartrate in 0.1m GDPNP, ADPNP, or ADP further 0.25 m in HEPES (pH 7.5) and 10 mm in MgCl2. Crystals treated in this way were immediately flash cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen after application of a cryo-protecting strategy as described (33Gomis-Rüth F.X. Coll M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Complete diffraction data sets were collected from a single cryo-cooled crystal each on a 345-mm MAR Research Imaging plate, 165-mm marCCD and ADSC Quantum4 CCD detectors at DESY (Hamburg) and ESRF (Grenoble) synchrotrons. All data were processed with MOSFLM 6.01 (34Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the trigonal crystal form of TrwBΔN70 grown from sulfate (product P complex) was solved by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion as described previously (33Gomis-Rüth F.X. Coll M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), revealing a toroidal homohexamer in the asymmetric unit (32Gomis-Rüth F.X.

The structure of the monoclinic crystal form (apo form) was solved by molecular replacement using a whole TrwBΔN70 hexamer as a searching model and AMoRe (33Gomis-Rüth F.X. Coll M. Acta Crystallogr.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) unveiling twelve monomers arranged as two hexamers in the asymmetric unit. The models were built and improved in successive cycles of manual model building on a Silicon Graphics workstation with TURBO-FRODO (37Roussel A. Cambilleau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar) and posterior bulk-solvent and anisotropic temperature factor correction, followed by maximum-likelihood positional and temperature factor refinement with CNS version 1.0 (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The structures of the GDPNP, ADPNP, and ADP complexes were solved by difference-Fourier synthesis using the trigonal crystal structure as a starting model. The coordinates were subjected to rigid-body and maximum-likelihood positional and temperature factor refinement with CNS version 1.0 against the diffraction data of each of the three complexes. The subsequently calculated electron density omit maps before and after 6-fold averaging clearly revealed the presence of bound molecules in the six NBSs of a particle (see Fig. 5, b and d). Additional density for a HEPES molecule on the molecular surface for a solvent-exposed chloride anion (tentatively assigned in base of strong electron density) and for a second, partially disordered GDPNP molecule in the central hexamer pore were found in the first complex. The ADPNP complex structure revealed an additional chloride anion, and the ADP complex revealed an ion of Mg2+ in each NBS (except in the NBS of chain F), besides two HEPES molecules at the molecular surface. Model building and computational refinement were assessed as mentioned.

Open table in a new tab The polypeptide chains of the different monomers within each hexamer are defined from their N termini at residues Asn72 to Glu78 until the C-terminal amino acids Glu504 to Ile507. Residues Arg437-Thr444 to Thr450-Glu455 from a surface-exposed region (strands β9 and β10) probably interacting with the inner part of the chopped-off transmembrane region, are flexible and have not been traced. All residues, excepting His125 (Φ/Ψ = ∼70°/∼160°) of each polypeptide chain in all structures, are placed in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. This residue is, however, clearly defined by electron density and located at the beginning of strand β2, because its (and the preceding residue's) carbonyl oxygen is involved in β sheet interactions with amide nitrogen atoms of residues Arg408 and Ser409. Superpositions were calculated with TURBO-FRODO (37Roussel A. Cambilleau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar), LSQKAB and LSQMAN of the CCP4 suite (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The figures were computed with TURBO-FRODO, GRASP (40Nicholls A. Bharadwaj R. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1993; 64 (A166): A166Google Scholar), and VOLUMES/BOBSCRIPT/RASTER3D (41Esnouf R.M. J. Mol.

Buried surface accessibility calculations (probe radius 1.4 Å) and close contacts (<4Å) were ascertained with CNS version 1.0. Model quality was assessed with PROCHECK (43Laskowsky R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 24: 946-950Google Scholar). The coordinates of TrwBΔN70 have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (access code 1e9r, 1e9 s, 1gki, 1gl6, and 1gl7). Structural similarity searches were performed with the DALI server at www.ebi.ac.uk/dali. Structural classifications were made according to SCOP at scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop. Interaction schemes were created with LIGPLOT (44Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Prot. Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). The TrwBΔN70 monomer consists of two domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) attached to the inner-membrane and a membrane-distal all-α domain (AAD; Fig.1, b and c). This NBD displays an α/β P-loop containing NTP-hydrolase core structure. This domain runs from the membrane-proximal N terminus, anchor point of the excised transmembrane domain (TMD), to residue Lys183and continues from position Asp298 to the surface-located C terminus. It is composed of a central, highly twisted (∼90°) nine-stranded pleated β-sheet of mixed parallel/antiparallel topology (strands β2–β8, β11, and β12; Fig. 1 b), flanked on its concave side by four helices (termed αA through αD) and on the other side by seven helices (αL through αR). The convex side faces an interior channel. On the membrane-proximal edge of the central β-sheet, a small three-stranded antiparallel sheet (strands β1, β9, and β10; see Fig. 1 b) is inserted, almost perpendicularly. Strands β9 and β10 are only partially defined by electron density, probably due to the absence of interactions with the (excised) TMD preceding strand β1. On top of NBD, the smaller AAD is inserted between strand β4 and helix αL, comprising residues Gly184-Gly297(Fig. 1, b and c). This domain contains seven helices: a 310-helix (helix αE), followed by a two-helix hairpin (helices αF and αG) and by a second, curved, helical hairpin segment (helices αH through αK). The latter mainly protects and interacts with the central helix αG. The interaction between NBD and AAD is mainly of hydrophilic nature and encompasses a common surface of 2314 Å2 (about 36% of the total surface of AAD). It comprises mainly segments Leu175-Tyr178, Thr182-Lys183, Asp298-Glu306, Ala324-Ser342, Glu362-Ala365, and Asp393-Val394 of NBD and Gly184-Tyr195, Arg199-Lys209, and Asp286-Gly297 of AAD. We analyzed the 56 close contacts between domains and observed 18 hydrogen bonds, 4 salt bridges, and 6 van der Waals interactions. As derived from both crystal forms obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”), six TrwBΔN70 protomers intimately associate employing a local 6-fold axis (see Figs.1 d and 2 b). One hexamer is observed in the asymmetric unit of the trigonal crystals (monomers A to G), and two are present in the monoclinic system (monomers A to G and H to M, respectively). This agrees with the native protein migrating as a hexamer in gel filtration column chromatography (data not shown). The protomers are practically indistinguishable from each other within a hexamer. The hexamer, with overall dimensions of 110-Å diameter and 90-Å height (see Fig. 2 a), displays an orange-like shape, somewhat flattened at both poles along the axis. A central channel runs from the cytosolic pole (made up by the AADs) to the membrane pole (formed by the NBDs), ending at the (tentatively modeled) transmembrane pore shaped by the 12 transmembrane helices, rendering an overall mushroom-like structure (Fig.1 d). This channel is delimited at its entrance mainly by gatekeeping residues Asn271 of loop αIαJ from each subunit and is restricted to a diameter of ∼7–8 Å. This is the closest point of the channel that, at its exit to the TMD, has an opening of ∼22 Å. The interaction between TrwBΔN70 monomers is mainly of hydrophilic nature with the central twisted β-sheets arranged almost in parallel (C-edge to N-edge). It is characterized by a common surface of 4588 Å2 as calculated for monomers A and B (about 25% of the total surface of a monomer). This contact surface is lined up mainly by segments Gly80-Pro83, Ala131-Thr134, Tyr178, Lys209-Trp216, Phe243-Phe251, Asn271-Asp286, Arg318-Ala324, Ser360, Gln386-Val397, Gly415-Lys421, Arg437-Arg439, Glu455-Asp472 (monomer A) and"

This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous C2H2 type zinc fingers near the C terminus that bind GC/GT boxes. Amino acid sequences in the transcription activation/repression domains are less conserved among family members. This family of proteins exhibits a different affinity for the GC/GT boxes in different promoters and possesses transcriptional activation, repression, or both functions. Because the GC/GT boxes are one of the most common regulatory elements in promoters of many cellular and viral genes, the characterization of the modulation of their transcriptional activities by different coactivators will provide significant insight into the mechanism by which this family of factors regulates gene expression.

A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as well as ERC-1 (EKLF coactivator remodeling complex 1). ERC-1 is a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex and is required for generating a DNase I-hypersensitive, transcriptionally active β promoter on a chromatin template in vitro (9Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). EKLF was also demonstrated to interact with the corepressors mSin3A and HDAC1 and repress transcription (10Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). In addition to histone, a number of transcription factors are also substrates for acetylation (15Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The modification of transcription factors by acetylation has been shown to regulate the activation function at multiple levels, including DNA binding, interaction with other proteins, and stability (15Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Despite the general involvement of CBP/p300 and PCAF in transcriptional activation by many factors, recent studies suggest that different transcription factors show selective interaction with these coactivators, and the exact role of the acetylation of transcription factors by these coactivators remains to be established. FKLF2/RFLAT-1/BTEB3 (hereafter referred to as FKLF2) is a recently cloned member of the Sp1/KLF family of transcription factors (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar, 22Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Song A. Chen Y.-F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). FKLF2 is a phosphorylated protein and is expressed in a variety of tissues (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar, 22Martin K.M. Cooper W.N.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our previous studies (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar) have shown that FKLF2 activates the human γ globin promoter and to a lesser degree the ε and β globin promoters as well as several erythroid-specific promoters. It also activates the SV40, SM22α, and theRANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) gene promoter in transient assays (22Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Song A. Chen Y.-F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies demonstrate that FKLF2 was able to bind to a consensus basic transcription element named BTE (22Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the A/B region of theRANTES gene promoter (23Song A. Chen Y.-F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays using reporter constructs containing different versions of the γ globin promoter have shown that, in addition to the CACCC sequence at position −142, other regions including sequences surrounding the TATA box in the γ globin promoter are also capable of mediating FKLF2 transcriptional activation (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar). Together, the results from these studies indicate that FKLF2 is able to activate transcription from many gene promoters via different sequence elements. Here we show that the coactivators CBP/p300 or PCAF stimulate transcriptional activation of the human γ globin promoter by FKLF2 in K562 cells. The acetyltransferase activity of PCAF but not that of CBP/p300 is required for the stimulation of FKLF2 activity, indicating that PCAF and CBP/p300 may play different roles in coactivation with FKLF2. We further show that p300 and PCAF act cooperatively in stimulating FKLF2-mediated transcription. FKLF2 interacts with both CBP and PCAF through its zinc finger domain. FKLF2 interacts with specific regions of CBP and PCAF. Both CBP and PCAF acetylate FKLF2 in the zinc finger domain in vitro. The binding of FKLF2 to the γ CACCC box was strongly stimulated by CBP and PCAF. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of PCAF but not of CBP/p300 is required for stimulating FKLF2 binding to the CACCC box of the γ promoter. Therefore, the functional HAT domain of PCAF but not that of CBP/p300 is required both for stimulation of FKLF2 DNA binding and for coactivation of the γ promoter. Together with other studies, these results demonstrate that FKLF2 and other members of this family (such as EKLF) interact differentially with CBP/p300 or PCAF and that the activities of these family members are regulated by these coactivators through distinct mechanisms. The differential utilization of and regulation by CBP/p300 and PCAF may play important roles in the specific activation of target genes by members of this highly conserved family of transcription factors. The plasmids pSG5DD and pSG5/FKLF2, which express the murine FKLF2, and the pγluc and pHS2βluc reporter plasmids were as described (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for wild-type and HAT-defective PCAF were provided by Y. Nakatani, T. Kouzarides, and I. Talianidis (20Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V.

Hecht (28Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for wild-type CBP and HAT-defective CBP (L1690K/C1691L) were provided by I. Talianidis (25Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). FKLF2-Myc plasmids that express the full-length or a series of mutants of FKLF2 with a Myc tag at their C termini were constructed by inserting FKLF2 or its mutants and a Myc tag into a mammalian expression vector. FLAG·CBP1 containing residues 451–662 and FLAG·CBP2 containing residues 1680–1891 were constructed by inserting the corresponding PCR fragments and FLAG tag into a cytomegalovirus expression vector. GST·FKLF2 fusion proteins were constructed by inserting the corresponding PCR fragments into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For production of GST·CBP fusion proteins, DNA sequences corresponding to the indicated regions of CBP (CBP1, CBP2, and CBP3) were amplified by PCR, and the corresponding PCR fragments were inserted into pGEX-4T-1. GST fusion proteins containing wild-type or HAT-defective PCAF were constructed by inserting their corresponding PCR fragments (amino acid residues 352–832) into pGEX-4T-1. GST fusion proteins containing the wild-type or mutant HAT domains of CBP (GST·CBP-HAT, residues 1196–1781) was constructed by inserting the corresponding fragments into pGEX-4T-1. EMSA assays were essentially as described (27Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using purified GST fusion proteins and synthetic oligo probes containing the distal CACCC box of the human γ globin promoter. K562 cells cultured in 12-well plates were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay system. Whole cell extracts from COS cells were prepared as described (27Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified as described (27Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The concentration and purity of the fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as standard. Whole cell extracts from COS cells expressing Myc-tagged FKLF2 were incubated with the GST·CBP or GST·PCAF fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% IGEPAL-CA-630 (Sigma) with protease inhibitors. The binding mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed four times with 500 μl of binding buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Myc·FKLF2 was detected using anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), respectively. COS cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the FLAG·CBP, FLAG·CBP1, CBP2, or FLAG·PCAF expression vector together with the Myc·FKLF2 expression plasmid as indicated using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (30Song C.-Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), except that the binding and washing buffers contained 100 mm KCl. The presence of FKLF2 and the CBP or PCAF complex was detected by immunoblotting using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or an anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody and chemiluminescence. Protein acetyltransferase assays were carried out in reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA, 1 μg of purified GST·FKLF2 fusion protein on beads, and 50 ng of purified GST·CBP-HAT containing the HAT domain of CBP (residues 1196–1718), GST·PCA wild-type, or the GST·PCAF-HAT-defective mutant. After incubating at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing, the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and analyzed using a phosphorimager. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which FKLF2 activates transcription, we determined whether CBP/p300 acts as an FKLF2 coactivator and potentiates transcriptional activity in K562 cells. As expected from previous studies (21Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 578-3584Crossref Google Scholar), FKLF2 activated the γ globin promoter. FKLF2 activity was further enhanced by CBP (Fig.1). CBP by itself showed no effect on the γ globin promoter-driven luciferase expression, indicating a functional interaction between CBP and FKLF2 at the γ globin promoterin vivo. These results demonstrate that CBP functions as a coactivator for FKLF2 (Fig 1). We next determined whether FKLF2 physically interacts with full-length CBPin vivo by a coimmunoprecipitation assay using whole cell extracts from COS cells expressing FLAG-tagged full-length CBP and Myc-tagged FKLF2. As shown in Fig.2 A, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc antibody revealed the complex formation between CBP and FKLF2 in vivo. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody also revealed the specific interaction between FKLF2 and CBP (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2, C and Dshow that the FLAG-tagged CBP and Myc-tagged FKLF2 are expressed at similar levels. These data demonstrate that FKLF2 associates with full-length CBP in vivo (Fig. 2). CBP contains distinct domains that interact with transcription factors. The CBP domains and some of their interacting proteins are illustrated in Fig. 3 A. GST fusion proteins containing different regions of CBP were tested for their ability to interact with FKLF2. A GST pull-down assay was performed on GST·CBP fusion proteins and whole cell extracts prepared from COS cells expressing Myc-tagged FKLF2. As shown in Fig. 3 A, this assay revealed that FKLF2 interacts specifically with CBP2, which is also essential for interactions with factors including E1a, c-Fos, PCAF, MyoD, GATA-1, and TFIIB (17Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The observed specific interaction of FKLF2 with CBP2 but not CBP1, CBP3, and GST is not due to a difference in the amount of these fusion proteins used in the assay, because the same amount of each protein was included in the reaction as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). To determine the in vivo association between FKLF2 and CBP2, coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out using whole cell extracts from COS cells expressing FLAG-tagged CBP1 or CBP2 and Myc-tagged FKLF2. As shown in Fig. 3 B, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc antibody revealed the complex formation between CBP2 and FKLF2in vivo. Consistent with the results from the GST pull-down assay shown in (Fig. 3 A), no in vivo association between CBP1 and FKLF2 was detected (Fig. 3 B). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using the anti-FLAG antibody also revealed the specific interaction between FKLF2 and CBP2 (Fig. 3 B). The FLAG-tagged CBP1, CBP2, and Myc-tagged FKLF2 are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3 B). Like other members of the Sp1/KLF family, FKLF2 contains distinct domains including a proline-rich potential transactivation domain in the N-terminal portion and three highly conserved zinc fingers (DNA-binding domain) in the C-terminal portion (Fig. 3 C). To determine which region of FKLF2 interacts with CBP, GST pull-down assays were carried out by incubating whole cell extracts prepared from COS cells expressing Myc-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants of FKLF2 proteins with a purified GST·CBP2 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the GST pull-down assay demonstrates that CBP2 interacts specifically with the zinc finger region of FKLF2. The Myc-tagged FKLF2 and its mutants used in this assay are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3 C). To further establish the interaction of the FKLF2 zinc finger region with CBP2, GST pull-down assays were carried out using whole cell extracts from COS cells expressing Myc-tagged FKLF2-(149–289) and GST·CBP1 or GST·CBP2. This assay revealed a specific interaction of FKLF2-(149–289) with CBP2 but not with CBP1 (Fig. 3 C). By establishing the specific interaction of the FKLF2 zinc finger region with CBP2 but not CBP1, this result rules out the possibility that the observed interaction of FKLF2-(149–289) with CBP2 is due to a nonspecific interaction of the cysteine rich zinc finger region (Fig.3). In addition to the ability to function as an intermediary molecule by direct interaction with both transcription activators and the general transcription machinery (14Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), CBP/p300 has intrinsic HAT activity (18Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

The acetylation of transcription factors by CBP/p300 has also been shown to modulate the activity of these proteins at multiple levels, including DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, stability, and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (24Martı́nez-Balbás M.A. Bauer U.-M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase function of CBP/p300 is required for the superactivation of EKLF (36Zhang W. Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, several studies have shown that the HAT activity of p300 is not required for coactivation with a number of transcription factors, including E2F, MyoD, β-catenin, and the HIV Tat protein (24, 28, 37, and 38). Therefore, the exact role of the acetylase activity of CBP/p300 in the coactivation of these two proteins with transcription activators remains unknown. We examined whether the HAT activity of CBP/p300 is required for the potentiation of FKLF2 transcriptional activity using a HAT-defective p300 (p300 HAT−), which contains a DI to AL exchange of p300 residues 1485 and 1486 and abolishes its HAT activity (Refs. 28Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 39Martı́nez-Balbás M.A Bennister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar and data not shown). Transient assays were carried out by cotransfection of a reporter containing the γ globin promoter and the FKLF2 expression plasmid together with expression vectors for either wild-type p300 or p300 HAT− in K562 cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, p300 and FKLF2 coactivated the γ globin promoter. P300 alone showed no effect on the γ globin promoter activity, indicating that its recruitment to the γ globin promoter is mediated through functional interaction with FKLF2. Both the wild-type and the HAT-defective p300 are capable of stimulating FKLF2 transcriptional activation of the γ globin promoter. A higher degree of stimulation of FKLF2 activity by the HAT-defective p300 was also observed. To further establish the requirement of CBP/p300-HAT activity for the stimulation of FKLF2 transcriptional activity, the wild-type CBP and the mutant CBP (CBP-HAT−, L1690K/C1691L), which lack HAT activity (25, 40 and our data not shown), were also tested for the ability to stimulate FKLF2 activation of the pγluc reporter in K562 cells. These assays also showed that the HAT activity of CBP is not required for its coactivation of FKLF2 transcriptional activation (data not shown). Protein assays demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant p300 are expressed at similar levels (data not shown). These results demonstrate that CBP/p300 functions as a coactivator for FKLF2 in the transcriptional activation of the γ globin promoter and that the HAT activity of CBP/p300 is dispensable for its function as a coactivator for FKLF2. PCAF is another member of the transcription coactivators with acetylase activity (20Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Both CBP/p300 and PCAF have been shown to function as coactivators for a number of transcription factors, including p53, E2F, and the estrogen receptor (24Martı́nez-Balbás M.A. Bauer U.-M.

In contrast, CBP/p300 but not PCAF is required for coactivation with the erythroid-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and EKLF (8Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 44Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 45Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggest that transcription activators may have a differential requirement for CBP/p300 or PCAF coactivators. We therefore determined whether PCAF also functions as a coactivator for FKLF2 in transcriptional activation of the γ globin promoter in K562 cells. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that PCAF stimulated FKLF2 activity in a dose-dependent manner. PCAF by itself showed no effect on the luciferase expression. We next determined whether the HAT activity of PCAF is required for the potentiation of FKLF2 transcriptional activation using HAT-defective PCAF, which contains a deletion of amino acids 497–526 (24Martı́nez-Balbás M.A. Bauer U.-M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The HAT-defective PCAF failed to stimulate the transcriptional activation of the human γ globin promoter by FKLF2. Transcriptional activation of the γ globin promoter by FKLF2 was reduced by the HAT-defective PCAF, indicating an inhibitory effect on FKLF2 transcriptional activation by PCAF-HAT− (Fig.4 B). The inability of HAT-defective PCAF to coactivate FKLF2 transcriptional activation is not due to the difference in expression levels, because Western blot analysis showed that these two are expressed at same level (data not shown). By demonstrating that PCAF-HAT− cannot coactivate with FKLF2 at different concentrations and has inhibitory effects when expressed at a higher level, the quantitative assays shown in Fig. 4 B further rule out the possibility that this is due to the differences in the expression levels of the wild-type and mutant PCAF. These results demonstrate that PCAF functions as a coactivator of FKLF2 and that the HAT activity of PCAF is required for its synergistic activation of γ globin promoter with FKLF2 (Fig. 4). The above transient reporter assays showed a functional interaction between PCAF and FKLF2. We next determined whether FKLF2 physically interacts with PCAF and which r"

To clarify the function of PV72 as a sorting receptor, we expressed four modified PV72s and analyzed their ability to bind the internal propeptide (the 2S-I peptide) of pro2S albumin by affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance. The recombinant PV72 specifically bound to the 2S-I peptide with a K D value of 0.2 μm, which was low enough for it to function as a receptor. The EGF-like motifs modulated the Ca2+-dependent conformational change of PV72 to form a functional pocket for the ligand binding. The binding of Ca2+ stabilizes the receptor-ligand complex even at pH 4.0. The association and dissociation of PV72 with the ligand is modulated by the Ca2+ concentration (EC50 value = 40 μm) rather than the environmental pH. Overall results suggest that Ca2+ regulates the vacuolar sorting mechanism in higher plants.

Such sorting involves recognition of targeting signals of proteins by receptors. In mammalian systems, mannose 6-phosphate residues in glycosyl side chains of glycoproteins are known to function as a targeting signal to the lysosomes, and mannose 6-phosphate receptors have been identified as a lysosome sorting receptor (1Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast systems, a short stretch sequence of amino acids, QRPL, found in the carboxypeptidase Y, is known to function as a targeting signal to the vacuoles, and Vps10p has been identified as a vacuolar sorting receptor for vacuolar hydrolases (2Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Higher plants have two types of vacuoles: one type, protein storage vacuoles, develop mainly in storage organs, such as seeds, and the other type, lytic vacuoles, which contain various lytic enzymes, develop in the vegetative organs. Both types of vacuoles, however, are found in the same cells of barley roots (3Paris N. Stanley C.M. Jones R.L. Rogers J.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and of maturing pea seeds (4Hoh B. Hinz G. Jeong B.-K. Robinson D.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 299-310PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, vacuolar proteins synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum are sorted and delivered to their respective vacuoles. Thus, different targeting machinery for each type of vacuole must be involved in protein transport in these cells. For the lytic vacuoles, BP-80 was the first putative vacuolar sorting receptor isolated from pea (5Kirsch T. Paris N. Butler J.M. Beevers L. Rogers J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It binds in vitro to the vacuolar-targeting determinants (6Kirsch T. Saalbach G. Raikhel N.V. Beevers L.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated the in vivo binding of BP-80 to the propeptide sequence of barley aleurain in a yeast mutant strain defective for its own vacuolar receptor, Vps10p. An Arabidopsis homolog, AtELP, was also found to interact with the propeptide of an aleurain homolog, AtALEU (9Ahmed S.U. Rojo E. Kovalentina V. Venkataraman S. Dombrowski J.E. Matsuoka K. Raikhel N.V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). BP-80 (10Paris N. Rogers A.W. Jiang L. Kirsch T. Beevers L. Phillips T.E. Rogers J.C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and AtELP (11Ahmed S.U. Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) are a type I integral membrane protein with epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like motifs. They have been shown to be rich in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and prevacuolar compartments (12Hinz G. Hilmer S. Baumer M. Hohl I. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1509-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Sanderfoot A.A. Ahmed S.U. Marty-Mazars D. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Marty F. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This implied that the cysteine proteinases might be delivered from the Golgi complex to lytic vacuoles via the CCVs in a receptor-dependent manner (9Ahmed S.U. Rojo E. Kovalentina V. Venkataraman S. Dombrowski J.E. Matsuoka K. Raikhel N.V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Jiang L. Rogers J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1183-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CCVs isolated from maturing pea seeds were reported to contain no storage proteins (12Hinz G. Hilmer S. Baumer M. Hohl I. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1509-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transport machinery for storage proteins should be different from that of the lytic enzymes. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the transport of storage proteins are scarcely elucidated. In maturing seeds of plants, seed storage protein precursors are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to protein storage vacuoles, where the precursor proteins are converted into the respective mature forms by the action of vacuolar processing enzyme (15Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 440-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hara-Nishimura I. Inoue K. Nishimura M.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2539-2550PubMed Google Scholar) and Hinz et al. (12Hinz G. Hilmer S. Baumer M. Hohl I. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1509-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) demonstrated immunocytochemically that dense vesicles with a diameter of about 100 nm associated with Golgi complex contain storage proteins in maturing pea cotyledons. We found the other unique vesicles responsible for delivery of precursors of seed storage proteins and a membrane protein into the vacuoles (22Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 747-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukasawa T. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 339-345Google Scholar, 24Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Inoue K. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and designated them PAC (precursor-accumulating) vesicles (25Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hatano K. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The PAC vesicles are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and mediate a transport for storage proteins directly to protein storage vacuoles. We have found an integral membrane protein, PV72, with EGF-like motifs in the PAC vesicle fraction prepared from maturing pumpkin seeds (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have also shown that PV72 exhibits an affinity for peptides derived from pumpkin 2S albumin (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The question is how the association and dissociation of a receptor and the respective ligand is regulated. In mammalian systems, the affinity of mannose 6-phosphate receptor for their glycoprotein ligands was reported to be reduced by the acidic pH of the lysosomes (1Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the analogy to the system, the binding of BP-80 and AtELP to the ligand was described to be regulated by the pH (5Kirsch T. Paris N. Butler J.M. Beevers L. Rogers J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Ahmed S.U. Rojo E. Kovalentina V. Venkataraman S. Dombrowski J.E. Matsuoka K. Raikhel N.V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study, however, we found that PV72 still has an ability to bind to the ligand at pH 4.0 in the presence of Ca2+ and that the EGF-like motifs modulate a Ca2+-dependent conformational change of PV72. We describe here a unique mechanism by which Ca2+ acts as a modulator for the association and dissociation of PV72 with its ligand. Pumpkin (Cucurbita sp cv Kurokawa Amakuri Nankin) seeds were purchased from Aisan Shubyo Seed Co. (Nagoya, Japan). The seeds were planted in the field. The cotyledons of maturing seeds, freshly harvested 22–28 days after anthesis, were used for the experiments. PAC vesicles were isolated from pumpkin cotyledons at the middle stage of seed maturation as described previously (25Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hatano K. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The cotyledons were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and 0.3 m mannitol) with an ice-chilled mortar and pestle and filtered through three layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 8,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA and 0.3m mannitol) and layered on 28% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) solution. After centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 35 min, the vesicle fraction was pooled and washed once in buffer B. PAC vesicles were collected by the centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in buffer B. The isolated vesicles were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Maturing pumpkin seeds were vacuum-infiltrated for 1 h with a fixative that consisted of 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.06m sucrose in 0.05 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The tissues were then cut into slices of less than 1 mm in thickness with a razor blade and treated for another 2 h with freshly prepared fixative. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (27Mitsuhashi N. Shimada T. Mano S. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), except that in the present study we used specific antibodies against PV72 (diluted 5,000-fold) (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies against rabbit IgG (diluted 5,000-fold; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). PV72 was immunologically detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (an ECL system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Four modified PV72s were expressed in insect cells of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) with a baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The system includes a transfer vector pBlueBac 4.5 and an expression vector Bac-N-Blue DNA composed of engineered baculoviral Autographa california multiple polyhedrosis virus. The KpnI-SacI fragment of pPV72 was produced from the amplified DNA with PV72 cDNA and a unique primer of 5′-ATT TGT TTA ACT GAA GAC GTG CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC GAT GAG CTT TGA GGT ACC GAA TTC-3′ and was ligated with theKpnI-SacI-digested pBlueBac 4.5 to produce the pBlueBac-rPV72. The pBlueBac-rPV72 encoded a fusion protein composed of both the signal sequence and the lumen domain of PV72 followed by a polyhistidine tag and an HDEL sequence. Constructs for three other modified PV72s were produced by the same procedure described above, except for using each primer: 5′-GAT GGA GTC CAC ACG TGT GAA CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC GAT GAG CTT TGA GGT ACC GAA TTC-3′ for PV72Δ3, 5′-YAC ACT CAT TGT GAA GCT CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC GAT GAG CTT TGA GGT ACC GAA TTC-3′ for PV72Δ2,3, and 5′-ATT TGT TTA ACT GAA CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC GAT GAG CTT TGA GGT ACC GAA TTC-3′ for PV72Δ1,2,3. We cotransfected Sf21 cells with Bac-N-Blue DNA and each of the produced plasmids to generate recombinant baculoviruses. The viruses were purified from the supernatant of the transfected cells by a plaque assay to generate a high titer recombinant viral stock (28De Hayashi H. Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For large scale expression of these modified PV72s, the optimal expression time was determined by monitoring the cellular extract using SDS-PAGE and an immunoblot with anti-PV72 antibodies. Three days after infection, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min, washed with PBS and gently suspended in 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and 1 mm CaCl2. The cells were lysed by three bursts of sonication for 1 min at 10-min intervals on ice and were centrifuged at 750,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and was eluted with a gradient of 20–1,000 mm imidazol in the above buffer. The modified PV72 fractions were dialyzed against the HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.4% CHAPS) plus 1 mm CaCl2 were concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and then were loaded on a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with the HEPES buffer plus 1 mmCaCl2. The purified modified PV72s were concentrated by Centricon 30 and subjected to a protein assay (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo) and a binding assay as described below. Five peptides (SRDVLQMRGIENPWRREG (2S-I), SRDVLQMRGIENPWGGGG (2S-I/3G), SRDVLQMRGIENGWRREG (2S-I/P75G), SRDVLQMRGIGNPWRREG (2S-I/E73G), SRDVLQMRGIENPWRRGG (2S-I/E79G)) were chemically synthesized with a peptide synthesizer (model 431A; Applied Biosystems Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and were used for ligands of affinity columns. Each peptide (10 mg) was immobilized to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to prepare affinity columns. The modified PV72s were applied to each column equilibrated with the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 and then eluted with the HEPES buffer plus 2.5 mm EDTA (20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, and 2.5 mm EDTA) with an automated chromatography system (ÄKTA, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently to an immunoblot analysis with anti-PV72 antibodies. We immobilized either 2S-I peptide or 2S-I/3G peptide on a sensor chip for a BIACORE system (BIACORE, Tokyo, Japan) in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (HBS, BIACORE). Carboxymethylated dextran on a sensor chip (CM5) was activated with the mixture (70 μl) of 0.05m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.05 m N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and then coupled with either 2S-I peptide or 2S-I/3G peptide at 25 °C and a flow rate of 5 μl/min for the solutions used on a BIACORE system. A control flow cell was prepared with no peptide. The amount of the coupled peptide on the sensor chip was found to be 1200–1500 resonance units. The modified PV72s were injected onto the sensor chip for 300 s, and then the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 was eluted for 200–300 s at 25 °C and a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated with 30 μl of 20 mmHCl to remove residual PV72 from the immobilized peptides. Equal volumes of each protein dilution were also injected over a control flow cell to serve as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of bulk refractive index background and nonspecific binding of analyte. The sensorgrams shown in this study are made by subtracting the sensorgram made with the control flow cell. Kinetic analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The association, dissociation, and regeneration phases were followed in real time as the changes in the relative diffraction. The association phase (0–180 s) was analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting to yield the association rate constants (k a) as mean values. The dissociation phase (180–300 s) was also analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting to yield the dissociation rate constants (k d). To avoid mass transport, we worked at a low immobilization level, a high flow rate (30 μl/min), and using suitable concentrations of analyte. Kinetic constants (the association rate constant (k a), the dissociation rate constant (k d), and the dissociation constant (K D = k d/k a)) were calculated from the sensorgrams using BIA evaluation software version 2.1 (BIACORE). These kinetic parameters were determined from three independent experiments. Ca2+-dependent binding was analyzed by two methods: surface plasmon resonance analysis and affinity chromatography. Both rPV72 and rPV72Δ1,2,3 were dialyzed against the HEPES buffer plus 2.5 mm EGTA, followed by dialysis against the HEPES buffer to remove Ca2+ and EGTA. The dialyzed PV72s were injected onto the 2S-I-immobilized sensor chip equilibrated with the HEPES buffer plus 0, 0.02, 0.05 0.1, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm MgCl2to obtain each sensorgram. Alternatively rPV72 was applied to the 2S-I affinity column with the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 and then washed with the HEPES buffer containing decreasing concentration of CaCl2 (500, 100, 50, 20, 0 μm). Finally, the column was eluted with the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm EGTA. To compare the Ca2+ sensitivity of rPV72 with that of rPV72Δ1,2,3, both modified proteins were applied to the 2S-I column with either the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 or the MES buffer (20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.4% CHAPS) plus 1 mm CaCl2. We used the HEPES buffer plus 50 μm CaCl2 or the MES buffer plus 50 μm CaCl2 as the washing solution for the columns and the HEPES buffer plus 2.5 mmEGTA or the MES buffer plus 2.5 mm EGTA as the elution buffers. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently to an immunoblot analysis. To investigate the pH effect on the interaction of modified PV72s with either 2S-I peptide, 2S-I/E73G peptide, 2S-I/P75G peptide, and 2S-I/E79G peptide, the proteins were subjected to each affinity column equilibrated with the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 or the sodium acetate buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS) plus 1 mmCaCl2. The column was washed with the respective buffer and eluted with the respective buffer plus 2.5 mm EGTA. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently to an immunoblot analysis. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4500, Tokyo, Japan) with an excitation wavelength at 280 nm in mixtures containing 1 μg/ml modified PV72s, in the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 or the HEPES buffer plus 1 mm EDTA, as described previously (29Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 251-285Google Scholar). Previously, we found unique vesicles, PAC vesicles, which mediate the transport of the storage protein precursors to protein storage vacuoles in maturing pumpkin seeds (25Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hatano K. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of the maturing seeds revealed numerous electron-dense PAC vesicles within the cells, as indicated byarrowheads in Fig. 1. Isolation of the PAC vesicles showed that they accumulated proprotein precursors of seed storage proteins, but not their mature forms at all (Fig. 2, lane 1). The precursors included pro2S albumin, proglobulin, and PV100, which is a single precursor of multifunctional proteins including trypsin inhibitors, cytotoxic peptides, and 7S globulin (30Yamada K. Shimada T. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PV72 was detectable as a single band with a molecular mass of 72 kDa on an immunoblot of the PAC vesicles with anti-PV72 antibodies (Fig. 2,lane 2). The PV72 content was enough high to be visible on the SDS gel with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2, lane 1). The result indicates that the pure PAC vesicles contain PV72 as the fourth abundant protein of the vesiclesFigure 2Localization of PV72 in PAC vesicles that accumulate a proprotein precursor of 2S albumin, a seed storage protein.

PV72 is a type I integral membrane protein with EGF-like motifs (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows each construct of the modified proteins; rPV72 corresponds to the lumenal domain of PV72, rPV72Δ3 corresponds to the lumenal domain without the third EGF-like motif, rPV72Δ2,3 corresponds to the lumenal domain without the second and third EGF-like motifs, and rPV72Δ1,2,3 corresponds to the lumenal domain with no EGF-like motifs. These expressed proteins were purified with a chelating column and a gel filtration column. Each final preparation was highly pure as judged from SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 B). All of their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined to be RFVVEKNSLK, which corresponds to the N-terminal sequence of authentic pumpkin PV72 as reported by Shimada et al. (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The results indicate that a signal peptide of the expressed proteins is correctly processed on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. To investigate the binding ability of rPV72 to the ligand peptides, we performed a binding assay on the affinity column (2S-I column) that was conjugated with the 2S-I peptide, the internal propeptide of pumpkin 2S albumin. As shown in Fig. 4 A(upper), rPV72 bound to the 2S-I column and then eluted with EDTA (discussed below). Previously we reported that the isolated PV72 from the maturing seeds of pumpkin binds to the 2S-I peptide but not to the mutant peptide 2S-I/3G with GGG instead of RRE of the internal propeptide. To clarify the specificity of the binding of rPV72, we used another affinity column (2S-I/3G column) that was conjugated with the 2S-I/3G peptide. As shown in Fig. 4 A (lower), rPV72 did not bind to the 2S-I/3G column. The results indicate that the characteristics of rPV72 with respect to ligand binding were the same as those of the authentic PV72 has. To identify the ligand-binding region of PV72, we performed a surface plasmon resonance analysis for four modified PV72s with either the 2S-I sensor chip or 2S-I/3G sensor chip. Each modified PV72 of the same concentration was injected onto the sensor chips. rPV72 bound to the 2S-I peptide, but not to the 2S-I/3G peptide (Fig. 4 B), as expected from the result in Fig. 4 A. All of the deleted proteins, rPV72Δ3, rPV72Δ2,3, and rPV72Δ1,2,3, also bound to the 2S-I peptide, but not to the 2S-I/3G peptide (Fig. 4 B). This demonstrates that the deleted proteins also specifically recognize the RRE sequence of the 2S-I peptide as rPV72 does. These results indicated the N-terminal region of PV72 corresponding to rPV72Δ1,2,3 includes a ligand-binding site. We determined the kinetic parameters for the binding of each modified rPV72 to the 2S-I peptide by surface plasmon resonance. Each modified rPV72 was injected onto the 2S-I sensor chip to start the association reaction. Fig.5 A shows the association and dissociation curves obtained from the respective experiment with four different concentrations (0.07–2 μm) of each protein. The sensorgrams of rPV72Δ3, rPV72Δ2,3, and rPV72Δ1,2,3 exhibited more rapid association followed by more rapid dissociation after the injection was completed than did the sensorgram of rPV72. The kinetic constants of association and dissociation were calculated from the slopes of the curves, as shown in Fig. 5 B. In contrast to small differences of the k a values among the modified rPV72, large differences of the k dvalues were observed. The k d value of each of rPV72Δ3, rPV72Δ2,3, and rPV72Δ1,2,3 was 16–23-fold higher than the k d value of rPV72. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was determined from the ratio of these two kinetic constants (k d/k a). rPV72 has a high enough affinity for the 2S-I peptide (K D= 0.2 μm) to function as a receptor. TheK D values of each of rPV72Δ3, rPV72Δ2,3, and rPV72Δ1,2,3 were 10-, 19-, and 21-fold higher than theK d value of rPV72, respectively. Therefore, the affinity of rPV72 for the ligand peptide is much higher than the affinities of the rPV72s lacking the EGF-like motifs. It seems likely that the EGF-like motifs play a role in stabilizing the receptor-ligand complex. The question is how the EGF-like motifs regulate the stability of the ligand binding of PV72. Previously, we found that the third EGF-like motif has a consensus sequence for Ca2+binding, while the first and second motifs do not have such a sequence (26Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that rPV72 was eluted from the 2S-I column by the addition of chelating agents. This implied that Ca2+ binding to the third EGF-like motif might be important for the ligand binding. To clarify the requirement of Ca2+, we performed an analysis of surface plasmon resonance with rPV72 in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. Fig.6 A (left) shows that the interaction between rPV72 and the ligand was observed in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of Mg2+ instead of Ca2+. This result indicates that Ca2+ is required for PV72 to interact with the 2S-I peptide. Unexpectedly, however, rPV72Δ1,2,3, which lacks the EGF-like motifs, also showed a Ca2+-dependent interaction with the 2S-I peptide, but not a Mg2+-dependent interaction (Fig. 6 A, right), as rPV72 did. This result indicates that the N-terminal region corresponding to rPV72Δ1,2,3 has another Ca2+-binding site (s), although no consensus sequence for Ca2+ binding was found in the region. It should be noted that the affinity of PV72 (K D = 0.2 μm) was 20-fold stronger than that of rPV72Δ1,2,3 (K D = 4.2 μm). Thus, the Ca2+-binding to the EGF-like motif must be required for the high affinity of PV72 for the ligand. The next question raised is whether the Ca2+ binding causes a conformational change of PV72 that results in the higher affinity. To answer the question, we measured Ca2+-dependent changes in the fluorescence emission"

In the present study, the role of Arg117 was investigated in wild-type cationic Tg and in the activation-resistant Lys15 → Gln mutant (K15Q-Tg), in which Tg-specific properties of Arg117 can be examined selectively. We found that trypsinolytic cleavage of the Arg117-Val118 bond did not proceed to completion, but due to trypsin-catalyzed re-synthesis an equilibrium was established between intact Tg and its cleaved, two-chain form. In the absence of Ca2+, at pH 8.0, the hydrolysis equilibrium (K hyd = [cleaved Tg]/[intact Tg]) was 5.4, whereas 5 mm Ca2+ reduced the rateof cleavage at Arg117 at least 20-fold, and shiftedK hyd to 0.7. These observations indicate that the Arg117-Val118 bond exhibits properties analogous to the reactive site bond of canonical trypsin inhibitors and suggest that this surface loop might serve as a low affinity inhibitor of zymogen activation. Consistent with this notion, autoactivation of cationic Tg was inhibited by the cleaved form of K15Q-Tg, with an estimated K i of 80 μm, while no inhibition was observed with K15Q-Tg carrying the Arg117→ His mutation. Finally, zymogen breakdown due to other trypsinolytic pathways was shown to proceed almost 2000-fold slower than cleavage at Arg117. Taken together, the findings suggest two independent, successively functional trypsin-mediated mechanisms against pathological Tg activation in the pancreas. At low trypsin concentrations, cleavage at Arg117 results in inhibition of trypsin, whereas high trypsin concentrations degrade Tg, thus limiting further zymogen activation. Loss of Arg117-dependent trypsin inhibition can contribute to the development of hereditary pancreatitis associated with the Arg117 → His mutation.

Although the precise mechanisms leading to pancreatitis have not been unraveled, increased Tr activity in the pancreas due to altered properties of mutant Tg/Tr emerged as a generally accepted model. Consequently, the biochemical defects, gain or loss of function, caused by mutations of Arg117 and Asn21 have been the target of intense research in recent years. Early studies used recombinant rat anionic Tg as a model for human cationic Tg (15Várallyai É. Pál G. Patthy A. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Experiments using these recombinant cationic Tg preparations have addressed four major aspects of Tg/Tr biochemistry, with the following developments: (i) Autocatalytic degradation (autolysis) of Tr was inhibited by mutations R117H (20Sahin-Tóth M.

(ii) Autocatalytic activation (autoactivation) of Tg was enhanced by all four mutations (N21T, N21I, R117H, R117C) studied so far (3Simon, P., Weiss, U.

Interestingly, increased autoactivation of N21I was prominent only at pH 5.0. A study using model peptides corresponding to the N terminus of Tg suggested that the rare K15R and D14G mutations might also increase Tg autoactivation (12Teich N. Ockenga J. Hoffmeister A. Manns M. Mössner J. Keim V. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), however, supporting data on recombinant enzymes are still lacking. (iii) Cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is believed to be responsible for initiating zymogen activation in animal models of experimental pancreatitis (see Ref. 23Halangk M.W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, and references therein). It was reported (22Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that the N21I cationic Tg mutant was activated almost 3-fold faster by cathepsin B than wild-type Tg, even in the presence of pancreatic secretory Tr inhibitor (PSTI). However, these observations could not be independently confirmed, because in more recent experiments mutants N21I, R117H, R117C and wild-type Tg exhibited no appreciable differences in activation by cathepsin B (3Simon, P., Weiss, U. F., Sahin-Tóth, M., Perry, M., Nayler, O., Lenfers, B., Schnekenburger, J., Mayerle, J., Domschke, W., and Lerch, M. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). 2Z. Kukor, M. Tóth, and M. Sahin-Tóth, unpublished observations. 2Z. Kukor, M. Tóth, and M. Sahin-Tóth, unpublished observations. (iv) The ability of PSTI to inhibit the N21I Tr mutant was also investigated, but no difference was found when compared with wild-type Tr (22Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, the bulk of evidence suggests that increased autoactivation is a common mechanism by which HP-associated mutations can lead to pathological Tr accumulation in the pancreas. In addition, Tr stabilization appears to be an accessory pathway, associated with mutations R117H, R117C, and N21T. Although it is now generally accepted that HP mutations lead to a gain of function, a recent report (3Simon, P., Weiss, U. F., Sahin-Tóth, M., Perry, M., Nayler, O., Lenfers, B., Schnekenburger, J., Mayerle, J., Domschke, W., and Lerch, M. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar) challenged this notion by demonstrating that almost 70% of mutant R117C was misfolded and inactive after recombinant expression andin vitro refolding. It remains unclear, however, whether or not the same folding defect is manifested in vivo. In any event, the correctly folded fraction of the R117C mutant exhibited gain-of-function properties that were similar to those of the R117H mutant. Despite considerable progress in the field, the mechanism(s) by which the mutations cause the described functional changes are still unclear. In the present study, we set out to investigate the role Arg117 might play in Tg activation and how mutations in Arg117 can enhance zymogen activation. Unexpectedly, we found that Tr not only cleaved the Arg117-Val118 bond but also re-synthesized it until an equilibrium was reached between the cleaved and intact Tg forms. These properties of Arg117 resemble the reactive site of reversible canonical protease inhibitors (24Laskowski M., Jr. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and suggest that Arg117 plays an inhibitory role in controlling zymogen activation in the pancreas. Evidence to support this notion is presented here, and a model describing the dual role of Tr in protecting against pathological Tg activation is discussed. In this article the classic chymotrypsin numbering was used to denote amino acid residues in the human cationic Tg sequence. In more recent genetic and clinical literature the actual Tg sequence numbering has been used by convention (25Chen J.M. Ferec C. Pfützer R.H. Whitcomb D.C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 277-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the chymotrypsin numbering system Asp14, Lys15, Asn21, Arg117, Val118, Lys188, and Asp189 correspond to Tg residues Asp22, Lys23, Asn29, Arg122, Val123, Lys193, and Asp194, respectively. Following the designation of cleaved canonical protease inhibitors (24Laskowski M., Jr. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the two-chain autolyzed form of Tg with the Arg117-Val118 bond cleaved was denoted here as Tg*. In previous studies bovine Tg and Tr, autolyzed at the Arg117-Val118 bond, were also named Val-neotrypsinogen (26Higaki J.N. Light A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or δ-trypsin (27Kumazaki T. Ishii S.-I. J. Biochem. 1979; 85: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), respectively. Mutant K15Q was constructed in the previously described pTrap-T7 expression plasmid (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide linker encoding the mutation was ligated into the NcoI andEcoRI sites. Mutant K15Q/R117H was created by subcloning theEcoRI-SacI fragment from the pTrap-T7/R117H plasmid (20Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) into the pTrap-T7/K15Q plasmid. Small scale expression of Tg was carried out essentially as previously reported (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For larger scale expression, 800-ml cultures of Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) cells harboring pTrap-T7 with given Tg constructs were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A 600 nm of 0.5, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 5 h. Rosetta(DE3) host strains are BL21(DE3) derivatives designed to enhance the expression of eukaryotic proteins that contain codons rarely used in Escherichia coli. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 60 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm K-EDTA, and disrupted by one passage through a French press cell at 25,000 p.s.i. Inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 25 ml of 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA. Solubilization and in vitro refolding of Tg was performed as described previously (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,22Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol.

The properly folded Tg was finally purified on an ecotin affinity column, as described (18Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Concentrations of zymogen solutions were measured from their ultraviolet absorbance using a calculated extinction coefficient of 36,160 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Tg yields were lower than previously reported (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), typically 2–4 mg of purified zymogen per liter culture. Wild-type Tg was allowed to autoactivate in 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), at 37 °C for 2 h. K15Q-Tg was digested with cationic Tr at a ratio of ∼1:250 Tr to K15Q-Tg in 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were immediately loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Tg and Tg* were eluted and separated from each other with 25 ml of a 0–0.5m linear gradient of NaCl. Under these conditions Tr did not bind to the column and was recovered in the flow-through. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing Tg* or K15Q-Tg* were pooled and dialyzed against 1 mm HCl overnight. Human cationic Tg (2 μmfinal concentration in 100-μl final volume) was incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) or 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 where indicated. At given times 2.5-μl aliquots were removed for Tr activity assays. Tr activity was determined using the synthetic chromogenic substrateN-carbobenzyloxy-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (200 μm final concentration). Kinetics of the chromophore release was followed at 405 nm in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, at 22 °C. Where indicated, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge at 4 °C. Laemmli sample buffer (20 μl), NaOH (1 μl, 2 n), and dithiothreitol (2 μl, 1 m) were added, and samples were denatured at 90 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation was performed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R for 30 min and destained with 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid overnight. Gels were dried between two layers of cellophane according to instructions of the Gel-Dry (Invitrogen) gel drying kit. Dried gels were scanned at 600 d.p.i. resolution in gray-scale mode, and images were saved as TIFF files. Quantitation of gel bands was carried out with the ImageQuaNT 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics) software. Rectangles were drawn around each band of interest, and an identical rectangle was used in each lane for background subtraction. The gel image in Fig.1 demonstrates the time course of activation of Tg with Tr, in 5 mm Ca2+ at pH 8.0, 37 °C. Conversion of Tg to Tr upon cleavage after Lys15 is indicated by a mobility shift on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (band Tg → band Tr), because Tr migrates faster than Tg under these electrophoretic conditions. In addition to activation, Tr cleaves Tg also at the Arg117-Val118 autolytic peptide bond, resulting in the appearance of band A on reducing gels. As we demonstrated previously (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), band A corresponds to a mixture of two co-migrating polypeptides with nearly identical sizes, namely the N- and C-terminal fragments of autolyzed Tg. This two-chain form of Tg with the Arg117-Val118 bond cleaved will be referred to as Tg* in this report. Tg* is also activated by Tr, which is evidenced by the appearance of band B on reducing gels.Band B is generated from band A by removal of the activation peptide from the N-terminal Tg* fragment. Thus, band B corresponds to the N-terminal fragment of two-chain, Arg117-cleaved Tr (Tr*). Note that the two chains in Tg* and Tr* are held together by a disulfide bond and they only separate under the reducing conditions used for SDS-PAGE gel analysis. We observed that Tr-catalyzed activation of Tg* seemed to proceed slower than Tr-catalyzed activation of intact Tg. Thus, band B always emerged later in the time course and was noticeably lighter in intensity than the Tr band (Fig. 1). This observation led to the hypothesis that cleavage of Tg at Arg117 hinders Tg activation, as we first believed due to a conformational change in the Tg structure. To test this assumption, we isolated Tg* using anion-exchange chromatography, and compared its activation properties to intact wild-type Tg. Tg* was generated from wild-type Tg by limited autoactivation of Tg in the absence of Ca2+. As we demonstrated previously (19Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), under these conditions Tg is cleaved predominantly after Arg117, whereas cleavage after Lys15 is suppressed. Thus, the major product is Tg* and only small amounts of Tr are generated. Tg* was then separated on a MonoQ column at alkaline pH, where it eluted after the intact Tg peak (Fig. 2). The gel inset indicates the purity of these preparations, which was greater than >95%, with small amounts of intact Tg present. Although data are not shown, when the activation process was followed by measuring Tr activity, we did not observe any appreciable differences between the activation characteristics of intact Tg and Tg*. Enterokinase or Tr activated both Tg forms at comparable rates, and Ca2+dependence of autoactivation was indistinguishable. These observations did not support our original hypothesis and indicated that cleavage of Tg at Arg117 had no direct effect on Tg activation. Furthermore, enzyme kinetic parameters of Tr and Tr* were essentially identical, in agreement with previous reports that cleavage of the Arg117-Val118 bond in bovine (28Maroux S. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 181: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or porcine (29Ru B.G., Du, J.Z. Zeng Y.H. Chen L.S., Ni, Y.S. Tan G.H. Zhang L.X. Sci. Sin. 1980; 23: 1453-1460PubMed Google Scholar) Tr has no obvious functional consequences. However, when the time course of autoactivation was followed on SDS-PAGE gels an unexpected observation was made. As shown in Fig.3 A, at pH 8.0, in 5 mm Ca2+, the majority of Tg* was converted back to intact Tg and activated to intact Tr. Attempts to extend these observations revealed that experiments with wild-type Tg and Tr were difficult to interpret quantitatively. Due to the continuous conversion of Tg to Tr, concentrations of substrate (Tg) and enzyme (Tr) were constantly changing during the reaction. In addition, Tr can cleave the Arg117-Val118 bond not only in Tg but also in Tr. This latter process is also reversible due to the re-synthesis of the Arg117-Val118 bond in Tr* (not shown). In the present study we focused selectively on the interaction of Tr with Tg, and the role of Arg117 in Tg. Similar experiments on the properties of Arg117 in Tr will be presented elsewhere. To gain deeper insight into the extraordinary phenomenon of Tr-catalyzed re-synthesis of Tg*, an activation-resistant Tg mutant was constructed, where Lys15 in the activation peptide was mutated to Gln (K15Q-Tg). In this zymogen, Arg117 is the only readily accessible trypsinolytic site, and thus its properties can be selectively studied. A two-chain form of K15Q-Tg cleaved between Arg117 and Val118 (K15Q-Tg*) was also isolated, as described above. When this Tg preparation was treated with cationic Tr, time-dependent re-synthesis of the intact single-chain form was evident, without any significant degradation (Fig.3 B). No re-synthesis was observed in the absence of Tr or with the catalytically incompetent S195A Tr mutant. As shown in Fig.3 C, the re-synthesis did not proceed to completion, but an apparent equilibrium was reached between intact Tg and Tg* with a hydrolysis equilibrium of 0.73 (K hyd = [Tg*]/[Tg]), corresponding to a ratio of ∼40% Tg* to 60% Tg. When intact K15Q-Tg was digested with catalytic amounts (∼1:160 ratio) of cationic Tr in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 8.0, rapid cleavage at Arg117 was evident (Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, digestion remained incomplete over the entire time course, as a stable equilibrium was reached between the predominant cleaved form (∼85%) and the remaining intact K15Q-Tg (∼15%), yielding a K hyd of 5.4. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ reduced the rate of cleavage at Arg117 significantly. Estimation of the relative rates by comparing the initial segments of digestion kinetics obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A) or in 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4 D) indicated an at least 20-fold decrease (Fig. 4 E). In addition, Ca2+ also lowered the K hyd values from 5.4 to 0.96 and 0.7 in 0.1 mm Ca2+ (Fig.4 B) and 0.5 mm Ca2+ (Fig.4 C), respectively. It is also apparent from Fig.4 E that in 5 mm Ca2+ an equilibrium was not reached during the time course studied. When digestions in 5 mm Ca2+ were carried out with higher Tr concentrations (Fig. 5), an equilibrium could be demonstrated with a K hyd of 0.7, a value that was essentially identical with that observed in the re-synthesis experiments in Fig. 3. It is noteworthy that theK hyd value remained constant when concentrations of Ca2+ were increased from 0.5 to 5 mm, although the rate of cleavage at Arg117 was further depressed, and the same equilibrium state was reached much slower. It must also be emphasized that in these experiments Tr behaved only as a catalyst facilitating the development of the hydrolysis equilibrium between the intact and Arg117-cleaved forms of K15Q-Tg. Consequently, given sufficient time, similar equilibrium states were reached regardless of the Tr concentration present in the incubation mixtures (data not shown).Figure 5Digestion of the Arg117-Val118 bond in K15Q-Tg in 5 mm Ca2+.

However, with the structures has come the realization that the static models do not provide all the information needed to understand mechanism at a deeper level. The reactions of greatest interest are the proton-coupled electron transfers at the quinone-processing sites. In particular, oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo-site of the complex is the key reaction of the Q-cycle, providing the bifurcation of electron transfer between two different acceptor chains that allows coupling to proton transfer. The Qo-site of the mitochondrial complex, and its mechanism, are also of central importance to the physiology of cellular damage and aging, because it is a major site for generation of reactive oxygen species.To understand the mechanism, we need detailed information about the local reaction environment, including protein structure, hydrogen bonding, and distances, to provide the parameters that control rates, and partitioning of electrons to different pathways. Of the five well characterized paramagnetic centers of the bc 1complex that are formed during different partial reactions, the most studied is the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), the EPR signal of which was found to vary with the redox state of the quinone pool, and inhibitor occupancy of the Qo-site (13Ding H.

However, with the structures has come the realization that the static models do not provide all the information needed to understand mechanism at a deeper level. The reactions of greatest interest are the proton-coupled electron transfers at the quinone-processing sites. In particular, oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo-site of the complex is the key reaction of the Q-cycle, providing the bifurcation of electron transfer between two different acceptor chains that allows coupling to proton transfer. The Qo-site of the mitochondrial complex, and its mechanism, are also of central importance to the physiology of cellular damage and aging, because it is a major site for generation of reactive oxygen species. To understand the mechanism, we need detailed information about the local reaction environment, including protein structure, hydrogen bonding, and distances, to provide the parameters that control rates, and partitioning of electrons to different pathways. Of the five well characterized paramagnetic centers of the bc 1complex that are formed during different partial reactions, the most studied is the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), the EPR signal of which was found to vary with the redox state of the quinone pool, and inhibitor occupancy of the Qo-site (13Ding H.

https://openalex.org/W2052051648,"Small GTPases of the Ras family are major players of signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. They receive signals from a number of receptors and transmit them to a variety of effectors. The distribution of signals to different effector molecules allows for the generation of opposing effects like proliferation and differentiation. To understand the specificity of Ras signaling, we investigated the activation of RalGDS, one of the Ras effector proteins with guanine-nucleotide exchange factor activity for Ral. We determined the GTP level on RalA and showed that the highly conserved Ras binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS, which mediates association with Ras, is important but not sufficient to explain the stimulation of the exchange factor. Although a point mutation in the RBD of RalGDS, which abrogates binding to Ras, renders RalGDS independent to activated Ras, an artificially membrane-targeted version of RalGDS lacking its RBD could still be activated by Ras. The switch II region of Ras is involved in the activation, because the mutant Y64W in this region is impaired in the RalGDS activation. Furthermore, it is shown that Rap1, which was originally identified as a Ras antagonist, can block Ras-mediated RalGDS signaling only when RalGDS contains an intact RBD. In addition, kinetic studies of the complex formation between RalGDS-RBD and Ras suggest that the fast association between RalGDS and Ras, which is analogous to the Ras/Raf case, achieves signaling specificity. Conversely, the Ras x RalGDS complex has a short lifetime of 0.1 s and Rap1 forms a long-lived complex with RalGDS, possibly explaining its antagonistic effect on Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1987592746,"In vitrotranscription of lonD, a heat-shock gene fromMyxococcus xanthus, was stimulated in the presence of extract from heat-shocked cells. For this stimulation the upstream promoter region of lonD was found to be essential. Activation of lonD transcription was also observed when extract from non-heat-shocked cells was heat treated in vitro at 42 °C for 10 min. A DNA binding assay and footprinting analysis revealed that a factor(s) binds to the upstream region from −122 to −107 with respect to the transcription initiation site. This region was required for heat-shock induction oflonD expression both in vitro and in vivo. The lonD promoter-binding protein named HsfA was purified, and its gene was cloned. Analysis of the DNA sequence reveals that HsfA is a response regulator of the two-component system and shows high sequence similarity to the NtrC family or the enhancer-binding proteins. Upstream of hsfA, a gene encoding a histidine kinase was identified and named hsfB. HsfB was found to be autophosphorylated and able to phosphorylate HsfA.

HsfA with HsfB activated in vitro transcription oflonD in a manner dependent on RNA polymerase containing SigA, the housekeeping sigma factor of M. xanthus. The major pathway of signal transduction required for response and adaptation to environmental changes in prokaryotes consists of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system (1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). This system basically utilizes two protein components, a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. Sensors typically contain a C-terminal transmitter module or a histidine kinase domain coupled to an N-terminal input domain. Response regulators typically contain an N-terminal receiver domain coupled to a C-terminal output domain. The mechanisms of transmitter-receiver communication involve phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Transmitters or histidine kinases have an autokinase activity that phosphorylates a specific histidine residue in the presence of ATP. The product phosphohistidine serves as a high energy intermediate for subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to a specific aspartate residue in the receiver domain. Response regulators become active upon receiving the phosphate group and generally function as transcription factors for cognate gene expression.Among various stress responses, the heat-shock response is the most extensively studied. Transcription of heat-shock genes is regulated in different fashions in bacteria (2Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

Morita M.T. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar). In addition to RpoH, RNAP containing RpoE (ςE, ς24) transcribes other heat-shock genes that are induced at higher temperature (50 °C) (2Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1382-1399Google Scholar,5Yura T. Kanemori M. Morita M.T. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis utilizes rather complex mechanisms for heat-shock response transcription. Heat-shock genes are classified into four groups (Class I–IV) (3Hecker M. Schumann W. Volker U. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 4Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Class I and III genes are negatively regulated by the CIRCE element and HrcA, and in tandem repeated DNA sequences and CtsR, respectively. Class II genes are transcribed by RNAP containing an alternative sigma factor, SigB. The mechanism for transcription of Class IV genes is not known. Both RpoH-driven transcription and negative regulation by CIRCE and HrcA are found inBradyrhizobium japonicum (4Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, another type of negative regulation controls some heat-shock genes by ROSE, a DNA element of approximately 100 bp in length and a putative repressor (4Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative bacterium that can differentiate through fruiting body formation into spores upon starvation (6Dworkin M.

It was found that M. xanthus contains at least eight sigma factor genes, sigA (8Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 80-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sigB(9Apelian D. Inouye S.

SigB, SigC, and SigE show sequence similarity to RpoH. However, they are not induced by heat-shock, and even the triple deletion of these genes does not affect production of heat-shock proteins by heat-shock (12Ueki T. Inouye S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 287-293PubMed Google Scholar).To understand heat-shock response transcription in M. xanthus, we first identified the lonD gene as a heat-shock gene. The lonD gene has been shown to be essential for M. xanthus fruiting body development (16Gill R.E. Karlok M. Benton D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4538-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tojo N. Inouye S. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4545-4549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the lonD gene, we have purified a DNA-binding protein specific to the lonD promoter. This DNA-binding protein belongs to the NtrC family or enhancer-binding proteins. Subsequent analysis revealed that a histidine kinase is also involved inlonD expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsM. xanthus DZF1 was grown in CYE liquid medium (18Campos J.M.

Exponentially growing cells (Klett units of 80) at 30 °C were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 10 min. Cell extracts were prepared as described by Gross et al. (22Gross C.A. Engbaek F. Flammang T.

The precipitates were suspended in the buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Roche), and 0.1 m KCl. This extract is referred to as AS fraction.In Vitro TranscriptionTwo different templates contain the lonD promoter region from the −346 base to the +96 base (plonD346) and from −41 to +96 (plonD41) for in vitro transcription analysis. Thein vitro transcription reaction was carried out in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 μm NTPs, and 0.5 unit/μl RNase inhibitor (Roche)) containing 0.5 mg/ml plasmid DNA templates in a 40-μl total volume. The reaction buffer was first incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Then 2 mg/ml AS fraction was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. When purified proteins were used, HsfB was first incubated in the buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP for 2 min at 30 °C, then HsfA was added and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C; RNAP containing SigA was added, and incubation was continued for another 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of stop solution (1 m ammonium acetate, 40 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mg/ml tRNA). The mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and transcripts were precipitated with ethanol. Transcripts were resuspended in distilled water and analyzed by primer extension analysis as described previously (11Ueki T. Inouye S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).DNA Binding Assay and Footprinting AnalysisPlasmid plonD(346–42) containing the lonD promoter region from the −346 base to the −42 base was prepared for the DNA binding assay. The DNA fragments were prepared by digesting plonD(346–42) with proper enzymes and purified with 5% polyacrylamide gel. The enzymes used for each experiment are described in the text or figure legends. The DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow fragment.DNA binding assays were performed in 10 μl of the reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA fragments, and 50 μg of extracts. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide; binding patterns were analyzed by autoradiography. Footprinting was carried out by using 1,10-phenanthroline-copper as described by Kuwabara and Sigman (23Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Purification of the lonD Promoter-binding Protein, HsfA, from M. xanthusM. xanthus DZF1 cells were grown exponentially (up to Klett units of ≈80) in 1 liter of CYE liquid medium at 30 °C and heat-shocked at 42 °C for 20 min. Heat-shocked cells were prepared from total 10-liter cultures. AS fraction was prepared as described above except that precipitates obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation were suspended in TGED buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Roche)). AS fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) equilibrated with TGED buffer. HsfA was eluted with TGED buffer containing 0.1m KCl (TGED0.1K). The activity of HsfA was detected by DNA binding assay. The eluate was applied to a heparin-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with TGED0.1K. The column was washed with TGED0.1K and eluted in the stepwise manner. HsfA was eluted with TGED0.5K. The eluate was diluted with 4 volumes of TGED and subjected to the lonD promoter-specific DNA affinity column chromatography. The DNA affinity column was prepared as described previously (24Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing the HsfA recognition sequences from −128 to −105, 5′GCTAGGGGGGCGATCATGCCCCAC3′ and 5′TAGCGTGGGGCATGATCGCCCCCC3′, were used for preparation of the column. The diluted eluate was mixed with poly(dI·dC) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The mixture was applied to the DNA affinity column equilibrated with TGED0.1K. The column was washed with TGED0.1K and eluted in a stepwise manner. HsfA was eluted with TGED0.3K. The eluate was diluted with 2 volumes of TGED, mixed with poly(dI·dC), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The mixture was applied again to the DNA affinity column equilibrated with TGED0.1K. Wash and elution were performed as described above. HsfA was nearly homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis using silver staining (see Fig. 5).The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was determined at the synthesizing/sequencing facility of Princeton University.Purification of RNAP Containing SigAAS fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with TGED0.1K. The column was washed with TGED0.1K and stepwise eluted. RNAP was eluted with TGED0.3K. This eluate was diluted with 2 volumes of TGED and applied to a heparin-agarose column equilibrated with TGED0.1K. The column was washed with TGED0.1K and stepwise eluted. RNAP was eluted with TGED0.5K. The eluate was diluted with 4 volumes of TGED and applied to a DNA-cellulose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The column was washed with TGED0.1K and stepwise eluted. RNAP containing SigA was eluted with TGED0.5K.Purification of Recombinant ProteinsHsfAThe hsfA gene was cloned in pET24b (Novagen) (designated pET24bhsfA). pET24bhsfA was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3), and the hsfA gene was overexpressed with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in TGED0.1K, and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The lysate was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column. The rest of procedure is same as described above.HsfBThe hsfB gene was overexpressed as described above. Because HsfB was produced as inclusion bodies, the precipitates from the lysate were obtained by centrifugation. The precipitates were then resuspended in TGED0.1K containing 8m urea. The sample was dialyzed against TGED0.1K containing 4 m urea, TGED0.1K containing 2 m urea, and TGED0.1K. The sample was cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with TGED0.1K. After washed with TGED0.1K, the column was eluted in the stepwise manner. HsfB was eluted with TGED0.3K.The HsfB kinase domain (Met174 to Pro527) and the HsfB receiver domain (initiation Met to Gln177) were purified as described for HsfB.In Vitro PhosphorylationAn in vitro phosphorylation reaction was performed in kination buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP). 10 μm HsfA and 10 μm HsfB were incubated in 20 μl of the kination buffer at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop solution (10% SDS, 0.4 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). The samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a new two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system that regulates expression of a heat-shock gene, lonD, inM. xanthus. This system consists of a response regulator, HsfA, and a hybrid histidine kinase, HsfB. HsfA also belongs to the NtrC family or enhancer-binding proteins. HsfB has a rather unusual domain organization and consists of a receiver domain at the N-terminal end and a kinase domain at the C-terminal end (Fig.8).Enhancer-binding proteins activate RNAP containing RpoN by binding promoter regions that are localized in tandem at >100 bp upstream with respect to the transcription initiation site (33Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34North A.K. Klose K.E. Stedman K.M. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4267-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Enhancer-binding proteins have ATPase activity that is required for transcriptional activation. A subgroup of enhancer-binding proteins including NtrC belongs to response regulators of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system. Therefore, it is regulated by a cognate sensor kinase, NtrB, in the case of NtrC. Although DNA binding of NtrC can be achieved in the absence of phosphorylation, only the phosphorylated form of NtrC is able to promote transcription. Phosphorylation is necessary for ATPase activity, oligomerization, and formation of an open transcriptional complex.We have demonstrated that extracts from both non-heat-shocked cells and heat-shocked cells possess DNA binding activity to the upstream promoter region of lonD, but that only the extract from heat-shocked cells is able to activate transcription in a manner dependent on the upstream promoter region of lonD. It was also found that transcriptional activity in the extract from non-heat-shocked cells is restored by in vitro heat treatment at 42 °C before transcription reaction, suggesting that a factor(s) in the extract can sense temperature shift and activate transcription of lonD.Furthermore, we showed that HsfA is phosphorylated in vitroby HsfB and that transcription of lonD is activated in the presence of HsfA and HsfB. Although the extract prepared from non-heat-shocked cells can become transcriptionally active afterin vitro heat-shock, purified HsfB was not activated by elevated temperature (data not shown). This suggests that HsfB is not the sensor kinase directly sensing heat-shock (this will be discussed later in detail). As mentioned above, two binding sites are usually found in the upstream promoter region of genes regulated by enhancer-binding proteins, whereas only one region (−122 to −107) was identified in the lonD promoter by DNA binding assay. When this region was mutated, no DNA binding activity was observed, and transcriptional activation was abolished both in vivo andin vitro. However, footprinting analysis exhibited another protected region. The latter region may be bound by HsfA only when it and the former region exist together. It is known that the enhancer-binding proteins typically activate transcription with RNAP containing RpoN. However, we performed in vitrotranscription with the major sigma factor, SigA, because thelonD promoter regions show higher similarity to ς70 consensus sequences than ς54 (Figs.1 C and 7 B). It was found that HsfA promoted transcription of lonD in vitro with RNAP/SigA. It has been reported that Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrC activates RNAP containing RpoD or ς70, the housekeeping sigma factor (39Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Although the upstream promoter region was shown to be necessary forin vivo heat-shock induction of lonD, in vitro transcription analysis showed an increase of transcripts by H-AS without the upstream promoter region of lonD. Because the −35/−10 promoter regions are recognized by RNAP/SigA, this increase may result from stabilization and/or modification of SigA in H-AS. RNAP/SigA in H-AS may be more active for the lonDpromoter because no difference by heat-shock was observed for in vitro transcription with the vegA promoter. Furthermore, it is possible that the 5′-TG-3′ sequence element located 1 base upstream from the −10 hexamer element of the lonDpromoter (indicated by a square in Fig. 1 C) provides a motif necessary for transcription initiation as found in some promoters of E. coli (44Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This 5′-TG-3′ element is not found in the vegA promoter. Therefore, this element may contribute to the increase of transcripts for lonD by heat-shock in vitro in the absence of the upstream promoter region and the HsfA/HsfB system. It has been demonstrated that some ofE. coli promoters are recognized in vitro by both RNAP containing RpoD and RpoS, the stationary phase sigma factor (ςS, ς38) (45Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, the increase in RpoS level is observed in E. coli when cells are exposed to heat-shock (46Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the M. xanthus stationary phase sigma factor, SigD (11Ueki T. Inouye S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), may be increased by heat-shock, and SigD may be able to recognize the lonDpromoter in vitro, resulting in the increase of transcripts with H-AS in the absence of the upstream promoter and the HsfA/HsfB system.The His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system consists of two basic components, a sensor kinase and a response regulator. However, recent studies have demonstrated that three or four components (or domains) are utilized in one phosphorelay signal transduction event in which a phosphate group is transferred from histidine → aspartate → histidine → aspartate (His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay) (47Appleby J.L. Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The first known phosphorelay was reported for regulation of initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis (48Perego M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 366-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This relay begins with autophosphorylation of one of three sensor kinases, KinA, KinB, or KinC. The phosphate group is then transferred to a response regulator, Spo0F. Spo0F serves as a phosphodonor for Spo0B. Finally, the phosphate group is passed from Spo0B to Spo0A, which regulates a number of genes involved in sporulation.Hybrid kinases with transmitter domains of sensor kinases and receiver domains of response regulators are usually found in His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay. A receiver domain is typically fused to a transmitter domain at the C terminus in hybrid kinases, but it also can be found at the N terminus as found in M. xanthus HsfB (this study), AsgA (37Plamann L., Li, Y. Cantwell B. Mayor J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and AsgD (38Cho K. Zusman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiaeosmoregulation is controlled by the Sln1p-Ypd1p-Ssk1p system (49Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The first two phosphorylation sites are located in the transmembrane hybrid kinase Sln1p. From Sln1p the phosphate group is transferred to Ypd1p, then to Ssk1p. Ssk1p modulates the downstream MAP kinase cascade. The BvgS-BvgA two-component system modulates regulation of virulence factors in Bordetella pertussis (50Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this system the first three steps of the four-step phosphorelay occur within the single protein BvgS. This pathway represents another organizational design. Furthermore, Ralstonia solanacearum utilizes in control of expression of virulence factors the PhcS-PhcR-OrfQ system in which the second and third phosphorylation sites appear to be located in the hybrid kinase PhcR (51Clough S.J. Lee K.-E. Schell M.A. Denny T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3639-3648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that PhcR has the same domain organization as HsfB. With these instances, it is tempting to speculate that there may exist a presently unidentified kinase (HsfX in Fig. 8) which functions as a temperature sensor and activates HsfB by phosphorylation of the receiver domain upon heat-shock because purified HsfB is not able to be activated by temperature shift in vitro and contains a receiver domain at the N terminus. However, we cannot exclude possibility that a factor(s) other than a sensor kinase may sense heat-shock and transduce signals to HsfB. For example, in control of nitrogen assimilation by the NtrB/NtrC system, protein II or PII functions as a sensory component responsible for sensing 2-ketoglutarate whose concentration reflects changes in the nitrogen status of the cell (52Rhee S.G. Park S.C. Koo J.H. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The present HsfA/HsfB system is the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system required for activation of a heat-shock gene and is also necessary for vegetative growth. Because lonD is dispensable for vegetative growth in M. xanthus (16Gill R.E. Karlok M. Benton D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4538-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tojo N. Inouye S. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4545-4549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the HsfA/HsfB system appears to regulate genes required for vegetative growth in addition to developmental genes such as lonD, an essential gene for fruiting body development (16Gill R.E. Karlok M. Benton D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4538-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tojo N. Inouye S. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4545-4549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major pathway of signal transduction required for response and adaptation to environmental changes in prokaryotes consists of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system (1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). This system basically utilizes two protein components, a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. Sensors typically contain a C-terminal transmitter module or a histidine kinase domain coupled to an N-terminal input domain. Response regulators typically contain an N-terminal receiver domain coupled to a C-terminal output domain. The mechanisms of transmitter-receiver communication involve phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Transmitters or histidine kinases have an autokinase activity that phosphorylates a specific histidine residue in the presence of ATP. The product phosphohistidine serves as a high energy intermediate for subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to a specific aspartate residue in the receiver domain. Response regulators become active upon receiving the phosphate group and generally function as transcription factors for cognate gene expression. Among various stress responses, the heat-shock response is the most extensively studied. Transcription of heat-shock genes is regulated in different fashions in bacteria (2Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C.

A soybean isoform of CaM, SCaM-4 (77% identical to human CaM) fails to activate MLCK, wheras SCaM-1 (90.5% identical to human CaM) is as effective as CaM. We exploited this difference to gain insights into the structural requirements in CaM for activation of MLCK. A chimera (domain I of SCaM-4 and domains II-IV of SCaM-1) behaved like SCaM4, and analysis of site-specific mutants of SCaM-1 indicated that K30E and G40D mutations were responsible for the reduction in activation of MLCK. Competition experiments showed that SCaM-4 binds to the CaM-binding site of MLCK with high affinity. Replacement of CaM in skinned smooth muscle by exogenous CaM or SCaM-1, but not SCaM-4, restored Ca2+-dependent contraction. K30E/M36I/G40D SCaM-1 was a poor activator of contraction, but site-specific mutants, K30E, M36I and G40D, each restored Ca2+-induced contraction to CaM-depleted skinned smooth muscle, consistent with their capacity to activate MLCK. Interpretation of these results in light of the high-resolution structures of (Ca2+)4-CaM, free and complexed with the CaM-binding domain of MLCK, indicates that a surface domain containing Lys30 and Gly40 and residues from the C-terminal domain is created upon binding to MLCK, formation of which is required for activation of MLCK. Interactions between this activation domain and a region of MLCK distinct from the known CaM-binding domain are required for removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site, i.e., activation of MLCK, or this domain may be required to stabilize the conformation of (Ca2+)4-CaM necessary for MLCK activation.

SCaM-1, SCaM-2, and SCaM-3 are similar to mammalian CaMs, whereas SCaM-4 and SCaM-5 are quite different.

The popular current theory of the mechanism of activation of MLCK by CaM involves the binding of Ca2+ to the four Ca2+-binding sites of CaM, which then interacts with and activates MLCK that is anchored via its N-terminal tail to actin (13Dabrowska R.

(Ca2+)4·CaM activates MLCK by inducing a conformational change that involves removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site, allowing access to the myosin substrate (11Allen B.G.

Activated MLCK phosphorylates the 20-kDa light chains of myosin II at Ser19, triggering cross-bridge cycling and the development of force (11Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 362-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The availability of the different plant CaM isoforms provides very useful tools for studying the mechanism of activation of MLCK and other CaM target enzymes. In this work, we exploited the existence of distinct plant isoforms of CaM, specifically SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 as well as chimeric and site-specific mutants of SCaM-1, to further our understanding of the mechanism whereby CaM activates MLCK in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We showed earlier that SCaM-1 behaves exactly like CaM in activation of MLCK, whereas SCaM-4 fails to activate the kinase (9Lee S.H. Johnson J.D. Walsh M.P. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C., Xu, A. Snedden W.A. Kosk-Kosicka D. Fromm H. Narayanan N. Cho M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we show that SCaM-4 behaves as a CaM antagonist, confirming earlier findings that binding of CaM to MLCK and activation of the enzyme are distinct events (18Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5608-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using a mutagenesis strategy based on the sequence differences between SCaM-4 and SCaM-1, we provide evidence that Lys30 and Gly40 play a key role in the activation process. Examination of the three-dimensional structures of free CaM and CaM bound to the CaM-binding domain of MLCK reveals that these side chains lie within a newly formed surface on CaM that is created as the protein binds to MLCK. Two mechanisms could explain these results: (i) saturation of the Ca2+-binding sites of CaM induces a conformational change in MLCK that permits interactions between this newly created surface on CaM and an unspecified region of the kinase distinct from the well known CaM-binding site, and these interactions are required for removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site; or (ii) the newly formed surface is required to stabilize the conformation of (Ca2+)4·CaM necessary for MLCK activation. SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as previously described (6Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J.

SCaM-1 mutants (K30E, M36I, G40D, and the triple mutant K30E/M36I/G40D, denoted SCaM-1-TM) were constructed from wild-type SCaM-1 cDNA by primer-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The cDNA encoding the SCaM-4111 chimera was generously provided by Dr. Moo Je Cho (Department of Biochemistry, Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Chinju, Korea). Myosin (19Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Science. 1981; 213: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and MLCK (20Ngai P.K. Carruthers C.A. Walsh M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were purified from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. The 20-kDa light chain of myosin (LC20) was isolated from purified myosin using a modification of the method of Hathaway and Haeberle (21Hathaway D.R. Haeberle J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as described by Weber et al. (22Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MLC-(11–23), a synthetic peptide substrate of MLCK corresponding to residues 11–23 of LC20 (KKRPQRATSNVFA), was synthesized in the Peptide Synthesis Core Facility at the University of Calgary. The purity of the peptide was >95% as determined by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography and amino acid analysis, and its concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Bovine brain CaM (bCaM) was purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Monoclonal anti-CaM antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. This antibody, which was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of CaM (residues 128–148), did not recognize SCaM-1 or SCaM-4. Polyclonal anti-CaM antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1:200 dilution. This antibody, which was raised against full-length CaM, cross-reacted with both SCaM-1 and SCaM-4. Polyclonal anti-LC20 antibody (22Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as the secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000. Triton X-100, Tween 20, and Tween 80 were purchased from Fisher, and trifluoperazine (TFP) was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. HEPES/Tyrode's buffer contained 137.0 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose (pH 7.4). Ca2+-free HEPES/Tyrode's buffer was composed of 140.6 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mmglucose (pH 7.4). Buffer A comprised 30 mm TES, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmK2EGTA, and 150 mm sucrose (pH 7.4).pCa 9 solution contained 20 mm TES, 4 mm K2EGTA, 5.83 mmMgCl2, 7.56 mm potassium propionate, 1 mm NaN3, 3.9 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 16.2 mmphosphocreatine, and 15 units/ml creatine kinase (pH 6.9). pCa 4.5 solution was composed of 20 mm TES, 4 mm CaEGTA, 5.66 mm MgCl2, 7.53 mm potassium propionate, 1 mm NaN3, 3.9 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mmdithioerythritol, 16.2 mm phosphocreatine, and 15 units/ml creatine kinase (pH 6.9). MLCK activity was assayed using either MLC-(11–23) or LC20 as substrate as follows. With MLC-(11–23) as substrate, MLCK (2 μg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 0.1 mm MLC-(11–23) in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm free CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼200 cpm/nmol). With LC20 as substrate, MLCK (0.05 μg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 10 μmLC20 in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm free CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼200 cpm/pmol) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of various forms of CaM (bCaM, SCaM-1, SCaM-4, SCaM-4111, and various site-specific mutants of SCaM-1). Reactions were started by addition of radiolabeled ATP and stopped by spotting 20 μl of the reaction mixture on squares (1 × 1 cm) of phosphocellulose P-81 paper (Whatman) and immersing in a beaker containing 0.5% (v/v) H3PO4. P-81 papers were washed with 3 × 500 ml of 0.5% (v/v) H3PO4 (5 min each) and once with 500 ml of acetone (5 min) and air-dried, and 32P incorporation was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Independent experiments indicated that the phosphorylation of MLC-(11–23) and LC20 was linear for at least 15 min under the conditions used. The concentrations of stock solutions of LC20 were determined by quantification of maximal phosphorylation levels by incorporation of radiolabeled ATP and urea-glycerol gel electrophoresis (22Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The specific activity of MLCK was determined to be 1.1 ± 0.2 μmol of Pi/min/mg of MLCK (mean ± S.D., n = 4) with MLC-(11–23) as substrate and 10.3 ± 0.8 μmol of Pi/min/mg of MLCK (mean ± S.D., n = 4) with LC20 as substrate, and the K m of the kinase for MLC-(11–23) was determined to be 14 μm. MLCK had no activity in the absence of Ca2+. To determine the [Ca2+] dependence of activation of MLCK, the purified CaM isoforms were dialyzed exhaustively against deionized water, and the free [Ca2+] was controlled by adding a given amount of CaCl2 to 200 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 3 mmMgCl2 as previously described (23Kasturi R. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7958-7964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other conditions for these assays were as follows: 0.5 nm MLCK, 10 μm LC20, 0.2 mm[γ-32P]ATP (∼150 cpm/pmol), and 2 μmCaM. The Ca2+ stock solutions and Ca2+ buffer were calibrated by the Ca2+-dependent increase in Quin-2 fluorescence occurring at pCa 6.86 with a Hill coefficient of 1.0. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were killed by halothane inhalation and decapitation according to a research protocol consistent with the standards of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Care Committee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary. Excess adventitia and adipose tissue were dissected free from the tail artery in Ca2+-free HEPES/Tyrode's buffer. Segments of rat tail artery (RTA) were placed over a 0.31-mm needle and passed back and forth 40 times to remove the endothelium, prior to cutting into 6 × 1.5-mm helical strips and mounting on a Grass Model FTO3C isometric force transducer connected to a PowerLab eight-channel recording device (ADInstruments). Strips were mounted on the transducer with a resting tension of 0.45 g and incubated for 20 min in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer (bath volume = 0.8 ml). Tissues were stimulated three times with HEPES/Tyrode's buffer containing 87 mm KCl (the increase in [KCl] was balanced by a decrease in [NaCl]) with a 20-min interval of relaxation in Ca2+-free HEPES/Tyrode's buffer to achieve a stable contractile response to depolarization. Only the third K+-induced contraction is shown in Fig. 5. Following a 10-min relaxation period after removal of K+, muscle strips were incubated for 5 min in Ca2+-free HEPES/Tyrode's buffer and for 5 min in Buffer A and subsequently skinned (demembranated) by incubation for 2 h in Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. Skinned tissues were washed (3 × 5 min) in pCa 9 solution, followed by 30 min in pCa 4.5 solution to elicit a sustained Ca2+-induced contraction. Skinned muscle strips were then relaxed by incubation inpCa 9 solution for 10 min and washed (2 × 5 min) inpCa 9 solution. A second Ca2+-induced contraction was elicited as described above. During the plateau phase of this contraction (30 min after addition of Ca2+), TFP (0.4 mm) was added; and consequently, the muscle slowly relaxed. When force had declined to base line (within 30 min), tissues were washed (8 × 5 min) in pCa 9 solution. Transfer topCa 4.5 solution for 20 min then failed to elicit a contractile response. After returning to pCa 9 solution (2 × 5 min), the bathing solution was changed to the appropriate CaM isoform or mutant (1.87 μm) in pCa 9 solution or to pCa 9 solution alone; and 15 min later, any unbound CaM was washed out by incubation (3 × 5 min) inpCa 9 solution. Muscle strips were then incubated inpCa 4.5 solution for 30 min, followed by pCa 9 solution (3 × 5 min). Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of hCaM and two of the isoforms of soybean CaM, SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 (6Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). hCaM and SCaM-1 are 90.5% identical, and hCaM and SCaM-4 are 77% identical. We demonstrated previously that SCaM-1 is as potent as bCaM in activation of smooth muscle MLCK and activates MLCK to the same extent as bCaM: half-maximal activation of MLCK (K CaM) occurred at 1.7 nm bCaM with a Hill coefficient of 1.1 and at 1.8 nm SCaM-1, also with a Hill coefficient of 1.1, whereas SCaM-4 caused very little activation of MLCK even at 1 μm (Fig.2 A) (9Lee S.H. Johnson J.D. Walsh M.P. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C., Xu, A. Snedden W.A. Kosk-Kosicka D. Fromm H. Narayanan N. Cho M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in assays using MLC-(11–23) as substrate; in this case, half-maximal activation of MLCK occurred at 8 nm bCaM and 5 nm SCaM-1, and no activation was observed with SCaM-4. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 indicates that substitutions are scattered throughout the molecule, but more (five conservative and seven non-conservative) are found in the N-terminal domain (residues 1–46) (Fig. 1). Therefore, a chimera composed of the first Ca2+-binding domain of SCaM-4 (Ala1–Leu48) and the second, third, and fourth Ca2+-binding domains of SCaM-1 (Gln49–Lys148) was expressed and purified. This chimera (denoted SCaM-4111), like SCaM-4, effected little activation of MLCK (Fig. 2 A), indicating that substitutions in the N-terminal Ca2+-binding domain of SCaM-1 are responsible for the loss of activation by SCaM-4. To identify the specific amino acids in the N-terminal domain that are required for activation of MLCK, a triple mutant was prepared in which Lys30, Met36, and Gly40 of SCaM-1 were replaced by Glu, Ile, and Asp, respectively, as found in SCaM-4. This mutant (designated SCaM-1-TM) was a weak activator of MLCK, with aK CaM of 66 nm andV max 43% that of MLCK activated by bCaM or SCaM-1 (Fig. 2 A). To determine which of these residues are involved in activation of MLCK, individual site-specific mutants were expressed and purified, and their effects on MLCK activity were assayed (Fig. 2 B). M36I activated MLCK withK CaM (1.4 nm) andV max values similar to those observed with bCaM or SCaM-1. On the other hand, both the K30E and G40D mutants of SCaM-1 were relatively weak activators of MLCK, withK CaM values of 15 and 26 nm, respectively, and V max values 57 and 68%, respectively, that of MLCK activated by bCaM or SCaM-1 (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that Lys30 and Gly40 of bCaM and SCaM-1 play important roles in the activation of MLCK. The Ca2+ dependence of activation of MLCK by CaM and SCaM-1 was very similar, with half-maximal activation atpCa 6.13 and 6.20, respectively (Fig.3 A). The triple mutant of SCaM-1, which only partially activated MLCK, required a much higher [Ca2+] for activation, with half-maximal activation atpCa 5.0 (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that these mutations affect the affinity for Ca2+. The single mutation M36I had no significant effect on the Ca2+ dependence of activation of MLCK by this SCaM-1 mutant, which half-maximally activated MLCK at pCa 6.14, whereas both K30E and G40D mutations increased markedly the [Ca2+] required for half-maximal activation of MLCK (Fig. 3 B). In the case of the K30E mutant, half-maximal activation was achieved at pCa 5. 7. In the case of the G40D mutant, although a plateau was not reached, half-maximal activation occurred at pCa 3.6 because, as in every case, MLCK activity decreased above the free [Ca2+] of 0.5–1 mm (data not shown). The lack of activation of MLCK by SCaM-4 could be due to an inability to bind to the kinase or an inability to activate the kinase despite binding to it. These possibilities were addressed in competition assays with bCaM and SCaM-1. SCaM-4 (100 nm), which failed to activate MLCK (Fig. 2 A), shifted the CaM activation curve for MLCK significantly to the right. When these data were analyzed as Lineweaver-Burk plots, the slope, but not the y intercept, was affected by SCaM-4 (Fig.4 A). This indicates that SCaM-4 does indeed bind to MLCK and is a competitive inhibitor of the kinase with respect to bCaM. Addition of SCaM-4 to a fixed concentration of bCaM (1.7 nm) or SCaM-1 (1.8 nm), sufficient for half-maximal activation of MLCK, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of MLCK activity, confirming that SCaM-4 competitively inhibits MLCK activation by bCaM or SCaM-1 (Fig. 4 B). A K i of 31 nm and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 were obtained for inhibition of bCaM-mediated activation of MLCK. Similar values (K i = 33 nm and Hill coefficient = 1.1) were determined for SCaM-4-mediated inhibition of SCaM-1-induced activation of MLCK (Fig. 4 B). The fact that SCaM-4 binds to MLCK is consistent with the fact that, of the 12 substitutions in the N-terminal domain of SCaM-4 compared with CaM, only two of these side chains are involved in interaction with the CaM-binding domain,i.e. Glu11 and Met36 (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), which are conservatively substituted in SCaM-4 (Asp and Ile, respectively). The SCaM-4111 chimera was a less potent inhibitor of bCaM activation of MLCK, with a K i of 230 nm and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 (Fig. 4 B). CaM was selectively removed from Triton X-100-skinned RTA smooth muscle by treatment with the CaM antagonist TFP (Fig. 5). Addition of TFP at the peak of a Ca2+-induced contraction caused a reduction in tension to basal levels. The (Ca2+)4·CaM·TFP2 complex was then removed, and the tissue was washed extensively in the absence of Ca2+. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ failed to induce myosin phosphorylation or to evoke a contractile response due to the absence of CaM. Near complete extraction of tissue CaM was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig.6 A, lane 2) (25Wilson D.P. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. November 13, 2001; 277: 2186-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following the removal of endogenous CaM, bCaM (Fig. 5 a), SCaM-1 (Fig. 5 b), SCaM-4 (Fig. 5 c), or no CaM (Fig. 5 d) was added to the bathing medium in the absence of Ca2+, and excess unbound protein was washed out atpCa 9. The [Ca2+] was then increased topCa 4.5. bCaM (Fig. 5 a) and SCaM-1 (Fig.5 b) both evoked a contraction in the presence of Ca2+, but SCaM-4 (Fig. 5 c) failed to do so. Cumulative data shown in Fig. 5 e indicate the change in tension elicited by (i) K+ depolarization of intact tissue; (ii) addition of Ca2+ to Triton X-100-skinned muscle strips; (iii) Ca2+ addition following the removal of endogenous CaM by TFP; and (iv–vii) Ca2+ addition following the binding, in the absence of Ca2+, of bCaM, SCaM-1, SCaM-4, or no CaM, respectively. These results are consistent with the effects of these proteins on the activity of purified MLCK (see above). Western blotting confirmed that exogenous bCaM, SCaM-1, and SCaM-4 all bound to the skinned smooth muscle preparation in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 7 a, SCaM-1-TM caused a small and slow contraction, consistent with its very weak activation of MLCK. Subsequent addition of bCaM increased force, albeit slowly, probably due to competition between bCaM and SCaM-1-TM for binding to MLCK. On the other hand, the site-specific mutants K30E, M36I, and G40D were all capable of supporting Ca2+-induced contraction (Fig. 7, b–d), consistent with their ability to activate MLCK to a reasonable level. In these instances, subsequent addition of bCaM had no effect. Based on the results of Figs.2 B and 3 B, it might be assumed that the K30E and G40D mutants would be relatively poor activators of contraction. However, it is important to note that there is not a linear relationship between force and LC20 phosphorylation. In Triton X-100-skinned RTA smooth muscle, maximal tension is achieved at 0.15–0.2 mol of Pi/mol of LC20 (26Weber L.P. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Swärd K. Walsh M.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 573-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulative data shown in Fig. 7 e indicate the change in tension elicited by (i) K+ depolarization of intact tissue; (ii) addition of Ca2+ to Triton X-100-skinned muscle strips; and (iii–vii) Ca2+ addition following the replacement of endogenous CaM by SCaM-1-TM, K30E, M36I, G40D, or bCaM, respectively. The open bars indicate that subsequent addition of bCaM where indicated increased the force response to SCaM-1-TM, but not to K30E, M36I, or G40D. Additional experiments were carried out with Triton X-100-skinned porcine coronary arterial smooth muscle depleted of CaM by treatment with TFP in the presence of Ca2+. These results can be summarized as follows. SCaM-4 (10 μM) failed to elicit a contractile response in the presence of Ca2+, whereas SCaM-1 (1 μM) evoked a maximal contractile response, which was reversed by TFP. If SCaM-1 (1 μM) was added to CaM-depleted porcine coronary artery in the presence of SCaM-4 (10 μM), the magnitude of the Ca2+-induced contraction and the rate of contraction were significantly reduced, consistent with competition between SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 for binding to the same sites. If SCaM-1 (1 μM) was added first in the presence of Ca2+ to initiate a contraction and SCaM-4 (10 μM) was added at the plateau of force development in the continued presence of Ca2+, SCaM-4 did not induce relaxation, consistent with very tight binding of SCaM-1, as demonstrated previously for bCaM (25Wilson D.P. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. November 13, 2001; 277: 2186-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From a comparison of the MLCK-activating capacity of soybean CaM isoforms SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 as well as a chimera composed of Ca2+-binding domain I of SCaM-4 and domains II–IV of SCaM-1 and site-specific mutants within domain I, we conclude that Lys30 and Gly40 of CaM play a key role in activation of MLCK. The three-dimensional structures of several forms of CaM have been determined at high resolution by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; these include apoCaM (27Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), Ca2+-saturated CaM (28Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), and a complex of (Ca2+)4·CaM with a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of MLCK (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) (Fig.8). The binding of Ca2+ to CaM induced a significant conformational change (Fig. 8, compareA and B), but the molecule retained its characteristic dumbbell shape. In the presence of the CaM-binding peptide of MLCK, however, (Ca2+)4·CaM underwent a very dramatic change in conformation, wrapping around the peptide, with which it forms several side chain interactions, and forming a latch between the N- and C-terminal halves of CaM (Fig.8 C). One of the consequences of this dramatic conformational change is the formation of an exposed surface contributed by residues in helix II (Lys30, Thr34, Ser38, and Gly40) and helix VI (Thr110 and Lys115) (Fig. 8 C), which are far apart in the absence of the MLCK peptide (Fig. 8 B). Other side chains in helixes II and VI (Met36 and Leu112) project inwards toward the MLCK peptide and are directly involved in interactions with side chains of the peptide (24Meador W.E. Means A.R.

As we have shown, Lys30 and Gly40 play important roles in activation of MLCK because mutation to Glu and Asp, respectively, dramatically reduces the potency of activation of MLCK without affecting their interaction with the kinase. Mutation of Met36 to Ile, on the other hand, had no effect on binding to or activation of MLCK. We previously reported that a similar M36L mutation in bCaM had no effect on the V max of MLCK and caused a slight reduction in affinity for the enzyme (29Edwards R.A. Walsh M.P. Sutherland C. Vogel H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results are not surprising because Met36 interacts with side chains in the CaM-binding domain of the kinase (Fig.8 C) and the Met to Ile or Leu mutations represent conservative substitutions with retention of the bulky hydrophobic character. Our results indicate that the formation of the surface containing Lys30, Thr34, Ser38, Gly40, Thr110, and Lys115 is critical for the activation of MLCK, but not for binding to the enzyme. This conclusion supports the earlier observations that CaM mutants E14A/T34K/S38M (30VanBerkum M.F.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21488-21495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and T110Q/L112T/K115T (31Su Z. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16761-16765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bind to, but do not activate, MLCK. The E14A/T34K/S38M CaM mutant behaves, like SCaM-4, as a CaM antagonist, with a K i of 38 nm(30VanBerkum M.F.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21488-21495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); but the T110Q/L112T/K115T mutant is not a CaM antagonist (31Su Z. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16761-16765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An acidic cluster (EEQ, residues 6–8) near the N terminus has also been implicated as a requirement for maximal activation of MLCK because deletion of this tripeptide reduces the V max of smooth muscle MLCK by ∼50% (32Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The N terminus appears to facilitate movement of bound CaM away from the vicinity of the active site. The activation of MLCK by (Ca2+)4·CaM, in addition to interaction with the CaM-binding domain, involves a conformational change in the kinase that results in removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site (17Krueger J.K.

Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The surface between Lys30 and Gly40 (Fig. 8 C) may therefore interact with an unspecified region of MLCK distinct from the CaM-binding domain and trigger removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site. Mutations within this surface such as K30E and G40D could disrupt this interaction so that activation of MLCK is lost, but binding to the CaM-binding domain of MLCK is unaffected. This mechanism is consistent with the original proposal of Blumenthal and Stull (34Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), based on thermodynamic studies, that interactions between the external surface of CaM and skeletal muscle MLCK occur in addition to the interactions between CaM and the CaM-binding domain of the kinase and with the work of Su et al. (31Su Z. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16761-16765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing the importance of Thr110 and Lys115, which are also located in this surface or activation domain. An alternative mechanism is also possible whereby this activation domain may be required to stabilize the conformation of (Ca2+)4·CaM necessary for MLCK activation without directly interacting with the kinase. Our recent work has indicated that a distinct pool of cellular CaM is involved in activation of smooth muscle contraction (25Wilson D.P. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. November 13, 2001; 277: 2186-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This CaM is bound to the detergent-insoluble fraction, composed of the myofilaments and cytoskeleton, even in the absence of Ca2+. Consistent with these findings, it has been shown that the CaM-binding domain of MLCK can interact with apoCaM, albeit at low ionic strength (35Tsvetkov P.O. Protasevich I.I. Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lobachov V.M. Haiech J. Briand C. Makarov A.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 274: 18161-18164Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Steady-state Ca2+ titrations indicated that the affinity of the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites of CaM is markedly enhanced (K d = 1.1 × 10−7m) in the presence of the CaM-binding domain of MLCK (36Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M.P. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the resting level of the cytosolic free [Ca2+] in smooth muscle cells is 130–140 nm (37Williams D.A. Fay F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C779-C791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Williams D.A. Becker P.L. Fay F.S. Science. 1987; 235: 1644-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), this suggests that the contractile pool of CaM consists of a mixture of (Ca2+)0·CaM and (Ca2+)2·CaM, both of which are bound to, but do not activate, MLCK (18Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5608-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Wilson D.P. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which is itself anchored to the actin filament via its N-terminal tail (15Smith L., Su, X. Lin P.J. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following the increase in the cytosolic free [Ca2+] in response to contractile stimuli, Ca2+ diffuses to the myofilaments, where it binds to the two N-terminal Ca2+-binding sites on CaM as well as to any Ca2+-free C-terminal sites, inducing the conformational change that leads to formation of the surface containing Lys30 and Gly40. We therefore conclude that formation of this surface is critical for removal of the autoinhibitory domain from the active site, resulting in activation of the kinase. We are very grateful to Aalim Weljie for help with presentation of the CaM structures."

The characteristics and gene organization of barbiturase suggested that it is a novel zinc-containing amidohydrolase that should be grouped into a new family of the amidohydrolases superfamily. The amino acid sequence of barbiturase exhibited 48% identity with that of herbicide atrazine-decomposing cyanuric acid amidohydrolase but exhibited no significant homology to other proteins, indicating that cyanuric acid amidohydrolase may have evolved from barbiturase. A putative uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene was found upstream of the barbiturase gene, suggesting mutual interaction between pyrimidine biosynthesis and oxidative degradation. Metal analysis with an inductively coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrophotometer revealed that barbiturase contains ∼4.4 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme. The homotetrameric enzyme had K m and V maxvalues of 1.0 mm and 2.5 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, for barbituric acid. The enzyme specifically acted on barbituric acid, and dihydro-l-orotate, alloxan, and cyanuric acid competitively inhibited its activity. The full-length gene encoding the barbiturase (bar) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli.

In a biological system, pyrimidines are metabolized through either a reductive or an oxidative pathway (1Vogels G.D. Van Der Drift C. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 403-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wasternack C. Biochem. Physiol. Pflanz. 1978; 173: 371-403Crossref Google Scholar). It is well recognized that mammals, plants, and microorganisms utilize the reductive pathway for pyrimidine degradation (3Wasternack C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 8: 629-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Tsai C.S. Axelrod B. Plant Physiol. 1965; 40: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Syldatk C. May O. Altenbucher J. Mattes R. Siemann M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotech. 1999; 51: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas some microorganisms use the oxidative pathway (6Hayaishi O. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 197: 717-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lara F.J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1952; 64: 279-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang T.P. Lampen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 194: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reductive pyrimidine metabolism, uracil, or thymine is first reduced to its dihydro-derivative, which in turn is hydrolyzed to anN-carbamoyl-β-amino acid and finally decarbamoylated to a β-amino acid. This metabolic route, especially the hydrolysis of dihydro-derivatives catalyzed by dihydropyrimidinase, has attracted much attention, because it is a potential target for drug therapy in the treatment of cancer (9Naguib F.M.N. el Kouni M.H. Cha S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5405-5412PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hull W.E. Port R.E. Herrmann R. Britsch B. Kunz W. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1680-1688PubMed Google Scholar), and it also has been used for the industrial production of optically active amino acids (5Syldatk C. May O. Altenbucher J. Mattes R. Siemann M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotech. 1999; 51: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Ogawa J. Shimizu S. J. Mol. Catal.

In contrast, oxidative pyrimidine metabolism has been scarcely investigated, and the references available so far are limited to the early studies performed by three groups of scientists (6Hayaishi O. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 197: 717-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lara F.J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1952; 64: 279-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang T.P. Lampen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 194: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports showed that pyrimidine bases are first oxidized to barbituric acid derivatives, and then the barbituric acid derivatives are further hydrolyzed by barbiturase (EC 3.5.2.1) to urea and malonate derivatives. However, these studies were carried out with crude enzyme preparations, and the results presented were inadequate for confirming the enzymatic conversion of barbituric acid to urea and malonate. We have elucidated the enzymes involved in the oxidative pathway, and clarified their physiological functions, in a bacterium,Rhodococcus erythropolis JCM 3132, which metabolizes pyrimidine exclusively through the oxidative pathway (13Soong C.-L. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our preliminary enzymatic study on the oxidative pathway in this strain revealed that barbiturase catalyzes the amidohydrolysis of barbituric acid to ureidomalonic acid but not to urea and malonate (13Soong C.-L. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consequently, we found a novel enzyme, ureidomalonase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ureidomalonic acid to urea and malonate, and proposed a detailed metabolic pathway of oxidative pyrimidine metabolism as shown below in Fig. 1 A (13Soong C.-L. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified and characterized barbiturase in detail. The full-length gene encoding the barbiturase (bar) was also cloned. The enzyme was found to contain zinc, and its amino acid sequence exhibited good homology to that of cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, an enzyme involved in the newly evolved catabolic pathway for herbicide atrazine degradation as shown below in Fig.1 B (14Karns J.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3512-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Martinez B. Tomkins J. Wackett L.P. Wing R. Sadowsky M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5684-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, no sequence homology was found with other naturally existing amidohydrolases such as dihydropyrimidinase, dihydro-orotase, allantoinase, cytosine deaminase, and urease, suggesting that barbiturase represents a new family of the amidohydrolase protein superfamily. The putative zinc-binding motif of barbiturase is located in the COOH-terminal region, contrary to in the cases of the zinc-containing amidohydrolases mentioned above, in which it is located in the NH2-terminal region, further indicating that barbiturase is a novel zinc-containing amidohydrolase. In addition, adjacent to the barbiturase gene is a putative uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene, this enzyme being involved in the salvage pathway for uracil in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, suggested that barbiturase may collaborate with this enzyme in the regulation of pyrimidine metabolism. R. erythropolisJCM 3132 was used and cultivated in uracil-rich medium as described previously (13Soong C.-L. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cultivation was carried out at 28 °C for 4 days with shaking. The standard enzyme assay mixture comprised 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 20 mmbarbituric acid, and an appropriate amount of enzyme in 100 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10–15 min and stopped with 10 μl of 15% (v/v) perchloric acid, followed by neutralization with 90 μl of 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was analyzed as to the decrease in barbituric acid, using a Shimadzu (Japan) LC-10A high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, 1HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyIEDion-exchange distilledICPSinductively coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrophotometerMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidORFopen reading frameUPGMAUnweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean at 210 nm) fitted with a reversed-phase Cosmosil 5C18 AR-II-packed column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Japan), and 100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 2.5) as the eluent at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.

The reaction mixture comprised 200 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm barbituric acid, and an appropriate amount of enzyme in 150 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, and the decrease in absorption of the barbituric acid was monitored for 2 min at 30 °C. The absorbance at 256 nm of barbituric acid was linear in this range. Cells (50% w/v) suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) were disrupted by ultrasonication at 4 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min. The resultant supernatant was supplemented with the following compounds at various concentrations (0.5–2 mm) and then kept at 4 °C: reducing agents (dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, and l-cysteine), cofactors (NADH, NADPH, NAD+, NADP+, FAD, FMN, ATP, ADP, AMP, and 2-oxoglutaric acid), metal ions (divalent and monovalent metal ions), protease inhibitors, metal ion chelators, pyrimidine and purine-related compounds, organic acids, non-ionic and ionic detergents at 1–10% (v/v), and sugars at 10% (w/v). The barbiturase activity of each supplemented sample was assayed periodically together with a non-supplemented sample as a control. All purification steps were carried out at 0–5 °C. The buffer used was 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mmdithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol (which was found to be a stabilizer for barbiturase, as described under “Results”). Washed cells (20 g (wet weight) from 10 liters of uracil-rich medium) were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C) and suspended in 20 ml of buffer. The cell suspension was disrupted with 0.25- to 0.50-mm diameter glass beads (Dyno-Mill KDL, W. A. Bachofen, Switzerland) at 5 °C for 25 min. The disrupted cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was used as the cell-free extract. The cell-free extract was dialyzed against 10 liters of buffer for 12 h. The dialyzed sample was then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 40 cm) previously equilibrated with the buffer. After the column had been washed with 1 liter of buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 1 liter of buffer. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer for 12 h. The dialyzed enzyme solution was applied to another DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with the buffer. The column was washed with buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.6 m NaCl in 500 ml of buffer. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer for 12 h. The dialyzed enzyme was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with the buffer and then eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.7 m NaCl) in 20 ml of buffer. The active fractions were combined, solid NaCl was added to obtain a concentration of 4 m, and the mixture was applied to a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with the buffer containing 4 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with a decreasing salt gradient (4 to 0 m NaCl) in 20 ml of buffer. The active fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a 10,000 cut-off membrane. The concentrated enzyme was applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/26 column equilibrated with the buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and then eluted with the same buffer. The active fractions were used for characterization. Analytical Methods—The relative molecular weight was determined by HPLC on a TSKgel G3000SW column (7.5 × 600 mm, Tosoh, Japan) eluted with 100 mm potassium phosphate containing 100 mm Na2SO4 and 0.2m NaCl (pH 7.0) at the flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The molecular weight of barbiturase was calculated from the mobilities of the standard proteins, glutamate dehydrogenase (290,000), lactate dehydrogenase (142,000), enolase (67,000), adenylate kinase (32,000), and cytochrome c (12,400). SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme were determined by automated Edman degradation with a pulsed-liquid-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 476A). Protein concentrations were determined by the dye binding method of Bradford using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Preparation of Internal Peptides—The freeze-dried purified enzyme (22 nmol) was dissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl containing 8 m urea (pH 9.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. It was then digested with 0.11 nmol of lysylendopeptidase in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 9.0) containing 4 m urea at 30 °C for 16 h. The mixture was then applied to a SMART micro-purification system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Sweden) equipped with a μRPC C2/C18 PC 3.2/3 column and eluted with a linear gradient (6 ml) of acetonitrile (0–80%) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptide solutions were evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac Plus SC110A (Savant Instruments, Inc., NY) and stored at −20 °C. Amino acid sequencing was performed by Edman degradation as described above. All glassware was soaked in 2 mHCl overnight and rinsed thoroughly with ion-exchange distilled (IED) water. Prior to enzyme dialysis, the dialysis tubing was successively treated with hot sodium carbonate (0.1 m), EDTA (12 mm)/sodium acetate (33 mm), and acetate (10 mm) for 30 min each and then washed with IED water. The treated tubing was then soaked in 50% ethanol for 2 h and washed thoroughly with IED water. The highly purified and concentrated enzyme (1.15 mg of protein/ml) was dialyzed extensively against 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10% ethylene glycol (special grade for amino acid analysis from Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan). The dialyzed enzyme was analyzed with an inductively coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrophotometer (ICPS), Shimadzu ICPS-8000 (27.120 MHz). The metal contents of the enzyme sample were determined from the calibration curve for standard solutions, with the dialysis buffer as a control. Total genomic DNA fromR. erythropolis JCM 3132 was isolated and purified according to the method of Saito and Miura (16Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The protocols used for plasmid isolation, agarose electrophoresis, ligation, and other standard molecular biological techniques were as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA labeling with alkaline phosphate for Southern and colony hybridization was carried out using the materials and protocols of chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., UK). Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain-termination method using a CEQ DTCS kit dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Instruments) with an automated DNA sequencer (CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System, Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The GENETYX software system (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used for computer analysis of nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences. Two degenerate oligonucleotides (forward primer 5′-GA(A/G)GA(A/G)GTIGCIGA(A/G)GTICCIAT (A/C/T)GTNTGG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-TT(T/G/A)AT(C/T)TGIC (T/G)(G/A)TGCCA(G/A)TGIAC(G/A)TC-3′, where I = inosine and N = any base) were synthesized based on two internal peptide sequences, EEVAEVPIVW (Ba-1) and DVHWHRQIK (Ba-5), respectively. PCR amplification was performed with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Japan) and the above primers, with the genomic DNA of R. erythropolis as a template. A Themoblock T-Gradient (Biometra, Germany) was programmed for 1 cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min; and 1 cycle of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. A single amplified PCR product of ∼700 bp was ligated with TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Transformation into Escherichia coli DH5-α was carried out by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser. Screening for positive transformants was performed by colony hybridization with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled 700-bp fragment as a probe. The resultant cloned plasmid, pCR-BAR10, was isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The cloned 700-bp insert was sequenced with M13 forward and reverse primers followed by primer-walking with custom oligonucleotides synthesized by GENSET KK, Kyoto, Japan. Subsequent cloning of the upstream and downstream regions flanking the barbiturase gene was carried out by inverse-PCR (18Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was separately digested with several restriction enzymes, and aNaeI digest of ∼2.3-kb was selected on Southern blot analysis as suitable for inverse-PCR. The genomic DNA was then digested with NaeI and self-ligated under dilute conditions (1 μg/ml) that favor intramolecular circularization (19Collins S.F. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6812-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of this ligated DNA was performed by using two divergent oligonucleotides (S1, 5′-CGTCAACGTGTTCTTGAAGTGCGAG-3′, and AS1, 5′-GTCGGTCTTGGTGACCTTGTCTGCC-3′, located within the previously obtained insert sequence of pCR-BAR10) as primers. The specific amplified 2.3-kb fragment was purified, ligated with a TA cloning vector and then transformed into E. coli DH5-α. Screening for positive colonies was performed by colony hybridization. The resultant cloned plasmid, pCR-BAR59, was isolated and sequenced. The recombinant form of R. erythropolis barbiturase was obtained by PCR amplification of the gene encoding the enzyme and its subsequent cloning into T7 polymerase-driven expression vector pET21-a (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). For amplification, the forward primer (5′-TACAAGGAGATGCATATGCCCGAAGCAATC-3′) contained an engineered NdeI site (underlined) and spanned positions −15 to +15 of the coding strand, whereas the reverse primer (5′-AAGTTTCCAGCGGAATTCTTACCGGCTACT-3′) had an engineered EcoRI site (underlined) and corresponded to the sequence ranging from +1106 to +1135 of the non-coding strand. The conditions for PCR amplification with LATaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Japan) were as described above, except that an annealing temperature of 65 °C and an extension temperature of 74 °C for 1 min were employed. The resultant 1.1-kb gene encoding barbiturase was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites in expression plasmid pET21-a, yielding plasmid pET-BAR11N5. This was maintained inE. coli DH5-α, and the complete sequence of the barbiturase gene was confirmed by sequencing of the genes from three independent colonies harboring the pET-BAR11N5 plasmid. The gene encoding barbiturase was expressed in E. coliBL21(λDE3)/pET-BAR11N5 cells grown in LB medium (500 ml in a 2-liter flask) containing a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultivation was carried out at 37 °C for 6 h, after inoculation with 10% (50 ml) of an overnight seed culture. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.85% NaCl, and then used for enzyme purification. All purification procedures were carried out at 0–5 °C. The bacterial cells obtained from 2 liters of culture were suspended in buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, pH 7.0). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer for 12 h. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 40 cm) previously equilibrated with the buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl (1 liter buffer). The active fractions were pooled, solid NaCl was added to a concentration of 4 m, and then the fractions were applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with the buffer containing 4 m NaCl. The column was washed with the buffer containing 2.5 m NaCl, followed by elution with a decreasing gradient of 2.5 to 0 m NaCl (600 ml of buffer). The active fractions were pooled, solid NaCl was added to a concentration of 4 m, and then the fractions were applied to a TSKgel butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (2.5 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with the buffer containing 4 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with a decreasing gradient of 4 to 0 mNaCl (400 ml of buffer). The active fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against the buffer for 12 h. The dialyzed sample was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25 to 0.5 m NaCl (20 ml of buffer). The active fractions were combined and used for characterization. During the initial study, we encountered difficulty in purifying the barbiturase, because the enzyme was unstable. The enzyme in a cell-free extract lost ∼70% of its initial activity (at 4 °C) within 2 weeks. Therefore, it could not withstand the purification process, and no activity was detected after the first two chromatographic steps. We then screened for possible stabilizers of the enzyme. The enzyme activity was examined after the addition of reducing agents, cofactors, metal ions, protease inhibitors, pyrimidine and purine derivatives, organic acids, detergents, and sugars. Among them, we found ethylene glycol is an effective stabilizer for the barbiturase. In the presence of 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, the barbiturase could be kept for more than 3 months at 4 °C without detectable loss of activity. Barbiturase was purified to homogeneity with an overall yield of 8% and a 40-fold increase in specific activity (Table I). The purified enzyme gave a single protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). Further evidence of its purity was provided by gel-permeation HPLC on a G3000SW column, there being a quite symmetrical protein absorption peak concomitant with barbituric acid-hydrolyzing activity.Table IPurification of barbiturase from R. erythropolis JCM 3132Step totalTotal proteinSpecific activityActivityYield-foldmgunitsunits/mg%Cell-free extract16501080.06551001.00DEAE-Sephacel (1st)90.057.50.63953.29.76DEAE-Sephacel (2nd)54.470.41.2965.219.7MonoQ HR 5/522.040.01.8237.027.8Phenyl-Superose HR 5/56.4015.62.4414.437.3Superdex 200 Hiload 16/263.308.702.648.0640.3 Open table in a new tab The relative molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 172,000. On SDS-PAGE, the purified enzyme gave a single protein band corresponding to a relative molecular weight of 45,000. Thus, the native enzyme probably consists of four identical subunits. An initial attempt to dialyze the enzyme against 5 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) failed, because the enzyme became aggregated. It was found that the addition of ethylene glycol to the dialysis buffer prevented this enzyme aggregation. Qualitative analysis of metals in the enzyme was performed for 66 elements by ICPS. Only zinc gave a significant reading, i.e.∼1.1 ± 0.1 mol per subunit. Other metals found in detectable amounts were calcium and magnesium (0.045 and 0.01 mol/subunit, respectively), but the amounts were too insignificant for these elements to be considered present in the purified enzyme. Therefore, barbiturase is a zinc-containing tetrameric enzyme with one atom of zinc bound per subunit. This is analogous to other amidohydrolases such as the dihydropyrimidinases from bovine and rat liver (20Brooks K.P. Jones E.A. Kim B.D. Sander E.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Kikugawa M. Kaneko M. Fujimoto-Sakata S. Maeda M. Kawasaki K. Takagi T. Tamaki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the hydantoinase from Arthrobacter aurescens (22May O. Siemann M. Siemann M.G. Syldatk C. J. Mol. Catal. B: Enzymatic. 1998; 4: 211-218Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme showed the maximum absorbance at 278 nm. No other absorption peak or shoulder was observed, suggesting that no co-factor other than zinc would be bound to the enzyme. The purified barbiturase showed strict specificity toward barbituric acid. The following compounds were not transformed by the purified enzyme: barbituric acid derivatives such as barbital, cyclobarbital, allobarbital, and isobarbituric acid; pyrimidine derivatives such as dihydro-l-orotate, dihydrouracil, dihydrothymine, orotate, uracil, and thymine; and other cyclic-amides such as cyanuric acid, alloxan, parabanic acid, hydantoin, glutarimide, and succinimide. The K m and V max values for barbituric acid were 1.0 mm and 2.5 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Barbituric acid was hydrolyzed to ureidomalonic acid, which showed the same elution profile on HPLC as that in our previous report dealing with product (ureidomalonic acid) identification (13Soong C.-L. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Urea and malonate were not detected in the reaction mixture of the purified enzyme with barbituric acid as the substrate on analysis by TLC, HPLC, and an enzymatic method using urease. The non-reactive compounds listed above were examined as to inhibition of barbituric acid hydrolysis by the purified barbiturase. It was found that dihydro-l-orotate, alloxan, and cyanuric acid competitively inhibited barbituric acid hydrolysis, theK i values being 4.5, 1.7, and 0.42 mm, respectively (Fig. 3). The reaction time courses with various barbituric acid concentrations (2–80 mm) showed time-dependent saturation of the reactions, indicating that the reactions attained equilibrium (data not shown). These results suggested that barbiturase catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of barbituric acid to ureidomalonic acid. An equilibrium constant ([product]/[substrate]) of ∼0.16 was obtained at pH 8.0. The enzyme activity was assayed under standard conditions in the presence of various compounds (2 mm). The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoate andN-ethylmaleimide, whereas N-bromosuccinimide and 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) showed 60 and 50% inhibition, respectively. Serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl phosphofluoridate strongly inhibited the enzyme activity (90% inhibition). The enzyme was sensitive to metal ion chelators such aso-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, EDTA, and α,α′-dipyridyl (80, 60, 30, and 30% inhibition, respectively), suggesting that metal ion (Zn2+) is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The enzyme activity was not enhanced on metal ion addition but partially inhibited by Ni2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ (80, 60, and 51% inhibition, respectively) and completely inhibited by Hg2+ and Cu2+. The enzyme activity and stability were assayed in MES/NaOH, potassium phosphate, Tris/HCl, HEPES/NaOH, and NaHCO3-Na2CO3buffer systems (100 mm) at pH 4.0–6.0, 6.5–8.0, 7.0–8.5, 7.0–8.0, and 9.4–10.0, respectively. Under the standard assay conditions, the highest activity was observed at pH 8.0. When the enzyme was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, more than 80% of the initial activity was retained at pH 6.0–8.0. The initial velocity of the hydrolysis increased with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum at 40–45 °C. No enzymatic activity remained after 30-min incubation at 55 °C or above at"

The enzyme has attracted interest because of its potential use as a biocatalyst. The structure of C. tetanomorphum MAL has been solved to 1.9-Å resolution by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. A divalent metal ion complex of the protein has also been determined. MAL is a homodimer with each monomer consisting of two domains. One is an α/β-barrel, and the other smaller domain is mainly β-strands.

One approach is to use stereospecific or highly stereoselective enzyme catalysts to control, for example, the stereochemical course of addition reactions (1Akhtar M. Botting N.P. Cohen M.A. Gani D.

However, the exquisite substrate selectivity of enzymes is also one of their principle limitations, their catalytic activity often being restricted to a few substrates. Rational redesign of protein catalysts has had several high profile successes but has so far failed to open up large areas of organic chemistry to biocatalysis. An alternative approach that shows considerable promise is to couple rational design with directed evolution methods to select enzyme activity (e.g. Altamirano et al. (3Altamirano M.M. Blackburn J.M. Aguayos C. Fersht A.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)). In such examples enzyme residues are chosen for random mutagenesis on the basis of function (e.g. substrate binding or catalysis), and the required enzyme activity is selected using a suitable screen. Of course, the ability to assign function to enzyme amino acid residues is greatly aided by a three-dimensional structural model.One enzyme that shows considerable potential for use in organic synthesis is 3-methylaspartic acid ammonia-lyase (MAL).1 MAL is a 45.5-kDa enzyme found on the main catabolic pathway for glutamate inClostridium tetanomorphum (4Barker H.A.

MAL catalyzes the reversible antielimination of ammonia froml-threo-(2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid to give mesaconic acid (Fig. 1). MAL also catalyzes the stereo- and regioselective addition of ammonia to several derivatives of mesaconic acid to form a limited number of homochiral substituted aspartic acids (1Akhtar M.

However, engineering of MAL is greatly hindered by the lack of structural information and the absence of homologues in the Protein Data Bank.The mechanism of MAL has attracted some interest. It was postulated that MAL belonged to the enolase superfamily of enzymes on the basis of distant sequence homology (6Babbit P.C. Hasson M.S. Wedekind J.E. Palmer D.R. Barrett W.C. Reed G.H.

Its molecular mass as estimated from sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration experiments was 11–12 kDa, and it was immunoprecipitated by Sanadi's anti-factor B antiserum in an Ouchterlony double diffusion experiment (7Stiggall D.L.

Although Sanadi (5Sanadi D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 39-56Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Joshi S. Kantham L. Kaplay S. Sanadi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) claimed that the ATP synthase complex prepared in his laboratory contained factor B, a thorough analysis of the polypeptide composition of an ATPase complex prepared in Walker's laboratory demonstrated the existence of the 16 unlike polypeptides mentioned above but no factor B (1Walker J.E. Lutter R. Dupuis A. Runswick M.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5369-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchanan S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Van Raaij M.J.

The multiplicity of Sanadi's factor B-like preparations with relative molecular masses ranging from 13–15 to 47 kDa, the small yield of our preparation, which precluded antibody production and chemical analyses, and the compelling extensive data of Walker's laboratory discouraged further interest in the pursuit of factor B. More recently, two nucleotide sequences corresponding in part to Sanadi's 55-amino acid sequence of the factor B amino terminus were detected by our colleagues in the human genome. The shorter frame corresponding to 96 amino acid residues was expressed with a histidine tag. The expressed protein was found in inclusion bodies, and when extracted with 8 m urea and dialyzed the protein exhibited no factor B-like activity. The longer frame corresponding to 175 amino acid residues was expressed once with a histidine tag and a second time fused to thioredoxin. Both were recognized after purification by polyclonal antibodies raised to the shorter polypeptide. The histidine-tagged preparation was also inactive, but the other, after removal of thioredoxin, exhibited all the functional features described previously by Sanadi and co-workers (4Lam K.W. Warshaw J.B. Sanadi D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Sanadi D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

This paper describes the molecular and functional properties of this human factor B preparation. NAD, NADH, ATP, oligomycin, and 2,4-dithiothreitol were obtained from Calbiochem; DCCD, venturicidin, FCCP, tributyltin chloride, NEM,p-chloromercuribenzoate, sodium succinate, and 2-mercaptoethanol were from Sigma; DEAE-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences; polyacrylamide was from Bio-Rad; Tris was from ICN; and oxonol VI was from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were reagent grade. AE-SMP were prepared from heavy beef heart mitochondria (13Hatefi Y. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 27: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) according to Ref. 14Joshi S. Sanadi D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. After a final wash with 0.25 msucrose containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, the particles were suspended in the same medium at 17 mg of protein/ml and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. F1-ATPase was prepared according to Senior and Brooks (15Senior A.E. Brooks J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 140: 257-266Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and stored in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The catalytic activity of the enzyme was in the range of 90–100 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed (min·mg)−1. OSCP was prepared by Dr. A. Matsuno-Yagi as described previously (16Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ATP-driven reverse electron transfer from succinate to NAD was assayed at 38 °C essentially according to Joshi and Sanadi (14Joshi S. Sanadi D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that after 1–2 min of incubation of AE-SMP with factor B, succinate, ATP, MgCl2, KCN, and dithiothreitol, the reaction was started by the addition of NAD. The progress of the reaction was monitored at 340 nm in a Milton Roy 1201 spectrophotometer, and the rate of NAD reduction was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1. Inactivation of factor B with thiol-modifying reagents was performed by incubating factor B for 5 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 7.8, with increasing concentration of CdSO4 dissolved in water, or of phenylarsine oxide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, or NEM dissolved in dimethylformamide. The incubation mixtures containing CdSO4 and phenylarsine oxide also contained 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The inhibitor-treated samples of factor B were assayed for reconstitution of the ATP-driven reverse electron transfer activity of AE-SMP in the absence of dithiothreitol. The ATPase activities of F1 and AE-SMP were measured spectrophotometrically by the coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase method as before (17Stiggall D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere (18Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence detection kit from Pierce. Protein concentration was determined, using the BCA kit from Pierce. Standard molecular biology techniques, including cloning, restriction enzyme analysis, plasmid preparation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were as described in Ref. 19Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Amino-terminal analysis of purified recombinant human factor B was performed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility of this institution. Tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were performed at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry. The I.M.A.G.E. clone 2663774 containing EST AW173068 was purchased from Research Genetics. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The forward primer P1, 5′-TTCTGGGGCTGGTTGAATGCA-3′, and reverse primers P2, 5′-TTACTTCAATTGTAATTTTAGTTC-3′, and P3, 5′-CTTCAATTGTAATTTTAGTTCCAG-3′, with and without termination codon, respectively, were designed to amplify the full length of mature factor B by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The amplicons were subcloned into pBAD/Thio-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations, and clones containing plasmids, designated pBAD-FB1 and pBAD-FB2, with the correct sequence of the inserts were selected after DNA sequencing. In both pBAD-FB plasmids, the factor B nucleotide sequence was located downstream of the nucleotide sequence coding for His-Patch thioredoxin under regulation of araBAD promoter. In the present study, a single colony of TOP10 cells transformed with pBAD-FB1 plasmid from a fresh LB plate containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml was used to inoculate 5 ml of 2× YT liquid medium in the presence of 100 μg of ampicillin/ml and grown overnight in a shaker at 37 °C. Then 0.5 liter of the 2× YT liquid medium plus 100 μg of ampicillin/ml were placed in a 2-liter flask and inoculated with 3 ml of the overnight culture and grown in a shaker (250 rpm) at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.5–0.6. The temperature in the shaker was shifted to 30 °C, and the protein expression was induced by adding 20% arabinose to 0.02% final concentration. The incubation was continued for 4 h, and the culture was harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The bacterial cells were disrupted by 4 cycles of freeze-thawing, followed by sonication on ice slurry, using a Branson sonifier. The soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation for 1 h at 15,000 rpm in a Beckman SS-34 rotor, and affinity-purified on His-Bind resin (Novagen) preloaded with NiCl2. After washing with a pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 mNaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, the fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm imidazole in the above buffer. The fractions containing the fusion protein were concentrated using the Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filter devise (Millipore) and subjected to size-seiving chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 44 (column size 1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated in a pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. To remove the thioredoxin moiety, the recombinant protein was cleaved overnight at room temperature with recombinant enterokinase (Novagen) and purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, using a pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The fractions were assayed for restoration of ATP-driven reverse electron transfer from succinate to NAD as catalyzed by AE-SMP and combined based on activity and purity after analysis by SDS-PAGE. The protein was concentrated on YM-10 and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. To obtain a cDNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of human factor B, the oligonucleotide primers P1 and P2 (see above) as well as the forward primer P4, 5′-CCTGCTCTGTACTCGACCCG-3′, and the reverse primer P5, 5′-AAGAGTCGGTGGCGTCGAT-3′, were used to amplify by PCR the nucleotide sequences encoded by inserts in I.M.A.G.E. clones 2663774 (GenBankTM accession number AW173068) and 24431 (GenBankTM accession number AF052186) obtained from Research Genetics. The PCR amplifications were performed in 50-μl volumes, each containing 5 μl of High Fidelity PCR buffer, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm of each primer, ∼10 ng of template, and 1 unit of PLATINUM Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions used are as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles each of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. In a second round, 5 μl from each of the PCR mixtures was combined and subjected to amplification with primers P2 and P4 as above. The final PCR product was purified on agarose gel and subcloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen). The nucleotide sequence of the insert was verified in both directions by ABI 327 sequencer using BigDye terminator sequencing. The predicted amino acid sequence of human factor B is shown in Fig.1. In the amino-terminal 55 residues, there are three differences between the mature human factor B shown in Fig. 1 and the sequence published by Sanadi and co-workers for the bovine protein (11Kantham L. Raychowdhury R. Ogata K.K. Javed A. Rice J. Sanadi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The human amino acid residues Tyr-14, Cys-33, and Glu-43 are, respectively, His, Gly, and Gln in the Sanadi partial sequence (11Kantham L. Raychowdhury R. Ogata K.K. Javed A. Rice J. Sanadi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 2The residues Gly-33 and Gln-43 in the partial sequence of the bovine factor B published by Sanadi and co-workers (11Kantham L. Raychowdhury R. Ogata K.K. Javed A. Rice J. Sanadi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) may in fact be Cys-33 and Glu-43 as in the human protein (see GenBankTM accession number AV611504, which might be a partial nucleotide sequence of the bovine factor B cDNA). Fig.2 shows on SDS-polyacrylamide gel the polypeptide pattern of Escherichia coli total cell lysate before (lane A) and after (lane B) induction of fused thioredoxin-factor B synthesis. Lane C is the pattern of the soluble proteins of the induced cells, and lane D is the purified thioredoxin-factor B fused preparation. Lane Eshows two protein bands due to factor B (upper) and thioredoxin (lower) after treatment of the fused protein with enterokinase, and lane F shows a single protein band due to purified factor B. As determined by amino-terminal sequence analysis, this preparation of factor B contained at its amino terminus an extra tripeptide, LAL, which had been retained after cleavage of thioredoxin. Otherwise, mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptide masses of our recombinant factor B matched the calculated masses of the corresponding peptides expected from its tryptic degradation (data not shown). Thus, the mature factor B shown in Fig. 1 is composed of 175 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 20,341 Da. The molecular mass derived from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the factor B preparation containing the amino-terminal LAL tripeptide was 20,607 Da (calculated value, 20,638 Da), and gel exclusion suggested a mass of ∼22 kDa, which indicated that the recombinant human factor B is monomeric (data not shown). Hydropathy analysis of the human factor B sequence revealed no hydrophobic clusters of amino acids for possible membrane anchorage.Figure 2Expression and purification of mature human factor B as depicted on SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Therefore, it was assumed that extraction of mitochondria with ammonia-EDTA partially removed one or more factor B-like molecules from the mitochondrial ATP synthase complexes. However, the effectiveness and the specificity of this extraction procedure for factor B removal were unclear. Fig.3 depicts immunoblots of mitochondria (column A), SMP (column B), and AE-SMP (column C) showing their relative contents of factor B (row 1), F1α subunit (row 2), OSCP (row 3), and IF1 (row 4). The results clearly show that ammonia-EDTA extraction is highly effective for the efficient removal of factor B. 3The ease with which factor B can be dissociated from the membrane may be related in part to the fact that most mammalian FO-F1 preparations reported in the literature exhibited low or no ATP-32Piexchange activity (see, for example Refs. 20Tzagoloff A. Byington K.H. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2405-2412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lutter R. Saraste M. van Walraven H.S. Runswick M.J. Finel M. Deatherage J.F.

Buhle E.L. Aebi U. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4642-4651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of F1 as represented by its α subunit, and OSCP, which is not anchored to the membrane, were essentially unchanged by the extraction. The level of IF1 was decreased in AE-SMP (Fig.3, bottom row) which was understandable, because of the alkaline pH of the extraction medium (24Galante Y.M. Wong S.-Y. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2671-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, the ATPase activity of AE-SMP was shown to be about 40% higher than that of SMP. Fig. 4 shows on the ordinate the activity of AE-SMP for ATP hydrolysis-driven electron transfer from succinate to NAD as affected by addition of increasing amounts of recombinant human factor B. The activity of AE-SMP in the absence of factor B was 4 nmol of NADH formed (min·mg of protein)−1. Addition of factor B increased this activity to 225, which was 87% of the activity of the SMP before ammonia-EDTA extraction. The abscissa intercept of the double-reciprocal plot of these data in the inset indicated half-maximal activation of AE-SMP at 0.33 nmol of factor B/mg of AE-SMP. By assuming that AE-SMP have roughly the same amount of ATP synthase as SMP, i.e. 0.4–0.45 nmol/mg of protein (25Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the factor B half-saturation amount of 0.33 nmol/mg of AE-SMP indicated that this water-soluble recombinant human protein bound specifically and with high affinity to the site from which its bovine counterpart had been removed. Addition to AE-SMP of F1 plus OSCP, instead of factor B, resulted in a marginal increase of reverse electron transfer activity (10–12% as compared with 87% when factor B was added), indicating in agreement with the data of Fig. 3 that the poor coupling activity of AE-SMP was not due to the loss of F1 and/or OSCP. It has long been known that addition of low concentrations of oligomycin to SMP treated with EDTA or ammonia-EDTA partially restores their energy-coupled activities. Apparently, when added at low concentrations oligomycin preferentially reacts with and seals the proton leakiness of the fraction of the ATP synthase complexes that have been rendered defective, thereby allowing the remaining intact ATP synthases to function normally (26Lee C.-P. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 18: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further addition of oligomycin would then begin to inhibit the intact ATP synthases, resulting in a decrease of the ATP synthase-coupled activity tested. Similar results are shown in Fig. 5. It is seen that addition to AE-SMP of oligomycin up to about 150 ng (0.3 nmol)/mg protein increased the ATP-driven reverse electron transfer activity of the particles from about 5 to about 54 nmol of NADH formed (min·mg protein)−1, and that further increase in oligomycin concentration resulted in inhibition. As was shown previously (6You K.-S. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 398-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), addition of low concentrations of oligomycin (<120 ng/mg protein) to factor B-replenished AE-SMP caused no activation but only partial inhibition of ATP-driven reverse electron transfer activity. We have examined the effect of other FO inhibitors with regard to activation of AE-SMP for ATP-driven electron transfer from succinate to NAD. At concentrations that caused inhibition of ATPase activity of AE-SMP from 10 to 70%, venturicidin and tributyltin chloride had no stimulating effect on its reverse electron transfer activity. Incubation of AE-SMP at 0 °C with 6 μm DCCD caused a time-dependent inhibition of its ATPase activity, as expected. At 10 and 20 min of incubation, when ATPase activity was inhibited by 30 and 43%, respectively, ATP-driven reverse electron transfer activity of the particles was increased from 4 nmol of NADH formed (min·mg)−1 to 18 at 10 min and to 27 at 20 min of incubation. Further incubation of AE-SMP with 6 μm DCCD lowered this stimulated activity to 22 at 30 min and to 7 at 50 min. Previous preparations of bovine factor B were shown to be inhibited by thiol and dithiol modifiers (5Sanadi D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 39-56Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6You K.-S. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 398-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Stiggall D.L. Galante Y.M. Kiehl R. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The effects of these modifiers on recombinant human factor B are shown in Fig.6. It is seen that factor B was inhibited when treated with the compounds shown, with the dithiol modifiers phenylarsine oxide and Cd2+ causing 50% inhibition at <10 μm concentration. As seen in Fig. 1, human factor B contains 6 cysteine residues, two of which are located at positions 92 and 94. The strong inhibitory effects of phenylarsine oxide and Cd2+ suggest that these dithiol modifiers bind to cysteine residues 92 and 94 of factor B. Fig.7 shows the formation of a membrane potential in SMP (traces A and B), AE-SMP (traces C and D), and AE-SMP plus factor B (traces E and F) as monitored by the absorbance change of oxonol VI at 630 minus 603 nm. Traces A and B are controls with SMP, showing membrane energization upon addition of ATP or NADH and deenergization by inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by oligomycin, inhibition of NADH oxidation by rotenone, or by uncoupling with FCCP. Traces C and D show that AE-SMP could not develop a high membrane potential upon addition of either ATP or NADH but that addition of oligomycin repaired this defect and allowed high membrane potential formation upon subsequent addition of NADH. Similar results were obtained when oligomycin was replaced with venturicidin or tributyltin chloride or when the AE-SMP was treated for 60 min at 0 °C with 10 μm DCCD. Like oligomycin, these reagents inhibited ATP hydrolysis but allowed membrane potential formation, as in Fig. 7 C, upon addition of NADH (data not shown). These results suggested, therefore, that removal of factor B created a proton leak in the FO of AE-SMP, which could be blocked by the specific FO inhibitors mentioned. Traces E and F show that the addition of factor B to AE-SMP repaired the defect shown in traces C and D and made it possible for the particles to develop a high membrane potential upon addition of either ATP or NADH. As seen in traces E and F, the development of the membrane potential to a static head level in factor B-supplemented AE-SMP was a slow process as compared with the results shown in traces A and B for SMP. It is possible that factor B binding to AE-SMP requires an energized conformation of FO-F1, apparently best achieved with the addition of ATP. This possibility would be somewhat analogous to the binding of IF1 to F1, which occurs during ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme (24Galante Y.M. Wong S.-Y. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2671-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to the data reported here, mature human factor B is composed of 175 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 20,341 Da and the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 1. The active, recombinant human factor B purified and used in the studies reported here contained an extra LAL tripeptide at its amino terminus. It was water-soluble, monomeric, and stable when stored at −80 °C in a pH 8.0 buffer containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. In its amino-terminal 55 residues and molecular mass, this recombinant human factor B is similar to the latest of a number of bovine mitochondrial factor B preparations reported previously by Sanadi and co-workers (11Kantham L. Raychowdhury R. Ogata K.K. Javed A. Rice J. Sanadi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).

We show that production of Gas8mRNA and protein occurs in adult mice predominantly in the testes, where expression is regulated during postmeiotic development of male gametocytes. Whereas a low level of Gas8 mRNA was detected by Northern blotting in testes of murine male neonates and young adolescents, Gas8 mRNA increased rapidly postmeiotically. In adult males, both Gas8 mRNA and protein reached steady state levels in testes that were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that Gas8 protein accumulates in gametocytes as they approach the lumen of seminiferous tubules and is localized to the cytoplasm of round spermatids, the tails of elongating spermatids, and mature spermatid tail bundles protruding into the lumen; in epididymal spermatozoa Gas8 protein was present in the flagella. However, premeiotic murine gametocytes lacked detectable Gas8 protein, as did seminiferous tubules in biopsy specimens from seven human males having cytological evidence of non-obstructive azoospermia secondary to Sertoli cell-only syndrome. Our findings, which associate Gas8 production developmentally with the later stages of spermatogenesis and spatially with the sperm motility apparatus, collectively suggest that this growth arrest-specific gene product may have a role in sperm motility. This postulated role for Gas8 is supported by our observation that highly localized production of Gas8 protein occurs also in the cilia of epithelial cells lining pulmonary bronchi and fallopian tubes and by the flagellar association of a Trypanosoma brucei ortholog of Gas8.

Growth arrest-specific (Gas) genes are structurally and functionally diverse genetic loci that are expressed preferentially in cultured cells that enter a quiescent state, commonly as a consequence of serum deprivation or growth to confluence. The cDNA sequences of these Gas genes show no similarity. Their activities have been found to range from the control of nerve cell differentiation to the regulation of microfilament organization, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycling (1Brancolini C.

We previously reported the use of retroviral based gene search vectors to identify two murine chromosomal loci (354–6 and 354–7) whose expression in fibroblasts is activated during growth arrest (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The locus in 354–7 encodes Gas7, which is expressed prominently during terminal differentiation of cultured Purkinje neurons and affects neurite outgrowth (14Ju Y.-T. Chang A.C.Y. She B.-R. Tsaur M.-L. Hwang H.-M. Chao C.C.-K. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and properties of the gene present at the 354–6 locus, which we previously named Gas8 (GenBankTMaccession number U19859 and Ref. 40Lih C.J. Cohen S.N. Wang C. Lin-Chao S.

A human ortholog of unknown function was designated as a Gas gene on the basis of its sequence similarity to Gas8 and assigned the name of GAS11 (15Whitmore S.A. Settasatian C. Crawford J. Lower K.M. McCallum B. Seshadri R. Cornelisse C.J. Moerland E.W. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Tipping A.J. Mathew C.G. Savnio M. Savoia A. Verlander P. Auerbach A.D. Van Berkel C. Pronk J.C. Doggett N.A. Callen D.F.

In the production of male gametocytes, diploid spermatogonia or stem cells proliferate, undergo meiosis, and differentiate in the testis into haploid spermatozoa containing flagella required for normal fertile function. This process involves complex regulation of at least in part the post-transcriptional level of the expression of a variety of testis-specific genes (16Braun R.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We show here that Gas8 is predominantly a testicular protein, whose expression in mice is developmentally regulated during puberty and spermatogenesis and in humans is absent in infertile males who lack the ability to generate gametes. The localization of Gas8 in the motility apparatus of postmeiotic gametocytes and mature spermatozoa, together with the detection of Gas8 also in cilia at the apical surfaces of epithelial cells lining the pulmonary bronchi and fallopian tubes suggests that the Gas8 protein may have a role in the functioning of motile cellular appendages. A lacZ-containing fragment of genomic DNA from the 354–6 cell, in which a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) 1MoMuLVMoloney murine leukemia virusESTexpressed sequence tagPBSphosphate-buffered saline lacprovirus was integrated downstream of the Gas8 genomic DNA (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was introduced by cloning and subcloning into the pSP72NOT plasmid (Promega), yielding pGas354–6. A series of nested deletions of this fragment was sequenced as described (14Ju Y.-T. Chang A.C.Y. She B.-R. Tsaur M.-L. Hwang H.-M. Chao C.C.-K. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moloney murine leukemia virus expressed sequence tag phosphate-buffered saline Using a TBLASTN data base search, we detected one Drosophila melanogaster EST (LD14709; 721-bp mRNA) that has extensive sequence homology to mouse Gas8. We obtained the cDNA clone containing this EST from Genome Systems Inc. and sequenced it as described (14Ju Y.-T. Chang A.C.Y. She B.-R. Tsaur M.-L. Hwang H.-M. Chao C.C.-K. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The GenBank™ accession number for the determined sequence isAF468957. Different tissues, e.g. lung, liver, kidney, heart, testis, cerebellum, cerebrum, adnexa (ovary and fallopian tube), spleen, and skeletal muscle of albino mouse (ICR strain; adult male/female mice) more than 12 weeks old, were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. For the collection of developing testes, the albino mice were housed in a cage in a 1:5 male to female ratio. The presence of a vaginal plug was the positive indication of mating and was considered as day 1 of gestation. Neonatal testes were collected from day 0 (samples were collected by 3 h after birth) to postnatal day 30 and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. Total RNA was isolated from different tissues following standard protocol (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA from different tissues was fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described (18Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). RNAs were transferred onto Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad) and then cross-linked by UV by following the vendor's protocol. Membranes were hybridized with random primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeledGas8 cDNA probe. Equal loading was monitored by ethidium bromide staining of 18 and 28 S rRNAs or by hybridization with β-actin cDNA probes. The end-filled AflIII DNA fragment containing Gas8 cDNA derived from pGas354–6 was inserted in the SmaI site of pET15bDH4 (a modified version of pET15b) to produce a His-tagged Gas8 protein expressed from a T7 bacterial phage promoter. The His-tagged Gas8 protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, WI). His-tagged Gas8 used for antiserum preparation was purified from the supernatant fraction by separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to Gas8 was excised and homogenized in PBS and stored at −20 °C until use for immunizing the rabbit by subcutaneous injection as described (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Various tissues from adult mice were homogenized by a polytron (PT3100, Kinematica) in buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, a sample of supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. The extract was first incubated with 25 μl of Sephadex G-100 at 4° for 2 h. The supernatant was centrifuged and then incubated with 9.7 μl of Sephadex G-100 and 0.3 μl of Sepharose CL-4B conjugated with the anti-Gas8 antiserum or the preimmune serum at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with the extraction buffer before resuspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and Western blot analysis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar,21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Mouse sperm cells were collected from cauda epididymis of adult mice (ICR strain, 3 months old). Protein lysate was made by homogenizing the sperm cells in RIPA buffer using a polytron homogenizer at 8,000 rpm for 10–20 s. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting as described (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Positive immunoreaction was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perfusion-fixed, adult (3 months) ICR mouse testis was dehydrated and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections 4–5 μm in thickness were collected for immunohistochemical study. The sections were rehydrated and then balanced in PBS buffer. After blocking by 10% normal goat serum in PBS, they were incubated with anti-Gas8 antiserum (1:300 dilution) in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100. The antibody-antigen complex was detected by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method and then developed in diaminobenzidine (DAB)-hydrogen peroxide (22Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). The nuclei were counterstained with either Mayer's hematoxylin or methyl green as indicated. Mouse ciliated respiratory epithelial cells were brushed from adult mouse pulmonary bronchi. Mouse epididymal sperm were collected surgically from adult ICR mice. The sperm or epithelial cells were smeared on glass slides and then were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 20 min. After washing in PBS for 30 min, they were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS for 30 min and incubated with a 1:300 dilution of anti-Gas8 antiserum or preimmune serum for 1 h. The antibody-antigen complex was detected with fluorescein-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The excess of antibodies was washed out with PBS, and samples were examined by confocal microscopy LSM510 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Human testicular tissues were biopsied from infertile patients or excised from patients with prostate cancer for androgen ablation therapy at Taipei Medical University Hospital. The tissues were prepared and stained using the En-Vision Plus system (Dako) and the manufacturer's protocol. The primary antibody (anti-Gas8 antiserum) was diluted (1:300) in PBS. After being stained with En-Vision Plus reagent, slides were developed in DAB-hydrogen peroxide. For comparison, adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to a standard protocol. The NIH3T3-derived cell line 354–6 (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) contains a single chromosomal insertion of a MoMuLV retroviral construct carrying the E. coli lacZ gene. The lacZ reporter gene in this insert is expressed from a chromosomally located promoter that is activated upon cell growth arrest. Cloning of the DNA segment 5′ to lacZyielded a 8.7-kb plasmid DNA insert whose restriction map (Fig.1 A) corresponded to the chromosomal DNA region containing the retroviral construct (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the distal 2 bp of the native long terminal repeat sequence of the retrovirus (Fig. 1 A, indicated as aa on the coding strand) had been deleted at the chromosome/provirus junction, as is characteristic of retroviral integration. The analysis showed also that retroviral insertion had occurred near a polypurine/polypyrimidine (Pu/Py) sequence (23Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Troutt A. Kedes L.H. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which typically is seen in S1 hypersensitive regions located at 5′ to transcribed genes. Eight independent cDNAs derived from lacZ-containing fusion transcripts contained sequences of a gene that corresponded to the genomic DNA segment we had identified. This gene was designated asGas8. Further analysis indicated that the retrovirus had inserted into the first exon of Gas8 and that an ATG codon in-frame with lacZ was generated at the splice junction of the chromosomal and retrovirus components of the fusion transcript (Fig. 1 B). These findings are consistent with the earlier observation that 354–6 cells synthesize a LacZ fusion protein that is approximately the same size as native LacZ (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of Gas8 cDNAs derived from native 3T3 cells showed two different species. These were identical through nucleotide 1126, where the sequences diverged, implying alternative splicing ofGas8 transcripts near the 3′ end. The open reading frames (ORFs) of 334 and 489 amino acids encoded by the two transcripts specify putative proteins that have calculated molecular masses of 40 and 57.9 kDa, respectively. The longer Gas8 transcript (GenBankTM accession number U19859) contains the hexanucleotide GAGGAC corresponding to the Kozak consensus sequence (24Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 261: 11779-11785Google Scholar) immediately 5′ to the predicted start site of the translation. Following the translational open reading frame (ORF) in the transcript is an AUUUA sequence, which has been implicated in determining mRNA stability (25Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). A polyadenylation signal (26Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), AAUGAAA, is located 20 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tract present at the 3′ end of this transcript. We used Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from various tissues of adult mice to investigate possible tissue-specific differences in the expression ofGas8. These experiments identified a 1.8-kbGas8-specific transcript made predominantly in the testes along with much smaller amounts of two larger transcripts detected by the same probe (Fig. 2 A). Limited amounts of the 1.8-kb transcript (approximately one-tenth the steady-state concentration in testes) were detected also in the kidney, cerebrum, and female adnexa (ovary and fallopian tube) (Fig.2 A). Consistent with our Northern blot results, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the bacterially expressed Gas8 protein showed prominent accumulation of Gas8 protein, which approximated a 60–65-kDa position, in adult mouse testes and also a small amount of Gas8 in female adnexa (Fig. 2 B). The size of the protein detected in both tissues is slightly larger than the predicted product of the ORF encoded by the Gas8 transcript we isolated. Northern blot analysis of testis mRNA isolated from animals of various ages showed that Gas8 transcription is developmentally regulated during pubertal maturation (Fig.3). Only a small amount ofGas8 transcripts was detected in neonates and young adolescents (through day 15) when the germ cells in the first wave of spermatogenesis reach the early pachytene stage. However,Gas8 mRNA increased dramatically by day 20, in which germ cells in the majority of tubules reach late pachytene stage, and early spermatids are found in a small number of tubules (27Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) and reached a plateau at day 30, when mature spermatozoa are produced. Transcription of Gas8 then continued at a high level throughout adulthood (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical analyses to localize the site(s) of Gas8 protein in adult testes showed that Gas8 accumulated in gametocytes as they matured and approached the lumen of seminiferous tubules (brown precipitates in Fig.4 A versus controls in Fig. 4 B). In particular, Gas8 was present in round spermatids, in the tails of elongating spermatids, and in mature spermatids present in the lumen of seminiferous tubules, all of which are cells in the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis (e.g.spermiogenesis). In contrast, no Gas8 protein was detected in gametocytes at early stages of spermatogenesis. Although a small amount of immunoreative material was found also in hormone-producing Leydig cells, which like mature spermatozoa are in a terminally differentiated state (28Ewing L.L. Zirkin B. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1983; 39: 599-635PubMed Google Scholar), this signal was not reversed by preabsorption of antibody with Gas8 protein, suggesting that it is nonspecific. In the adult mouse testis, the seminiferous epithelium undergoes cyclic changes during spermatogenesis, and sections showing seminiferous tubules at the various stages of spermatogenesis contain collections of gametocytes developing in synchrony (29Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The presence of Gas8 protein in seminiferous tubules was strikingly correlated by immunohistochemical analysis with the stage of spermatogenesis and, specifically, with the transition from round to elongated spermatids (spermiogenesis). Whereas the Gas8 protein was not detected in gametocytes in the premeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, sections of seminiferous tubules containing gametes at different stages of postmeiotic spermatogenesis (29Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) showed markedly different staining patterns by anti-Gas8 antibody. Gas8 was detected specifically in tubules in which short tails of elongating spermatids are embedded in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells (Fig. 5,A and D), tubules in which elongating spermatids have moved to the apical region of Sertoli cells (Fig. 5, Band E), and tubules in which tail bundles of mature spermatids still embedded in Sertoli cells protrude into the lumen (Fig. 5, C and F). The staining of gametocytes in these tubules by anti-Gas8 antibody confirmed that Gas8 protein accumulation is associated with later stages of spermatogenesis and further suggested a possible association of Gas8 with tail maturation in postmeiotic gametocytes. Consistent with the above findings, immunofluorescent staining of epididymal sperm indicated that Gas8 protein is present also in the flagella of mature spermatozoa (Fig.6 A, top panel); control experiments using preimmune serum showed only nonspecific staining of proteins in the sperm head (Fig. 6 B, top panel). The association of Gas8 expression with later stages of sperm cell differentiation and our finding that Gas8 protein is present in both tails of elongating spermatids and flagella of mature epididymal spermatozoa raised the prospect that Gas8 may have a role in the action of motile cellular appendages of male gametocytes. This notion was supported by the finding that the Gas8 protein also accumulated selectively in the cilia of epithelial cells lining both bronchi (shown as brown precipitates in Fig. 6,middle panels A and E; as arrowheadsin bottom panel A) and fallopian tubes (brown precipitates in Fig. 6, middle panel C; see also controls in Fig. 6, middle panels B and D andbottom panel B). Consistent with the selective occurrence of Gas8 protein in mouse gametocytes, testes biopsies from seven Sertoli cell-only syndrome patients, which lack gametocytes (30del Castillo E.B. Trabucco A. de la Balze F.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. 1947; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 C), showed no detectable Gas8 staining in seminiferous tubules (Fig. 7 F). In contrast, immunohistochemical staining of biopsied testes from fertile human males or from five adult males with obstructive azoospermia all showed Gas8 protein in the cytoplasm of round spermatids, the tails of elongating spermatids, and testicular spermatozoa (Fig. 7, Dand E). Recently, a human gene of unknown function was given a Gas gene designation on the basis of its similarity to the GenBankTM sequence we deposited for Gas8 and was named GAS11 (15Whitmore S.A. Settasatian C. Crawford J. Lower K.M. McCallum B. Seshadri R. Cornelisse C.J. Moerland E.W. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Tipping A.J. Mathew C.G. Savnio M. Savoia A. Verlander P. Auerbach A.D. Van Berkel C. Pronk J.C. Doggett N.A. Callen D.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The T lymphocyte triggering factor of Trypanosoma brucei(GenBankTM accession number AF012853) (31Vaidya T. Bakheit M. Hill K.L. Olsson T. Kristensson K. Donelson J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) shows 59% amino acid similarity and 35% identity with Gas8 (and with GAS11) along the entire sequence of both proteins. Using mouse Gas8 DNA sequences as a probe, we performed a TBLASTN data base search and identified a 721-nucleotide EST (clone LD14709) that has significant sequence alignment to the mouse gene in a cDNA library prepared fromD. melanogaster embryo mRNA. This EST encodes an open reading frame whose amino acid residues have 61% similarity and 43% identity to the mouse Gas8 protein and its human ortholog, GAS11 (Fig.8). Amino acid residues and motifs that are conserved between the mouse and Drosophila Gas8 proteins are distributed over the entire length of these polypeptides. TheDrosophila ortholog of Gas8 (GenBankTMAE003427) is located on the X chromosome. Gas8, a gene whose product is preferentially induced in growth-arrested murine fibroblasts growing in culture is shown here to be expressed in vivo in testes during postmeiotic development of male germ cells. Our finding that Gas8 is produced in the later stages of differentiation of spermatozoa is reminiscent of results obtained for another developmentally regulated Gasgene we have studied, Gas7, which is expressed predominantly during terminal differentiation of Purkinje neurons (14Ju Y.-T. Chang A.C.Y. She B.-R. Tsaur M.-L. Hwang H.-M. Chao C.C.-K. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). During the premeiotic phase of spermatogenesis, diploid spermatogonia and their progeny divide mitotically to generate large numbers of germ cells. Later, the first and the second divisions of meiosis yield haploid gametocytes; it is in this phase (i.e.spermiogenesis) that biochemical and morphological differentiation take place to produce mature spermatozoa (29Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This entire process begins at puberty, which is also when Gas8 transcription starts to rise. Gas8 mRNA is present prominently by postnatal day 20 and continues to increase through day 30, reaching a plateau that persists through adulthood. From 17 to 19 days, the majority of seminiferous tubules contain late pachytene spermatocytes and by 22 to 24 days, early (round) spermatids are detected in many tubules (32Nebel B.R. Amarose A.P. Hackett E.M. Science. 1961; 134: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Despite the accumulation ofGas8 transcripts during this period, as shown by Northern blotting, only a small amount of Gas8 protein was detected in round spermatids by immunocytochemical analysis, suggesting that translation of Gas8 mRNA is delayed until later in spermatogenesis. Consistent with this interpretation, despite the presence or a low level of Gas8 mRNA from birth (Fig. 3), no Gas8 protein was detected until after testes maturation. Similar transcription and translation patterns have been observed for other genes regulated during gametogenesis (16Braun R.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As transcription is known to cease in germ cells during midspermiogenesis and protein production is regulated during spermiogenesis by post-transcriptional mechanisms (16Braun R.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Schafer M. Nayernia K. Engel W. Schafer U. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the postmeiotic developmental regulation of Gas8 production we have observed seems likely to occur at the level of protein synthesis. Localized expression of Gas8 was also observed in the cilia of epithelial cells lining mouse bronchi and fallopian tubes, although the steady state levels of Gas8 mRNA and protein in these structures were far lower than in adult testes. The cilia of bronchi and fallopian tubes are structurally similar to sperm cell flagella and have a similar mechanism of movement (34Cosson J. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Gibbons I.R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid composition of the Gas8 protein revealed that it is rich in hydrophilic amino acids. It contains 20% positively charged residues (Asp + Glu = 90/489) and 20% negatively charged residues (Arg + Lys = 90/489). There is no typical signal peptide sequence in the N terminus; however, a putative nuclear localization signal (165KKMKMLRDELDLRRKTE) was observed toward the center of the protein, raising the prospect that Gas8 may be transiently translocated into the nucleus during some stage of spermatogenesis. The Gas8 protein sequence and particularly domains extending from amino acids 47 through 76 and 198 through 260 is remarkably conserved in multiple organisms (Fig. 8). Recent evidence that a trypanosomal protein T lymphocyte triggering factor localizes near the flagellar pocket (36Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains sequence similarity to Gas8 (31Vaidya T. Bakheit M. Hill K.L. Olsson T. Kristensson K. Donelson J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is consistent with the notion that Gas8 and related proteins may carry out a motility function expressed in organisms ranging from protozoa to humans. However, other functions that Gas8 may have cannot be excluded because Gas8 protein is present in round spermatids, which lack flagella. GAS11, the human counterpart of Gas8, has 87 and 96% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level, respectively, with the murine gene (Fig. 8). The human sequence maps to chromosome 16q24.3, a locus frequently associated with loss of heterozygosity in breast, prostate, hepatocellular, and ovarian carcinomas and for this reason was initially suspected of being a tumor suppressor gene (15Whitmore S.A. Settasatian C. Crawford J. Lower K.M. McCallum B. Seshadri R. Cornelisse C.J. Moerland E.W. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Tipping A.J. Mathew C.G. Savnio M. Savoia A. Verlander P. Auerbach A.D. Van Berkel C. Pronk J.C. Doggett N.A. Callen D.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse Gas8 antibodies detected GAS8/GAS11 in the flagella of human sperm (data not shown) and in the testes of both fertile human males and males having obstructive azoospermia. However that GAS8/GAS11 protein is absent from the testes of infertile human males with Sertoli cell-only syndrome, which is associated with an absence of gametocytes in seminiferous tubules (30del Castillo E.B. Trabucco A. de la Balze F.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. 1947; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is consistent with evidence that Gas8 expression in mouse testes occurs specifically in gametocytes. Given the localization of Gas8 in motile cellular appendages of both sperm and bronchial epithelial cells, it is of some interest that a clinical association between human male infertility due to reduced sperm motility and respiratory disease due to immotile cilia of bronchial epithelial cells has been observed (37Eliasson R. Mossberg B. Camner P. Afzelius B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Similarly, ciliary dyskinesis in the human respiratory tract has been associated with female infertility due to dysfunction of cilia in the oviduct (38Halbert S.A. Patton D.L. Zarutskie P.W. Soules M.R. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of at least 10 separate Gas genes has been found in cultured growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells by using cDNA subtraction (39Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) and retrovirus-based gene-trapping vectors (13Brenner D.G. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Like Gas8, Gas6, a ligand for Tyr-3 receptor tyrosine kinase families (41Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C.

Recent work has shown that knockout mice lacking Gas6 as well as other multireceptor tyrosine kinases are viable, but infertile, and show disordered spermatogenesis and reduced numbers of mature epididymal sperm (44Lu Q.

It is transcriptionally controlled by two proteins expressed from two unlinked genetic loci: CarS from the light-inducible carQRS operon, and CarA from the light-independent carA operon. CarA represses transcription from the carB promoter (PB) in the dark, and CarS counteracts this on illumination. The CarA sequence revealed a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif of the type found in bacterial MerR transcriptional factors, whereas CarS contains no known DNA-binding motif. Here, we examine the molecular interplay between CarA and CarS. We demonstrate the following. (i) Whereas CarS exhibits no DNA bindingin vitro, CarA binds specifically to a region encompassing PB to form at least two distinct complexes. (ii) A palindrome located between positions −46 and −63 relative to the transcription start point is essential but not sufficient for the formation of the two CarA-DNA complexes observed.

(iv) CarS physically interacts with CarA; thus, the functional interaction between them is mediated by protein-protein interactions. One of various cellular responses to blue light is the induction of the synthesis of carotenoids. These protect cells against photo-oxidative damage by quenching singlet oxygen and other free radicals produced on illumination (1Goodwin T.W. The Biochemistry of the Carotenoids. 1. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1980: 77-91Crossref Google Scholar, 2Rau W. Goodwin T.W. Plant Pigments. Academic Press, London1988: 231-255Google Scholar). The Gram-negative bacteriumMyxococcus xanthus is a model prokaryotic system for investigating how blue light switches on the network of cellular activities leading to carotenoid synthesis (3Hodgson D.A. Murillo F.J. Dworkin M. Kaiser A.D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 157-181Google Scholar). Genetic analyses have revealed a number of regulatory and structural genes involved in this response (Ref. 4Hodgson D.A. Berry A.E. Caddick M.X. Baumber S. Hodgson D.A. Phillips-Jones M.K. Microbial Responses to Light and Time. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998: 186-211Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). One enzyme involved in carotenoid synthesis is encoded by gene crtI, and all the rest by the unlinked carB operon (5Ruiz-Vázquez R. Fontes M. Murillo F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Fontes M. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Photoinduction of these structural genes is mediated by at least six regulatory genes as follows: the carQ, carR, and carS gene cluster and the unlinked carD, ihfA, andcarA genes. Transcriptional activation of crtI is mediated by the extracytoplasmic function-ς factor CarQ (7Lonetto M. Brown K. Rudd K. Buttner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7573-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 8Gorham H.A. McGowan S.J. Robson P. Hodgson D.A. Mol.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and by CarD, a multifunctional transcriptional factor of considerable resemblance to eukaryotic high mobility group A proteins (10Nicolás F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Nicolás F.J. Cayuela M.L. Martı́nez-Argudo I. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Light up-regulatescrtI expression by triggering the liberation of CarQ from CarR, a membrane-associated protein that sequesters CarQ in the dark (8Gorham H.A. McGowan S.J. Robson P. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 171-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The released CarQ is then free to activate transcription from thecrtI promoter (PI). CarQ, in conjunction with CarD and the histone-like protein IhfA, also promotes transcription from its own promoter (PQRS), leading to increased production in the light of the three proteins encoded in the operon (10Nicolás F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13McGowan S.J. Gorham H.C. Hodgson D.A. Mol.

Photoinduction of the structural genes in the carB operon depends on a different set of regulatory proteins: CarS, encoded by the third gene of the carQRS operon (13McGowan S.J. Gorham H.C. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 713-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and CarA, produced independently of light from an unlinked operon (Fig.1). A non-polar deletion within thecarA gene leads to light-independent expression of thecarB operon, indicating that CarA acts as a negative regulator of the carB promoter (PB) in the dark. 1M. Cervantes and F. J. Murillo, personal communication. Cells bearing a lack-of-function mutation in carS, on the other hand, do not display light activation of the carB operon; CarS thus functions as a positive regulator of PB in the light (13McGowan S.J. Gorham H.C. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 713-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, when carA is mutated, CarS is not required forcarB expression (15Martı́nez-Laborda A. Murillo F.J. Genetics. 1989; 122: 801-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations taken together have led to the following model for the light-regulated expression of PB. In the dark, CarA would prevent transcription from PB by an as yet unknown mechanism, and this transcriptional blockage would somehow be counteracted by CarS in the light. Derepression of PB is observed when CarS production is increased on illumination or when it is expressed from a constitutive heterologous promoter (13McGowan S.J. Gorham H.C. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 713-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hence, the relative levels of CarA and CarS may be important for the latter to exert its antagonistic role. The interplay between CarS and CarA in regulating PB is further manifested by the identification of a gain-of-function mutation incarS (carS1) that leads to constitutive expression of the carB gene cluster (16Balsalobre J.M. Inducción por la Luz de la Expresión Génica y la Carotenogénesis en Myxococcus xanthusPh.D. thesis. University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain1989Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence for CarS does not reveal any significant sequence homology to other known proteins nor does it suggest the presence of a defined DNA binding domain. By contrast, the amino acid sequence of CarA predicts an N-terminal stretch with high sequence homology to the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif of the MerR family of gene regulators (17Botella J.A. Murillo F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These transcriptional factors, found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, regulate response to stress such as exposure to toxic compounds or oxygen radicals (18Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Demple B. Amábile-Cuevas C.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37517-37524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MerR, the prototypical member of the family, regulates expression of the Tn21 mercury resistance operon merTP(C)ADthat confers resistance to inorganic mercury (Hg(II)). MerR binds to the mer operator to function as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of Hg(II) and as an activator in its presence (reviewed in Ref. 18Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The molecular interplay between CarA and CarS in the regulation of the photoinducible carB promoter is the focus of the present study. We have purified the proteins and examined whether either one or both show specific DNA binding that could underlie their observed functional roles. CarA, but not CarS, was found to bind specifically in the region around PB. Moreover, our experimental data lead to the conclusion that CarS antagonizes CarA by preventing it from binding to its cognate DNA as well as by provoking the dissociation of pre-formed CarA-DNA complexes. CarA is thus a repressor protein, and CarS functions as its antirepressor partner. By using in vivo and in vitro studies to probe for protein-protein interactions, we demonstrate that the repressor and antirepressor interact physically. The functional relationship between the two regulatory proteins is then most likely bridged by the observed CarA-CarS physical interaction. M. xanthus strain DK1050 (22Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 818-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the wild-type strain used in this study. Strain MR844 is a derivative of DK1050 bearing a non-polar deletion withincarA. 1M.

The rich casitone-tris (CTT) 2CTTcasitone-trisEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranosideCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl ammonio]-1-propane sulfonate medium was used for growth of M. xanthus cells (23Bretscher A.P. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 763-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid constructions, and strain BL21-(DE3) containing plasmid pLysS was used for protein overexpression. The recipient yeast strain for all yeast two-hybrid experiments was Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 (24Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 18.16-18.47Google Scholar). Yeast growth conditions and media were as described elsewhere (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). casitone-tris electrophoretic mobility shift assay 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl ammonio]-1-propane sulfonate Standard protocols were followed for DNA manipulation (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each PCR-derived clone was sequenced to verify the absence of any PCR-generated mutations. Detailed information on specific plasmid constructions is given below. A DNA fragment encompassing the carB promoter/operator region was PCR-amplified using as template DNA pMAR140 (which includes 1058 bp upstream of the translation initiation site of the first gene in thecarB operon), and as primers the oligonucleotides proB1 (5′-CCTGCGATCCACGCCTTCATGAGG-3′) and proB2 (5′-CTTTCCTCCGAAGAACCCGTTCCTTTGTTTCC-3′). PCR was performed usingPfu DNA polymerase to yield a 130-bp blunt-ended DNA fragment spanning positions −102 to +28 relative to the transcription start point. The amplified product was ligated to EcoRI adapters, and the 5′ ends were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase after removing unbound adapters. The phosphorylated DNA fragments were then cloned into EcoRI-digested pMAR240, which carries a 1.5-kb DNA fragment of M. xanthus DNA, sufficiently long for plasmid integration by homologous recombination, and with no promoter activity (9Martı́nez-Argudo I. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Restriction analysis was used to identify a plasmid with the 130-bp fragment inserted in the right (pMAR191) or wrong (pMAR192) orientation to produce a transcriptional fusion to the promoter-less lacZ gene lying downstream of the EcoRI site in pMAR240. pMAR191 and pMAR192 were introduced into M. xanthus by electroporation, and integration of the plasmid was selected for on CTT plates containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of the reporter lacZ gene under the control of the 130-bp fragment was qualitatively monitored on CTT plates containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and assessed quantitatively by measurements of β-galactosidase activity as described previously (27Balsalobre J.M. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2359-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The vector pET15b was used in constructs for overexpressing His6-tagged CarA, CarS, and CarS1 (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding these proteins were obtained by PCR using M. xanthus genomic DNA as template and cloned into theNdeI-BamHI sites of the vector. To overexpress proteins, cells cultured in 50 ml of LB/ampicillin at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6–1.0 were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of fresh LB/ampicillin, and inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium. After growth toA 600 of 0.6–0.8, protein expression was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 or 4 h (all at 37 °C). Expression and solubility of each protein were checked by SDS-PAGE of whole cell extracts or of the supernatant and pellet obtained by sonication and centrifugation of cells from 1-ml cell cultures. His6-CarS and His6-CarS1 were expressed as soluble proteins. His6-CarA was partly soluble at 50–200 mm NaCl but insoluble at higher salt concentrations. Cells from 1-liter of induced culture were pelleted and suspended in 80 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) containing 1 mNaCl (unless otherwise stated) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication under ice-cold conditions and centrifuged (12,000 × g, Beckman JA-20 rotor, 30 min, 4 °C) to separate cell debris and the soluble fraction. Soluble His6-tagged protein was purified off TALON metal affinity resin following the accompanying native purification protocol at neutral pH, with imidazole elution and subsequent elimination by dialysis (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Native His6-CarS and His6-CarS1 purified in this fashion yielded ≥20 mg/liter cell culture. The His tag was effectively removed by thrombin cleavage (1:1000 molar ratio of thrombin:protein in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2, incubated overnight at 20 °C) followed by dialysis. Some native CarA (∼50 μg of protein/g cell pellet) could be similarly purified by resuspending the cell pellet in buffer A containing 50 mmNaCl and performing cell lysis and purification off TALON in this same buffer. Purification of His6-CarA from the insoluble fraction was carried out at room temperature and denaturing solution conditions. Cells pelleted from a 1-liter culture were resuspended in 40 ml of binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated. Inclusion bodies isolated by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min were solubilized in binding buffer containing 8m urea. Insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant yielded ∼2 mg of CarA per g of cell pellet when purified off TALON metal affinity resin under denaturing conditions. CarA was renaturated following protocols described by Burgess and Knuth (29Burgess R.R. Knuth M.W. Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 205-274Google Scholar): buffer A with 50 mm NaCl was added to dilute urea from 8 to 3 mand protein to ≤0.3 mg/ml. Sarkosyl (N-laurylsarcosine) was then added to 0.2% and the sample dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. After eliminating any precipitate formed during dialysis by centrifugation, renatured protein was used immediately or stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. To determine protein concentrations, absorbance at 280 nm and the following extinction coefficients, ε280 (m−1cm−1), were used: CarA (4 Trp, 6 Tyr), 30,940; CarS (1 Trp and 1 Tyr), 6990; CarS1 (1 Tyr), 1490 (30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled wild-type probes were prepared by PCR as follows. Primer pro B1 (see construction of pMAR191 and pMAR192 above) was labeled at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then added to a PCR mix containing the second unlabeled amplification primer. The radiolabeled PCR-amplified fragment was purified off a 2% low-melting agarose gel. 5′-Radiolabeled mutant probes were generated employing PCR site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Binding was performed in 20-μl reaction volume containing 100 mm KCl, 15 mm HEPES, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 200 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA as nonspecific competitor, 1.2 nm end-labeled double-stranded probe (∼13000 cpm), and the indicated amounts of proteins. After incubation at 20 °C for 30 min, the samples were loaded onto 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 37.5:1) pre-run at 200 V, 10 °C for 30 min in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA), and electrophoresed for 1–1.5 h at 200 V, 10 °C. Gels were vacuum-dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Experimental conditions for DNase I footprinting matched those used for the gel shift assays except that 10 mm MgCl2 was included in the reaction mix. After the 30-min incubation at 20 °C, the mix was treated with DNase I (0.07 units) for 2 min and then quenched with EDTA. DNA was ethanol-precipitated and run in 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels against G + A and C + T chemical sequencing ladders of the 130-bp fragment (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed using the LexA-based system (24Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 18.16-18.47Google Scholar). N-terminal protein fusions to the LexA DNA-binding protein were constructed in plasmid pEG202, whereas those to the B42 transcriptional activation domain were in plasmid pJG4-5. Genes carA, carS, andcarS1 were PCR-amplified using genomic DNA as template and cloned into EcoRI-XhoI double-digested pEG202 or pJG4-5, and the respective constructs were designated pEG-Xor pJG-X, X referring to the gene cloned. The recipient yeast strain EGY48 was transformed by electroporation or by the lithium acetate method. Prior to use in the analysis of protein-protein interactions, self-activation and entry into the nucleus of the LexA fusion proteins were tested. pEG202 and pJG4-5-based constructs were introduced in different pairwise combinations into EGY48 cells bearing pSH18-34. Cells containing all three plasmids were streaked on galactose plates supplemented with or without leucine, and interaction was assessed by monitoring expression of the two reporter genes as follows: (i) by analyzing growth on plates lacking leucine; (ii) by the development of blue color when plates were subjected to the X-gal overlay assay (32Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Measurements of β-galactosidase activity were done as described previously (33Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar). In pull-down assays, 50 μl of TALON metal affinity resin in a 1.5-ml tube was washed twice with 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by centrifuging at 700 × g for 3 min and removing the supernatant. His6-CarA (50 μl of 5 μm protein stock) was then bound to the resin in separate tubes for 1 h at 25 °C, after which unbound protein was removed by washing three times with the above binding buffer. Thrombin-cleaved CarS was added in excess (50 μl of 35 μm stock) to the resin-bound His6-tagged protein and to the resin alone (as control). After allowing to bind for 2 h (or overnight) at 25 °C, unbound protein was again removed by washing three times with 500 μl of binding buffer. Then the protein-bound resin was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 100 μl of binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The supernatant recovered from the resin by centrifugation was then analyzed in a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. An AKTA high performance liquid chromatography unit and a Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 200 mm NaCl in buffer A containing 5% or 25% glycerol, and with or without 1 mm CHAPS, were used in size-exclusion experiments. 100 μl of 5–50 μm protein samples were injected, and the elution was tracked by absorbances at 280, 235, and 220 nm at flow rates of 0.2–0.4 ml/min. The column calibration using as standards (all from Sigma) cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa), blue dextran (2 MDa; to determine void volume, V 0) and vitamin B12 (to estimate total bed volume,V t) yielded: log M r = 7.91–0.23 V e (correlation coefficient ≥0.99) in buffer A, 200 mm NaCl. V e, the elution volume, was assigned for each peak after verifying its identity by SDS-PAGE and used to determine the molecular weight,M r. A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, and a Ti60 rotor with 6-sector Epon charcoal centerpieces of 12-mm optical path length, was used for sedimentation equilibrium measurements. 70-μl samples (5–50 μm protein) in 50 mm NaCl, buffer A were centrifuged at 13,000, 18,000, or 25,000 rpm and 20 °C to equilibrium (verified when consecutive radial scans acquired in 2-h intervals, and monitored at 230, 236, or 275 nm, were superimposable). Apparent weight average molecular weight (M̄ w) was determined by fitting data (program EQASSOC-Beckman) to the equation for an ideal solution containing a single species (34Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar, 35Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes,v̄, (in ml/g) calculated from the amino acid compositions (36Laue T.M. Shak B.D.

A 1058-bp DNA segment upstream of orf1 has been shown to encompass all the cis-acting elements required for the correct in vivo expression and regulation of PB(17Botella J.A. Murillo F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we narrowed down this DNA segment to a shorter yet functionally competent length of 130 bp, spanning positions −102 to +28 relative to the transcription start point. Features identified in this fragment are shown in Fig.2 A. Direct in vivoevidence that this 130-bp DNA fragment contains all the cis-acting elements required for the correct expression of PB was obtained as follows. Plasmid pMAR191, which contains the 130-bp fragment-lacZ transcriptional fusion (see “Experimental Procedures”), was introduced into M. xanthus wild-type strain DK1050 by electroporation. Chromosomal integration of the plasmid via homologous recombination was selected for by growth in the presence of kanamycin. On plates containing X-gal, DK1050-derived electroporants showed the light-inducible phenotype expected for PB. Quantitative analysis of β-galactosidase activity for dark- and light-grown cultures of several of these electroporants provided results directly comparable with those reported previously with the longer 1058-bp stretch of DNA upstream of orf1(Fig. 2 B; see Ref. 17Botella J.A. Murillo F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pMAR191 introduced into strain MR844, where part of the carA gene is deleted, yielded electroporants that showed the constitutive, light-independent expression of the lacZ reporter gene expected for carA lack-of-function mutants (Fig.2 C). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, control electroporation experiments with pMAR192 (where the 130-bp fragment is fused to the lacZ gene in the opposite orientation relative to pMAR191) gave rise to electroporants expressing low levels of basal β-galactosidase activity, which remained the same irrespective of the genetic background (wild type or MR844) or growth conditions (dark or light). Thus, we conclude that the 130-bp DNA fragment includes all of the cis-acting elements essential for the correct regulation and expression of the carB promoter. The paring-down experiment discussed above provides a DNA fragment that is sufficiently short for use in DNA binding assays, yet fully functionalin vivo. To verify binding of CarA to the carBpromoter/operator region, purified His6-CarA was used in gel mobility shift assays using as probe the 130-bp DNA fragment (CCR, c arB control region). His6-CarA was purified under native conditions or under denaturing conditions followed by renaturation (see “Experimental Procedures”). These and other proteins used in this work were ≥95% pure, and their mobilities in SDS-PAGE were those expected based on the molecular weights (Fig.3 A). EMSA analysis of CarA binding to probe CCR was characterized by two retarded bands that appeared as a function of CarA concentration (Fig.3 B). Only the higher mobility species (lower band) was apparent at the lowest concentrations of CarA used in these assays (4–8 nm; lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 3 B). The lower mobility complex (upper band) appeared with increasing CarA concentration and became the predominant species at the highest concentrations of CarA used (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6 and 7). This concentration-dependent appearance of the lower mobility band may reflect different modes of CarA binding to CCR, as a consequence of distinct binding sites on the DNA and cooperativity between these binding modes. It could also reflect specific DNA binding by higher oligomeric form(s) of CarA that could be increasingly populated as the protein concentration is raised. That the binding of CarA is probe-specific was demonstrated by the fact that addition of excess cold CCR probe effectively competed in EMSA. It may be noted that these results obtained with His6-CarA purified under native conditions were reproducible with purified, renatured His6-CarA. Hence, CarA manifests the DNA binding ability predicted from its sequence analysis, and moreover, it binds specifically within the region of the PB promoter shown to be essential in vivo. The 130-bp CCR probe used above contains a palindromic DNA sequence upstream of the −35 region which, by analogy with MerR proteins, could be a potential binding site for CarA. It also includes two direct repeats (one overlapping with the palindrome and the other lying between the −35 and −10 regions, Fig. 2 A), an arrangement reminiscent of the operator for the Bacillus subtilis DeoR repressor of thedra-nupC-pd"
https://openalex.org/W2009166071,"Abstract In the inner medullary collecting duct of the terminal nephron, the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) plays a major role in determining urinary sodium content. This nephron segment, by virtue of its medullary location, is subject to very high levels of extracellular tonicity. We have examined the ability of medium tonicity to regulate the activity and expression of this receptor in cultured rat inner medullary collecting duct cells. We found that NaCl (75 mm) and sucrose (150 mm), but not urea (150 mm), increased natriuretic peptide receptor activity, gene expression, and promoter activity. The osmotic stimulus also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In the latter instance the β isoform was selectively activated. Inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 blocked the osmotic induction of receptor activity and expression, as well as receptor gene promoter activity, whereas inhibition of ERK with PD98059 had no effect. Cotransfection of p38β MAPK together with the receptor gene promoter resulted in amplification of the osmotic stimulation of the latter, whereas cotransfection of dominant negative MKK6, but not dominant-negative MEK, completely blocked the osmotic induction of receptor promoter activity. Collectively, the data indicate that extracellular osmolality stimulates receptor activity and receptor gene expression through a specific p38β-dependent mechanism, raising the possibility that changes in medullary tonicity could play an important role in the regulation of renal sodium handling in the terminal nephron."

Although basic energetic principles are understood, elucidation of the specific roles of side chain residues and lipids in membrane protein insertion and folding has proven challenging due to the hydrophobic nature of these proteins (for a discussion see Ref. 1Popot J.-L. Engelman D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). To address these issues, several investigators (2Wang C. Deber C.M. J. Biol.

By using such a system, for example, the detailed molecular associations involved in helix-helix packing of the glycophorin A homodimer have been determined (7MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar); this system has also been used to investigate the role of micellar detergents in modulating interhelical associations in glycophorin A (8Fisher L.E. Engelman D.M. Sturgis J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been surmised from both theoretical and experimental considerations that the nature of surrounding lipids affects membrane protein conformation and, presumably, interhelical contacts (9Bechinger B.

To gain further insight into helix-helix interactions in polytopic membrane proteins, we have studied the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 1CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorTMtransmembranePFOperfluorooctanoatelyso-PClyso-phosphatidylcholinelyso-PGlyso-phosphatidylglycerolOPCoctanoyl-PCNPCnonanoyl-PCCPCcaproyl-PCLPClauroyl-PCMPCmyristoyl-PCPPCpalmitoyl-PCLPG-lauroyl-PGMPG, myristoyl-PGPPGpalmitoyl-PGSPGstearoyl-PGEMRexcimer-to-monomer ratio the chloride channel associated with cystic fibrosis (14Sheppard D.N.

Although few details are available concerning the structure of the membrane domain of this protein, experiments using peptides corresponding to the individual transmembrane (TM) segments have revealed that TMs 1–6 are α-helical in detergent micelles (15Wigley W.C. Vijayakumar S. Jones J.D. Slaughter C. Thomas P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 844-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and that TMs 2 and 6 can form ion channels similar to intact CFTR (16Oblatt-Montal M. Reddy G.L. Iwamoto T. Tomich J.M. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, Akabas and co-workers (17Akabas M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,18Akabas M.H. Cheung M. Guinamard R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that residues in TMs 1, 3, and 6 may line the pore of the CFTR channel, whereas studies on the mechanism of CFTR folding have revealed that the net charge of residues that flank TM 4 are important in mediating the proper membrane insertion of TMs 3 and 4 (19Chen M. Zhang J.-T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Results obtained in our laboratory have shown that a construct comprising the third and fourth TM segments of CFTR (designated TM 3–4) spontaneously inserts into detergent micelles in an α-helical conformation (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, initial structural experiments using a gel migration assay have shown that hydrogen bonds can stabilize interhelical associations in certain forms of this construct (21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator transmembrane perfluorooctanoate lyso-phosphatidylcholine lyso-phosphatidylglycerol octanoyl-PC nonanoyl-PC caproyl-PC lauroyl-PC myristoyl-PC palmitoyl-PC MPG, myristoyl-PG palmitoyl-PG stearoyl-PG excimer-to-monomer ratio In the present report, we use pyrene as a fluorescent probe of the distance between the two membrane helices of TM 3–4 constructs. By covalently labeling the extremities of the two TM segments in TM 3–4 with pyrene, we show that the two helices are in proximity in detergent micelles, indicating tight helix-helix interactions. Furthermore, we use the pyrene-labeled CFTR TM 3–4 construct to show that the extent of interhelical packing within a polytopic membrane protein is dependent on the nature of the head group and the length of the acyl chain of the micellar detergent. These experiments provide insight into the effects of lipids and hydrophobic mismatch on interhelical packing in membrane proteins, as well as demonstrate the general utility of this pyrene-labeled system for the study of helical interactions in polytopic membrane proteins. The construct used in this study, 2C, is a version of the wild type TM 3–4 construct (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which encompasses amino acids 194–241 of CFTR (boldface in the following sequence) and spans TM segments 3 and 4 of this protein. The 2C construct has the following sequence: GSGMKETAAAKFERQHMDSPDLGTDDDD C KAMGLALAHFVWIAPLQVALMGLIWELLQASAFAGLGFLIVLALFQAGLGLE C HHHHHH. It should be noted that Cys-225 was mutated to Ala, and two cysteines (underlined) were introduced, one at the N-terminal end of TM 3 and the other at the C-terminal end of TM 4, as described in Ref. 21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. The N-terminal domain is inherent to the pET32a vector and contains an S-tag for immunological identification (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The construct was expressed and purified as described previously (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 2C construct purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography was lyophilized and resuspended at a final concentration of 50 μm in labeling buffer (2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm tris-carboxyethylphosphine, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). Pyrene iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (20 mm) was added dropwise while vortexing to a final concentration of 1 mm. The solution was stirred overnight in the dark at room temperature, the insoluble material removed by centrifugation, and the pyrene-labeled construct (2C-P) purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the reaction was determined by calculating the molar ratio of pyrene concentration, calculated using ε339 = 26,000m−1 cm−1, to protein concentration, determined using the bicinchoninic acid method with reagents from Pierce and according to the manufacturer's specifications. The 2C-P construct was lyophilized and dissolved (at 1 μm or varying concentrations, as described under “Results”) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing one of the following: 34 mm SDS, 20 mm lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), 20 mm lyso-phosphatidylglycerol (lyso-PG), or 50 mm sodium perfluorooctanoate (Na-PFO). Fluorescence emission (λexc = 345 nm) was measured at room temperature in an LPS-220B fluorescence spectrometer (PTI). For CD spectroscopy measurements, constructs were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm lauroyl-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) or lauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LPG) at a concentration of 10 μm; CD absorption spectra were recorded as described previously (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 2C-P protein (1 μg) was analyzed by PFO-PAGE (NuPAGE system; NOVEX) as described in Ref. 22Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.-J. Garami E.

Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. We have described previously the expression and purification of TM 3–4 constructs, which comprise the third and fourth TM segments of CFTR (residues 194–241) (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To obtain detailed information on the interhelical packing of TM segments 3 and 4, we took advantage of the unique fluorescent properties of pyrene, a fluorophore capable of forming excited dimers, or excimers, when two molecules are in proximity and allowed to stack together (23Lehrer S.S. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of pyrene, when excited at 345 nm, consists of ordered bands at 385 and 405 nm; however, the stacking of two pyrene molecules results in the appearance of an excimer band centered around 480 nm. Thus, the ratio of excimer band to monomer band is a measure of the extent to which pyrene is able to dimerize. As such, pyrene molecules covalently attached to both the N-terminal end of TM segment 3 and to the C-terminal end of TM segment 4 should form excimers only when the TM 3 and 4 helical segments are interacting tightly. Because pyrene is available commercially as a cysteine-reactive molecule (pyrene iodoacetamide), we mutated TM 3–4 in the following ways (see also Ref. 21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar): (i) Cys-225 was mutated to Ala to remove any other possible reactive sites, and (ii) Cys residues were inserted at the ends of TM segments 3 and 4. The resulting construct, designated 2C, was then used in a subsequent reaction with pyrene iodoacetamide to form 2C-P. To test the efficiency of the pyrene-labeling reaction, we determined the ratio of pyrene molecules to protein molecules (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although there was some variation between preparations, the ratio ranged from 1.4 to 1.8, indicating a relatively high level of labeling (100% labeling corresponds to a ratio of 2.0). While individual experiments were carried out using a given preparation, the trends described below were observed for at least three separate preparations. As a first step toward determining whether and to what extent TM 3–4 constructs retain their expected “native” helical hairpin-like conformations in detergent micelles, we measured pyrene fluorescence (λexc= 345 nm) in four different detergents. Thus, as shown in Fig.1, 2C-P constructs have typical pyrene monomer peaks at ∼385 and ∼405 nm (24Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in PFO, LPC, LPG, and SDS micelles. In addition, a third, broader emission peak, centered at ∼480 nm is observed in all detergents. This excimer peak corresponds to “dimerization” of two pyrene molecules, with the ratio of the amplitudes of the excimer peak to the monomer peak (excimer-to-monomer ratio, denoted as EMR) a measure of the extent to which two pyrene molecules, and by extension, the two TM helices, interact (24Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 1 show that PFO is significantly more tolerant of such interactions compared with SDS, whereas LPG and LPC have intermediate, yet distinct, levels of tolerance. To eliminate the possibility that pyrene excimer fluorescence depends on secondary structure and/or complete insertion into detergent micelles, we compared the CD spectra of 2C-P constructs in LPC and LPG. As shown in Fig.2, the spectra in both detergents are consistent with an α-helical conformation and are indistinguishable under conditions similar to those used in the pyrene fluorescence experiments. By using the formula of Chen et al. (25Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), we calculated that the 2C-P construct is ≈60% α-helical in lysophospholipids, even though only ≈50% of the amino acid residues in the protein are predicted to lie in the α-helical membrane-spanning region. The slightly higher than expected helicity is explained by the probable presence of an α-helical component in the soluble domain of the protein; TM 3–4 constructs are less α-helical in SDS, a detergent that should completely denature soluble regions of proteins (21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Figure 2CD spectra of 2C-P constructs in LPC and LPG micelles. 2C-P protein was dissolved into detergent-containing buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), and CD spectra were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the EMR is largest in PFO, we used this detergent to demonstrate that excimer fluorescence results from intramolecular rather than intermolecular associations. As described by Liu et al. (26Liu W. Chen Y. Watrob H. Bartlett S.G. Jen-Jacobson L. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15457-15465Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this distinction can be made by measuring the dependence of the EMR on protein concentration. As shown in Fig.3, the EMR is invariable in the range 0.03–10 μm. A similar result was obtained in LPC and LPG micelles (not shown). In addition, PFO-PAGE analysis (22Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.-J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) of the 2C-P construct (Fig. 3, inset) shows no significant oligomerization of the protein, even though the protein exhibited excimer fluorescence in PFO-PAGE running buffer (not shown). These observations are consistent with intramolecular helix-helix interactions within a single TM 3–4 construct. We tested the role of acyl chain length on interhelical packing of TM 3–4 constructs in both lyso-PC and lyso-PG micelles. EMRs were measured for TM 3–4 constructs dissolved in lauroyl-PG (LPG), myristoyl-PG (MPG), palmitoyl-PG (PPG), and stearoyl-PG (SPG) as well as octanoyl-PC (OPC), nonanoyl-PC (NPC), capryl-PC (CPC), lauroyl-PC (LPC), myristoyl-PC (MPC), and palmitoyl-PC (PPC). All lyso-lipids were at a concentration of 20 mm, except OPC, which was at a concentration of 100 mm to account for its critical micellar concentration, which may be as high as 70 mm (27Stafford R.E. Fanni T. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pyrene fluorescence emission spectra in these various detergents are shown in Fig.4, A (lyso-PC), andB (lyso-PG), and the relationship between EMR and the number of carbons in the acyl chain for both lyso-lipids is shown in Fig.4 C. For comparison, the EMRs in PFO and SDS (measured using the same preparation of 2C-P protein) are also shown in Fig.4 C. The results show a distinct dependence of EMR on acyl chain length, with the highest EMR in detergents having an acyl chain of 9 carbons for LPC and 12 carbons for LPG. Although the results shown in Fig. 4, A and B, have been normalized to the monomer peak (at 385 nm), the non-normalized insets to these figures show that the increased intensity of excimer peaks in shorter chain detergents is at the expense of monomer peak intensity. Thus, overall fluorescence intensity is generally constant in the various detergents. Helix-loop-helix segments of membrane domains of multispanning membrane proteins constitute the minimal construct for study of intramolecular tertiary contacts between TM helices. In the present work, we have used such a “helical hairpin” construct from the first transmembrane domain of CFTR as a model for 2-TM segment protein-folding and insertion into detergent micelles. In addition, we have devised a pyrene-labeled system whereby intramolecular helix-helix interactions can be monitored and wherein the effects on helix-helix packing of various micellar detergents can be measured with a high degree of precision. The results define an important role of both the lipid head group and acyl chain length on the equilibrium between “closed” (helical hairpin loop) and “open” (helical rod-like) states of TM 3–4. The use of pyrene as a probe of protein conformation has been described previously for both soluble and membrane proteins (26Liu W. Chen Y. Watrob H. Bartlett S.G. Jen-Jacobson L. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15457-15465Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Graceffa P. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12273-12278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although the appearance of excimer fluorescence in our system provides proof that TM 3–4 constructs fold into a helical hairpin loop conformation in detergent micelles, it could be argued that the detergent-specific effects observed in this report are secondary to disruptions in pyrene-pyrene, rather than in helix-helix, interactions. Therefore, we carried out a series of control experiments using dithiothreitol which, upon reaction with pyrene maleimide, produces a molecule containing two pyrene groups, dipyrene-dithiothreitol, that forms excimers in solution (30Lehrer S.S. Ishii Y. Jameson D.M. Reinhart G.D. Fluorescent Biomolecules. 51. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 423-425Crossref Google Scholar). We found that whereas monomer band intensity was variable, the intensity of the excimer peak of dipyrene-dithiothreitol was not significantly affected in the presence of PFO, SDS, LPC, or LPG micelles versus its intensity in aqueous buffer (not shown); by contrast, the excimer peak intensity of the 2C-P construct was decreased by ∼65% in SDS compared with PFO. Although this control does not completely rule out the possibility that detergents might affect pyrene-pyrene interactions in the 2C-P construct, the following points also argue against such a possibility. First, the results presented herein are consistent with previous observations based on gel-migration shifts that SDS promotes a rod-like conformation for TM 3–4 constructs, whereas PFO tolerates a helical-hairpin fold (20Peng S. Liu L.-P. Emili A.Q. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, in view of the experiments shown in Fig. 4, we consider it unlikely that detergents will differentially interfere with pyrene-pyrene interactions based solely on their acyl chain lengths. In fact, Fig. 4 C shows that the EMRs for both lyso-PC and lyso-PG detergents fall within the range defined by SDS and PFO for constructs that are predominantly rod-like and hairpin-like in conformation, respectively. A striking result of this study is the non-disruptive nature of the detergent PFO (Fig. 1). Indeed, 2C-P constructs have very intense excimeric peaks in this detergent, an indication of the proximity of the N-terminal end of TM3 to the C-terminal end of TM4 and thus a measure of the high degree of interhelical packing. The direct inference can be drawn from this observation that tertiary contacts between helices are retained in this 2-TM segment of the full (6-TM) first transmembrane domain of CFTR, consistent with previous observations for TM domain fragments of other multispanning membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Popot J.-L. Engelman D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The relative tolerance of PFO for such interhelical interactions is a further manifestation of previous results (22Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.-J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showing that membrane proteins retain their oligomeric states in PAGE analysis when PFO is substituted for SDS. The higher EMR obtained in PFO micelles is also consistent with recent observations made in this laboratory using PFO-PAGE analysis (21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for stabilization of helix-helix packing in PFO is not immediately obvious, although the fluorinated acyl chains in PFO micelles are more rigid than those in the equivalent hydrogenated detergents (31Berr S.S. Jones R.R.M. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 2555-2558Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Shepherd F.H. Holzenburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a circumstance that may provide an extra level of stability. In comparison to results obtained in PFO micelles, SDS is a disruptive detergent that apparently does not tolerate weak van der Waals associations; we found that excimer peaks are much less intense in SDS, in agreement with experiments showing that this detergent disrupts homodimers of TM peptides in the absence of an interhelical hydrogen bond (4Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 33Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 34Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Results with lysophospholipids show that lyso-PC and lyso-PG detergents have a tolerance for helix-helix packing that is intermediate between those of SDS and PFO, yet distinct from each other. A comparison of EMRs in SDS (negatively charged head group), LPC (zwitterionic head group), and LPG (negatively charged head group), three detergents with acyl chains of equal length (12 carbons), shows that charge is not a major determinant of helix-helix packing per se, although the nature of the lipid head group is demonstrably an important contributor to helical packing. Another factor, which may affect these observations, is the variability in micelle size (i.e. aggregation number) among the detergents studied. For experiments aimed at determining the role of acyl chain length on interhelical packing, we used the water-soluble lysophospholipids lyso-PC and lyso-PG. Our results (Fig. 4) show that the EMR, and thus the extent of interaction between TMs 3 and 4, is highly dependent on acyl chain length. Thus, optimal interaction occurs in detergents with acyl chains of eight or nine carbons (in the case of lyso-PC) and decreases as the length of the acyl chain increases. We did not test the effect of lyso-PC detergents of fewer than 8 carbons or more than 16 carbons due to the high critical micellar concentration values of short chain lyso-PCs and the low water solubility of long chain lyso-PCs (27Stafford R.E. Fanni T. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35Stafford R.E. Dennis E.A. Colloids Surf. 1988; 30: 47-64Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The optimal helical packing of TM 3–4 constructs inserted into micelles formed by detergents with acyl chains of 9 carbons is not directly explicable in terms of the cross-sectional geometry of detergent micelles. Because TM helices 3 and 4 of CFTR are each 21 amino acids long (36Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar), corresponding to a length of ∼31.5 Å, they should be readily accommodated by the hydrophobic bilayer of most biological membranes (about 30 Å thick; see Ref. 1Popot J.-L. Engelman D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In the case of detergent micelles, the maximal diameter of their hydrophobic core can be approximated as twice the length of a fully extended acyl chain (37Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar) which, in the case of the eight carbon chains, is 20.6 Å (calculated using the formula in Ref. 37Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). A change of one methyl group increments this value by about 2.5 Å, so that the hydrophobic cores of micelles formed by NPC, CPC, LPC/LPG, MPC/MPG, PPC/PPG, and SPG are ∼23.1, 25.6, 30.7, 35.8, 40.8, and 45.9 Å, respectively. From these approximations, 12-carbon acyl chains would have been expected to minimize so-called hydrophobic mismatch upon insertion of TM 3–4 constructs. That LPC (12 carbons) seems to interfere somewhat with helical packing (compare the EMRs of LPC and NPC in Fig. 4) may indicate either that (i) lipid-inserted TM segments 3 and 4 are shorter than originally estimated, or (ii) the very insertion of the TM 3–4 protein into the micelles increases the effective diameter of their hydrophobic core such that 9-carbon detergent micelles are expanded to ideal size. In micelles of detergents that have acyl chains longer than 9 carbons, TMs 3 and 4 may be forced apart to prevent polar regions of the protein from interacting with the hydrophobic core. As depicted in Fig. 5, if the TM helices were to remain associated, the larger hydrophobic core would be predicted to engulf some of the more polar regions that flank the TM segment, producing an energetically untenable situation. In addition to yielding information on the role of the acyl chain on helix-helix interactions in this system, our experiments using detergents of varying acyl chain length provide evidence for the so-called two-stage model of membrane protein folding (38Popot J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Indeed, an uncoupling between tertiary structure, as measured by pyrene excimer fluorescence, and secondary structure, as measured by CD spectroscopy, is evident when comparing Figs. 1 and 2. These considerations support the view that TM helices form in the membrane previous to, and independently of, any tertiary contacts. Homodimerization of a peptide that contains a single TM segment has been shown to be highly dependent on the nature of the detergent micelle into which it inserts (8Fisher L.E. Engelman D.M. Sturgis J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, recent experiments have shown that hydrophobic mismatch between a TM segment and the lipid bilayer can alter the extent of inter-molecular oligomerization of model poly(Leu) peptides (13Ren J. Lew S. Wang J. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The results described in the present work not only extend these observations to intramolecular helix-helix associations but also suggest that native contacts between TM helices of a polytopic membrane protein can be altered both by the nature of the lipid head group and by hydrophobic mismatch. This is in agreement with previous reports (9Bechinger B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Dumas F. Lebrun M.C. Tocanne J.-F.

Biol. 2000; 302: 727-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that factors such as membrane composition and thickness are important determinants of protein conformation. The pyrene-labeled constructs described in this study should prove useful in evaluating the effects of various membrane substituents in future experiments using lipid vesicles. In addition, since TM 3–4 constructs represent a segment of the CFTR protein, experiments become feasible which test the effects of various cystic fibrosis phenotypic mutations on interhelical packing of TMs 3 and 4, as described for the mutant V232D (21Therien A.G. Grant F.E.M. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Such studies should provide insight into the molecular basis for some forms of CF disease, as well as lead to a better understanding of the role of individual amino acid residues in helix-helix packing."
https://openalex.org/W2014496815,"Cysteine-to-serine mutations were constructed to test the functional and structural significance of the three non-extracellular cysteine residues in ecto-nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3 (eNTPDase3). None of these cysteines were found to be essential for enzyme activity. However, Cys10, located on the short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, was found to be responsible for dimer formation occurring via oxidation during membrane preparation as well as for dimer cross-linking resulting from exogenously added sulfhydryl-specific cross-linking agents. The resistance to further cross-linking of these dimers into higher order oligomers by lysine-specific cross-linkers suggests that this enzyme may form its native tetrameric structure as a “dimer of dimers” with nonequivalent interactions between subunits. Cys501, located in the hydrophobic C-terminal membrane-spanning domain of eNTPDase3, was found to be the site of chemical modification by a sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMPS), leading to inhibition of enzyme activity. The effect of pCMPS was negligible after dissociation of the enzyme into monomers by Triton X-100, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition is dependent on the oligomeric structure. Because Cys501 is accessible for modification by the membrane-impermeant reagent pCMPS, we hypothesize that eNTPDase3 (and possibly other eNTPDases) contains a water-filled crevice allowing access of water and hydrophilic compounds to at least part of the protein's C-terminal membrane-spanning helix.

All 10 of these conserved residues are likely to be involved in the formation of five conserved disulfide bonds. Different members of the eNTPDase family contain various numbers of nonconserved cysteine residues located either in membrane-spanning helices or in the N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. These cysteine residues may exist as free sulfhydryls and are not expected to be involved in disulfide bond formation. The lone non-extracellular cysteine residue in human CD39 (eNTPDase1) is located on the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and has been shown to be palmitoylated (7Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Kittel A.

In this study, we mutated singly and in combination all three of the non-extracellular eNTPDase3 cysteine residues (not involved in disulfide bonds) to serine. These residues are localized to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (cysteine 10), the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix (cysteine 501), and the interface of the C-terminal membrane helix and the cytoplasm (cysteine 509), respectively. Although none of these cysteine residues were found to be essential for nucleotidase activity, cysteine 10 was identified as the residue responsible for oxidative dimer formation as well as for sulfhydryl-specific intermolecular cross-linking, and cysteine 501 was identified as the residue responsible for inhibition of the enzyme by the sulfhydryl-specific reagent pCMPS. pCMPS has been shown to inhibit several eNTPDases (15Shi X.

Therefore, its ability to react with cysteine 501, which is located in the C-terminal membrane-spanning region of the protein, was surprising. We interpret this result as indicating that the part of the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix containing residue 501 must be solvent-accessible, possibly suggesting a water-filled crevice in the membrane-spanning region involved in the formation of the quaternary structure of eNTPDase3, and perhaps in the other membranous eNTPDases as well.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of three non-extracellular cysteine residues in eNTPDase3. None of the cysteines were essential for nucleotidase activity; however, the C10S mutation did result in an increased expression level for the enzyme in transfected COS cells, and the triple cysteine-to-serine mutant, although expressed at a higher level, was slightly less active than the wild-type enzyme when normalized for expression level.The cysteine residue present in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Cys10) was found to be the residue responsible for both dimer formation occurring via oxidation of the wild-type enzyme during membrane preparation and dimer formation due to sulfhydryl-specific chemical cross-linking with BMOE (Fig. 2). There is a cysteine residue in the short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD39 (eNTPDase1) that is analogous to cysteine 10 in eNTPDase 3. In eNTPDase1, this residue is palmitoylated (7Koziak K.

This is clearly not the case for Cys10of eNTPDase3, at least not for the enzyme expressed in COS cells, because this cysteine must be present as a free sulfhydryl to be cross-linked and oxidized to a disulfide. It is clear that dimers of wild-type eNTPDase3 observed on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels are due to oxidation of the Cys10 sulfhydryl to disulfides during harvesting and homogenization of cells because only a small amount of dimers was formed in eNTPDase3 COS cell membranes prepared in the presence of either alkylating or reducing agents (Fig. 3). In addition, this oxidative cross-linking of the wild-type enzyme can be increased by intentional exposure to air during freeze-thaw of the COS membrane preparations, as was done to generate the data in Fig.2 B.Experiments on sequential cross-linking of eNTPDase3 with sulfhydryl- and amino-specific reagents suggest that, in a native tetramer (25Stoscheck C.M.

Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the monomers are more efficiently cross-linked within a dimer than between two dimers. In other words, the four monomers in a tetramer are not equally likely to be cross-linked to each other. This is evident in Fig. 4, where amino group cross-linking (DSS and glutaraldehyde), subsequent to sulfhydryl-specific cross-linking via cysteine 10 (BMOE), resulted in the formation of very little additional trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers, leaving the dimer as the predominant cross-linked form.

By examining pCMPS inhibition of wild-type and mutant eNTPDase3, we showed in this study that modification of cysteine 501 is primarily responsible for inhibition of nucleotidase activity by pCMPS in eNTPDase3 (Fig. 5). This result is somewhat surprising due to the location of cysteine 501 in the membrane-spanning region near the C-terminal end of the protein. Under physiological conditions and the conditions used in this study, pCMPS is a permanently charged and therefore membrane-impermeant reagent (18Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J.

We interpret this result as indicating the presence of an aqueous cavity or crevice in the vicinity of cysteine 501; and thus, the interior of the membrane-spanning region surrounding cysteine 501 must be solvent-accessible. This interpretation is consistent with other systems in which pCMPS was used to determine the solvent accessibility of cysteine residues in membrane-spanning regions of proteins containing aqueous pores or crevices (19Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Ding P.Z. Wilson T.H.

One possibility is that modification of cysteine 501 in a membrane-spanning region results in decreased or modified interactions of the membrane-spanning segments in the native tetrameric structure. This is a reasonable postulate because it has been shown that the membrane-spanning regions are important for maintaining the tetrameric structure and the enzyme activity of eNTPDase1 (CD39) (29Wang T.-F., Ou, Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test this possibility for mechanism of inactivation, we dissociated tetrameric eNTPDase3 into monomers by solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 6) and examined the effect of pCMPS on solubilized monomeric enzyme. The fact that pCMPS no longer substantially inhibited the residual nucleotidase activity after solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 7) suggests that this inhibition is dependent upon the oligomeric structure of eNTPDase3. The non-additive inhibitory effects of pCMPS and Triton X-100 on the nucleotidase activities of eNTPDase3 (Fig. 8) also suggest a common mechanism of enzyme inactivation by these two reagents, mediated by a weakening or disruption of the oligomeric structure.Knowles and co-workers (17Caldwell C.C. Hornyak S.C. Pendleton E. Campbell D. Knowles A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have reported that pCMPS inhibits chicken muscle ecto-ATPase (eNTPDase2). These authors hypothesized that a cysteine residue located at the interface between the N-terminal membrane-spanning region and the large extracellular loop (cysteine 23) is the most likely target for modification by pCMPS, leading to inhibition of nucleotidase activity by interfering with that enzyme's oligomerization. The data presented in our study, using site-directed mutagenesis of eNTPDase3, are consistent with their hypothesis in that the pCMPS-induced inhibition of eNTPDase3 is mediated by interfering with monomer-monomer interactions in the native tetrameric quaternary structure. However, the proposed location of the cysteine residue responsible for inhibition of nucleotidase activity by pCMPS in chicken eNTPDase2 (the extracellular face of the N-terminal membrane-spanning segment) is different from the location of the pCMPS-reactive cysteine reside found in this work because cysteine 501 of eNTPDase3 is located deep within the C-terminal membrane-spanning region, slightly closer to the cytoplasmic face than to the extracellular face of the cell membrane.A diagram summarizing the results and conclusions from this study is presented in Fig. 9. Cysteine 10, located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, is shown to be the site of sulfhydryl cross-linking. Cysteine 501, located in the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix, is depicted to be accessible to pCMPS and water. Cysteine 509, located at the interface of the membrane and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, is depicted at the mouth of the hypothesized aqueous crevice. DSS and glutaraldehyde cross-linking is depicted as occurring on the extracellular loops because most of the lysine residues and most of the protein mass are contained in the extracellular domain.Because the transmembrane domains greatly modulate the nucleotidase activity of eNTPDases (17Caldwell C.C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), future understanding of the interactions of the membrane-spanning helices, both within monomers and between monomers in the native tetramer, will be dependent on the delineation of the details of the aqueous crevice that has been postulated in this work. Further investigation of the extent and functional significance of this aqueous crevice in the transmembrane regions of eNTPDase3 and the existence of such an aqueous crevice in other membranous eNTPDases should lead to a better understanding of the structure and function of these enzymes.

All 10 of these conserved residues are likely to be involved in the formation of five conserved disulfide bonds. Different members of the eNTPDase family contain various numbers of nonconserved cysteine residues located either in membrane-spanning helices or in the N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. These cysteine residues may exist as free sulfhydryls and are not expected to be involved in disulfide bond formation. The lone non-extracellular cysteine residue in human CD39 (eNTPDase1) is located on the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and has been shown to be palmitoylated (7Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Kittel A.

In this study, we mutated singly and in combination all three of the non-extracellular eNTPDase3 cysteine residues (not involved in disulfide bonds) to serine. These residues are localized to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (cysteine 10), the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix (cysteine 501), and the interface of the C-terminal membrane helix and the cytoplasm (cysteine 509), respectively. Although none of these cysteine residues were found to be essential for nucleotidase activity, cysteine 10 was identified as the residue responsible for oxidative dimer formation as well as for sulfhydryl-specific intermolecular cross-linking, and cysteine 501 was identified as the residue responsible for inhibition of the enzyme by the sulfhydryl-specific reagent pCMPS. pCMPS has been shown to inhibit several eNTPDases (15Shi X.

Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, its ability to react with cysteine 501, which is located in the C-terminal membrane-spanning region of the protein, was surprising. We interpret this result as indicating that the part of the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix containing residue 501 must be solvent-accessible, possibly suggesting a water-filled crevice in the membrane-spanning region involved in the formation of the quaternary structure of eNTPDase3, and perhaps in the other membranous eNTPDases as well. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of three non-extracellular cysteine residues in eNTPDase3. None of the cysteines were essential for nucleotidase activity; however, the C10S mutation did result in an increased expression level for the enzyme in transfected COS cells, and the triple cysteine-to-serine mutant, although expressed at a higher level, was slightly less active than the wild-type enzyme when normalized for expression level.The cysteine residue present in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Cys10) was found to be the residue responsible for both dimer formation occurring via oxidation of the wild-type enzyme during membrane preparation and dimer formation due to sulfhydryl-specific chemical cross-linking with BMOE (Fig. 2). There is a cysteine residue in the short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD39 (eNTPDase1) that is analogous to cysteine 10 in eNTPDase 3. In eNTPDase1, this residue is palmitoylated (7Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Kittel A. Sevigny J. Blusztajn J.K. Schulte Am Esch J., II Imai M. Guckelberger O. Goepfert C. Qawi I. Robson S.C. J. Biol.

Cysteine 501, located in the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix, is depicted to be accessible to pCMPS and water. Cysteine 509, located at the interface of the membrane and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, is depicted at the mouth of the hypothesized aqueous crevice. DSS and glutaraldehyde cross-linking is depicted as occurring on the extracellular loops because most of the lysine residues and most of the protein mass are contained in the extracellular domain.Because the transmembrane domains greatly modulate the nucleotidase activity of eNTPDases (17Caldwell C.C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), future understanding of the interactions of the membrane-spanning helices, both within monomers and between monomers in the native tetramer, will be dependent on the delineation of the details of the aqueous crevice that has been postulated in this work. Further investigation of the extent and functional significance of this aqueous crevice in the transmembrane regions of eNTPDase3 and the existence of such an aqueous crevice in other membranous eNTPDases should lead to a better understanding of the structure and function of these enzymes. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of three non-extracellular cysteine residues in eNTPDase3. None of the cysteines were essential for nucleotidase activity; however, the C10S mutation did result in an increased expression level for the enzyme in transfected COS cells, and the triple cysteine-to-serine mutant, although expressed at a higher level, was slightly less active than the wild-type enzyme when normalized for expression level. The cysteine residue present in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Cys10) was found to be the residue responsible for both dimer formation occurring via oxidation of the wild-type enzyme during membrane preparation and dimer formation due to sulfhydryl-specific chemical cross-linking with BMOE (Fig. 2). There is a cysteine residue in the short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD39 (eNTPDase1) that is analogous to cysteine 10 in eNTPDase 3. In eNTPDase1, this residue is palmitoylated (7Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Kittel A. Sevigny J. Blusztajn J.K. Schulte Am Esch J., II Imai M. Guckelberger O. Goepfert C. Qawi I. Robson S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is clearly not the case for Cys10of eNTPDase3, at least not for the enzyme expressed in COS cells, because this cysteine must be present as a free sulfhydryl to be cross-linked and oxidized to a disulfide. It is clear that dimers of wild-type eNTPDase3 observed on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels are due to oxidation of the Cys10 sulfhydryl to disulfides during harvesting and homogenization of cells because only a small amount of dimers was formed in eNTPDase3 COS cell membranes prepared in the presence of either alkylating or reducing agents (Fig. 3). In addition, this oxidative cross-linking of the wild-type enzyme can be increased by intentional exposure to air during freeze-thaw of the COS membrane preparations, as was done to generate the data in Fig.2 B. Experiments on sequential cross-linking of eNTPDase3 with sulfhydryl- and amino-specific reagents suggest that, in a native tetramer (25Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,26Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the monomers are more efficiently cross-linked within a dimer than between two dimers. In other words, the four monomers in a tetramer are not equally likely to be cross-linked to each other. This is evident in Fig. 4, where amino group cross-linking (DSS and glutaraldehyde), subsequent to sulfhydryl-specific cross-linking via cysteine 10 (BMOE), resulted in the formation of very little additional trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers, leaving the dimer as the predominant cross-linked form. Considering these data and previous work, both in our laboratory (30Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and by Knowles and co-workers (17Caldwell C.C. Hornyak S.C. Pendleton E. Campbell D. Knowles A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using chicken muscle eNTPDase2 (ecto-ATPase), as well as evidence presented by Wang et al. (29Wang T.-F., Ou, Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) demonstrating that CD39 (eNTPDase1) is dimeric after solubilization with the detergent sodium cholate, we propose that, although all of the membranous eNTPDases exist as native tetramers (29Wang T.-F., Ou, Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Hicks-Berger C.A. Kirley T.L. Int. Union of Biochem. Mol. Biol. Life. 2000; 50: 43-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), these tetramers are not 4-fold symmetric, but instead are composed of an asymmetric “dimer of dimers,” where the interaction between two monomers in each dimer is different and stronger than the interaction between the two dimers forming the tetramer. It has been previously demonstrated that some eNTPDases are inhibited by mercurial sulfhydryl group-selective reagents such as pCMPS (15Shi X. Knowles A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 35: 177-184Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Caldwell C.C. Davis M.D. Knowles A.F. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 2001; 387: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By examining pCMPS inhibition of wild-type and mutant eNTPDase3, we showed in this study that modification of cysteine 501 is primarily responsible for inhibition of nucleotidase activity by pCMPS in eNTPDase3 (Fig. 5). This result is somewhat surprising due to the location of cysteine 501 in the membrane-spanning region near the C-terminal end of the protein. Under physiological conditions and the conditions used in this study, pCMPS is a permanently charged and therefore membrane-impermeant reagent (18Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M.

A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was unexpected that this reagent could react with a cysteine residue predicted to be inside the plasma membrane. We interpret this result as indicating the presence of an aqueous cavity or crevice in the vicinity of cysteine 501; and thus, the interior of the membrane-spanning region surrounding cysteine 501 must be solvent-accessible. This interpretation is consistent with other systems in which pCMPS was used to determine the solvent accessibility of cysteine residues in membrane-spanning regions of proteins containing aqueous pores or crevices (19Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Ding P.Z. Wilson T.H.

Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The question remains as to how modification of cysteine 501 in the membrane-spanning domain inhibits nucleotidase activity that is catalyzed by a large extracellular domain of eNTPDase3, far removed from the membrane-spanning segments and cysteine 501. One possibility is that modification of cysteine 501 in a membrane-spanning region results in decreased or modified interactions of the membrane-spanning segments in the native tetrameric structure. This is a reasonable postulate because it has been shown that the membrane-spanning regions are important for maintaining the tetrameric structure and the enzyme activity of eNTPDase1 (CD39) (29Wang T.-F., Ou, Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test this possibility for mechanism of inactivation, we dissociated tetrameric eNTPDase3 into monomers by solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 6) and examined the effect of pCMPS on solubilized monomeric enzyme. The fact that pCMPS no longer substantially inhibited the residual nucleotidase activity after solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 7) suggests that this inhibition is dependent upon the oligomeric structure of eNTPDase3. The non-additive inhibitory effects of pCMPS and Triton X-100 on the nucleotidase activities of eNTPDase3 (Fig. 8) also suggest a common mechanism of enzyme inactivation by these two reagents, mediated by a weakening or disruption of the oligomeric structure. Knowles and co-workers (17Caldwell C.C. Hornyak S.C. Pendleton E. Campbell D. Knowles A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have reported that pCMPS inhibits chicken muscle ecto-ATPase (eNTPDase2). These authors hypothesized that a cysteine residue located at the interface between the N-terminal membrane-spanning region and the large extracellular loop (cysteine 23) is the most likely target for modification by pCMPS, leading to inhibition of nucleotidase activity by interfering with that enzyme's oligomerization. The data presented in our study, using site-directed mutagenesis of eNTPDase3, are consistent with their hypothesis in that the pCMPS-induced inhibition of eNTPDase3 is mediated by interfering with monomer-monomer interactions in the native tetrameric quaternary structure. However, the proposed location of the cysteine residue responsible for inhibition of nucleotidase activity by pCMPS in chicken eNTPDase2 (the extracellular face of the N-terminal membrane-spanning segment) is different from the location of the pCMPS-reactive cysteine reside found in this work because cysteine 501 of eNTPDase3 is located deep within the C-terminal membrane-spanning region, slightly closer to the cytoplasmic face than to the extracellular face of the cell membrane.

Whereas cytokine induction of gene products promoting inflammation and proliferation is well characterized, little is known about the concomitant down-regulation of potentially counter-regulatory gene products in these cells. By employing the suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR technique, RNA isolated from rat aortic SMC treated with the cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was subtracted from RNA of control cells. Eleven genes were identified, the expression of which fell by 44–77%. One, the transcriptional repressor splicing factor-1 or zfm1, was characterized further. Antisense oligonucleotide suppression of zfm1 protein synthesis mimicked the stimulatory effects of IL-1β and TNFα on SMC proliferation and expression of the chemokine MCP-1 and the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Moreover, in an in vivo mouse model of atherosclerosis, zfm1 abundance was decreased in proliferating arterial SMC. These findings suggest a role for zfm1 in controlling both proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory gene products in SMC. Therefore, cytokine-induced down-regulation of zfm1 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of hyperproliferative inflammatory diseases.

The consequences of a prolonged exposure of bystander cells to these cytokines are best characterized for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in atherosclerosis (1Nilsson J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with several animal models demonstrating de-differentiation of SMC upon cytokine exposure. Thus, porcine vascular SMC treated with IL-1β undergo phenotype changesin vivo very much like that of neointimal SMC in atherosclerotic lesions (2Fukumoto Y. Shimokawa H. Ito A. Kadokami T.

Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα are highly expressed in humans during various inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis (4Simon A.D. Yazdani S. Wang W. Schwartz A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 197-204Crossref Google Scholar)), capable of recruiting circulating leukocytes to the site of inflammation. The infiltrating leukocytes in turn activate adjacent bystander cells resulting in increased mitogenesis. Moreover, MCP-1 not only acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes but also can directly induce proliferation and de-differentiation of vascular SMC (9Porreca E., Di Febbo C. Reale M. Castellani M.L.

Although MCP-1 and VCAM-1 play an important role in cytokine-induced inflammation as, e.g. in atherosclerosis, it is unlikely that they are the only important components of the pro-inflammatory response to IL-1β plus TNFα. Therefore, in addition to the many known genes induced by IL-1β plus TNFα, it is important to identify gene products, which help to maintain the phenotype of bystander cells in inflamed tissue, but are down-regulated upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. To identify such gene products, cultured vascular SMC were used as a model system. Subtractive hybridization of cDNA derived from rat aortic cultured SMC, which were exposed to IL-1β plus TNFα, against cDNA isolated from quiescent SMC combined with suppression PCR analysis (11Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rat aortic SMC were isolated by the explant technique and serially cultured up to passage 4 as previously described (12Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Culture media were exchanged 1 h before the start of the incubations in the absence or presence of IL-1β (60 units/ml) plus TNFα (1000 units/ml), as indicated in the “Results” section. Determination of cell number was performed with the CyQuant kit (Molecular Probes via MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of total RNA from the cells and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (12Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for PCR: MCP-1: 5′-ACCTGCTGCTACTCATTCACT-3′, 5′-CATCTTGCATTTAAGGATTTCT-3′ (product spans 1 intron in the rat MCP-1 gene, cDNA length is 454 bp); VCAM-1: 5′-TGGAGCAAGAAATTAGATAATGG-3′, 5′-CACATGTACAGGAGATGATGAC-3′ (product spans 1 intron in the humanVCAM-1 gene, cDNA length is 1104 bp); EF-2: 5′-GACATCACCAAGGGTGTGCAG-3′, 5′-GCGGTCAGCACACTGGCATA-3′ (no intron-spanning product, cDNA length is 220 bp); iNOS: 5′-ATGGCTTGCCCCTGGAAGTTTCTC-3′, 5′-CCTCTGATGGTGCCATCGGGCATCTG-3′, (product spans 2 introns in the human gene; cDNA length is 826 bp); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCG-3′, 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′ (product spans 1 intron in the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegene, cDNA length is 571 bp), zyxin: 5′-CCAACTCCAGCACCTAAGTTTG-3′, 5′-ATTTGCCACAGGACTCATTCAC-3′ (product spans 1 intron in the humanzyxin gene, cDNA length is 385 bp); HMG-17: 5′-GACCAGGCACAGAAAGCTG-3′, 5′-CAGGTTCCACAGGTCTCTG-3′ (product spans 1 intron in the human HMG-17 gene, cDNA length is 449 bp); zfm1: 5′-AGGAGCGGCACACCCTTATTAC-3′, 5′-GCCAGGCCTCTGAAATTTGC-3 (product spans 3 introns in the humansplicing factor-1/zfm1 gene and amplifies all zfm1 splice variants known thus far, cDNA length is 575 bp). To analyze zfm1 splicing variants A and E (13Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the common forward primer and specific reverse primers (with sequences not present in the other variant) were used (zfm1A: 5′-CAAAGTTAGAAGGGTCCATG-3′, cDNA length is 1416 bp; zfm1E 5′-GTCCTCACTCTCTCATGGCTCG-3′, cDNA length is 1074 bp). For all primers except HMG-17 (annealing temperature 60 °C), 58 °C was established to be the optimal annealing temperature. To be within the exponential phase of the semi-quantitative PCR reaction, the appropriate number of cycles was newly established for every set of samples. For the qualitative analysis of zfm1A and zfm1E, 40 cycles were performed to ensure that even background expression of either variant was detected. Nuclear run-on analyses were performed as described previously (12Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, SMC were incubated with the cytokines for 3 h before the nuclei were isolated and processed further. Aliquots (2 μg) of poly(A)+ RNA preparations (samples from non-stimulated and cytokine-stimulated cultured SMC) were subjected to reverse transcription, subtraction, and suppression PCR with the PCR-Select kit from BD Biosciences Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany) with cDNA from control cells as tester and cDNA from cytokine-exposed cells as driver samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting subtracted cDNAs were cloned (PCR-Script, Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and sequenced with a 373 stretch DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Clones were screened for identity at GenBankTM (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Previously unknown partial sequences of rat cDNAs were deposited at GenBankTM with the following accession numbers: rat-Fln29, AF329825; HSR1-homologous transcript, AF329824; rat-D54, AF329826; rat-HMG-17, AF329828; and rat zyxin, AF329827. Electrophoresis of total RNA and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (12Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with probes generated by PCR (30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C with T3 primers (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′) and T7 primers (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′)) from clones of differentially expressed cDNAs. PCR products were labeled with the Rediprime random labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Cell lysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were performed as described previously (12Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H.

Loading and transfer of equal amounts of protein in each lane was verified by reprobing the stripped membrane (5-min incubation in 200 mmNaOH and subsequent neutralization by several washes with distilled water) followed by incubation with a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) and visualization with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) as described. The 5′ region of the rat zfm1 gene was cloned by 5′-RACE according to the manufacturer's instructions (5′-RACE system, version 2.0, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and sequenced as described. The zfm1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (as-ODN) with the sequence 5′-TpCpCpGGTCGCCATGGCpGpCpC-3′, including the complementary bases to the first ATG codon (underlined in the as-ODN sequence) was obtained from IBA, Göttingen, Germany. The three terminal phosphodiester bonds between the bases at both ends were exchanged for phosphorothioate (p) to attain higher stability against enzymatic degradation. The as-ODN was preincubated with the cultured SMC for 18 h at a final concentration of 2 μm. A scrambled oligodeoxynucleotide (sc-ODN), modified as the as-ODN and having the same base composition but a sequence (5′-CpGpCpGTCGTGCGCACTpCpGpC-3′) unrelated to zfm1 was used as a control. Housing and treatment of the animals was performed according to the German legislation on the protection of animals with a 12-h day and night rhythm. Mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (apoE −/− mice, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and backcrossed 10 times to their genetic background (C57BL/6J wild type mice) were fed a high fat diet (21.2% fat, 0.15% cholesterol; Harlan Teklad TD88137) for 22 weeks. At the age of 30 weeks, a 10% (w/v) ferric chloride solution was applied for 3 min to the adventitia of the left common carotid artery to induce arterial thrombosis and neointima formation as described previously (16Konstantinides S. Schafer K. Thinnes T. Loskutoff D.J. Circulation. 2001; 103: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). After this procedure, wounds were closed and animals kept under standard conditions. Ferric chloride-induced injury resulted in the formation of a 2- to 3-mm-long thrombus and consecutive neointima formation (7–21 days post injury). Mice were killed after the times indicated by an overdose of Metofane (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ), and the carotid arteries were excised, fixed for 4 h in 4% zinc formalin (Shandon, Frankfurt, Germany), and subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis. Formalin-fixed segments of the mouse carotid artery were embedded in paraffin blocks of which 5- to 7-μm-thick sections were cut. After paraffin removal (boiling of the glass-fixed sections six times for 5 min in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0), they were inactivated in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide followed by blocking of nonspecific binding sites for 20 min at room temperature with 10% bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). The primary rabbit polyclonal anti-zfm1 antibody (15Guth S. Valcárcel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38059-38066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:100 in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, and incubated with the mounted sections for 2 h at room temperature. After thoroughly rinsing with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (anti-rabbit, Envision, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed again, incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the AEC chromogen solution (Dako), counterstained with hematoxylin if suitable (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), rinsed for 10 min with water, and finally mounted with Aquamount sealing medium (Gurr, Hanau, Germany). The stained sections were analyzed by light microscopy with brown nuclei counted as zfm1-positive. In some experiments, monoclonal antibodies against the replication protein-1 (RPA, Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) and/or the DNA-polymerase subunit PCNA (proliferative cell nuclear antigen; Dako were used in essentially the same manner as described above. Unless indicated otherwise, results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations with cells obtained from the aortas of different animals. A one samplet test with a two-sided p value or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett post test was used where appropriate to determine statistically significant differences between the means and control with p < 0.05 considered significant. To characterize genes down-regulated upon cytokine exposure (IL-1β (60 units/ml) plus TNFα (1000 units/ml) for 6 h), a subtractive hybridization followed by suppression PCR (SSH-PCR) was performed (11Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar), and 15 clones derived from this procedure were analyzed. To confirm their differential expression in the cytokine-treated SMC, Northern blot, RT-PCR, or Western blot analyses (depending on antibody availability) were performed for these gene products. According to Northern blot analysis, an average decrease in e.g. zyxin, HMG-17, and zfm1 mRNA expression of 60%, 55%, and 51% was determined after 6-h exposure of the SMC to IL-1β plus TNFα (Fig.1, TableI). An identical decrease in mRNA expression was also detected by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1 B) and, in the case of zyxin and zfm1, correlated with the concomitant decrease in protein abundance (60 and 56% decrease, respectively), as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C).Table IList of truly down-regulated genes identified by SSH-PCR in rat aortic cultured SMC exposed to IL-1β plus TNFαGene product (length of clone)Function and homology to known genes from rat or other speciesLevel of expression% of control ± SECaBP-1 (410 bp)Redox-active subunit of endoplasmic 4-hydroxyprolylhydrolase (100% to rat)51 ± 111-ap < 0.05versus control.Cathepsin B (360 bp)Secretory protease (99% to rat)43 ± 71-ap < 0.05versus control.D54 (410 bp)Member of a protein family involved in calcium signalling (65% to human)49 ± 71-ap < 0.05versus control.Fln-29 (580 bp)Putative human TRAF-interacting zinc finger protein (84% to human)33 ± 21HMG-17 (330 bp)High mobility group transcriptional regulator family (88% to mouse)49 ± 14Osteoprotegerin (400 bp)Hormone involved in bone metabolism (100% to rat)23 ± 121-ap < 0.05versus control.Protein disulfide isomerase (620 bp)ER enzyme involved in the processing of secretory proteins (100% to rat)38 ± 61-ap < 0.05versus control.TCTP-21 (210 bp)Cell growth and tumor-related calcium binding protein (82% to mouse)35 ± 151-ap < 0.05versus control.zfm1 (300 bp)Transcriptional repressor/splicing factor (100% to rat)44 ± 81-ap < 0.05versus control.Zyxin (520 bp)Cytoskeleton-associated zinc finger protein (92% to mouse)40 ± 121-ap < 0.05versus control.GTP-binding protein HSR1 (230 bp)Not known, similar to the human HSR1 gene (81%)44 ± 101-ap < 0.05versus control.Their relative level of expression represents the mean result of three independent Northern blot analyses with different batches of SMC.1-a p < 0.05versus control. Open table in a new tab Their relative level of expression represents the mean result of three independent Northern blot analyses with different batches of SMC. Of the 15 clones analyzed, two were cloning artifacts, down-regulation by IL-1β/TNFα of one gene product (KIAA0067) could not be confirmed, and one clone could not be unambiguously identified using GenBankTM and was therefore omitted from further analysis. Thus, 11 of 15 clones represented truly down-regulated gene products (Table I). Although partly unknown, all identified gene products either have a high degree of homology to already known genes (e.g.HSR1 homologue) or to homologues from other species, which are well characterized (e.g. zyxin; cf. Table I). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of IL-1β plus TNFα on the expression of these genes, at least for zfm1 and zyxin, appeared to occur at the level of transcription, as confirmed by nuclear run-on analyses (Fig. 2 A). The transcriptional repressor splicing factor-1 or zfm1 was chosen for further analysis on a functional basis. First, zfm1 protein was characterized. The predominant protein recognized by the antiserum (15Guth S. Valcárcel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38059-38066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa in the Western blot analysis, corresponding to the splice variant zfm1A. No band with a molecular mass of 55 kDa was detected, indicating that the other splice variant capable of interfering with transcription, zfm1E (13Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is not expressed by the cultured SMC. Isoform-specific PCR analysis confirmed that only zfm1A but no zfm1E mRNA is expressed by the cultured SMC (Fig. 2 B). Second, the effects of IL-1β plus TNFα effects on zfm1 expression were monitored over time. Cytokine-induced down-regulation of zfm1 mRNA in the cultured SMC was detectable for at least 18 h (Fig. 2 C). Although the inhibitory effect of the cytokines on mRNA expression was maximal after 6 h, protein levels reached a minimum at 12–18 h (not shown). Moreover, an as-ODN spanning the first coding ATG of the gene product, but not an oligonucleotide with the same base content but unrelated sequence (sc-ODN), after 18–36 h of exposure inhibited zfm1 protein expression to an extent similar to the combined treatment of the cultured SMC with IL-1β and TNFα (Fig. 3). To test for possible functional consequences of this decrease in zfm1 expression, the rate of proliferation of SMC exposed to IL-1β and/or TNFα or to the zfm1 as-ODN were compared. IL-1β and TNFα alone (not shown) or in combination enhanced the rate of proliferation of the cultured SMC by 40% over a 24-h period (Fig.4). Down-regulation of zfm1 protein expression (48-h pre-treatment with the as-ODN) resulted in a virtually identical increase in the rate of SMC proliferation. Pre-treatment with the as-ODN plus exposure to IL-1β and TNFα did not result in a further increase in the rate of proliferation whereas the sc-ODN alone had no appreciable effect (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, interferon-γ (1000 units/ml) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-BB, 0.5 ng/ml), when compared with IL-1β and TNFα, exerted a similar effect on SMC proliferation (Fig.4 A) and zfm1 expression (Fig. 4 B) whereas other cytokines such as IL-6 (0.5 ng/ml) or IL-10 (1 ng/ml) or another growth factor-like agent, insulin (10 nm), had no such effect (Fig. 4 B). Finally, the consequences of the decrease in zfm1 protein abundance for MCP-1 and VCAM-1 expression were analyzed. Pre-treatment of the cultured SMC with the as-ODN for 24 h resulted in an increase of ∼2-fold in expression of these pro-inflammatory gene products, while the sc-ODN had no such effect (Fig.5 B). In comparison, exposure of the SMC to IL-1β plus TNFα for 6 h triggered a 5- to 6-fold increase in MCP-1 and VCAM-1 gene expression and, in addition, induced expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in these cells. The latter effect was not mimicked by pre-treating the SMC with the zfm1 as-ODN (Fig.5 A). Exposure of the SMC to IL-1β plus TNFα after down-regulation of zfm1 expression by the as-ODN had no additional or even synergistic effect on MCP-1 or VCAM-1 expression when compared with the effects of the cytokines alone (Fig. 5 B). In addition to the cultured SMC, zfm1 expression was monitored in a model of vascular lesion formation triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Ferric chloride-induced injury of the carotid artery of cholesterol-fed apoE −/− mice was accompanied by a transient down-regulation of zfm1 protein in the SMC of the media and the developing neointima. Only after completion of neointima formation and structural stabilization of the vessel wall at ∼3 weeks, 2K. Schäfer, unpublished observation. zfm1 expression re-occurred in the nuclei of neointimal and medial SMC (Fig.6 A). At this stage,i.e. when SMC proliferation was impeded, SMC expressing high amounts of zfm1 protein and cells almost devoid of zfm1 could be observed in parallel. Interestingly, there was no nuclear co-expression of zfm1 and PCNA, a marker for proliferation, at this time point, as exemplified by a cross-section of a carotid artery 3 weeks post ferric chloride injury (see Fig. 6 B). Virtually the same inverse immunostaining was observed with another proliferation marker, RPA (not shown). Inflammation is an often beneficial response of the immune system and affected tissues to injury. Proliferation of normal bystander cells such as fibroblasts and SMC plays a central role in the course of such reactions to fully reconstitute the affected tissue both structurally and functionally (17Gharaee-Kermani M. Phan S.H. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1083-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for SMC to proliferate is a de-differentiation, which is frequently induced by the mixture of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and other stimuli present in inflamed tissue. In contrast to these well-characterized stimulatory factors, virtually nothing is known about the fate of gene products that are expressed in these cells to maintain an anti-proliferative and differentiated phenotype following tissue injury. Of the 11 gene products characterized to be down-regulated in the cultured SMC upon exposure to IL-1β plus TNFα, the majority may indeed directly or indirectly be associated with cell growth, gene transcription, and signal transduction. Besides the transcriptional repressor zfm1 that is discussed in detail below, rat-Fln29, a TNFα-receptor-associated factor-interacting zinc finger protein with a high homology to the cytosolic inhibitory protein A20 (18Heyninck K. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and HMG-17, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) family of transcription coordinating proteins (19Bustin M. Trieschmann L. Postnikov Y.V. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), may be of interest for changes in SMC phenotype that are characteristic for the early phase of inflammation. zfm1 was chosen for further analysis, because, according to data retrieved from the literature, it appeared to be the most promising candidate to be involved in SMC phenotype control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of zfm1 as a modulator of SMC proliferation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Besides its function as a co-factor of mRNA splicing events (15Guth S. Valcárcel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38059-38066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), zfm1 has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor of genes under control of the transcriptional activator EWS and homologous proteins by directly interacting with these proteins (13Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,20Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whereas several zfm1 splice variants seem to be predominantly involved in RNA splicing, two naturally occurring isoforms, A and E, were reported to be inhibitors of EWS-like proteins (13Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cultured SMC only express zfm1A. zfm1-mediated repression directly targets the basal transcription machinery, because EWS is part of the constitutive transcription complex, which binds and activates the transcription factor TFIID. Interestingly, several EWS-like proteins exist in mammals (20Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), all of which have been characterized to be activators of transcription of as yet unknown physiological significance. One attractive hypothesis is, therefore, that these factors modulate the cellular response to specific stimuli, e.g. cytokine signaling to the nucleus. Indeed, two proteins, hTAFIII and TLS, both homologous to EWS, have been characterized as co-activators of the cytokine-inducible transcription factor NF-κB (21Uranishi H. Tetsuka T. Yamashita M. Asamitsu K. Shimizu M. Itoh M. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13395-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This finding, on the other hand, suggests a mechanism for the putative anti-inflammatory effects of zfm1 through inhibition of such co-activators. Although zfm1 in principle targets the basal transcription machinery, its action seems to be specific for a certain subset of transcription factors, i.e. it does not block transcription in general (13Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In support of a specific system of one or more transcriptional co-activators and repressors, there is a growing number of EWS-like proteins and of zfm1 homologues that have been characterized to date. One such example is the Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1, which can act both as a factor modulating mRNA splicing and as a transcriptional repressor (23Ladomery M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). According to run-on analysis, down-regulation of zfm1 expression by IL-1β plus TNFα occurred at the level of transcription and was maintained for at least 18 h. To mimic this effect without potentially confounding cytokine effects, a specific as-ODN was employed. Down-regulation of zfm1 protein expression by the as-ODN indeed resulted in effects very similar to those of the cytokines, i.e. an up-regulation of both MCP-1and VCAM-1 gene expression and, in addition, an increase in the rate of SMC proliferation. When considering how zfm1 inhibits basal transcription (see above), it may become intelligible as to why its down-regulation exerted a weaker effect on MCP-1 or VCAM-1 expression than IL-1β plus TNFα stimulation of the SMC. Although constituting an important step in cytokine-induced gene expression, zfm1 suppression thus cannot account for full activation of these genes, because it affects the basal transcription machinery but does not induce gene expression per se. This notion is supported by the apparent lack of effect of down-regulating zfm1 on iNOS expression. Transcription of this gene must be induced, i.e. the iNOS gene remains silent despite de-blockade of the basal transcription machinery as long as cytokine-inducible transcription factors such as NF-κ B are inactive (24Hammermann R. Dreissig M.D. Mossner J. Fuhrmann M. Berrino L. Gothert M. Racke K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This assumption is also corroborated by the finding that as-ODN-based down-regulation of zfm1 protein before addition of the cytokines does not alter their stimulatory effect on MCP-1 or VCAM-1 expression. On the other hand, this finding may be interpreted as indicating that lowering zfm1 protein below the level obtained with the as-ODN has no further effect on gene expression in the SMC. In contrast, as-ODN lowering of zfm1 protein accelerated the rate of proliferation of the SMC to the same extent as the cytokine exposure, whereas the combination did not result in a greater effect. This apparent discrepancy is best explained by a moderate increase in expression of several constitutively active genes associated with cell cycle control following down-regulation of zfm1, which already suffices to maximally induce SMC proliferation (cf. the comparable effect of PDGF and that of the as-ODN on SMC proliferation). Such subtle changes in gene expression triggering the entry of eukaryotic cells into the cell cycle are well described in the literature (see Ref. 25Tyson J.J. Novak B. Odell G.M. Chen K. Thron C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 89-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar for review). Does an increase in zfm1 expression consequently suppress SMC proliferation? For various reasons this question is difficult to address experimentally. Moreover, when considering that lowering the zfm1 abundance below a certain threshold unmasks its effects on SMC proliferation, affirmation of this question is not at all certain. Perhaps, maintaining zfm1 expression despite the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines constitutes a more feasible approach to further substantiate its anti-proliferative capacity. Apart from interferon-γ, which might have been expected, PDGF also repressed zfm1 gene expression to a similar extent as did IL-1β plus TNFα. PDGF is thought to play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis and possesses many properties of the cytokines analyzed in this study. Besides enhancing SMC proliferation, PDGF also induces expression of pro-inflammatory gene products such as MCP-1 in vascular SMC (26Bogdanov V.Y. Poon M. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24932-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDGF may be defined as a pro-inflammatory cytokine rather than a typical growth factor, the action of which is also amenable to zfm1 modulation. Finally, the putative role of zfm1 as a factor capable of preventing inflammation-induced de-differentiation of vascular SMC was studied in an in vivomodel of accelerated neointima formation that appears to be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα (27Elhage R. Maret A. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Arnal J.F. Bayard F. Circulation. 1998; 97: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The observed transient down-regulation of zfm1 abundance in the media and in the ensuing neointima of the injured carotid arteries supports the notion of zfm1 acting as an endogenous inhibitor of pro-inflammatory and proliferative responses in the vessel wall. Interestingly, in the terminal phase of neointima formation, nuclei of SMC, which stained positively for zfm1, stained negatively for the proliferation markers PCNA or RPA (28Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and vice versa, further supporting this hypothesis. The present findings demonstrate that, among several cytokine down-regulated gene products, zfm1 was characterized as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory gene expression and proliferation in vascular SMC. Because there is an increasing number of proteins with genetic and/or functional similarities to zfm1 and its counterpart EWS, these findings point toward a system of co-activators and matching repressors of the constitutive transcription machinery that modulate gene expression. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the initiation and progression of inflammatory responses can no longer be solely explained by an induction of pro-inflammatory genes (i.e. through activation of the corresponding transcription factors) but must also consider a complementary cytokine effect through attenuating the expression of negative regulatory factors such as zfm1. It might well be this additional effect, if prolonged, that contributes to the transition of an acute to a chronic inflammatory response, at least in the vessel wall."

Munc18-c, a Syntaxin 4-binding protein, is a proposed regulator of the docking/fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. We examined the subcellular distribution of Munc18-c in response to acute (15-min) insulin (100 nm) stimulation after preincubation in 5 or 25 mm glucose ± 0.6 nm insulin. Immunoblotting detected Munc18-c mainly in the Triton X-100-soluble plasma membrane (TS-PM) and the Triton X-100-insoluble low density microsomal (TI-LDM) fraction. Under each condition except high glucose + insulin preincubation, acute insulin increased Munc18-c (∼50–200%) in TS-PM and decreased Munc18-c (∼60%) in TI-LDM. Munc18-c traffic was time-dependent with a lag time of ∼3 min compared with GLUT4. Preincubation with high glucose + 0.6 nm insulin significantly impaired acute insulin-stimulated Munc18-c trafficking and decreased basal Munc18-c in the TI-LDM. Preincubation with glucosamine + insulin had similar effects. Total cellular Munc18-c remained unchanged. In conclusion, acute insulin stimulation promotes the translocation of Munc18-c, apparently from a TI-LDM-associated compartment to the TS-PM. Chronically increased glucose flux or exposure to glucosamine disrupts this process, which may negatively impact the fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2143372479,"The redox properties and thiol reactivity of quinones play critical roles in their therapeutic and toxicological properties. The present study was undertaken to investigate the binding activity of ubiquinone 0 (UQ0) to human oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) using electron spin resonance (ESR). Addition of UQ0 to HbO2 resulted in the immediate detection of a five-line ESR spectrum characteristic of the semiquinone radical of UQ0 (UQ0). With time the HbO2 adduct with UQ0, which was characterized by a broad immobilized ESR spectrum, was gradually formed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra analysis showed that UQ0 bound to the β-chain of HbO2. Superoxide dismutase dose-dependently suppressed the intensity of the broad spectrum and accelerated its formation. However, N-ethylmaleimide, a thiol-blocking agent, completely eliminated its formation. The nonspecific protease mixture pronase also prevented its formation and resulted in the gradual appearance of a 4-line spectrum from the 5-line spectrum of UQ0. The structure of the species responsible for the 4-line spectrum was confirmed and identified by the reaction of UQ0 with reduced glutathione. In human red blood cells, UQ0 rapidly bound to glutathione but more slowly to HbO2. These results suggest that UQ0 reacted with both ferrous heme and the reactive β-93 cysteinyl residue of HbO2 to generate its corresponding semiquinone radical.

Many quinones have cytotoxic properties that have made them useful as anticancer and antibacterial drugs. For example, adriamycin possesses antitumor activity and is important therapeutically (14Blum R.H. Carter S.K. Ann. Intern. Med. 1974; 80: 249-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because quinones and their corresponding semiquinone species have strong electrophilic character, they can readily react with available nucleophiles, especially sulfhydryl groups, and thereby form covalent adducts.

Although the addition and substitution reactions of quinones with thiols have been extensively documented, the possibility of UQ0 binding to the only reactive β-93 thiol group on human hemoglobin has not been examined, especially in regard to the free radical formation involved in UQ0/thiol interactions. Hence, the present study was undertaken to characterize the interaction of UQ0 with human oxyhemoglobin or glutathione in human red blood cells by directly detecting the radicals generated during their interaction using ESR. The binding reaction of UQ0 with human oxyhemoglobin was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra. ubiquinone 0 (2,3-dimethoxyl-5-methyl-1,4-benoquinone) 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid electron spin resonance matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra methemoglobin N-acetyl-l-cysteine N-ethylmaleimide oxyhemoglobin the semiquinone radical of ubiquinone 0 superoxide dismutase milliwatt Human oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), 2,3-dimethoxyl-5-methyl-1,4-benoquinone (UQ0), 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), maleimide, iodoacetamide, reduced glutathione (GSH), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), and dithiothreitol were from Sigma Chemical Company. The 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin trap agent was purchased from Sigma and was vacuum-distilled twice and stored under nitrogen at −70 °C until used. Potassium ferricyanide andN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Pronase and proteinase K were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), and catalase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, German). Human blood was from the American Red Cross (Durham, NC). Centricon-10 was from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). Methemoglobin (MetHb) was prepared from human HbO2 as described previously with a slightly modification (34Kosaka H. Tyuma I. Environ. Health Perspect. 1987; 73: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HbO2 was treated with 5 equivalents of potassium ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixture was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column and concentrated using centricon-10 with centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 60 min. Thiol (β-93)-blocked hemoglobin samples were prepared from human HbO2 or MetHb as described above. A 10-fold excess of NEM was added to HbO2 or MetHb, and the mixture was allowed to react for 30 min. The NEM-reacted hemoglobin (NEM-HbO2) or NEM-MetHb was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove the unreacted NEM and was concentrated using centricon-10 by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 60 min. More than 98% of the reactive sulfhydryl groups were blocked in the NEM-HbO2 or NEM-MetHb solution prepared in this way. Human red blood cells were prepared in a procedure slightly modified from that described by Stolze and Nohl (35Stolze K. Nohl H. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After removal of plasma and leukocytes by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,200 × g, the cells were washed five times by addition of twice the amount of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 2,200 × g. For ESR measurements, the reaction mixture containing red blood cells and 2.0 mm UQ0 in borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm) was subjected to ESR analysis with the instrumental parameters described below. ESR experiments were carried out on a Bruker EMX ESR spectrometer. The reaction mixture containing 1.2 mm human HbO2 and 0.5 mm UQ0 in borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm) was subjected to ESR analysis with or without 0.8 mg/ml pronase, or various concentrations of SOD and catalase. In the NEM experiment, 1.2 mm HbO2 or MetHb was incubated with 12 mm NEM at room temperature for 10 min, and then 0.5 mm UQ0 was added to react with the NEM-pretreated HbO2 or MetHb before being subjected to ESR analysis. Instrumental parameters were as follows: microwave power, 40 mW; scan width, 50 G; microwave frequency, 9.8 GHz; modulation amplitude, 2.0 G; time constant, 41 ms; gain, 1.0 × 105. Positive ion MALDI analyses were performed using a Voyager DE-STR delayed-extraction time-of-flight MS equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) (Applied Biosystems Inc.). A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 45:45:10 ethanol/water/formic acid (v/v/v) was used as the MALDI matrix. Reaction mixtures containing 2.4 mm human HbO2alone or with 1.4 mm UQ0 in distilled water were reacted at room temperature for 2 h, diluted 100 times, and then mixed with the MALDI matrix for the MALDI-MS analysis. Reaction mixtures containing various concentrations of GSH and 5.0 mm UQ0 in borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm) were subjected to ESR analysis with the instrumental parameters described above except that microwave power was 20 mW, and the receiver gain was 1.0 × 104. Oxygen consumption measurements were made with a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a 1.8-ml Gilson sample cell and monitored by a model 53 oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring Instruments, OH). The reagents were added in the following order. First, a borate buffer stock solution (pH 9.0, 100 mm) and UQ0 in the presence or absence of SOD or catalase were placed in the sample cell. Then, after establishing a 1-min baseline measurement, reactions were initiated by adding GSH stock solution to the reaction chamber. Oxygen concentration in the samples as a function of time was recorded by a PC interfaced to the oxygen monitor with a Data Translation DT2801 data acquisition board. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature. When 0.5 mm UQ0 was mixed with 1.2 mm human HbO2 in borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm), a 5-line ESR spectrum appeared immediately (Fig.1 A). Its simulated spectrum (Fig. 1 B) is characteristic of the semiquinone radical of UQ0 (UQ0)(aH (3H, position 6) = 2.43 G and aH (1H, position 5) = 1.92 G) in agreement with the literature (5Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Schopfer F. Lisdero C.L. Riobo N.A. Giulivi C. Boveris A.D. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). No detectable ESR signal of UQ0 was observed from 0.5 mm UQ0 alone in borate buffer. The ESR signal of UQ0 was more stable when the reaction solution was bubbled with sufficient N2 to lower the O2 concentration without significantly deoxygenating HbO2(data not shown). When HbO2 was replaced by MetHb that was prepared from HbO2, a weaker 5-line ESR signal appeared, and this reaction also took place under anaerobic conditions (data not shown). Over 10 min of incubation, a broad, immobilized signal was gradually formed (Fig. 1, C–E), suggesting the formation of an HbO2 adduct of the semiquinone radical of UQ0. The formation of the HbO2 adduct with UQ0 was confirmed by the MALDI-MS analysis. Fig.2 shows the MALDI mass spectra obtained from human HbO2 with or without UQ0. When HbO2 alone was analyzed by MALDI-MS, two signals of nearly equal intensity were observed (Fig. 2 A). These represent ions that were generated from protonation of the α- and β-chains that constitute the HbO2 tetramer. The α-chain [α+H]+ and β-chain [β+H]+ ions are observed at mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios of 15,131 and 15,877 compared with the calculated [M+H]+ values of 15,127 and 15,868, respectively. The MALDI mass spectrum of the solution of HbO2 with UQ0 (Fig. 2 B) shows that the mass of the β-chain was increased by 181 Da compared with that observed in Fig. 2 A. The mass of the modified β-chain is equal to that of the single β-chain (less one proton) plus that of UQ0 (15,877–1+182 = 16,058), indicating the binding reaction of UQ0 to the β-chain of HbO2 at a single site. The mass of the protonated α-chain in the solution containing HbO2 and UQ0 was unchanged, indicating no α-chain modification. To confirm the possibility that UQ0 bound to the thiol group at the β-chain of HbO2, the β-93 cysteine sulfhydryl group, which is the only reactive sulfhydryl group, was blocked by NEM. It was found that the formation of the broad ESR signal of the HbO2/UQ0 adduct was completely prevented when HbO2 was either pretreated for 10 min with 12 mm of NEM before the addition of UQ0 or replaced by purified NEM-HbO2, and only a weaker 5-line spectrum of UQ0 was present (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained when NEM was replaced by the other thiol-blocking agents such as 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), maleimide and iodoacetamide (data not shown). These results indicate that the exposed β-93 cysteinyl residue of HbO2 was involved in the formation of the broad ESR signal of the HbO2/UQ0 adduct. No detectable 5-line ESR signal was observed when NEM-HbO2 was replaced either by MetHb pretreated with NEM or by purified NEM-MetHb, indicating that not only ferrous heme but also β-93 sulfhydryl group participated in the formation of the 5-line ESR signal of UQ0. The addition of SOD significantly decreased the ESR signal intensities of both the 5-line and the broad spectra in a dose-dependent manner (TableI). SOD also dose-dependently accelerated the decay of the 5-line spectrum and shortened the period during which the broad spectrum was completely formed. For instance, the addition of SOD (100 units/ml) decreased the period from 10 to 5 min. SOD at a concentration of above 500 units/ml completely inhibited the formation of both spectra (data not shown). However, catalase (10–100 μg/ml) did not show statistically significant effects on the formation of the broad spectrum (data not shown).Table IEffect of superoxide dismutase on the formation of the semiquinone radicalsSOD ConcentrationESR signal intensity of the semiquinone radicals1-aData points represent mean ± S.D.

To obtain further information about the binding site of the immobilized radical, we employed the enzymes pronase or proteinase K to partially degrade the HbO2 and overcome the immobilization of the radical (35Stolze K. Nohl H. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presence of 0.8 mg/ml pronase during the incubation not only eliminated the formation of the broad signal but, more interestingly, gradually led to the replacement of the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0 by a 4-line spectrum (Fig.4). Similar results were obtained in the presence of proteinase K (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained when HbO2 was replaced by MetHb (data not shown). To identify the above 4-line ESR spectrum, we substituted GSH, a cysteine-containing tripeptide, for macromolecular hemoglobin. We found that the addition of GSH at a low concentration of 0.25 mm to borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm) containing 5.0 mmUQ0 generated the 5-line spectrum of UQ0 (Fig.5 A), which was the same as that shown in Fig. 1 A. With increasing GSH concentrations, the 5-line spectrum gradually changed to a 4-line spectrum (Fig. 5,B–E). Furthermore, under the appropriate ESR measurement conditions, the hyperfine structures of the spectra shown in Fig. 5 could be resolved. For instance, when microwave power, scan width, and modulation amplitude were decreased to 5.0 mW, 20 G and 0.2 G from 20 mW, 50 G, and 2.0 G, respectively, the resolved spectrum for a ratio of [GSH]/[UQ0] of 0.5 (Figs. 5 D or6 A, which was obtained under the same experimental conditions as Fig. 5 D except that the scanwidth was 20 G) is shown in Fig. 6 B. This spectrum can be simulated (shown in Fig. 6 C) as a composite of two radical species, the semquinone radical of UQ0(aH (3H, position 6) = 2.43 G and aH (1H, position 5) = 1.92 G, Fig. 6 D) and the semiquinone radical of the UQ0-glutathionyl conjugate characterized by its hyperfine coupling constant (aH (3H, position 6) = 2.89 G, Fig. 6 E). The relative contribution of each species to the overall spectra depended upon the ratio of [GSH]/[UQ0]. As shown in Fig. 5, when [GSH]/[UQ0] ≤0.05, UQ0 was primarily formed, whereas at [GSH]/[UQ0] ≥1.0, the formation of the semiquinone radical of the UQ0-glutathionyl conjugate predominated. Similar results were obtained when GSH was replaced with NAC, containing one sulfhydryl group, or dithiothreitol, containing two (data not shown). Oxygen consumption in this system was also measured. Fig.7 shows that the time course of oxygen consumption after GSH was added to initiate the reaction with UQ0. For the controls of 0.5 mm UQ0or GSH alone (Fig. 7, A–B), oxygen consumption was undetectable. Oxygen was consumed rapidly in the first minute of the reaction. The amount of oxygen consumption increased with increasing GSH concentration, whereas total oxygen consumed leveled off when GSH was at a concentration of 0.5 mm, equal to that of UQ0 (Fig. 7 G), supporting a previous report (36Goin J. Gibson D.D. McCay P.B. Cadenas E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Catalase at a concentration of 0.10 mg/ml partially inhibited the oxygen consumption (Fig. 7 H), whereas SOD up to 1,000 units/ml had no effect (data not shown). Neither 100 μmEDTA nor DETAPAC affected the oxygen consumption (data not shown), as reported previously (36Goin J. Gibson D.D. McCay P.B. Cadenas E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8, the initial rate of oxygen consumption was first order in GSH concentration when the GSH concentration was lower than 0.25 mm.Figure 8Effects of glutathione concentrations on the initial rate and total oxygen consumption. Experimental conditions are the same as described in the legend to Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When using human red blood cells instead of HbO2, we found that the broad ESR signal was not observed during the initial period of reaction. Instead, the initial 5-line spectrum changed to the 4-line spectrum (Fig. 9, A–D), which was identical to the results obtained from the reaction of UQ0 with GSH. The formation rate of the UQ0-glutathionyl conjugate depended on the concentrations of both UQ0 and red blood cells (data not shown). After 25 min of reaction time, the broad ESR signal was detected, and it dominated at 40 min (Fig. 9, E–F). In this study, we detected for the first time the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0 upon the addition of UQ0 to the borate buffer solution (pH 9.0) containing human HbO2 (Fig.1 A). When HbO2 was pretreated with the thiol-blocking agent NEM or replaced by MetHb, a weaker 5-line ESR spectrum appeared (data not shown). No detectable 5-line ESR signal was observed when NEM-MetHb replaced NEM-HbO2 or MetHb was pretreated with NEM. These results not only indicate that the ferrous heme of HbO2 (Reaction 1) participated in the formation of the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0, which supported the previous report where ferrous heme of HbO2 was involved in the one-electron reduction of menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or vitamin K3) to its semiquinone radical (37Winterbourn C.C. French J.K. Claridge R.F. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but more importantly suggest that the β-93 sulfhydryl group of HbO2, the only reactive sulfhydryl group, was also involved in the formation of the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0. The probable mechanism by which UQ0was generated by the β-93 sulfhydryl group was via Reactions 2–R4. The reductive addition of the β-93 sulfhydryl group of HbO2 to UQ0 formed the hydroquinone conjugate of HbO2 (Reaction 2). The co-existence of hydroquinone conjugate and UQ0 resulted in the formation of their semiquinones via the comproportionation/disproportionation reaction 3. During the initial period of the reaction the presence of high concentrations of UQ0 favored the dominant formation of the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0 by displacing the equilibrium of the Reactions 3 and 4 toward the right. Another route to generating UQ0 by the β-93 sulfhydryl group might be via Reaction FR5 forming the thiyl radical, although this reaction is thermodynamically unfavourable (38Wardman P. Free Rad. Commun. 1990; 8: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Reactions 1–R4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions 1–R4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions 1–R4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure FR5View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The incubation of UQ0 with HbO2 over time formed a broad, immobilized ESR signal (Fig. 1 E), indicating that the binding reaction of UQ0 to HbO2 occurred. This was confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis, showing that UQ0 bound to the β-chain of HbO2(Fig. 2). Moreover, it was found that the formation of the broad, immobilized ESR signal was eliminated by the addition of NEM (Fig. 3), and its formation rate at pH 7.4 was much slower than at pH 9.0 (data not shown). It has been reported that cysteinyl residues of hemoglobin show more reactivity at pH 9.0 than at physiological pH values (39Miranda J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that UQ0 forms the immobilized paramagnetic adduct by binding to the only reactive β-93 cysteinyl residue of HbO2. To obtain further information about the binding site of the immobilized radical, the enzymes pronase or proteinase K were employed to induce partial degradation of HbO2 in order to overcome the immobilization of the radical (35Stolze K. Nohl H. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The addition of pronase or proteinase K at the beginning of the reaction prevented the formation of the immobilized spectrum and caused the gradual formation of a 4-line ESR spectrum from the 5-line ESR spectrum of UQ0 (Fig.4). To identify the 4-line ESR spectrum, we used the small molecular thiol agent GSH to replace the macromolecular HbO2. In the system containing UQ0 and various concentrations of GSH, a 5-line ESR spectrum changed gradually into a 4-line ESR spectrum as the molar ratio of [GSH]/[UQ0] increased (Fig. 5). Theoretically, if the proton (position 5) in the aromatic ring of UQ0 is unsubstituted, both the proton in position 5 and three protons in position 6 will contribute to the ESR spectrum of UQ0, resulting in the formation of a 5-line ESR spectrum as shown in Fig. 1 A or its resolved spectrum (Fig.6 D). Otherwise, if the proton in position 5 is substituted (for instance, a nucleophilic attack by a thiol upon the position 5 of UQ0), only three protons in position 6 will contribute to the ESR spectrum of the semiquinone radical of the substituted UQ0, resulting in the formation of a 4-line ESR spectrum as shown in Figs. 5 E or 6 E. In other words, in our case the formation of a 4-line spectrum indicates that the proton in position 5 of UQ0 is substituted by a thiol. Thus, based on the computer-simulated spectra and their hyperfine coupling constants (Fig. 6, C–E), the radicals formed during the reactions of UQ0 with GSH are demonstrated to the semiquinone radicals from either UQ0 alone or its conjugate with GSH or both, depending upon the molar ratio of [GSH]/[UQ0]. At a lower GSH concentration, the reductive addition of GSH to UQ0 (Reaction 6) occurred. The presence of high concentrations of UQ0 displaced the equilibrium of Reactions 7 and 8 toward the right. As a result, ESR spectra showed the 5-line spectrum to be dominant (Fig.5 A).Reactions 6–R10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions 6–R10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions 6–R10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reactions 6–R10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, our results suggest that the reactive β-93 cysteinyl residue of HbO2 substituted for the proton (position 5) of UQ0, further forming a paramagnetic adduct of HbO2 in the presence of UQ0, which was characterized by a broad, immobilized ESR spectrum in the absence of pronase (Reactions 2 and 3) and a 4-line spectrum in the presence of pronase (Reactions 9 and 10), respectively. The formation of superoxide radicals has been previously detected indirectly during the reaction of HbO2 with certain hemolytic agents, including the quinone menadione (37Winterbourn C.C. French J.K.

SOD significantly accelerated the decay of the semiquinone radical of UQ0, shortened the period during which the semiquinone radical of the HbO2/UQ0 adduct was completely formed, and suppressed the signal intensities of both semiquinone radicals, which indicated that superoxide was formed in this system. The effect of SOD is understood as a displacement of the equilibrium of the autoxidation reaction of UQ 0·− toward the right by the rapid removal of superoxide radical via disportionation (ReactionFR11), and, therefore, SOD favored the oxidative decay of the semiquinone radical of UQ0. To test the possibility that high levels of glutathione (>2 mm) (45Mori K. Inoue N. Fujishiro K. Kikuchi M. Chiba S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1990; 15: 441-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compete with oxyhemoglobin for reaction with the electrophilic UQ0, UQ0 was added to human red blood cells in borate buffer (pH 9.0, 100 mm). It was found that the corresponding semiquinone radical of UQ0 appeared during the initial period of reaction (Fig. 9 A). With time the 5-line ESR spectrum changed to a 4-line ESR spectrum (Fig. 9,B–D). The intermediate radical signals formed with time of incubation were the same as those formed in the system containing UQ0 and various concentrations of GSH. The broad ESR signal of the HbO2/UQ0 adduct was not observed until UQ0 was incubated with red blood cells for at least 25 min (Fig. 9, E–F). These results indicate that UQ0rapidly bound to glutathione but more slowly to hemoglobin. In summary, UQ0 was found to react with both the heme group and the β-93 thiol group of HbO2. In the initial stage of the reaction, the semiquinone radical of UQ0 was formed through the reactions with both ferrous heme and the β-93 thiol residue. With time a broad, immobilized ESR signal characterized as a macromolecular adduct was gradually formed, indicating that UQ0 had bound to the cysteinyl residue of HbO2."

Acid-sensitive ion channels (ASICs), members of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin superfamily, were originally cloned from neuronal tissue, and recently localized in epithelia. Because CFTR has been immunocytochemically and functionally identified in rat, murine, and human brain, the regulation of ASICs by CFTR was tested in oocytes. Our observations show that the proton-gated Na+ current formed by the heteromultimeric ASIC1a/2a channel was up-regulated by wild type but not by ΔF508-CFTR. In contrast, the acid-gated Na+ current associated with either the homomultimeric ASIC1a or ASIC2a channel was not influenced by wild type CFTR. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for extracellular Na+ for ASIC1a/2a was increased by CFTR, but CFTR had no effect on the gating behavior or acid sensitivity of ASIC1a/2a. CFTR had no effect on the pH activation of ASIC1a/2a. We conclude that wild type CFTR elevates the acid-gated Na+ current of ASIC1a/2a in part by altering the kinetics of extracellular Na+interaction.

Because the sulfonylurea receptors, a branch of the family of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, show a high degree of homology with CFTR, Konstas et al. (12Konstas A.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) studied the interaction between sulfonylurea receptors and ENaC. They concluded that sulfonylurea receptors inhibit Na+ transport by reducing surface expression of ENaC, but there is no protein-protein interaction at the level of the plasma membrane. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction between CFTR and ENaC, they have not yet been systematically tested (13Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Mall M.

Champigny G. Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Like other family members, ASICs are thought to have a single, large extracellular loop, and two short transmembrane domains with both the C and N termini located intracellularly (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). ASICs are ligand-gated ion channels activated by extracellular acidification and perhaps mechanical stimulation. The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of ASICs are similar to those of ENaC, albeit with a lower sensitivity to amiloride (K i ∼ 10 μm versus 0.1 μm) and a different cation permeability pattern (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the acid-gated cation current is transiently (seconds) activated and inactivated, whereas ENaC current decreases at extracellular pH 6.4 after a transient increase (18Awayda M.D. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the native amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance is activated by slightly acidic pHe (5.5 or 6.4) in toad bladder and A6 cells (18Awayda M.D. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J.

ASIC members, like ENaC, may assemble as a tetramer or as a higher order heteromultimeric channel (20Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol.

The biophysical features of heteromultimeric channels constructed with ASIC1a and ASIC2a (ASIC1a/2a) or ASIC2b with ASIC3 (ASIC2b/3) can be distinguished from those built from homomultimeric individual channels (21Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R.

However, CFTR expression has not been reported in the peripheral neuronal tissues. Human ASIC3 is distributed in both neuronal tissues and epithelial tissues (32Babinski K. Le K.T. Seguela P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a splice variant (hTNaC1) was cloned from human testis (33Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The most recently discovered homolog, ASIC4, has been found in the spinal cord, the pituitary gland, and the inner ear (34Grunder S. Geissler H.S. Bassler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P.

In these same groups of neurons where CFTR is found, ASIC1a and ASIC2a are also expressed (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The function of neuronal CFTR remains unknown. It is proposed that neuronal CFTR may regulate membrane trafficking processes of cytoplasmic ionic transporters and secretion of neuropeptides (42Weyler R.T. Yurko-Mauro K.A. Rubenstein R.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone has been postulated to be related to the infertility and delayed sexual maturation of CF patients in a developmentally sensitive pattern (42Weyler R.T. Yurko-Mauro K.A.

ASICs may act as pain sensors, mechanical receptors, and/or components of a signal transduction pathway responding to extracellular acidity. To investigate the possible functional regulation by neuronal CFTR on ASIC1a/2a, the objective of the present study was to useXenopus oocytes as an expression model to study the effect of human CFTR on the channel activity of ASIC1a/2a. Our results show that CFTR up-regulates proton-gated Na+ currents by altering the kinetics of extracellular Na+ interaction with ASIC1a/2a. Full-length human ASIC1a (BNaC2) and ASIC2a (BNaC1) cDNAs and their “degenerin” mutants were kind gifts of Drs. D. Corey and J. Garcı́a-Añoveros (Harvard Medical School (23Garcı́a-Añoveros J.

DNA samples were in vitro transcribed using either SP6 or T3 mMessage Machine kits (Ambion, TX) as appropriate. The quality and size of the cRNAs were confirmed by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentration was estimated by UV spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 260 nm. Expression of ASIC2a and CFTR in the rat hypothalamus was stained by indirect immunofluorescence. Rats were anesthetized with halothane, perfused transcardially with 60 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and followed by 60 ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. The brains were then removed from the skull, post-fixed in the same fixative for 2–4 h on ice, and cryoprotected by overnight immersion in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue samples were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) medium, then 5-μm frozen sections were obtained. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody solution for 72 h at 4 °C with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Rat brain tissue sections were labeled with one or two of the following antibodies: a 1:50 dilution of polyclonal anti-CFTR antibodies (44Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J.

Sorscher E.J. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Pavirani A. Escande D. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar); or a 1:20 dilution of polyclonal anti-ASIC2a antibodies (Alamone, Jerusalem, Israel). The identity of the stained cells as neurons was established using co-staining with a 1:20 dilution of neuron-specific nuclear monoclonal antibodies NeuN (CHEMICO International, Temecula, CA). The samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to the secondary antibody solution, goat anti-rabbit-Alexa 594 for ASIC2a and NeuN (1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or goat anti-mouse-Alexa 488 for CFTR (1:200, Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted, and examined using an Olympus 1 × 70 epifluorescence microscope. Nonimmune IgG and the secondary antibodies were used as controls. The distribution of ASIC1a was not examined because of a lack of a suitable antibody. Oocytes were surgically removed from anesthetized adult female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Beverly Hills, FL) by standard techniques (46Ji H.-L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Follicle cells were removed in OR-2 calcium-free medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.0 MgCl2 mm, 5.0 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) with the addition of collagenase (3 mg/ml). Defollicated oocytes were washed in OR-2 medium to which 50 mm CaCl2 was added and allowed to recover overnight in half-strength Teibovitz medium at 18 °C. Groups of stage VI oocytes were injected with 50 nl of RNase-free H2O or cRNA containing 2.5 ng of CFTR cRNA and 12.5 ng of ASIC cRNA. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were made 24–72 h post-injection at room temperature (22–24 °C). This protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Whole-cell proton-gated Na+ currents were measured in oocytes expressing ASICs and CFTRs with conventional dual electrode voltage clamps as described previously (46Ji H.-L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were impaled with two 3 mKCl-filled electrodes, each having resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ. The virtual current monitor/bath clamp head stage of the Dagan TEV-200 whole-cell clamp monitors the macroscopic currents flowing through the oocyte and simultaneously maintains the bath at zero potential. This head stage corrects for voltage deviations introduced by current flow through the reference electrode and agar bridge so that oocyte current can be recorded precisely without the series resistance compensation. Two chlorinated Ag-AgCl pellets (1 mm in diameter), each with a resistance below 500 Ω, were used as reference electrodes and were connected to the bath by 3 m KCl, 3% agar bridges (resistance was ∼200 Ω). The control superfusate was ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). To prepare ND-96 medium with pH below 6.0, HEPES was replaced with MES. Equimolar concentrations ofN-methyl-d-glucamine were used to replace NaCl in those experiments where the [Na+]o was varied. To allow the ASIC channels to recover completely from de-sensitization after bath solution acidification, solutions of acidic pH were applied for a period of 10 s separated by an interval of at least 45 s at pH 7.5. The current-voltage (I-V) relationships were acquired by stepping the holding potential in 20-mV increments from −100 to +100 mV. The effects of bath solution acidification (pH 4.0) on the resting membrane potential were recorded, and acid-gated Na+ entry through ASICs was measured. Data for voltage and current clamps were sampled at the rate of 1 kHz and filtered at 500 kHz. Experimental protocols were controlled by pCLAMP 8.2 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA), and Na+ currents at −60 mV were digitized and stored on the hard drive of a computer for later analysis. All macroscopic currents presented in this paper are proton-activated Na+ currents. The maximal inward or outward current activated by low pHe was measured and referred to as the transient peak current (I p, nA).I p usually occurred within 500∼1000 ms after the change in pHe. The relatively stable current was measured 8 s after the application of acidic pHe and is referred to as the sustained current (I s, nA). The inactivation time constant (τi, ms) was calculated by fitting the time course of current decay subsequent to peak current according to the equation,f(t)=∑i=1n Aiet/τi+CEquation 1 where A stands for the current amplitude, τi is the inactivation time constant, C is the basal current recorded at pH 7.5 for each component i, andt is the time period of the recording. The inactivating current (from the peak current to 8 s) was fit to a first order exponential. Determination of τi is depicted in Fig.2 B. Computation of the EC50 of the external proton concentration (pHe[/i]0.5) was performed by fitting both the acid-gated peak current and the sustained currents as a function of external pH with the Hill equation,INa=ImaxpHenpHen+EC50nEquation 2 where I Na is the proton-gated currents,I max is the maximal acid-gated current, pHe stands for the extraoocyte pH, EC50 represents the value of pHe, which results in half of the maximal current of the ASIC channel, and n is the Hill coefficient. To further verify the calculation, the Hill coefficient and EC50 were also computed by fitting the normalized acid-gated Na+ currents with the equation,ImaxINaImax=11+EC50[H+] eEquation 3 where [H+]e is the proton concentration in the bath solution. To analyze the steady-state kinetics for proton-activated Na+ current as a function of bath solution [Na+], superfusates containing variable concentrations of Na+ (ranging from 0 to 96 mm) were sequentially superfused into the chamber. K m andI max were calculated by fitting the proton-gated Na+ currents against the concentration of extracellular Na+ with the Michaelis-Menten equation,INa=Imax·[Na]Km+[Na])Equation 4 where K m is the concentration required for activating half of the maximal current, I max andI Na are the proton-gated currents, and [Na] represents the extraoocyte concentration of sodium. A nonlinear curve fitting subroutine was applied to fit the data. All results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Student'st test was used to compare means. A probability level of 0.05 or less was considered significant. ASIC2a and CFTR were detected in rat anterior hypothalamus by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.1). Control sections labeled with nonimmune IgG and secondary antibodies did not reveal any staining (not shown). CFTR is expressed in long cellular processes, most likely dendrites (Fig. 1, top panel). ASIC2a is expressed in punctate regions, most likely cell bodies of neurons (Fig.1 B, middle panel). Double-labeling with anti-CFTR and anti-ASIC2a antibodies revealed that CFTR is primarily expressed in a sub-population of neuronal cells expressing ASIC2a (Fig. 1,bottom panel). Some co-localization is also observed in neuronal cellular processes. Similar patterns of co-localization have also been observed in the hippocampus (not shown). To avoid any current from endogenous hyperpolarization-activated ion channels, which are activated at membrane potentials more hyperpolarized than −140 mV (47Kuruma A. Hirayama Y. Hartzell H.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 1401-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the exogenous acid-gated Na+ currents associated with ASICs were obtained while oocytes were clamped at −60 mV. Reduction of pHe (4.0) had no effect on I Na in water-injected oocytes (Figs. 2 and3). In oocytes expressing ASIC1a/2a, a reduction in pHe (4.0) transiently activated an inward Na+ current. The current peaked (I p) and then decayed exponentially to a value close to basal (unstimulated) values (Fig. 2B). The transiently activated Na+ current associated with ASIC1a/2a generally reached its peak in 500 ms or less (I p) after switching the pHe to 4.0 from 7.5. However, the acid-gated Na+ current took 1000 ms or more to become sustained (I s). The de-sensitized current fits to a first order exponential decay. The acid-gated sustained Na+current (I s) was measured 8 s after acidic pHe application. The characteristics of acid-gated Na+ currents described here are consistent with those demonstrated by a number of other investigators (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R.

CFTR increased the acid-activated Na+ currents (I p and I s); however, ΔF508-CFTR had no effect on I p andI s (Fig. 2, C and D). The current-voltage (I-V) relationships of both I pand I s for the heteromultimeric ASIC1a/2a channel displayed a linear conductance (Fig. 3, A and B). CFTR co-expression increased the slope conductance of the I-V curves for I p, leaving the reversal potential (∼30 mV) unchanged (Fig. 3 A). CFTR co-expression also increased the slope conductance of the I-V curve for I s (Fig.3 B). The reversal potential for I s was also unchanged by CFTR (Fig. 3 B). I p of ASIC1a/2a was −6772 ± 985 nA (n = 20) at a holding potential of −60 mV (Fig. 3 C), significantly greater than the current in uninjected oocytes (−14 ± 17 nA,p < 0.001). ASIC1a/2a-associated I pwas up-regulated in oocytes co-expressing CFTR (−15,554 ± 2,880 nA, p < 0.01) compared with oocytes expressing ASIC1a/2a alone. I s in the presence of CFTR also markedly increased to −2217 ± 506 (n = 19) from −624 ± 124 nA (n = 20; p < 0.01, Fig. 3 D). In contrast to the up-regulatory effect of CFTR on ASIC1a/2a, ΔF508-CFTR co-expression did not show a significant alteration in I p orI s (Fig. 2 C). Our previous studies demonstrated that β- and γ-ENaCs were involved in the cross-talk between CFTR and ENaC (8Ji H.-L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B. Fuller C.M.

In an attempt to identify which isoform of the heteromultimeric ASIC1a/2a channel was involved in the intermolecular interaction with CFTR, we co-expressed CFTR with either ASIC1a or ASIC2a in oocytes. As shown in Fig.4, CFTR did not increaseI p or I s produced by ASIC1a clone or by ASIC2a clone. However, the time to peak current was 1851 ± 414 ms (n = 9), and τi was 3613 ± 17 (n = 9) for ASIC1a, slower than those of ASIC2a or ASIC1a/2a. To examine the effect of CFTR activation on ASICs, we first tested the effect of a cAMP-elevating mixture on ASIC1a/2a. After application of this cAMP-elevating mixture, the normalized I pdecreased to 92 ± 5.1% (n = 5, p> 0.05) of its value before mixture application. In oocytes co-expressing ASIC1a/2a with CFTR, ASIC1a/2a I p was increased by 220 ± 31%. Application of the cAMP-elevating mixture produced a saturation of the CFTR current and did not significantly influence the proton-gated ASIC1a/2a current (−1665 ± 974 nA without mixture versus −1502 ± 842 nA with mixture, n = 6, p > 0.05). To determine whether CFTR co-expression modified the protonation of ASIC1a/2a channels, solutions of different external pH were applied to calculate the pHe required for ha"

The conjugation of GSH to electrophilic 5-oxoETE in vitro was found to be catalyzed by both soluble glutathioneS-transferase and membrane-bound leukotriene C4(LTC4) synthase. The cytosolic glutathioneS-transferase-catalyzed products were not biologically active; however, the adduct formed from recombinant LTC4synthase had identical mass spectrometric properties and biological activity to the macrophage-derived FOG7. The biosynthesis of FOG7 in the macrophage was inhibited by MK-886, a known inhibitor of LTC4 synthase, suggesting that this nuclear membrane-bound enzyme might be responsible for GSH conjugation to 5-oxoETE in the intact cell. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the microsomal fraction from the murine macrophage contained the enzyme responsible for FOG7biosynthesis. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of LTC4 synthase in the microsomal fraction that did not catalyze conjugation of GSH to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, indicating an absence of microsomal glutathioneS- transferase activity.

The enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid plays an important role in biology, leading to the production of a diverse family of biologically active eicosanoids, which typically carry information between cells, acting as intracellular chemical communicators of cellular activation. One pathway of arachidonic acid oxidation involves the addition of molecular oxygen to carbon-5 of arachidonic acid to afford 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (1Samuelsson B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 2-6Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev.

LTA4 is transformed either into the neutrophil chemotactic leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (3Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) through the LTA4hydrolase-catalyzed addition of water to LTA4 (4Haeggstrom J.Z. Clin. Rev.

Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 16-19Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LTC4 is rapidly metabolized through a series of peptidic cleavage reactions by ectoenzymes to the cysteinyl-glycine leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and the cysteine leukotriene E4 (LTE4) (6Denzlinger C. Guhlmann A. Scheuber P., H. Wilker D. Hammer D., K. Keppler D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15601-15606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three cysteinyl leukotrienes were previously known as slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis (7Murphy R.C. Hammarström S. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and are synthesized by several inflammatory cell types including the eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and platelets (8Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar, 9Holtzman M.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Maclouf J.A. Murphy R.C.

As a family, cysteinyl leukotrienes possess potent biological activities causing contraction of various smooth muscles and have been implicated as mediators of acute hypersensitivity reactions including asthma (11Leff A.R. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2001; 86 Suppl. 1: 4-8Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Although considerable interest has focused attention on the leukotriene pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism within cells, it is now recognized that another family of equally potent eicosanoids is formed through the metabolism of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid via the substrate 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which itself is metabolized into 5-oxoETE by a NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase in the neutrophil (12Powell W.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery that 5-oxoETE is a potent chemotactic factor for the eosinophil has raised interest in this eicosanoid because of a suggested role for eosinophils in the pathogenesis of asthma (14Butterfield J.H. Lieferman K.M. Gleich G.J. Frank M.J. Austen K.F. Claman H.N. Unanue E.R. Samter's Immunologic Diseases. 5th Ed. Little, Brown, and Co., Boston1995: 501-527Google Scholar, 15Martin L.B. Kita H.

Recently, a new biologically active cysteinyl 5-lipoxygenase product was structurally characterized as 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (FOG7), which was shown to be chemotactic for both the eosinophil and neutrophil (16Bowers B.C.

FOG7 and LTC4 are the only known biologically active GSH adducts of arachidonic acid and are, interestingly, isobaric, with a molecular mass of 625 daltons.The conjugation of GSH to various endogenous and exogenous electrophiles is not uncommon in biological systems due to the presence of numerous glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The GSTs make up a complex multigene family of proteins that play a central role in detoxifying electrophilic xenobiotics in nearly all species studied (17Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The primary function of these proteins is to catalyze the nucleophilic conjugation of GSH to exogenous and endogenous electrophiles by effectively increasing the concentration of the thiolate anion near the substrate when held in the active site (18Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). GSTs are typically cytosolic enzymes; however, there are four known microsomal GSTs including microsomal GST-I (19Lee S.H. DeJong J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), microsomal GST-II (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), microsomal GST-III (21Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Rienndeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Bio. Chem. 1997; 272: 22934-22939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and LTC4 synthase (5Lam B.K. Austen K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 16-19Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of LTC4, differs from conventional GSTs by its selectivity for LTA4 and closely related analogs and failure to conjugate GSH to xenobiotics (22Bach M.K. Brashler J.R. Peck R.E. Morton D.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1984; 74: 353-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase also exhibits differential susceptibility to inhibitors (24Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and lacks immunoreactivity to antibodies for known GSTs (23Nicholson D.W. Klemba M.W. Rasper D.M. Metters K.M. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

Opas E.E. Galavage M. Soderman D. Bonney R.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and lipoxygenase products (35Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Fatty Acids. 1992; 45: 1-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the macrophage is also capable of producing the chemotactic eicosanoid 5-oxoETE, the synthesis of this eicosanoid is not significantly enhanced by cell stimulus in contrast to other 5-lipoxygenase products (37Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence to suggest that oxygenation of arachidonate at carbon-5 with formation of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a precursor of 5-oxoETE, may be a preferred free radical pathway of arachidonate metabolism (38Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The major metabolite of 5-oxoETE in the macrophage is the GSH 1,4-Michael addition product FOG7, which also has chemotactic properties (16Bowers B.C. Hevko J.H. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29931-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The macrophage expresses the unique microsomal protein, LTC4 synthase (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), long thought to be specific only for LTA4 conversion to LTC4. It is now apparent that LTC4 synthase recognized 5-oxoETE as substrate and is likely the principal enzyme involved in the formation of FOG7 in the macrophage.Recombinant human LTC4 synthase as well as human and rat cytosolic GSTs all catalyzed the conjugation of GSH to the electrophilic 5-oxoETE, as identified by multiple reaction monitoring on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. LTC4 synthase catalyzed the production of a single GSH-5-oxoETE adduct, which displayed identical chromatographic properties and biological activity to that of macrophage-produced FOG7. Both human and rat GSTs catalyzed the conjugation of GSH to 5-oxoETE to produce an adduct that was not separable from FOG7 under the RP HPLC conditions used; however, these adducts did not initiate F-actin polymerization, suggesting that these compounds were in fact not FOG7. Rat GST also produced an additional minor adduct that was separable from FOG7 and the other GSH-5-oxoETE adducts. This minor GSH-5-oxoETE adduct also lacked the ability to initiate F-actin polymerization in the human neutrophil. MS/MS and MS3 analysis of these cytosolic GST-catalyzed products afforded spectra identical to that of FOG7, suggesting that these compounds are isomers of FOG7. Because the stereochemistry of FOG7 and these additional GSH-5-oxoETE adducts are not known, determination of the absolute stereochemistry of macrophage-derived FOG7 will likely require total organic synthesis. The chemical addition of GSH to 5-oxo-ETE would likely form equal quantities of two diastereoisomers at carbon-7 (absolute stereochemistry 7R and S), which may not substantially alter lipophilicity and, thus, RP-HPLC retention times.The nuclear membrane-bound protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein (FLAP) shows close homology to that of LTC4 synthase, and as a consequence, the FLAP antagonist, MK-886, has been shown to inhibit LTC4 synthase and formation of LTC4from the reactive precursor LTA4 (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FOG7production in the intact macrophage was completely inhibited by MK-886 at concentrations of 100 μm, with an effective IC50 consistent with the inhibition of LTC4formation from LTA4 in this cell type. The production of FOG7 catalyzed by the microsomal preparation was also inhibited by MK-886 (IC50, 7 μm). Even though this inhibition was not as efficient (80% inhibition at 100 μm) as that observed for the intact macrophage, this result was consistent with inhibition of recombinant LTC4synthase-dependent conversion of LTA4 to LTC4 and may be due to the detergent used to solubilize these membrane-bound proteins. The apparent K m determined for LTA4 conversion to LTC4 and 5-oxoETE conversion to FOG7 by macrophage microsomes were essentially identical. This low K m for LTA4 and 5-oxoETE (1.3 ± 0.34 and 1.6 ± 0.22, respectively) reinforces the suggestion that murine macrophage LTC4 synthase can be involved in both the formation of LTC4 and FOG7, therefore having a potential dual role in the metabolism of 5-lipoxygenase arachidonate products.Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody for LTC4synthase revealed detection of this enzyme in the microsomal fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction. The antibody used, however, had been raised against peptides in the FERV region, a region almost identical in the human and murine sequence but having substantial amino acid sequence similarity in FLAP and microsomal GST-II (31Scoggan K.A. Jakobsson P.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10182-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, this LTC4 synthase antibody might also detect both FLAP and microsomal GST-II.The conversion of LTA4-methyl ester to LTC4-methyl ester as well as LTC4 in the macrophage indicated that LTC4 synthase was expressed in this cell as expected (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The closely related microsomal GST-II has been previously shown to catalyze the conjugation of GSH to LTA4 but also mediates conjugation of GSH to CDNB (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A.

The absence of microsomal GST-II in the macrophage was confirmed by a failure of this preparation to form the CDNB-GSH adduct.

Because the microsomal fraction did not conjugate GSH to CDNB, LTC4 synthase was therefore most likely responsible for the biosynthesis of FOG7 in the macrophage. The absence of microsomal GSTs in the peritoneal macrophage is consistent with the observation that LTC4 synthase expression is not prevalent in tissues that express microsomal GST-II and/or GST-III, with the testis being the exception (42Kanaoka Y.

However, an interesting question remains to be answered as to whether or not microsomal GSTs expressed within another cell type could catalyze conversion of 5-oxoETE into FOG7.Stimulation of the murine peritoneal macrophage by the calcium ionophore A23187 results in the abundant production of LTC4due to generation of LTA4 but very little 5-oxoETE (37Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar) and no FOG7. 4J. M. Hevko and R. C. Murphy, unpublished data. Because there have been no reports of stimulated production of both 5-oxoETE and LTA4 within the same cell type, it is difficult to assess whether these two substrates ever compete for LTC4synthase. However, the generation of 5-oxoETE by nonenzymatic pathways (38Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) could lead to the presentation of this substrate to LTC4 synthase within the macrophage or other cell types (e.g. platelet) without activation of 5-lipoxygenase and concomitant formation of LTA4.In summary, the biosynthesis of FOG7 from 5-oxoETE and GSH in the elicited peritoneal macrophage was found to be catalyzed by a membrane-localized enzyme rather than cytosolic GSTs. Biochemical and pharmacological evidence suggests that nuclear membrane-bound LTC4 synthase, long thought to be specific for the formation of LTC4 from LTA4, is responsible for this conjugation reaction. The enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid plays an important role in biology, leading to the production of a diverse family of biologically active eicosanoids, which typically carry information between cells, acting as intracellular chemical communicators of cellular activation. One pathway of arachidonic acid oxidation involves the addition of molecular oxygen to carbon-5 of arachidonic acid to afford 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (1Samuelsson B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 2-6Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev.

LTA4 is transformed either into the neutrophil chemotactic leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (3Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J.

Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 16-19Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LTC4 is rapidly metabolized through a series of peptidic cleavage reactions by ectoenzymes to the cysteinyl-glycine leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and the cysteine leukotriene E4 (LTE4) (6Denzlinger C.

These three cysteinyl leukotrienes were previously known as slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis (7Murphy R.C. Hammarström S. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The discovery that 5-oxoETE is a potent chemotactic factor for the eosinophil has raised interest in this eicosanoid because of a suggested role for eosinophils in the pathogenesis of asthma (14Butterfield J.H.

Recently, a new biologically active cysteinyl 5-lipoxygenase product was structurally characterized as 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (FOG7), which was shown to be chemotactic for both the eosinophil and neutrophil (16Bowers B.C. Hevko J.H. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29931-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FOG7 and LTC4 are the only known biologically active GSH adducts of arachidonic acid and are, interestingly, isobaric, with a molecular mass of 625 daltons. The conjugation of GSH to various endogenous and exogenous electrophiles is not uncommon in biological systems due to the presence of numerous glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The GSTs make up a complex multigene family of proteins that play a central role in detoxifying electrophilic xenobiotics in nearly all species studied (17Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The primary function of these proteins is to catalyze the nucleophilic conjugation of GSH to exogenous and endogenous electrophiles by effectively increasing the concentration of the thiolate anion near the substrate when held in the active site (18Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). GSTs are typically cytosolic enzymes; however, there are four known microsomal GSTs including microsomal GST-I (19Lee S.H. DeJong J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), microsomal GST-II (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), microsomal GST-III (21Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Rienndeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Bio. Chem. 1997; 272: 22934-22939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and LTC4 synthase (5Lam B.K. Austen K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161, Suppl. 2, Part 2: 16-19Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of LTC4, differs from conventional GSTs by its selectivity for LTA4 and closely related analogs and failure to conjugate GSH to xenobiotics (22Bach M.K. Brashler J.R. Peck R.E. Morton D.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1984; 74: 353-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase also exhibits differential susceptibility to inhibitors (24Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and lacks immunoreactivity to antibodies for known GSTs (23Nicholson D.W. Klemba M.W. Rasper D.M. Metters K.M. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

DISCUSSIONThe macrophage is an efficient cell in processing arachidonic acid with the formation of both cyclooxygenase (34Humes J.L. Opas E.E. Galavage M. Soderman D. Bonney R.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and lipoxygenase products (35Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 36Abe M. Goya T. Nagata N. Takahashi H. Muranishi H. Shigematsu N. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 45: 1-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the macrophage is also capable of producing the chemotactic eicosanoid 5-oxoETE, the synthesis of this eicosanoid is not significantly enhanced by cell stimulus in contrast to other 5-lipoxygenase products (37Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence to suggest that oxygenation of arachidonate at carbon-5 with formation of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a precursor of 5-oxoETE, may be a preferred free radical pathway of arachidonate metabolism (38Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The major metabolite of 5-oxoETE in the macrophage is the GSH 1,4-Michael addition product FOG7, which also has chemotactic properties (16Bowers B.C. Hevko J.H. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29931-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The macrophage expresses the unique microsomal protein, LTC4 synthase (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), long thought to be specific only for LTA4 conversion to LTC4. It is now apparent that LTC4 synthase recognized 5-oxoETE as substrate and is likely the principal enzyme involved in the formation of FOG7 in the macrophage.Recombinant human LTC4 synthase as well as human and rat cytosolic GSTs all catalyzed the conjugation of GSH to the electrophilic 5-oxoETE, as identified by multiple reaction monitoring on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. LTC4 synthase catalyzed the production of a single GSH-5-oxoETE adduct, which displayed identical chromatographic properties and biological activity to that of macrophage-produced FOG7. Both human and rat GSTs catalyzed the conjugation of GSH to 5-oxoETE to produce an adduct that was not separable from FOG7 under the RP HPLC conditions used; however, these adducts did not initiate F-actin polymerization, suggesting that these compounds were in fact not FOG7. Rat GST also produced an additional minor adduct that was separable from FOG7 and the other GSH-5-oxoETE adducts. This minor GSH-5-oxoETE adduct also lacked the ability to initiate F-actin polymerization in the human neutrophil. MS/MS and MS3 analysis of these cytosolic GST-catalyzed products afforded spectra identical to that of FOG7, suggesting that these compounds are isomers of FOG7. Because the stereochemistry of FOG7 and these additional GSH-5-oxoETE adducts are not known, determination of the absolute stereochemistry of macrophage-derived FOG7 will likely require total organic synthesis. The chemical addition of GSH to 5-oxo-ETE would likely form equal quantities of two diastereoisomers at carbon-7 (absolute stereochemistry 7R and S), which may not substantially alter lipophilicity and, thus, RP-HPLC retention times.The nuclear membrane-bound protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein (FLAP) shows close homology to that of LTC4 synthase, and as a consequence, the FLAP antagonist, MK-886, has been shown to inhibit LTC4 synthase and formation of LTC4from the reactive precursor LTA4 (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FOG7production in the intact macrophage was completely inhibited by MK-886 at concentrations of 100 μm, with an effective IC50 consistent with the inhibition of LTC4formation from LTA4 in this cell type. The production of FOG7 catalyzed by the microsomal preparation was also inhibited by MK-886 (IC50, 7 μm). Even though this inhibition was not as efficient (80% inhibition at 100 μm) as that observed for the intact macrophage, this result was consistent with inhibition of recombinant LTC4synthase-dependent conversion of LTA4 to LTC4 and may be due to the detergent used to solubilize these membrane-bound proteins. The apparent K m determined for LTA4 conversion to LTC4 and 5-oxoETE conversion to FOG7 by macrophage microsomes were essentially identical. This low K m for LTA4 and 5-oxoETE (1.3 ± 0.34 and 1.6 ± 0.22, respectively) reinforces the suggestion that murine macrophage LTC4 synthase can be involved in both the formation of LTC4 and FOG7, therefore having a potential dual role in the metabolism of 5-lipoxygenase arachidonate products.Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody for LTC4synthase revealed detection of this enzyme in the microsomal fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction. The antibody used, however, had been raised against peptides in the FERV region, a region almost identical in the human and murine sequence but having substantial amino acid sequence similarity in FLAP and microsomal GST-II (31Scoggan K.A. Jakobsson P.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10182-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, this LTC4 synthase antibody might also detect both FLAP and microsomal GST-II.The conversion of LTA4-methyl ester to LTC4-methyl ester as well as LTC4 in the macrophage indicated that LTC4 synthase was expressed in this cell as expected (39Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Rokach J. Kongyi X. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The closely related microsomal GST-II has been previously shown to catalyze the conjugation of GSH to LTA4 but also mediates conjugation of GSH to CDNB (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A.

The absence of microsomal GST-II in the macrophage was confirmed by a failure of this preparation to form the CDNB-GSH adduct. LTC4 synthase is the only known GST, both cytosolic and microsomal, that does not catalyze the conjugation of GSH to CDNB (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

The closely related microsomal GST-II has been previously shown to catalyze the conjugation of GSH to LTA4 but also mediates conjugation of GSH to CDNB (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2578-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The absence of microsomal GST-II in the macrophage was confirmed by a failure of this preparation to form the CDNB-GSH adduct. LTC4 synthase is the only known GST, both cytosolic and microsomal, that does not catalyze the conjugation of GSH to CDNB (20Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,29Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Klemba M.W. Munday N.A. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

S. A. 1992; 89: 11603-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the microsomal fraction did not conjugate GSH to CDNB, LTC4 synthase was therefore most likely responsible for the biosynthesis of FOG7 in the macrophage. The absence of microsomal GSTs in the peritoneal macrophage is consistent with the observation that LTC4 synthase expression is not prevalent in tissues that express microsomal GST-II and/or GST-III, with the testis being the exception (42Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, an interesting question remains to be answered as to whether or not microsomal GSTs expressed within another cell type could catalyze conversion of 5-oxoETE into FOG7. Stimulation of the murine peritoneal macrophage by the calcium ionophore A23187 results in the abundant production of LTC4due to generation of LTA4 but very little 5-oxoETE (37Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar) and no FOG7. 4J. M. Hevko and R. C. Murphy, unpublished data. Because there have been no reports of stimulated production of both 5-oxoETE and LTA4 within the same cell type, it is difficult to assess whether these two substrates ever compete for LTC4synthase. However, the generation of 5-oxoETE by nonenzymatic pathways (38Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) could lead to the presentation of this substrate to LTC4 synthase within the macrophage or other cell types (e.g. platelet) without activation of 5-lipoxygenase and concomitant formation of LTA4. In summary, the biosynthesis of FOG7 from 5-oxoETE and GSH in the elicited peritoneal macrophage was found to be catalyzed by a membrane-localized enzyme rather than cytosolic GSTs. Biochemical and pharmacological evidence suggests that nuclear membrane-bound LTC4 synthase, long thought to be specific for the formation of LTC4 from LTA4, is responsible for this conjugation reaction. The purification of recombinant LTC4 synthase was expertly carried out by Wesley Martin."

HWY 289 and HWY 336 completely inhibited the proliferation of wild type as well as various mutant fission yeast cells (minimal inhibitory concentrations were 29.52 μm for HWY 289 and 11.83 μm for HWY 336), but did not affect the proliferation of Wis1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) deletion mutants. In addition, HWY 289 with an IC50 value of 7.3 μm or HWY 336 with IC50 of 5.7 μm specifically inhibited in vitro kinase activities of purified Wis1, whereas either compound did not affect the activities of other kinases in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades of fission yeast. These genetic and biochemical results demonstrate the high degree of specificity of HWY 289 and HWY 336 to MAPKK Wis1 and suggest that the cytotoxicity of these compounds is not simply due to the inhibition of Wis1 kinase activity. High salt wash experiments have shown that strong noncovalent binding occurs between Wis1 and either HWY 289 or HWY 336. The preincubation of Wis1 kinase with ATP did not affect the inhibition of Wis1 by HWY 289 and HWY 336, but when Wis1 was preincubated with MBP, a protein substrate, Wis1 kinase activity was no longer inhibited. These observations demonstrate that HWY 289/HWY 336 do inhibit Wis1 kinase, not by binding to the ATP-binding site but by disturbing the binding of substrate to the kinase. Target validation of the complex of HWY 289/HWY 336 and Wis1 kinase will provide important clues for the mechanism of specific cytotoxicity of these compounds in S. pombe. On a broader aspect, it would create an initiative to further modify and develop compounds that selectively inhibit kinases and cause cytotoxicity in various MAPK cascades including those of mammals.

Berberine alkaloids supposedly have diverse biological effects including anti-tumor activity in mice, anti-Candida activity, cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines, and inhibition of dopamine biosynthesis (1.Park K.S.

Since berberine has been shown to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis, 515 synthetic and semisynthetic berberine derivatives were produced and screened for more effective anti-fungal activity in C. albicans (5.Nakamoto K. Sadamori S. Hamada T. J. Prosthetic Dentistry. 1990; 64: 691-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C. albicans is the most frequently isolated fungal pathogen in humans. Its ability to change from a yeast form to a filamentous hypal or pseudohypal form during growth is thought to contribute to its virulence (6.Cutler J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). HWY 289 and HWY 336 were selected because of their highly effective anti-Candida properties in the screen. Since C. albicans is a diploid fungus with no known sexual cycle and target validation by genetic approaches is limited, direct targets of HWY 289 and HWY 336 were identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is amenable for genetic studies. Studies using various mutations of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae have shown that yeast provides a good system for identifying targets of known compounds such as rapamycin and FK506 (7.Heitman J.

In this paper, we report that the novel berberine derivatives having anti-Candida properties, HWY 289 and HWY 336, selectively inhibit the in vivo and in vitro activities of a specific kinase in the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseMKK or MAPKKMAPK kinaseMAPKKKMAPK kinase kinaseMEKKMAPK/ERK kinase kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinMICminimal inhibitory concentrationGSTglutathione S-transferaseSAPKstress-activated protein kinase, TOR, target-of-rapamycin cascade in S. pombe. mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase MAPK/ERK kinase kinase myelin basic protein minimal inhibitory concentration glutathione S-transferase stress-activated protein kinase, TOR, target-of-rapamycin MAPK (sometimes called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) cascades are highly conserved signaling cassettes found in all eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells respond to diverse extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, high temperature, osmotic shock, and hydroxyl radicals by activating distinct MAP kinase cascades, which lead to diverse regulatory events including proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Therefore, kinases in distinct MAPK cascades serve as effective cytotoxic targets for a number of anti-fungal, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Each MAPK cascade is composed of a series of three or more protein kinases, each phosphorylating, thereby activating, the next kinase in the pathway. MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in the catalytic domain by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs, sometimes called MEKs). These are in turn activated by phosphorylation of specific conserved serine/threonine residues by MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs, sometimes called MEKKs). Several MAPK cascades exist in a cell. Each of them functions in parallel by mediating a specific signal; yet, activation of a single MAPK can be affected by various signals. In addition, specific MAPK signaling pathways interact with one another to form a complex network (13.Garrington T. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Therefore, to better understand signal transduction in MAPK cascades, we must answer questions about how various signals are integrated to activate a single response and how signaling specificity is maintained in stress-specific and tissue- specific manners. Synthetic inhibitory components of several MAPK cascades have proven excellent tools for studying MAPK signaling specificity mechanisms in mammalian cells. PD 098059 (2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one) and U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-minophenyl-thio)butadiene) are specific inhibitors for MEK1 and MEK2 (14.Dudley D.T. Pang L.

MAPK Spk1, MAPKK Byr1, MAPKKK Byr2, and a small GTPase, Ras1, comprise a cascade required for mating and sporulation (21.Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Shimanuki M. Toda T. Imai Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell.

The integrity of the Wis1-Spc1 pathway is required for survival under varied stress conditions such as high osmolarity and oxidative stress. MAPKK Wis1 is activated by MAPKKKs Win1 and Wis4, which in turn activates MAPK Spc1 following osmotic, heat, or oxidative stress (24.Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A.

Another stress-activated MAP kinase cascade, consisting of MAPKKK Mkh1, MAPKK Skh1, and MAPK Spm1, regulates morphogenesis and cell wall integrity in relation to environmental conditions (27.Sengar A.S.

There are highly conserved functional similarities between MKK4/7-SAPK and MKK3/6-p38 pathways of mammalians and the Wis-Spc1 pathway of fission yeast. Similarities are also observed between the mammalian Ras-Raf-MEK1-ERK pathway and the fission yeast Ras1-Byr2-Byr1-Spk1 pathway. These striking resemblances to mammalian cells and the relative simplicities of the cascades, combined with genetic amenability, make fission yeast an ideal system for studying the mechanisms of a drug action by chemical control of gene function. In this report, we show that specific berberine derivatives selectively inhibit the kinase activity of Wis1 MAPKK in S. pombe and suggest the applicability of these berberine derivatives to the development of selective inhibitors for kinases in divergent stress-activated MAPK cascades of mammalian cells. HWY 289 (1,3-benzodioxolo[5,6-a]-9,10-dimethoxybenzo[g]-13-(4-(1,1-dimethyl)ethylbenzyl) qinolizinium chloride) and HWY 336 (1,3-benzodioxolo[5,6-a]-9,10-dimethoxybenzo[g]-13-(4-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxybenzyl)qinolizinium chloride) were synthesized from berberine chloride (Sigma) as summarized in Fig. 1.

Goffeau Open table in a new tab Each stock solution of berberine chloride (1 mg/ml), HWY 289 (1 mg/ml), and HWY 336 (1 mg/ml) was prepared in DMSO. The MIC of each compound for the wild type of S. pombe was determined by transferring cells grown to midlog phase (5 × 106 cells/ml) in yeast extract supplemented with adenine and uracil into the fresh media containing different concentrations of HWY 289, HWY 336, and berberine, respectively. Cells were incubated for 12 h with shaking and counted every 3 h for 24 h to monitor the growth rate. DMSO, the compound solvent, had no visible effect on cell growth. The reversible effect of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the growth of S. pombe was examined by counting cell numbers in drug-free media every 3 h for 6 h after incubating with MIC of each drug for 18 h. The same number of cells incubated with each drug were collected and washed three times with double-distilled H2O and media before switching to drug-free media. Each MIC of HWY 289 and HWY336 was also tested on a range of mutants of S. pombe for 12 h with shaking and counted every 3 h for 24 h to monitor the growth rate. Cell morphologies were observed at ×100 using a light microscope (Axioscop; Zeiss). The expressions of 6×His/HA-tagged Win1, Skh1, Spm1, Byr1, and GST-tagged Wis1 and Spc1 were respectively induced from the pREP1 nmt1 promoter by incubating log phase KGY246 cells transformed with each plasmid in the absence of thiamine for 18 h at 29 °C (32.Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Before harvest, cells expressing tagged Win1, Skh1, Spm1, Wis1, and Spc1 kinases were exposed to 0.6 m KCl for 20 min to activate the kinase by osmotic stress, and cells expressing Byr1 were incubated in nitrogen-free media for 6 h to activate the kinase by nitrogen starvation. Cells were disrupted by glass beads in HB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% Triton-X, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) after washing once with PBS containing 50 mm NaF and 1 mm NaN3, and the lysate was incubated with 3.2 μg of HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C followed with 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C or 45 mg/ml GST beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, respectively. The beads were washed three times with 1.0 ml of HA buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) prior to kinase assays. The kinase assay was performed for 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of 1 mg/ml MBP (Sigma), 1 mm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated MBP was resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and detected by autoradiography. The concentrations of HWY 289 and HWY 336 that caused 50% inhibition of kinase activity (IC50) were determined by kinase assays of Wis1 bound to beads with a range of varied concentrations of each HWY compound or Me2SO in kinase buffer for 10 min at 30 °C. To determine whether the binding of HWY 289 and HWY 336 to Wis1 was reversible, purified kinase was treated with HWY 289 or HWY 336, respectively, and washed three times with kinase buffer containing different concentrations of NaCl from 100 to 500 mm prior to kinase assays. The competition of HWY 289 and HWY 336 with protein substrate or ATP for Wis1 binding was resolved by comparing the kinase activity of GST bead-purified Wis1, preincubated with 1 mg/ml MBP or 1 mmATP, respectively, prior to the addition of HWY 289 or HWY 336, to that of purified Wis1 kinase, pretreated with each HWY compound before the addition of 1 mg/ml MBP or 1 mm ATP. The novel berberine derivatives HWY 289 and HWY 336 were prepared in the lead berberine optimization process to search for compounds having potent anti-fungal activity and better pharmacological profiles. The synthesis of these berberine derivatives was started with commercially available berberine chloride and processed as presented in Fig. 1. Each desired derivative was verified by 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) spectroscopic analysis. To utilize fission yeast S. pombe for studying the targets and biological actions of berberine derivatives, we first examined the cytotoxic effects of the lead compound berberine chloride and the novel berberine derivatives HWY 289 and HWY336 on the proliferation of fission yeast. Berberine slowed down but did not completely inhibit the proliferation of wild type S. pombe (Fig. 2A). However, as expected from the highly effective anti-Candida activities of HWY 289 and HWY 336 over berberine (1.Park K.S. Kang K.C. Kim J.H. Adams D.J. Johng T.N. Paik Y.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1999; 43: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), these compounds completely blocked the proliferation of wild type fission yeast (Fig. 2A). The MIC on the wild type S. pombe was 29.52 μm for HWY 289 and 11.83 μm for HWY 336 (Table II). We also examined whether the inhibitory effect of these compounds on the proliferation of fission yeast was reversible. The cells treated with HWY 289 and HWY 336 could not resume active proliferation even after several washes with media, suggesting that the effects of these compounds on the growth of S. pombe were due to very tight binding to targets (Fig. 2B). In addition to growth inhibition, the wild type fission yeast cells were more sensitive to HWY 289 and HWY 336 when osmotic stress (0.6 m KCl) was applied to these cells and were less sensitive in isotonic media containing 1.2 m sorbitol (data not shown). These observations suggest that the berberine derivatives HWY 289 and HWY 336 might target the stress-response pathways, particularly those involved in regulating osmolarity. We then examined the effects of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on various mutant cells in which the function of each gene related to osmolarity control was destroyed, including mutants of ion and metabolite transport and mutants of MAP kinase cascades for osmotic stress signaling. The effect of berberine chloride on these mutants was also examined as a control for specificity of these compounds.Table IIMICs of the berberine derivatives on S. pombe strainsStrainHWY 289HWY 336μmKGY24629.5211.83 Open table in a new tab Three S. pombe mutations, cyh3, cyh4, and pma1, have been reported for their defects in metabolite transport. The genes for cyh3 and cyh4 have not been cloned, but these mutants exhibited reduced membrane ergosterol and reduced uptake of amino acids (33.Ibrahim M.A. Coddington A. Heredity. 1976; 37: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34.Johnston P.A. Coddington A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). pma1 encodes an H+-ATPase in the plasma membrane for metabolite transport, and its mutant exhibited multiple drug resistance (35.Ulaszewski S. Van Herck J.C. Dufour J.P. Kulpa J. Nieuwenhuis B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the effects of HWY 289, HWY 336, and berberine chloride on these mutants were compared with those on wild type S. pombe, cyh3, cyh4, and pma1 mutant cells were as sensitive as wild type cells (data not shown). As described in the introduction, two pathways among three stress-activated MAP kinase cascades have been elucidated for osmotic stress signaling in S. pombe. The effects of HWY 289 and HWY 336 were examined in each deletion mutant of the components in two MAP kinase cascades for osmotic stress signaling including win1, wis4, wis1, spc1, mkh1, skh1, and spm1. The effects of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on byr2 and byr1 mutants of another MAP kinase cascade were also observed as controls for specificity. While HWY 289 and HWY 336 completely blocked the growth of other kinase mutants and wild type cells, they did not inhibit the proliferation of wis1 deletion mutant cells (Fig. 3, A and B; data not shown). Previous genetic studies have reported that wis1 as well as its direct upstream activators, win1 and wis4, and the downstream target spc1 are required for survival in high osmolarity conditions, but their deletion mutants are not lethal (24.Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25.Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. Warbrick E. Weisman R. Fantes P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26.Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Our results showed that HWY 289 and HWY 336 did not inhibit the growth of wis1 deletion mutant cells but did block the proliferation of win1, wis4, and spc1 deletion mutants (Fig. 3, A and B). These observations also demonstrate that the effect of HWY 289/HWY 336 on wild type is different from the phenotype of a wis1 null mutation. The specific effect of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the growth of wis1 deletion mutant cells and the discrepancy between the effect of these compounds on wild type and the phenotype of wis1 deletion mutant strongly suggest that Wis1 kinase could be a direct target of these compounds, although these compounds may not inhibit cell growth by simply blocking Wis1 kinase activity. In contrast to HWY 289 and HWY 336, berberine and the solvent Me2SO showed the same effect on these mutants as on wild type cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Since HWY 289 and HWY 336 could not inhibit the proliferation of wis1 deletion mutant cells specifically, the effect of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the S. pombe mutants of other kinases including Cdc2 and polo kinase Plo1 was also examined. Other kinase mutants were as sensitive to HWY 289 and HWY 336 as wild type fission yeast cells (data not shown), suggesting the high specificity of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on wis1 deletion mutant cells. The specific effect of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the growth of wis1 deletion mutant cells led us to analyze the precise effect of these compounds on the kinase activity of each component of the Wis1-Spc1 MAP kinase cascade. Based on in vivo observations, we first investigated whether HWY 289 and HWY 336 could directly inhibit the kinase activity of Wis1 MAPKK at each MIC concentration, respectively. We also examined the effect of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the kinase activity of MAPKKK Win1 and MAPK Spc1 in the Wis1 MAPK cascade and of MAPKKs Skh1 and Byr1 and MAPK Spm1 in other MAPK cascades. The His6/hemagglutinin-tagged Win1, Skh1, Spm1, and Byr1 and GST-tagged Wis1 and Spc1, each of which is expressed in wild-type KGY246, were activated upon exposure to 0.6 m KCl or by nitrogen starvation and were purified using tag-specific beads or antibodies. The activity of each purified kinase was measured by MBP phosphorylation after preincubation with HWY 289 and HWY 336. The effect of the lead compound berberine chloride on Wis1 kinase was also examined. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, Wis1 kinase activity was completely blocked by incubation with HWY 289 and HWY 336, and neither the phosphorylation of substrate MBP nor the autophosphorylation of Wis1 kinase was observed. On the other hand, the kinase activities of Win1 and Spc1 were not altered by incubation with HWY 289 and HWY 336 (Fig. 4D). The presence of berberine chloride did not show any effect on Wis1 kinase activity, which is consistent with in vivo assays (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated that HWY 289 and HWY 336 selectively block Wis1 kinase activity but have no effect on the kinase activities of Win1 and Spc1. We also investigated the effects of HWY 289 and HWY 336 on the kinase activity of other MAPKKs, Skh1 and Byr1, to examine whether the kinase-inhibitory actions of HWY 289 and HWY 336 are specifically aimed at Wis1 kinase, but not at other MAPKKs, as suggested by the in vivo mutant analyses. HWY 289 and HWY 336 did not inhibit the kinase activity of Skh1 and Byr1 (Fig. 4D and data not shown). As expected from in vivo studies, these compounds do not affect the activity of MAPK Spm1 (Fig. 4D). These findings are consistent with the in vivo results and indicate that the novel berberine derivatives HWY 289 and HWY 336 selectively bind and inhibit MAPKK Wis1. The selective inhibition of Wis1 kinase by HWY 289 and HWY 336 led us to determine the concentration of these compounds for 50% inhibition of Wis1 kinase activity (IC50) by performing in vitro kinase assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of HWY 289 or HWY 336 (Fig. 5, A and B). Wis1 kinase activity was partially inhibited at 5 μm and inhibited completely at 10 μm of both HWY 289 and HWY 336 (Fig. 5, A and B). The IC50 of Wis1 kinase was 7.3 μm for HWY 289 and 5.7 μm for HWY 336, as listed in Table III.Table IIIIC50 of the berberine derivatives on the Wis1 kinase of S. pombeKinaseHWY 289HWY 336μ mWis 17.35.7 Open table in a new tab As shown previously in Fig. 2B, cells treated with HWY 289 and HWY 336 did not resume active proliferation even after several washes with media, suggesting that the effects of these compounds on the growth of S. pombe were due to very tight bindings to targets. Therefore, we inspected whether the specific binding and inhibition of Wis1 kinase by HWY 289 and HWY 336 is irreversible. The activity of purified Wis1 kinase bound to beads was completely inhibited by 10 μm HWY 289 or HWY 336 when incubated with each compound for 10 min before kinase assays (Fig. 5). Wis1 kinase activity was not restored despite several washes of each compound with kinase buffer prior to kinase assays (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 2). Wis1 kinase activity was examined after Wis1 kinase, preincubat"

One unsolved question concerns the molecular mechanisms of chromatin remodeling during in vivo promoter activation. By using a high resolution in vivo analysis we show that when yeast cells are exposed to a regulatory signal the positions of specific nucleosomes change. The system analyzed consists of the basic elements of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH2 promoter, two nucleosomes of which are shown to change the distribution of their positions by few nucleotides in the direction of transcription when the glucose content of the medium is lowered. Such repositioning does not occur in the absence of the ADH2 transcriptional activator Adr1 or in the presence of its DNA-binding domain alone. A construct consisting of the DNA-binding domain plus a 43-amino acid peptide containing the Adr1 activation domain is sufficient to induce the same effect of the full-length protein. Nucleosome repositioning occurs even when the catalytic activity of the RNA polymerase II is impaired, suggesting that the Adr1 activation domain mediates the recruitment of some factor to correctly preset the relevant sequences for the subsequent transcription steps.

The two gene systems in which in vivo chromatin remodeling was best characterized (the yeast PHO5 and GAL1-GAL10) (21Gregory P.D. Hörz W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were analyzed only at low resolution levels, thus preventing definitive understanding of the underlying mechanism. We have studied the mechanisms of in vivo chromatin remodeling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on the gene coding for the alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH2) in its natural chromosomal location. The transcriptional activator of the system (22Denis C.L. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the key regulatory region (23Beier D.R. Young E.T.

To evaluate what exactly happens in vivo during derepression to the nucleosome particles spanning the ADH2 promoter, we apply here a high resolution method (24Verdone L. Camilloni G., Di Mauro E.

A short region encompassed between the two nucleosomes can be alternatively occupied by members of either family (24Verdone L. Camilloni G., Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Precise mapping of the borders was obtained in a population of cells growing in repressing conditions (3% glucose). The analysis of chromatin remodeling during derepression was so far performed at low resolution by indirect end-labeling (24Verdone L. Camilloni G., Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell.

This is consistent with nucleosomal loss during derepression or with a change of nucleosome location or conformation allowing increased MN access. These possibilities are not distinguishable at low resolution and are not necessarily mutually exclusive. By using a high resolution in vivo analysis we show that the two promoter nucleosomes change the distribution of their positions by few nucleotides in the direction of transcription and that this repositioning is mediated by the Adr1 activation domain.

Spheroplasts from cells exponentially growing (A 600 0.3–0.5/ml) were treated with nystatin (100 μg/ml) to allow the access of MN to the nucleus. The samples were incubated with MN (120 units/ml, 37 °C, 15 min), and the reaction was stopped with 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. After proteinase K (2 h, 56 °C), phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, the samples were electrophoresed on preparative 1.5% agarose-TBE gels to isolate the mononucleosomal DNA. The monomer-sized DNA was eluted by the “Concert” rapid gel extraction system (Invitrogen), and the amount was determined by the ethidium bromide-based spot test. The samples were primer-extended with Taq polymerase in the presence of labeled oligonucleotides and analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide-TBE gels. Nucleotide-level mapping was obtained by parallel sequencing lanes. To determine the weight average of each group of borders, we started from the densitometric scannings shown in Figs.1 D and 2 C and calculated the area of each border (upstream or downstream) in repressing (R) or derepressing (180′) conditions. These values, expressed as arbitrary units (see Tables I and II), were first corrected by multiplying for a correction factor (calculated as detailed in the legends of Tables Iand II), which takes into consideration the intrinsic differences between the upstream and the downstream profiles (namely the differential primer-specific efficiency of annealing and the sequence-dependent Taq polymerase efficiency of elongation) and then transformed in percentage relative to the total (100%). The percentage of each border was then multiplied for the number corresponding to the map position.Figure 2Change of the distribution of the members of the +1 nucleosomal family.

The correction factors introduced in this calculation were necessary to compare the area values obtained with different oligonucleotides extending on different filaments of the same monomeric DNA template. Nystatin-treated spheroplasts were digested with low amounts of MN (0.5 and 1 unit/0.25 ml, 37 °C, 15 min). After proteinase K and phenol-chloroform extraction, the purified DNA was primer-extended with Taqpolymerase in the presence of labeled oligonucleotides and analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide-TBE gels. For the experiment shown in Fig.4 B, aliquots containing an equal number of cells (0.5 to 1 × 108) were pelleted, and total RNA was prepared as described (31Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). After spectrophotometric determination of the amount of RNA present in each aliquot, 10 μg of RNA were loaded onto 1.2% agarose-MOPS gels, containing formaldehyde as a denaturing agent and ethidium bromide as an intercalating dye. Northern blot analysis was performed by standard procedures with Hybond N+ nylon paper (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).

Camilloni G., Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore asked what would happen to the same groups of nucleosome particles when analyzed during transcriptional activation by studying the distribution of their borders after extensive MN digestion of the spheroplasts. We reasoned that, depending on the type of mechanisms underlying theADH2 chromatin remodeling, the high resolution pattern of MN-induced cuts would be different, as follows. (i) If nucleosomal loss is the major mechanistic feature taking place upon derepression, with no particle relocation occurring, the intensity of the entire borders profile should decrease homogeneously. In this instance, MN may have access to the DNA sites that have lost their nucleosomal organization and degrade them. The corresponding nucleosomal borders would be lost. (ii) If a conformational change occurs upon derepression in part or in all the members of a nucleosomal family, the MN accessibility of the modified members of the family would be different from that of the non-modified ones. This would cause a partial or total modification of the distribution of the border intensities, respectively. (iii) If the chromatin modification occurring upon derepression consists of a directional repositioning of nucleosomal particles, the intensities of the borders should vary in a predictable way. The variation of the border profile should consist of the decrease of the borders on one side, matched by the increase of the corresponding borders on the opposite side. If the repositioning occurs over several helical repeats, the appearance of new bands on one side of the initial border distribution should be observed (accompanied by a decrease or disappearance in the opposite side). Fig. 1 shows the results obtained for the nucleosome −1, in a wild type and its isogenic adr1 strain. Two divergent oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 C) were used with the same amount of material: oligonucleotide 1 anneals in the center of the population and extends rightward, away from the UAS1, thus defining all the downstream borders of the nucleosome family −1 (Fig.1 A); oligonucleotide 2 anneals in the center and extends leftward, toward the UAS1, thus defining all the upstream borders of the family (Fig. 1 B). The nucleotide level mapping of the borders and the identification of the single particles is reported in Fig. 1 C. Fig.1 A (downstream distribution) shows that the intensity of some borders (−1.1, −1.2, −1.3, −1.4) in the wild type but not in the adr1 strain does indeed decrease with a different rate during derepression whereas the intensity of the others (−1.5, −1.6) increases. The decreased frequency is expected from, and explained by, the accumulation of MN cleavages inside certain monomeric particles, thus causing their absence as substrates for primer extension. The increased frequency of certain borders is explained considering that some members of the family −1 “disappear” from one place to “reappear” in a different place, consistent with a shift of the position of the particles in the direction of transcription. In addition, some new bands appear above the −1.6 border (seearrowheads in Fig. 1 A, left panel, and in the bottom panel showing a longer autoradiographic exposure of the specific area). Fig. 1 B (upstream distribution) shows a stronger decrease in the intensities of some borders (−1.1, −1.2, −1.3, −1.4), a less pronounced decrease in the intensities of the others (−1.5, −1.6), and the appearance of new bands below the −1.6 border (see arrowheads in Fig.1 B, left panel). The new bands, present on one side only of the initial distribution, i.e. beyond the −1.6 particle (more clearly visible for the same nucleosome in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 A, arrowheads, and for the nucleosome +1 in Fig. 2 A,arrowheads), are not consistent with a nucleosome loss (i) or a nucleosome conformational change mechanism (ii) but rather with a repositioning mechanism (iii), in which the most upstream particles of the −1 family move in the direction of transcription. Fig.1 D shows a densitometric evaluation of part of these data: for both the upstream and the downstream profiles only the two extreme situations, r (repressing conditions, 3% glucose) and 180′ (derepressing conditions, 0.05% glucose), are shown. To describe more quantitatively this phenomenon, we calculated the weight average for each group of borders and defined the variation of the nucleosome positioning. The results are shown in TableI. After 180 min of activation, the weight average of the upstream borders of the nucleosome covering the TATA box shifts by 6 base pairs to the right (from position 953 in repressing conditions to 959 after promoter induction). The same numerical change (6 base pairs) is reported for the weight average of the downstream borders. This number represents only the minimal estimate of the real shift because the intensities of the new bands appearing beyond the initial distribution have not been included in this calculation. One further feature emerges when comparing the profiles of the wild type and of the adr1 strains, as in Fig. 1A. Additional bands are present between the borders of nucleosomes −1.4 and −1.5 in the adr1 strain. The same feature is evident also in theadr1 strain transformed with a reduced version of Adr1 (see Fig. 4 A) or in another mutant, the rpb1–1 strain (see Fig. 5 A), although the behavior of these bands depends on the genetic context. The accessibility to MN in this specific region may be altered in these mutants because the absence of a full-length activator or the presence of a defective RNA polymerase II (rpb1–1 strain) could favor the assembly of alternative protein complexes. Because of the close proximity of the nucleosome family −1, which covers the TATA box region, with the family +1, which covers the RNA initiation sites, we argued that the repositioning of the group of particles −1 could influence the translational positioning of the adjacent group of +1 particles. We therefore extended the high resolution analysis to the family of nucleosomes +1; the results are shown in Fig. 2. A second couple of divergently overlapping oligonucleotides (map position in Fig. 2 B) was used: oligonucleotide 3 points toward the downstream borders, and oligonucleotide 4 toward the upstream ones. As in the case of the nucleosome −1, by inspection of the downstream nucleosomal borders (right part of the figure) some members of the family (+1.2, +1.3) show a decrease in occupancy during derepression, some remain constant (+1.1, +1.4), whereas others (+1.5, +1.6) show an increase, and even new positions (seearrowheads above the +1.6 band) become evident. Again, the effect is observed only in the wild type and not in the adr1strain (data not shown). Fig. 2 C shows a densitometric evaluation of part of these data: for both the upstream and the downstream profiles only the two extreme situations, r(repressing conditions, 3% glucose) and 180′ (derepressing conditions, 0.05% glucose), are shown. From these scannings we calculated the weight average for each group of +1 nucleosome borders and defined the change of nucleosome positioning. The results are shown in TableII; after 180 min of activation, the weight average of the nucleosome +1 upstream borders shift by 6 base pairs to the right (from position 1126 in repressing conditions to 1132 after promoter induction). The same numerical change (6 base pairs) is reported for the weight average of the downstream borders. The change in positioning occurring to the nucleosomal family +1 appears therefore to be very similar to that occurring to the neighboring group of −1 particles. If one influences the other or if the two events are unrelated remains to be established. Moreover, the constant intensity of the downstream boundary of nucleosomes +1.1 and +1.4 could potentially represent the consequence of the simultaneous influence of the two adjacent nucleosomes (−1 and +2). To confirm the Adr1-dependent change of translational positioning observed upon derepression in the nucleosomal families −1 and +1, as obtained through the analysis of populations of isolated monomeric particles, we performed a high resolution analysis using chromatin samples obtained from mildly MN-digested spheroplasts. This approach allows the study of an entire array of nucleosomes providing information (Fig. 3) on the occupancy of the whole area encompassed between the two adjacent families of nucleosomes −1 and +1 and on its variations upon derepression. Oligonucleotide 1 (as in Fig. 1 A) was used for the primer extension. The bands indicated as −1.1 to −1.6 and +1.1 to +1.6 were unambiguously attributed to one or the other nucleosomal family, based on the nucleotide level mapping previously obtained with the purified monomeric populations (see Figs. 1 C and 2 B). In the samples dubbed “ 60′” (derepressing conditions), the intensity of some of the −1 and +1 intermingled borders decreases (−1.1, −1.2, −1.3, −1.4, +1.1, +1.2, +1.3), whereas the intensity of few others remain constant (−1.5, +1.4) and the intensity of the remaining ones increases (−1.6, +1.5, +1.6) relative to the samples dubbed “ R ” (repressing conditions). Again, as in Figs.1 and 2, the effect is directional, with a clear increase in site occupancy in the direction of transcription. In addition, to locate and to allow the analysis of nucleosome boundaries, MN is able to recognize and cut the DNA that has lost or is in the process of loosing its contacts with the histone octamer, as we have observed by low resolution analysis (24Verdone L. Camilloni G., Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Di Mauro E. Kendrew S.G. Caserta M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and as can be clearly seen by inspection of Fig. 3. An increase in accessibility inside the +1 nucleosomal family after derepression is observed when comparing thelanes R with the lanes 60′. Moreover, when comparing the lanes 60′ with the in vitro-treated samples (lanes N), it appears that some bands coincide, suggesting a local loss of contact with histones, whereas other bands in the samples N are not visible in the samples60′, indicating that these latter DNA sites are still protected by one or more members of the +1 nucleosomal family. One interesting possibility would be that the concerted repositioning of the −1 and the +1 families of nucleosomes allows the RNA initiation sites (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3) to become accessible to the transcriptional apparatus. The Adr1 dependence of the change of positioning of the promoter nucleosomes can be explained by two different alternatives: (i) when the glucose in the medium becomes limiting, the activator protein occupies the UAS1 and because of its large size (1323 amino acids) pushes the more upstream borders of the −1 nucleosome toward the nearby +1 nucleosome; (ii) in derepressing conditions, Adr1 binds the UAS1 and recruits additional factors which in turn cause the nucleosomes to slide. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we have analyzed a couple of isogenic adr1 strains transformed with two different Adr1 derivatives: pADR1Δ172 consisting of the first 172 amino acids (of 1323) containing the Adr1 DNA-binding domain, and pADR1Δ172-AD, consisting of the Adr1 DNA-binding domain plus a peptide (amino acids 420–462) containing the Adr1 activation domain (see Ref. 28Di Mauro E. Kendrew S.G. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7612-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig.4. When using oligonucleotide 1 to elongate a monomeric population prepared from adr1 cells containing pADR1Δ172 we did not observe any change in the distribution of nucleosome borders (Fig. 4 A, left panel), whereas in the presence of the construct pADR1Δ172-AD a change of the intensity of the borders is visible (Fig. 4 A, right panel), just as observed in the presence of the full-length protein (Fig. 1 A,wt). When using oligonucleotide 2 to elongate the same samples, again a change in the distribution of nucleosome borders is visible only in adr1 cells containing pADR1Δ172-AD (compare Fig. 4 B, right panel, with Fig. 4 B, left panel). The lack of sliding in cells containing the DNA-binding domain alone is not due to instability of the Adr1 derivative because the same molecule is capable of binding UAS1 and of inducing a conformational change in the adjacent −1 nucleosome in the absence of transcription (28Di Mauro E. Kendrew S.G. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7612-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results obtained with these two constructs indicate that the nucleosome repositioning is not simply induced as a consequence of Adr1 binding but is specifically mediated by the Adr1 activation domain. Because of the requirement for the Adr1 activation domain, one could think that the change of the translational positioning of the two promoter nucleosomes during derepression is due to the Adr1-induced wave of transcription. To better investigate this possibility, we analyzed (Fig. 5) the populations of isolated monomeric particles in the temperature-sensitive strain rpb1–1 (30Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), in which the major catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase II can be heat-inactivated. Cells growing at the permissive temperature (25 °C) in ADH2 repressing conditions (3% glucose) were shifted to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) inADH2 derepressing conditions (0.05% glucose) and analyzed after 60, 120, and 180 min (Fig. 5 A). Even in the complete absence of transcription (RNA analysis in Fig. 5 B) the positions of the nucleosomes change, suggesting that the nucleosome repositioning actually precedes transcription and that the activation domain is required to recruit some factor(s) to correctly preset the relevant sequences for the subsequent transcription steps. Chromatin remodeling upon ADH2 gene activation is therefore due at least in part to the translational repositioning of nucleosomes following activator binding but preceding the actual start of mRNA accumulation. This nucleosome fluidity is likely to be facilitated by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and/or by changing the acetylation level of the histone tails, as proposed (2Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes & Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), or it could be caused by TATA-bending protein-induced DNA binding as recently hypothesized (32Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Cell. 2001; 106: 685-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this change of nucleosome distribution cannot by itself represent the only process occurring upon activation: additional features of chromatin remodeling are likely to involve conformational changes of the nucleosome particles that alter their accessibility, as indicated by the low resolution analysis of the involvement of the various Adr1 domains (28Di Mauro E. Kendrew S.G. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7612-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and as shown in the footprint presented in Fig. 3. The in vivo existence of multiple nucleosome positionings in different eukaryotic systems (24Verdone L. Camilloni G., Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell.

Multipositioning implies that each individual cell may locate the regulatory nucleosome in one of different positions, inside a gaussian distribution of possible alternatives. Thus, individual cells (most of them genetically identical) are confronted with different localization choices. Being independent on the genetic background, these alternative localizations are epigenetic in their nature. The present observations show that yeast cells actually use this potentiality and distribute nucleosomes along a series of alternatives. The fact that nucleosome positions vary in a controlled manner upon a physiological event adds genetic and regulatory interest to their multiplicity."
https://openalex.org/W2019180516,"Previously we observed that rab3 GTPases modulate both the secretion of catecholamines from PC12 neuroendocrine cells and the steady-state accumulation of exogenous norepinephrine (NE) into these cells (Weber, E., Jilling, T., and Kirk, K. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6963–6971). Here we addressed the mechanisms by which these monomeric GTPases stimulate NE uptake by PC12 cells including their effects on uptake kinetics, their sites of action (secretory granule membrane versus plasma membrane), and the involvement of rab3-interacting proteins in this process. We observed that rab3B stimulated the rate and maximal accumulation of radiolabeled NE into large dense core vesicles within intact PC12 cells. rab3A and rab3B also increased NE uptake into large dense core vesicles in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells, which indicates that these GTPases stimulate catecholamine uptake at the level of the secretory granule membrane. In an attempt to identify rab3B targets that may mediate this effect on NE uptake, we found that rab3B interacts directly with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in a GTP-dependent fashion and that PI3K activity was elevated in PC12 cells overexpressing rab3B. Furthermore, two structurally distinct inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin and LY294002) inhibited NE uptake in intact as well as digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells, but had no effect on calcium-evoked NE secretion. Our results indicate that rab3 and PI3K positively and coordinately regulate NE uptake in PC12 neuroendocrine cells at least in part by stimulating the secretory vesicle uptake step. Previously we observed that rab3 GTPases modulate both the secretion of catecholamines from PC12 neuroendocrine cells and the steady-state accumulation of exogenous norepinephrine (NE) into these cells (Weber, E., Jilling, T., and Kirk, K. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6963–6971).

Neurotransmitter uptake across the plasma membrane is facilitated by specific plasma membrane transporters that remove neurotransmitter from the extracellular milieu (1Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 2Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 263-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs)1 localized on the membranes of secretory vesicles concentrate monoamine neurotransmitters into large dense core vesicles (LDCVs), chromaffin granules, and secretory vesicles. VMAT is an electrogenic antiporter that uses a H+ electrochemical gradient maintained by an ATP-dependent vacuolar H+ pump located in the secretory vesicle membrane to drive neurotransmitter uptake. A number of drugs, including reserpine and tetrabenazine, inhibit neurotransmitter uptake by VMAT (3Johnson Jr., R.G. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 232-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Henry J.P. Scherman D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In both neurons and neuroendocrine cells, catecholamine transport across the vesicular membrane serves to rapidly and efficiently package newly synthesized and recycled catecholamines into secretory vesicles to control the supply of neurotransmitter available for exocytosis. Catecholamine uptake by neurons also helps terminate synaptic transmission by the removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. Both steps in catecholamine uptake (plasma membrane and vesicular membrane) are subject to regulation by second messengers that are in turn activated by receptor binding or membrane depolarization (5Launay J.M. Bondoux D. Oset-Gasque M.J. Emami S. Mutel V. Haimart M. Gespach C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R526-R536PubMed Google Scholar, 6Desnos C. Laran M.P. Langley K. Aunis D. Henry J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16030-16038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitter uptake is also regulated by heterotrimeric and monomeric GTPases. The heterotrimeric G-protein, Gαo2, inhibits catecholamine uptake by a neuroendocrine cell line (PC12) that accumulates norepinephrine into secretory granules by mechanisms similar to those utilized by chromaffin cells and noradrenergic neurons (7Ahnert-Hilger G. Nurnberg B. Exner T. Schafer T. Jahn R. EMBO. 1998; 17: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, monomeric GTPases of the rab3 subfamily can stimulate NE uptake by PC12 cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). rab3 GTPases are expressed in a variety of secretory cells including PC12 cells, where they localize to catecholamine-containing secretory granules (LDCVs). rab3 GTPases have been implicated in the regulation of exocytosis (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Khokhlatchev A. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J.

Interestingly, however, we observed in a previous study that stably transfected PC12 cell lines that overproduce rab3A or rab3B also accumulated substantially greater amounts of exogenous NE than mock transfected or untransfected cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This effect was greater for rab3B than rab3A and was seen for multiple rab3-overproducing clones (i.e. was not the result of clonal variation). This raises the interesting possibility that rab3 GTPases regulate not only the efficiency of secretion but also the amount of vesicle cargo available for secretion. The mechanism for the rab3-induced increased in NE uptake was not addressed in the earlier study and is the subject of the present investigation. Here we addressed three outstanding questions concerning the regulation of NE uptake by rab3 GTPases in PC12 cells: (i) how does rab3B affect the kinetics (time course and concentration dependence) of NE uptake by intact PC12 cells, (ii) do rab3B and rab3A regulate NE uptake at the plasma membrane or the secretory granule membrane, and (iii) do rab3 GTPases interact with other molecules to regulate this process? We report that rab3B stimulates the rate and maximum accumulation of NE by PC12 cells, and that one of the sites of action for rab3B and rab3A is the secretory granule uptake step. Furthermore, we identify phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as a putative rab3B effector protein and demonstrate that PI3K, like rab3B, positively regulates vesicular catecholamine uptake by PC12 cells. The involvement of PI3K in the regulation of NE uptake could be generally significant, because PI3K participates in a variety of cell signaling pathways that are activated by multiple growth factors and hormones (13Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 14Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol.

PC12 cells stably transfected with rab3A, rab3B, the GTP binding mutant rab3BN135I, and vector alone (mock) were generated as described (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In our previous analysis of these clones, we observed that, like the endogenous rabA in PC12 cells, recombinant rab3A and recombinant rab3B localized to LDCVs in these cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured in HEPES-modified RPMI with sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 400 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% CO2 and 5% O2. All experiments were performed using PC12 cells cultured in the absence of nerve growth factor. GST fusion proteins containing full-length human rab3B, rab5, and the rat p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pGEX-2T prokaryotic expression vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Transformed E. coli were induced with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. GST fusion proteins were affinity purified from bacterial cell lysates with glutathione-agarose, as described (15Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl L. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 16.7.1-16.7.6Google Scholar). The GST moiety was removed from GST-p85 PI3K by incubation with thrombin (1% thrombin w/w GST fusion protein) at 25 °C for 1 h. Thrombin was neutralized by incubation withp-aminobenzamidine (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 μg of immobilized GST, GST-rab3B, or GST-rab5 prebound to 0.5 mm GDP or GTPγS was mixed with 1 μg of p85 (GST moiety removed) in the following buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 4 °C. After 1 h, the bound proteins were washed extensively with the same buffer, and then eluted in 5× SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and blotted with a monoclonal antibody to p85α (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). For Western blot analysis, PC12 cells were grown on 10-cm poly-l-lysine-coated dishes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,800 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline, and then blocked in 5% dry milk plus 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Blots were incubated with rab3B polyclonal antibody (16Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. St. John P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U. Jilling T. Sorscher E.J. Elton T.S. Abrahamson D.R. Kirk K.L. J.

Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies as appropriate incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 1 m glucose, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The blots were developed by Renaissance Chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transport assays were performed on 2-day-old PC12 cultures seeded on 12- or 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated culture dishes. 343 nm [3H]NE with varying concentrations of unlabeled NE (0–3.43 μm) were added to 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 400 units/ml hygromycin. After incubation for varying time periods at 37 °C (typically 30 min), uptake was terminated by removal of the [3H]NE-containing media. Cells were rinsed twice in fresh RPMI media and then chased 30–45 min in RPMI media at 37 °C. At the end of the chase, cell-associated radioactivity was determined by lysing the cells in 0.25 nNaOH and measuring the amount of [3H]NE in the extracts by liquid scintillation counting. For PI3K inhibitor studies, transport was performed as before except that cells were pretreated with various concentrations of LY294002 (Biomol) or wortmannin (Calbiochem) for 6 h prior to transport assay. Transport assays were performed in duplicate. The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), and the uptake values were normalized to the amount of total protein (mg) in the lysate. K m and V max values were determined from plots of normalized transport activityversus total NE concentration (see “Results”). NE uptake by digitonin-permeabilized cells was performed as described with minor modifications (18Nakanishi N. Onozawa S. Matsumoto R. Hasegawa H. Yamada S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were seeded on 12-well poly-l-lysine-coated dishes, cultured for 2 days, and then permeabilized with 100 μm digitonin in complete media for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed in HTMS buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mmTris-HCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m sucrose (pH 7.4). To initiate uptake cells were incubated 30 min at room temperature with HTMS buffer containing 4 mm ATP and 4 μCi of [3H]NE in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors. Uptake was terminated by removal of [3H]NE-containing buffer. Cells were rinsed, chased at room temperature for 30 min in HTMS buffer without [3H]NE, and then lysed in 0.25 n NaOH. The amount of [3H]NE in the lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Intact PC12 cells were loaded with [3H]NE for 1 h at 37 °C as described above. The cells were then homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, 0.32m sucrose buffer (1 × 40 strokes with a Potter homogenizer) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to pellet unbroken cells. The clarified homogenate was layered on a 0.6–1.8 msucrose gradient with a 2.2 m sucrose pad (10-ml volume). The gradient was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 6 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. An equal aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting for 3[H]NE and by Western blotting for markers of LDCVs (secretogranin) and light vesicles (synaptophysin). PC12 cells plated on 10-cm poly-l-lysine-coated dishes were cultured until confluent. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mmNaCl, 135 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 4 mmNa3VO4, and 10% glycerol supplemented with leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A (all at 10 μg/ml) and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. 10 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories), anti-p85 PI3K (Transduction Laboratories), or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with lysates (1 ml) that were prepared from mock and rab3B-expressing PC12 cells and matched for equal protein concentrations. Protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added to the lysates followed by mixing for an additional 2 h. To determine whether rab3B interacts with PI3K, 25 μg of anti-rab3B polyclonal IgG (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. St. John P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U. Jilling T. Sorscher E.J.

Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively first in lysis buffer and then in kinase assay buffer (20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.8 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2). The lipid kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 10 min in a 70-μl kinase assay buffer containing 60 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 3 μm cold ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer NEN Life Sciences). Reactions were terminated with methanol:chloroform:water mixture. The lipid was extracted in methanol:chloroform:hydrochloric acid (20:10:1) and then separated on potassium oxalate-coated thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates in methanol:chloroform:ammonium hydroxide:water (100:75:12.5:27). The phosphoinositide 3-phosphate lipid product was quantified by phosphorimage analysis. Previously we observed that recombinant rab3A and rab3B localized to LDCVs in PC12 cells and markedly stimulated the steady-state accumulation of radiolabeled NE by these cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We observed no discernible differences in either the total number of LDCVs per cell or the number of LDCVs within 110 nm of the plasma membrane (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors were responsible for the observed effects of rab3 on NE uptake. In the present study we addressed the mechanism by which rab3 GTPases regulate catecholamine uptake by PC12 neuroendocrine cells. We focused on rab3B because this GTPase had quantitatively greater effects on NE uptake, although rab3A appears to exhibit qualitatively similar effects (Ref. 8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar; see below). Fig. 1 shows the effects of rab3B expression on the kinetics of [3H]NE uptake by intact PC12 cells. The uptake of NE was time-dependent and reached a plateau within 2 h for either the rab3B transfected cells or mock transfected cells (Fig. 1 A). The initial rate of uptake and the steady-state accumulation of radiolabeled NE were consistently much higher in rab3B-expressing cells than in mock cells. The higher steady-state accumulation observed here was consistent with what we had found previously for multiple rab3B-expressing clones (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To characterize further the effects of rab3B on uptake kinetics, we measured uptake over a range of NE concentrations at a single time point where NE uptake is a linear function of time (i.e. 30 min; Fig. 1 B). In each case the uptake data could be well fit by a single Michaelis-Menten function (see Fig. 1 legend), suggesting that one of the two steps in NE uptake by intact PC12 cells (plasma membrane or vesicle membrane) is limiting under these conditions. The primary effect of rab3B was to increase the maximal accumulation (V max) of NE uptake by intact PC12 cells. Extracellular NE is concentrated into secretory granules (LDCVs) via a two-step process in which NE is transported across the plasma membrane into the cytosol and then across the vesicular membrane into the LDCV (19Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 20Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the greater amount of NE uptake exhibited by rab3B-expressing cells reflects an increase in cytosolic accumulation with no corresponding increase in uptake into LDCVs. Thus, to determine whether rab3B increased the accumulation of exogenous NE into secretory granules as opposed to simply increasing the cytoplasmic levels of NE, intact cells preloaded with [3H]NE were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and the amount of [3H]NE in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. As shown in Fig. 2, the peak of [3H]NE was localized in fractions 8–12 (corresponding to 1.4–1.6m sucrose), and co-fractionated with secretogranin, a soluble protein marker of LDCVs (21Kelly R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fractions were also immunoblotted with antibodies against synaptophysin, a marker of endosomes and small secretory vesicles in PC12 cells (22Johnston P.A. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. DeCamilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Secretogranin and synaptophysin were enriched in distinct fractions, indicating that LDCVs and small secretory vesicles were fractionated into separate pools. The NE signal at the top of the gradient probably represents NE released from LDCVs that were lysed during centrifugation because the soluble LDCV cargo protein, secretogranin, was also present in these fractions. The rab3B-expressing cells exhibited a greater amount of [3H]NE in the LDCV fractions than in mock cells, which indicates that the greater amount of NE accumulated by these cells represents at least in part more NE within secretory granules. Although our fractionation data indicate that rab3B expression leads to an increase in the amount of NE within LDCVs, these data do not establish that the vesicle uptake step is directly stimulated by this GTPase. rab3B could secondarily increase NE accumulation into LDCVs by stimulating the plasma membrane uptake step and thereby increasing the cytosolic pool of NE available for transport into LDCVs. To identify the site of regulation of NE transport by rab3B and rab3A (e.g. plasma membrane or LDCV membrane), we measured NE uptake in digitonin-permeabilized cells. In this assay NE diffuses into the cytosol via bulk flow through pores in the plasma membrane created by the detergent, digitonin, and is then actively transported into secretory vesicles (17Nakanishi N. Onozawa S. Matsumoto R. Hasegawa H. Minami N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Nakanishi N. Onozawa S. Matsumoto R. Hasegawa H. Yamada S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We were encouraged to use this assay because our earlier membrane fractionation results indicated that rab3A and rab3B remain tightly associated with secretory granules following cell homogenization (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, therefore, would be expected to remain on these granules in semi-intact cells. To validate this assay we first showed that vesicular uptake in permeabilized cells was stimulated by ATP and that only the ATP-dependent component of uptake was sensitive to reserpine, an inhibitor of the vesicle membrane monoamine transporter (Fig. 3 A). To assess the efficiency of permeabilization, we monitored NE uptake in the presence and absence of nomifensine, a plasma membrane NE transporter inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). NE uptake was inhibited by nomifensine in intact cells but not in permeabilized cells. Conversely, the VMAT inhibitor, reserpine, inhibited uptake by both intact and permeabilized cells (Fig. 3 C). Collectively, these results indicate that NE uptake by digitonin-permeabilized cells represents NE uptake at the vesicle membrane independent of a significant contribution from the plasma membrane transport process. Using this assay we observed that reserpine-sensitive NE uptake by digitonin-permeabilized cells was stimulated ∼3-fold in rab3B PC12 cells compared with mock PC12 cells (Fig. 3 D). We also measured NE uptake in permeabilized cells that were overexpressing rab3A or that were expressing a rab3B mutant with accelerated on and off rates for GTP binding (rab3BN135I (Refs. 8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 26Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). NE uptake was increased 1.5-fold in permeabilized PC12 cells overproducing rab3A compared with mock cells (Fig. 3 D). Thus, both rab3 isoforms positively regulate NE uptake in permeabilized PC12 cells as well as in intact cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rab3BN135I had no effect on the amount of [3H]NE accumulated in permeabilized cells, despite the fact that this mutant does stimulate NE uptake by intact cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of rab3BN135I expression on vesicular uptake in semi-intact cells may reflect the fact that this mutant binds much less tightly to membranes as compared with wild type rab3B or rab3A (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and could have leaked out of the cells during permeabilization. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that rab3 may regulate uptake at the plasma membrane as well as at the granule surface, and that its modulation of granule uptake is more sensitive to mutations that influence the kinetics of nucleotide binding. Either way the data obtained for semi-intact PC12 cells show that rab3B and, to a lesser extent, rab3A increase NE uptake at the level of the granule membrane. To further characterize the mechanism by which rab3B regulates NE transport, we sought to identify putative rab3B effectors that might function in concert with rab3B to stimulate NE uptake. PI3K attracted our attention because of its role in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction; processes in which rab proteins and monomeric GTPases in general are thought to play important roles. In addition, we reported previously that rab3B expression in PC12 cells affects the profile of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (24Sunshine C. Francis S Kirk K.L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 257: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is an interaction between rab3B and PI3K, we immunoprecipitated rab3B from lysates of rab3B-expressing PC12 cells and tested for co-immunoprecipitated PI3K activity using an in vitro lipid kinase assay. Mock-transfected cells lacking detectable rab3B (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) served as negative controls. A rab3B-specific antibody (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol.

To test whether native rab3B can also interact with PI3K in cells that normally express this GTPase, we also immunoprecipitated rab3B from HT29-CL19A colonic epithelial cells that express more endogenous rab3B than PC12 cells (8Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,16Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. St. John P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U.

Unfortunately, our attempts to show an interaction between rab3A and PI3K using this strategy were unsuccessful because we could not immunoprecipitate rab3A from PC12 cells with any of three available antibodies. To determine whether the association of rab3B with PI3K is mediated directly through one of the PI3K subunits or indirectly through an adaptor molecule, we performed a direct pairwise binding assay with GST-rab3B an"

Ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ bind to distinct sites on integrin and can have opposing effects on ligand binding. These effects are presumably brought about by alterations of the shape of the ligand binding pocket. To gain insight into the nature of these structural differences, we probed the integrin ligand binding site with an RGD-based library of unparalleled complexity. A cysteine-constrained phage library containing six random amino acids and the RGD motif present in seven different registers was used to select for ligands that exhibit ion-selective binding to integrin αIIbβ3.

The Ca2+-selective peptides had a range of sequences, with the only obvious consensus involving a motif that had four cysteine residues bonded in a 1,4:2,3 arrangement.

Interestingly though, divalent ions can have opposing effects on ligand binding, promoting both cell adhesion and cell detachment (2Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J.

J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that integrins contain two classes of divalent ion binding sites. One class of sites, called ligand-competent (LC)1 sites, must be filled for ligand to bind (7Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LC site(s) can bind to a number of different ions including Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. A number of studies (8D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), including recent co-crystals of integrin I domains with bound ligands (9Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), suggest that the LC sites may actually sit within the ligand binding pocket and make direct contact with ligand.A separate class of ion binding sites is allosteric to the ligand binding site and inhibits ligand binding by increasing the rate of ligand dissociation. Because of their effects on ligand dissociation, we called these allosteric sites inhibitory, or “I,” sites (10Hu D.D. Barbas C.F.I. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The I site(s) appear to bind selectively to Ca2+. The effects of the I site can be pronounced, as an integrin with Ca2+ bound at the I site can have a dissociation rate that is 20-fold higher than when the I site is unoccupied. Because the affinities of the LC and I sites for divalent ions are within the physiologic ranges, these sites act cooperatively, and in an opposing manner, to regulate the function of the integrin ligand binding pocket.There are several physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances in which divalent ions play an important role in regulating cell adhesion. For example, osteoclasts, the primary bone-resorbing cell, adhere to the bone surface through the αvβ3 integrin. The adherent osteoclast resorbs mineralized bone, liberating free Ca2+, which can rise above 10 mm (11Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). This elevation in [Ca2+] is then sensed by the osteoclast via a receptor (12Miyauchi A. Hruska K.A. Greenfield E.M. Duncan R. Alvarez J. Baratollo R. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Teitelbaum S.L. Teti A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2543-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Zaidi M. Kerby J. Huang C.L. Alam T. Rathod H. Chambers T.J. Moonga B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and this ultimately causes the osteoclast to detach from the bone surface. The identity of this osteoclast Ca2+ receptor remains unclear, but it appears to have many of the properties of the allosteric I site on the αvβ3 integrin (4Hu D.D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Hu D.D. Barbas C.F.I. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consequently, we proposed that the liberated Ca2+ binds to this site on integrin, accounting for the effects of this ion on osteoclast detachment. A similar mechanism can be proposed in wound healing, where keratinocyte integrins play a major role. In wound fluids the ratio of Mg2+ to Ca2+ is substantially higher than under normal circumstances (14Grzesiak J.J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This scenario is expected to favor the action of the integrin LC ion binding sites over the I site and favor adhesion over detachment. Indeed, the elevated levels of Mg2+ appear to promote integrin-mediated migration of keratinocytes and healing of the wounds (14Grzesiak J.J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Divalent ions also influence the ligand binding properties of the integrin that is the subject of this study, platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (15Kirchhofer D. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. Grzesiak J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18525-18530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3 integrin is somewhat unique in that it contains two physically distinct but interacting ligand binding pockets (16Hu D.D. White C.A. Panzer-Knodle S. Page J.D. Nicholson N. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4633-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One ligand binding pocket binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of fibrinogen (Fg), called the γ-chain site. The binding of αIIbβ3 to the γ-chain is necessary for the aggregation of platelets in blood (17Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 249-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Importantly, the γ-chain of Fg lacks the RGD motif. Interestingly, the effects of divalent ions on the binding of the γ-chain to αIIbβ3 are different from the effects on RGD binding. Binding between the Fg γ-chain and αIIbβ3 proceed faster in Ca2+than in any other ion, indicating that the I site is not involved in this interaction.Integrin αIIbβ3 also contains a separate RGD binding pocket that binds to ligands such as von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, as well as RGD peptides and their mimetics. This RGD binding site is governed cooperatively by the LC and I ion binding sites as discussed above. Another important feature of the RGD binding site is that it is allosterically connected to the Fg γ-chain binding site. When αIIbβ3 is occupied with RGD ligands, the rate of dissociation for Fg is increased dramatically. Altogether then, the ligand binding properties of αIIbβ3 are regulated in a complex manner, with both divalent ions and the presence of additional ligands making key contributions. In general though, the current understanding of these interactions suggests that platelet aggregation to soluble Fg will be enhanced by Ca2+ and that platelet adhesion to immobilized RGD ligands such as von Willebrand factor will be enhanced by Mg2+.Given the clinical importance of dissecting these two functions of αIIbβ3 and the lack of a structural basis for ion-selective binding to integrins, we sought to engineer RGD ligands for αIIbβ3 which exhibit Mg2+- and Ca2+-selective binding. To address these issues we constructed a phage library of cyclic RGD peptides of unparalleled complexity. The library is comprised of ninemers that are conformationally constrained by two terminal cysteine residues. The RGD motif and six randomized residues lie between the two cysteines. The library takes full access of all possible conformations of RGD by displaying the motif in every register. In solution, all of the peptides that bind to αIIbβ3 adopt the conformation of a general β-turn, with the RGD sequence near the apex of the turn. Yet, the study reveals key differences in the primary structure of ion-selective RGD peptides. A distinguishing feature of the Mg2+-selective peptides is the presence of a protruding basic patch adjacent to the turn.DISCUSSIONThe RGD motif is the key recognition element for a large segment of the integrin protein family. However, there is an underlying binding specificity between integrins and RGD for which we still have no structural basis. In most cases, integrin binding RGD motifs are presented at the apex of β-turns (36Krezel A.M. Ulmer J.S. Wagner G. Lazarus R.A.

Yet, this body of information falls short of providing a systematic data set of key structure-activity relationships because the RGD loops are embedded within different protein backbones. We reasoned that such data could be obtained by using biochemical selection to obtain RGD loops with a given biochemical property and then probing the solution structures of these loops with NMR. As a test of the strategy, we created the most diverse library of RGD loops assembled to date and used this library to identify RGD loops that distinguish subtle conformational differences in the ligand binding pocket of a single integrin. Our findings indicate that even subtle differences in the shape of a single RGD binding pocket can be discerned using a library of sufficient diversity.We screened for RGD motifs that can distinguish the αIIbβ3 integrin when its cation binding sites are occupied with either Ca2+ or Mg2+. RGD loops were identified with both biochemical properties. Loops from both selections could be grouped into well defined subfamilies with rather obvious consensus motifs. There are several common features among the peptides selected in the two ions. First, the RGD motif is observed most frequently at positions 4–6 and 5–7, slots that put the RGD at the apex of a loop or β-turn. Second, most of the RGD motifs contain at least one, and often two, aromatic residues. In the vast majority of cases an aromatic residue follows directly after RGD. Tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine residues were all observed at this position. This observation is consistent with prior reports showing that the affinity of linear RGD peptides for αIIbβ3 is enhanced greatly by inclusion of a hydrophobic residue just after RGD (42Plow E.F. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 43Ruggeri Z.M. Houghten R.A. Russell S.R. Zimmerman T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5708-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Aromatic residues were often found at other positions, both preceding and following the RGD motif.Despite the similarity in the positioning of RGD within the loops, there are other features that distinguish the two functional families. The primary distinguishing feature of the Mg2+-selected loops is the presence of two basic, or polar, residues that fall on the carboxyl-terminal side of the RGD. Two subfamilies of phage from the Mg2+ selection display this feature (Table III). Both subfamilies contain the RGD at P4–6. The small distinctions arise at P7, which is occupied by a hydrophobic residue in one family and an aromatic residue in the other. There is also a distinction at P8, which is populated exclusively by Arg or Lys in the first subfamily but can be occupied by noncharged, but usually polar, residues in the second family. The NMR structures of peptides that represent both subfamilies, D16 and D18, show the basic patch to protrude from the base of the RGD loop. The findings presented here suggest that this patch is necessary for Mg2+-selective binding.The inherent flexibility of the loops is a second feature that appears to distinguish the Ca2+- and Mg2+-selective peptides. The two phage loops with the highest binding affinity and the highest degree of selectivity for binding in Ca2+ are A13 and A22. Both of these loops contain two additional cysteine residues that presumably constrain the peptide further by forming an additional disulfide bond. This extra disulfide is expected to impose more rigidity onto the RGD loop, and the NMR data for A22 support this concept.The NMR spectra for the peptides containing a single disulfide bridge are also consistent with enhanced flexibility for the Mg2+-selected loops. Both D16 and D18 display fewer NOEs than their Ca2+-selective counterpart, A1. The dearth of NOEs in D16 and D18 may be interpreted as increased conformational flexibility as has been observed for highly flexible or unfolded regions (44Neuhaus D. Williamson M.P. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis.2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH, New York2000Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that NOEs for D16 and D18 are undetectable under the experimental conditions chosen. We view this latter possibility as unlikely because D16 and D18 are the same size as A1, where NOEs are clearly evident, and all three populate the same NOE regime. Furthermore, studies on D16 and D18 were performed under solvent and temperature conditions identical to those for A1. The strong sequential αN NOEs and large spin-spin coupling constants (3 J HNα above 9 Hz) of the A1 peptide (A1 spectrum and calculations in the supplementary material) may also be interpreted to indicate that this peptide has a more extended conformation (22Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Spin-spin coupling constants were significantly lower for D16 and D18, suggesting enhanced flexibility compared with the Ca2+-selective A1. Although the measurement of reduced heteronuclear NOEs is the method of choice for probing flexibility (45Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 46Eliezer D. Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) it requires 15N-labeled peptides, which are not available in our case.The presumed flexibility of D16 and D18, superimposed to a local signature provided by their additional cationic patch, may well be an important regulator of the binding of physiologic ligands. Such inherent flexibility would allow for protein-protein interactions subsequent to initial contact with the RGD sequence. The precedent for differential rigidity in RGD-containing loops from homologous cell adhesion domains has been demonstrated for homologous fibronectin type III domains from tenascin and fibronectin (47Carr P.A. Erickson H.P. Palmer A.G. Structure. 1997; 5: 949-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the context of small peptidic inhibitors, other examples have been reported in which increased flexibility is needed for binding, e.g. for factor Xa inhibitors (48Duggan B.M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Our study also raises another important issue concerning recognition of ligands by the two distinct ligand binding pockets on αIIbβ3. We showed previously that αIIbβ3 contains two distinct ligand binding pockets that are linked allosterically (16Hu D.D. White C.A. Panzer-Knodle S. Page J.D. Nicholson N. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4633-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One binding pocket binds to the physiologic ligand Fg, and the other binding pocket binds to RGD ligands. An important and unappreciated aspect of the allosteric connection between these two binding sites is the fact that RGD ligands can bind to αIIbβ3 even when Fg occupies its binding site. In doing so RGD ligands induce the dissociation of bound Fg. One observation from the present study may relate to this mechanism. Most of the RGD peptides from the current study inhibit Fg with far lower IC50 values than they exhibit for Fab-9. This is expected given that the RGD peptides and Fab-9 are anticipated to bind the same binding pocket and compete for association with integrin. Interestingly however, peptide A1 behaved differently. It inhibited Fab-9 binding at far lower concentrations than required for inhibition of Fg binding. The reason for this difference in behavior is not entirely clear, but one is tempted to speculate that this peptide could actually be a mimic of the Fg γ-chain motif rather than a true RGD mimic. It would then compete directly with Fg for association with αIIbβ3 but not Fab-9. Given the molecular diversity within the RGD superlibrary, nearly 500 million different motifs, it is not unreasonable to expect that some of these motifs could approximate the shape of the fibrinogen γ-chain, a motif of between 11 and 15 residues (18Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 249-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 49Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T.J. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This idea is also consistent with the fact that both peptide A1 and the γ-chain peptide adopt type II β-turns in solution, with an aspartic acid near the apex of the turn.Because αIIbβ3 is an excellent paradigm for most other members of the integrin family, and because many other integrins also exhibit Ca2+- and Mg2+-regulated binding of physiologic ligands, the results presented here could potentially be extrapolated to other integrins. The availability of peptides that bind to the two conformations of αIIbβ3 is likely to make it possible to determine the structures of ion-selective ligands while bound to integrin. A comparison of the peptide solution structures with the integrin-bound structures should provide a structural basis for the way that ions influence ligand binding specificity. Such information will provide additional framework for understanding ion-regulated binding of all integrins.This study also lays the groundwork for two future lines of investigation. First, the ion-selective ligands identified here can be applied to test hypotheses regarding the role of ions in regulating platelet adhesion functions. It is well known that certain RGD-based antagonists have different effects on platelet aggregationversus bleeding times. These differences have often been attributed to a distinction in binding kinetics which is still not understood. We have speculated that thrombosis, which is driven by aggregation, is a Ca2+-controlled event, and that hemostasis, which is driven by adhesion to RGD-containing proteins, is a Mg2+-controlled event. The availability of peptides with well defined selectivity for binding in the two ions should make it possible to test this hypothesis.Finally, the study validates the use of the RGD superlibrary for the selection of high affinity binders with exquisite specificity. We have shown previously that RGD-containing loops can be grafted into proteins, endowing them with integrin binding function. The availability of the superlibrary for identifying highly selective RGD loops should enhance our ability to design proteins that are targeted to specific integrin targets. This type of highly specific target could potentially enhance the therapeutic efficacy of protein-based drugs. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is regulated tightly by extracellular divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (for review, see Ref. 1Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Interestingly though, divalent ions can have opposing effects on ligand binding, promoting both cell adhesion and cell detachment (2Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hu D.D.

J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that integrins contain two classes of divalent ion binding sites. One class of sites, called ligand-competent (LC)1 sites, must be filled for ligand to bind (7Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LC site(s) can bind to a number of different ions including Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. A number of studies (8D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), including recent co-crystals of integrin I domains with bound ligands (9Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), suggest that the LC sites may actually sit within the ligand binding pocket and make direct contact with ligand. A separate class of ion binding sites is allosteric to the ligand binding site and inhibits ligand binding by increasing the rate of ligand dissociation. Because of their effects on ligand dissociation, we called these allosteric sites inhibitory, or “I,” sites (10Hu D.D. Barbas C.F.I. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The I site(s) appear to bind selectively to Ca2+. The effects of the I site can be pronounced, as an integrin with Ca2+ bound at the I site can have a dissociation rate that is 20-fold higher than when the I site is unoccupied. Because the affinities of the LC and I sites for divalent ions are within the physiologic ranges, these sites act cooperatively, and in an opposing manner, to regulate the function of the integrin ligand binding pocket. There are several physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances in which divalent ions play an important role in regulating cell adhesion. For example, osteoclasts, the primary bone-resorbing cell, adhere to the bone surface through the αvβ3 integrin. The adherent osteoclast resorbs mineralized bone, liberating free Ca2+, which can rise above 10 mm (11Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). This elevation in [Ca2+] is then sensed by the osteoclast via a receptor (12Miyauchi A. Hruska K.A. Greenfield E.M. Duncan R. Alvarez J. Baratollo R. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Teitelbaum S.L. Teti A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2543-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Zaidi M. Kerby J. Huang C.L. Alam T. Rathod H. Chambers T.J. Moonga B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and this ultimately causes the osteoclast to detach from the bone surface. The identity of this osteoclast Ca2+ receptor remains unclear, but it appears to have many of the properties of the allosteric I site on the αvβ3 integrin (4Hu D.D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Hu D.D. Barbas C.F.I. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consequently, we proposed that the liberated Ca2+ binds to this site on integrin, accounting for the effects of this ion on osteoclast detachment. A similar mechanism can be proposed in wound healing, where keratinocyte integrins play a major role. In wound fluids the ratio of Mg2+ to Ca2+ is substantially higher than under normal circumstances (14Grzesiak J.J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This scenario is expected to favor the action of the integrin LC ion binding sites over the I site and favor adhesion over detachment. Indeed, the elevated levels of Mg2+ appear to promote integrin-mediated migration of keratinocytes and healing of the wounds (14Grzesiak J.J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Divalent ions also influence the ligand binding properties of the integrin that is the subject of this study, platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (15Kirchhofer D. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. Grzesiak J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18525-18530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3 integrin is somewhat unique in that it contains two physically distinct but interacting ligand binding pockets (16Hu D.D. White C.A. Panzer-Knodle S. Page J.D. Nicholson N. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4633-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One ligand binding pocket binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of fibrinogen (Fg), called the γ-chain site. The binding of αIIbβ3 to the γ-chain is necessary for the aggregation of platelets in blood (17Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb.
