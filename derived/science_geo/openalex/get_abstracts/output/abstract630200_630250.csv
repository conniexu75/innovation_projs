https://openalex.org/W2953325102,"This study analyzes the core energy consumption among countries' specific variables by Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis (EKC), for a panel data of 29 (14 developed and 15 developing) countries during the period of 1977-2014. By assessing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) regressions with first generation tests such as common root, individual Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), and individual root-Fisher-PP which have been computed individually, the results confirm the EKC hypothesis in the case of emissions of solid, liquid, gases, manufacturing industries and also construction. Hence, we computed the cointegration test by Pedroni Kao from Engle-Granger based and Fisher. Since the variables are co-integrated, a panel vector error correction model is estimated in GDP per capita, emission from manufacturing industries, arms import, commercial service export, and coal rent, in order to perform Pairwise Granger Causality test and indicate Vector Error Correction (VEC), with co-integration restrictions. Moreover, the statistical finding from VEC short-run unidirectional causality from GDP per capita growth to manufacturing industries and coal rent, as well as the causal link with manufacturing industries and commercial service export. Additionally, there occurred no causal link among economic growth, arm import and coal rent."

In the current study, we developed a novel machine learning approach to overcome the caveats of existing approaches. Methods Non-invasive parameters were selected by an ensemble feature selection (EFS) from a retrospectively collected training cohort of 164 obese individuals (age: 43.5±10.3y; BMI: 54.1±10.1kg/m2) to develop a model able to predict the histological assessed NAFLD activity score (NAS). The model was evaluated in an independent validation cohort (122 patients, age: 45.2±11.75y, BMI: 50.8±8.61kg/m2). Results EFS identified age, γGT, HbA1c, adiponectin, and M30 as being highly associated with NAFLD. The model reached a Spearman correlation coefficient with the NAS of 0.46 in the training cohort and was able to differentiate between NAFL (NAS≤4) and NASH (NAS>4) with an AUC of 0.73. In the independent validation cohort, an AUC of 0.7 was achieved for this separation. We further analyzed the potential of the new model for disease monitoring in an obese cohort of 38 patients under lifestyle intervention for one year. While all patients lost weight under intervention, increasing scores were observed in 15 patients. Increasing scores were associated with significantly lower absolute weight loss, lower reduction of waist circumference and basal metabolic rate. Conclusions A newly developed model (http://CHek.heiderlab.de) can predict presence or absence of NASH with reasonable performance. The new score could be used to detect NASH and monitor disease progression or therapy response to weight loss interventions."

Although serologic abnormalities are an important diagnostic tool for SSc, little is known about whether autoantibodies precede clinical diagnosis. Here we investigated the presence of autoantibodies before SSc diagnosis and assessed whether certain autoantibodies might associate with the future onset of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), a potentially fatal complication of the disease. Using the Department of Defense Serum Repository, autoantibodies were analyzed from archived, prospectively collected, longitudinal serum samples from sixteen individuals with SRC (SSc/SRC) and thirty cases of SSc without SRC (SSc/no SRC), matched for age, sex, and race. Seventy five percent (12/16) of the SSc/SRC and 40% (12/30) of the SSc/no SRC were seropositive for at least one autoantibody prior to clinical diagnosis (up to 27.1 years earlier, mean = -7.4 years). Although both disease groups demonstrated a heterogeneous immunoreactivity profile against the autoantigen panel, the SSc/SRC subjects showed two enriched clusters with one featuring elevated levels of autoantibodies against Ro52 and/or Ro60 and another with high levels of immunoreactivity against the RNA polymerase complex. Consistent with larger spectrum of immunoreactivity and the elevated levels of autoantibodies in SSc/SRC, the total response against the autoantigen panel from the last time point of the seropositive subjects revealed that the SSc/SRC cohort harbored higher antibody levels (p = 0.02) compared to SSc/no SRC. Overall, our findings demonstrate that relevant seropositive autoantibodies often precede the clinical diagnosis of SSc/no SRC and SSc/SRC."
https://openalex.org/W2923975695,"Schwann cells are the main supportive cells of the peripheral nerves. Schwann cells suffer inhibition of autophagy under hyperglycemia treatment in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). However, the exact mechanism is still not fully elucidated. We first observed the decrease of autophagy markers (LC3-II/LC3-I, P62) in the sciatic nerves of diabetic mice vs. normal mice, accompanied with the loss of myelinated nerve fibers and abnormal myelin sheath. In line with this, LC3-II/LC3-I and P62 were also significantly reduced in high glucose-treated rat Schwann cell 96 (RSC96) cells compared with normal glucose-treated cells. Furthermore, we found that trichostatin A [an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC)] evidently improved LC3-II/LC3-I in high glucose-treated RSC96 cells, without an effect on P62 expression. Again, HDAC1 and HDAC5 were revealed to be increased in RSC96 cells stimulated with high glucose. Inhibition of HDAC1 but not HDAC5 by small hairpin RNA vector enhanced LC3-II/LC3-I in high glucose-cultured RSC96 cells. In addition, LC3-II conversion regulators [autophagy-related protein (Atg)3, Atg5, and Atg7] were detected in high glucose-treated and HDAC1-knockdown RSC96 cells, and Atg3 was proven to be the key target of HDAC1. The presuppression of Atg3 offset the improvement of LC3-II/LC3-I resulting from HDAC1 inhibition in high glucose-treated RSC96 cells. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway was activated in RSC96 cells treated with high glucose, which was indicated by increased STAT3 phosphorylation. Blocking STAT3 phosphorylation by chemical inhibitor AG490 induced HDAC1 down-regulation followed by increases in Atg3 and LC3-II/LC3-I. Interestingly, we also found that AG490 treatment enhanced P62 expression in high glucose-stimulated RSC96 cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that hyperglycemia inhibits LC3-II/LC3-I in an HDAC1-Atg3-dependent manner and decreases P62 expression in an HDAC-independent manner via the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway in the Schwann cells of DPN.-Du, W., Wang, N., Li, F.

https://openalex.org/W2922567054,"Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most lethal human malignancies, and the leading cause of GC mortality is metastasis. However, the precise mechanism of GC metastasis remains unclear. To screen key transcriptional factors (TFs) involved in GC metastasis, we performed bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database and found that Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a GC metastasis-associated TF. KLF9 is significantly decreased in patients with GC with distant metastasis compared with those patients without distant metastasis. Ectopic expression of KLF9 evidently inhibited the migration and invasion capabilities of GC cells. Conversely, knockdown of KLF9 endowed GC cells with stronger invasive capacity. Moreover, tail intravenous injection confirmed that KLF9 strongly inhibits the lung metastasis process of GC in vivo. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing data from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements revealed that KLF9 specifically binds to the promoter region of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)28. Further quantitative real-time PCR and dual-luciferase assay indicated that KLF9 directly inhibited MMP28 transcription. Importantly, decreased invasion and metastasis capability of GC cells caused by ectopic KLF9 expression could be rescued via reinforcing MMP28 expression in vivo. Collectively, our study indicates that KLF9 significantly suppresses GC cell invasion and metastasis through inhibiting MMP28 transcription.-Li, Y., Sun, Q., Jiang, M., Li, S., Zhang, J., Xu, Z., Guo, D., Gu, T., Wang, B., Xiao, L., Zhou, T., Zhuo, W.

https://openalex.org/W2923964382,"Wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling has emerged as a major mechanism for promoting bone formation and a target pathway for developing bone anabolic agents against osteoporosis. However, the downstream events mediating the potential therapeutic effect of Wnt proteins are not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated that increased glycolysis is associated with osteoblast differentiation in response to Wnt signaling, but direct genetic evidence for the importance of glucose metabolism in Wnt-induced bone formation is lacking. Here, we have generated compound transgenic mice to overexpress Wnt family member 7B (Wnt7b) transiently in the osteoblast lineage of postnatal mice, with or without concurrent deletion of the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), also known as solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 1. Overexpression of Wnt7b in 1-mo-old mice for 1 wk markedly stimulated bone formation, but the effect was essentially abolished without Glut1, even though transient deletion of Glut1 itself did not affect normal bone accrual. Consistent with the in vivo results, Wnt7b increased Glut1 expression and glucose consumption in the primary culture of osteoblast lineage cells, and deletion of Glut1 diminished osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Thus, Wnt7b promotes bone formation in part through stimulating glucose metabolism in osteoblast lineage cells.—Chen, H., Ji, X., Lee, W.-C., Shi, Y., Li, B., Abel, E.

https://openalex.org/W2923702879,"Increased muscle contractile activity, as observed with regular exercise, prevents oxidative stress-induced muscle wasting, at least partially, by improving the antioxidant defense system. Phosphorylated p62/sequestosome1 competitively binds to the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which stimulates transcription of antioxidant/electrophile responsive elements. However, it remains to be determined if this process is activated by regular exercise in skeletal muscle. Here, we demonstrate that muscle contractile activity increases antioxidants, Nrf2 translocation into nuclei, and Nrf2 DNA-binding activity in association with increased p62 phosphorylation (Ser351) in mouse oxidative skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific loss of Nrf2 [i.e., Nrf2 muscle-specific knockout (mKO) mice] abolished the expression of the Nrf2 target antioxidant gene NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in both glycolytic and oxidative muscles but reduced exercise-mediated increases of antioxidants (i.e., copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) and extracellular SOD only in oxidative muscle. Interestingly, skeletal muscle-specific loss of p62 (i.e., p62 mKO mice) also abolished the expression of NQO1 and reduced exercise-mediated increases of the same antioxidants in soleus muscle. Collectively, these findings indicate that p62 and Nrf2 cooperatively regulate the exercise-mediated increase of antioxidants in oxidative muscle.-Yamada, M., Iwata, M., Warabi, E., Oishi, H., Lira, V. A., Okutsu, M. p62/SQSTM1 and Nrf2 are essential for exercise-mediated enhancement of antioxidant protein expression in oxidative muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2923368409,"Introduction Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) is the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world and appears to be more prevalent in children with additional support needs (ASN). There is an urgent need for routine screening for CVI, particularly in children with ASN, however, current screening questionnaires for CVI have limited validation. The aim of this study was to evaluate two screening tools: the Five Questions and the CVI Questionnaire. Additionally, the distribution of CVI across neurodevelopmental disorders is unknown. This too was investigated. Methods An online survey was completed by 535 parents. The survey was advertised via social media, CVI websites and parent email systems of four schools. The survey comprised of the Five Questions, the CVI Questionnaire and additional questions regarding the child’s diagnoses. Whether or not a child had a diagnosis of CVI and/or additional neurodevelopmental disorders was based on parental report. Results Based on parent reports, both the screening tools accurately screened for CVI diagnoses in children. The Five Questions and the CVI Questionnaire have construct validity (as determined through factor analysis), high internal consistency (as determined by Cronbach’s alpha) and convergent validity (as determined by correlation analysis of the raw scores of each questionnaire). This study also highlights that among children with neurodevelopmental disorders, a large proportion have parent-reported CVI (23%-39%) and potential CVI (6.59–22.53%; as identified by the questionnaires). Conclusion The current study demonstrates that the Five Questions and CVI Questionnaire have good convergent validity, internal consistency and a reliable factor structure and may therefore be suitable as screening tools. The study also highlights that reported or potential CVI is evident in a large proportion of children with neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2923139450,"Antimicrobial biopolymers provide a biodegradable, sustainable, safe, and cheap approach to drug delivery and wound dressing to control bacterial infection and improve wound healing respectively. Here, we report a one-step method of making antimicrobial alginate polymer from sodium alginate and aqueous extract of Wakame using antibiotic aminoglycosides. Thin layer chromatography of commercially available sodium alginate and Wakame extract showed similar oligosaccharide profiles. Screening of six aminoglycosides showed that kanamycin disulfate and neomycin sulfate produces the highest amount of biopolymer; however, kanamycin disulfate produces the most malleable and form fitting biopolymer. Image texture analysis of biopolymers showed similar quantification parameters for all the six aminoglycosides. Weight of alginate polymer as a function of aminoglycoside concentration follows a growth model of prion protein, consistent with the aggregating nature of both processes. Slow release of antibiotics and the resulting zone of inhibition against E. coli DH5α were observed by agar well diffusion assay. Inexpensive method of production and slow release of antibiotics will enable diverse applications of antimicrobial alginate biopolymer reported in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2923923096,"Timely diagnosis of tuberculosis disease is critical for positive patient outcomes, yet potentially millions go undiagnosed or unreported each year. Sputum is widely used as the testing input, but limited by its complexity, heterogeneity, and sourcing problems. Finding methods to interrogate noninvasive, non-sputum clinical specimens is indispensable to improving access to tuberculosis diagnosis and care. In this work, economical plasmonic gratings were used to analyze tuberculosis biomarker lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from clinical urine samples by single molecule fluorescence assay (FLISA) and compared with gold standard sputum GeneXpert MTB/ RIF, culture, and reference ELISA testing results.In this study, twenty sputum and urine sample sets were selected retrospectively from a repository of HIV-negative patient samples collected before initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy. GeneXpert MTB/RIF and culture testing of patient sputum confirmed the presence or absence of pulmonary tuberculosis while all patient urines were reference ELISA LAM-negative. Plasmonic gratings produced by low-cost soft lithography were bound with anti-LAM capture antibody, incubated with patient urine samples, and biotinylated detection antibody. Fluorescently labeled streptavidin revealed single molecule emission by epifluorescence microscope. Using a 1 fg/mL baseline for limit of detection, single molecule FLISA demonstrated good qualitative agreement with gold standard tests on 19 of 20 patients, including accurately predicting the gold-standard-negative patients, while one gold-standard-positive patient produced no observable LAM in urine.Single molecule FLISA by plasmonic grating demonstrated the ability to quantify tuberculosis LAM from complex urine samples of patients from a high endemic setting with negligible interference from the complex media itself. Moreover, agreement with patient diagnoses by gold standard testing suggests that single molecule FLISA could be used as a highly sensitive test to diagnose tuberculosis noninvasively."
https://openalex.org/W2922724808,"Escherichia coli is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal microbiota of chickens, a small proportion of which may be avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) or potential extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), capable of causing disease in humans. These E. coli may also be resistant to antimicrobials of critical importance in human or veterinary health. This study aims to 1) determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and resistance genes, multidrug resistance (MDR), chromosomal mechanisms of quinolone-resistance and virulence profiles of E. coli isolated from healthy chicken farms in the region of Dakar, Senegal, 2) investigate the spread of third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) resistance in E. coli isolated from healthy chicken farms with respect to virulence and resistance genes, serogroups, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), phylogenetic groups, plasmid types and transferability and 3) determine whether nonsusceptibility against 3GC on farms could be linked to risk factors. More than 68% of isolates from environmental faecal and drinking water samples, carcasses and carcass washes collected on 32 healthy chicken farms were multidrug resistant (MDR), resistance to antimicrobials critical in human health (3GC or ciprofloxacin) being found in all types of samples. Ciprofloxacin resistance was due to mutations in the gyrA and parC genes, 95% of tested farms harboring isolates carrying three mutations, in gyrA (Ser83Ile and Asp87Asn) and parC (Ser80Ile). Nine of the 32 farms (28.1%) demonstrated the presence of one or more 3GC-nonsusceptible indicator isolates but none of the potential risk factors were significantly associated with this presence on farms. Following ceftriaxone enrichment, presumptive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/AmpC-beta-lactamase (ESBL/AmpC)-producer isolates were found in 17 of the 32 farms. 3GC resistance was mediated by blaCMY-2 or blaCTX-M genes, blaCTX-M being of genotypes blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-8 and for the first time in chickens in Senegal, the genotype blaCTX-M-15. Clonally related ESBL/AmpC-producer isolates were found on different farms. In addition, blaCTX-M genes were identified on replicon plasmids I1 and K/B and blaCMY-2 on K/B, I1 and B/O. These plasmids were found in isolates of different clusters. In addition, 18 isolates, some of which were ESBL/AmpC-producers, were defined as potential human ExPEC. In conclusion, E. coli isolates potentially pathogenic for humans and demonstrating MDR, with resistance expressed against antimicrobials of critical importance in human health were found in healthy chickens in Senegal. Our results suggest that both clonal spreading and horizontal gene transfer play a role in the spread of 3GC-resistance and that chickens in Senegal could be a reservoir for AMR and ExPEC for humans. These results highlight the importance of raising awareness about compliance with biosecurity measures and prudent use of antimicrobials."
https://openalex.org/W2924486584,"Background Schistosoma mansoni is the main species causing hepatic and intestinal schistosomiasis in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is the only species in South America. Adult stages of the parasite reside in the mesenteric venous plexus of infected hosts, and eggs are shed in feces. Collecting patient stool samples for S. mansoni diagnostic purposes is difficult in large-scale field trials. Urine samples would be an alternative approach for molecular S. mansoni detection since they have several advantages over stool samples, including better handling, management and storage. Additionally, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool for infectious diseases, particularly under field conditions in developing countries. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of our previously developed LAMP assay (SmMIT-LAMP) for S. mansoni-specific detection in clinical urine samples. Methodology/Principal findings The sensitivity of SmMIT-LAMP in urine was established in simulated fresh human urine samples artificially spiked with genomic DNA from S. mansoni. LAMP for 120 min instead of 60 min improved the sensitivity, reaching values of 0.01 fg/μL. A set of well-defined frozen stored human urine samples collected from Sub-Saharan immigrant patients was selected from a biobank to evaluate the diagnostic validity of SmMIT-LAMP. The set included urine samples from patients with microscopy-confirmed infections with S. mansoni, S. haematobium and other nonschistosome parasites, as well as urine samples from patients with microscopy-negative eosinophilia without a confirmed diagnosis. The SmMIT-LAMP was incubated for 60 and 120 min. A longer incubation time was shown to increase the LAMP-positive results in patient urine samples. We also tested urine samples from mice experimentally infected with S. mansoni, and LAMP-positive results were obtained from the third week after infection. A real-time LAMP assay was also performed with three individual urine samples. Conclusions/Significance The SmMIT-LAMP could effectively detect S. mansoni DNA in mouse urine samples and produced promising results for human clinical samples. The detection of S. mansoni DNA in mouse urine samples from the third week after infection indicates that early diagnosis of active S. mansoni infection is possible using urine as a source of DNA. Further studies are still needed, but our method could be used as a promising molecular tool applicable to urine samples to diagnose human intestinal schistosomiasis caused by S. mansoni."
https://openalex.org/W2925176333,"According to guidelines, the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure can be predicted by determining the levels of natriuretic peptides, the NYHA classification and comorbidities. The aim our work was to develop a prognostic score in chronic heart failure patients that would take account of patients' comorbidities, NYHA and NT-proBNP levels.A total of 1,088 patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (LVEF<40%) and mid-range EF (HFmrEF) (LVEF 40-49%) were enrolled consecutively. Two-year all-cause mortality, heart transplantation and/or LVAD implantation were defined as the primary endpoint (EP). The occurrence of EP was 14.9% and grew with higher NYHA, namely 4.9% (NYHA I), 11.4% (NYHA II) and 27.8% (NYHA III-IV) (p<0.001). The occurrence of EP was 3%, 10% and 15-37% in patients with NT-proBNP levels ≤125 ng/L, 126-1000 ng/L and >1000 ng/L respectively. Discrimination abilities of NYHA and NT-proBNP were AUC 0.670 (p<0.001) and AUC 0.722 (p<0.001) respectively. The predictive value of the developed clinical model, which took account of older age, advanced heart failure (NYHA III+IV), anaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperuricaemia and being on a higher dose of furosemide (>40 mg daily) (AUC 0.773; p<0.001) was increased by adding the NT-proBNP level (AUC 0.790).The use of prediction models in patients with chronic heart failure, namely those taking account of natriuretic peptides, should become a standard in routine clinical practice. It might contribute to a better identification of a high-risk group of patients in which more intense treatment needs to be considered, such as heart transplantation or LVAD implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2922901740,"Pleistocene glaciations had significant effects on the distribution and evolution of species inhabiting the Holarctic region. Phylogeographic studies concerning the entire region are still rare. Here, we compared global phylogeographic patterns of one boreo-montane and one boreo-temperate butterflies with largely overlapping distribution ranges across the Northern Hemisphere, but with different levels of range fragmentation and food specialization. We reconstructed the global phylogeographic history of the boreo-montane specialist Boloria eunomia (n = 223) and of the boreo-temperate generalist Boloria selene (n = 106) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, and with species distribution modelling (SDM). According to the genetic structures obtained, both species show a Siberian origin and considerable split among populations from Nearctic and Palaearctic regions. According to SDMs and molecular data, both butterflies could inhabit vast areas during the moderate glacials. In the case of B. selene, high haplotype diversity and low geographic structure suggest long-lasting interconnected gene flow among populations. A stronger geographic structuring between populations was identified in the specialist B. eunomia, presumably due to the less widespread, heterogeneously distributed food resources, associated with cooler and more humid climatic conditions. Populations of both species show opposite patterns across major parts of North America and in the case of B. eunomia also across Asia. Our data underline the relevance to cover entire distribution ranges to reconstruct the correct phylogeographic history of species."
https://openalex.org/W2923823518,"Early social deprivation (i.e., an insufficiency or lack of parental care) has been identified as a significant adverse early experience that may affect multiple facets of child development and cause long-term outcomes in physical and mental health, cognition and behavior. Current research provides growing evidence that epigenetic reprogramming may be a mechanism modulating these effects of early adversities. This work aimed to investigate the impact of early institutionalization—the immersion in an extreme socially depriving environment in humans—on the epigenome and adaptive behavior of young children up to 4 years of age. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving two comparison groups: 29 children raised in orphanages and 29 children raised in biological families. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of blood cells were obtained using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array; the level of child adaptive functioning was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. In comparison to children raised in families, children residing in orphanages had both statistically significant deficits in multiple adaptive behavior domains and statistically significant differences in DNA methylation states. Moreover, some of these methylation states may directly modulate the behavioral deficits; according to preliminary estimates, about 7–14% of the deviation of adaptive behavior between groups of children may be determined by their difference in DNA methylation profiles. The duration of institutionalization had a significant impact on both the adaptive level and DNA methylation status of institutionalized children."
https://openalex.org/W2924060556,"Accurate species delimitation and description are necessary to guide effective conservation of imperiled species, and this synergy is maximized when multiple data sources are used to delimit species. We illustrate this point by examining Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake), a large, federally-protected species in North America that was recently divided into two species based on gene sequence data from three loci and heuristic morphological assessment. Here, we re-evaluate the two-species hypothesis for D. couperi by evaluating both population genetic and gene sequence data. Our analyses of 14 microsatellite markers revealed 6-8 genetic population clusters with significant admixture, particularly across the contact zone between the two hypothesized species. Phylogenetic analyses of gene sequence data with maximum-likelihood methods suggested discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers and provided phylogenetic support for one species rather than two. For these reasons, we place Drymarchon kolpobasileus into synonymy with D. couperi. We suggest inconsistent patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are driven by high dispersal of males relative to females. We advocate for species delimitation exercises that evaluate admixture and gene flow in addition to phylogenetic analyses, particularly when the latter reveal monophyletic lineages. This is particularly important for taxa, such as squamates, that exhibit strong sex-biased dispersal. Problems associated with over-delimitation of species richness can become particularly acute for threatened and endangered species, because of high costs to conservation when taxonomy demands protection of more individual species than are supported by accumulating data."

The study aims were to assess the nutritional status of pregnant Ethiopian women using MUAC and examine association with nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive factors, using baseline data of a prospective longitudinal observational birth cohort study conducted in three rural districts in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. Recruitment into the cohort was rolling over a period of nine months, and the data used for this analysis were collected while the women were between 12–32 weeks of gestation. Detailed household socio-demographics, agricultural production, women’s health, morbidity and diets, with weights, heights and MUAC, and anemia prevalence (HemoCue) were collected. The prevalence of low MUAC (< 23 cm) was 41%. Controlling for location and clustering, wealth quintile (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.82 to 0.96, p<0.01) was associated with decreased risk of low MUAC, while trimester (OR = 1.31, CI = 1.16 to 1.48, p<0.001) was associated with increased risk of low MUAC. The only significant factor amenable to nutrition-specific interventions was altitude-adjusted anemia, which was associated with increased risk of low MUAC (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.09 to 1.49, p<0.01). Significant factors amenable to nutrition-sensitive factors and associated with higher odds of low MUAC were household food insecurity (OR = 1.04, CI = 1.02 to 1.06, p<0.001), distance to the clinic in minutes (OR = 1.01, CI = 1.0 to 1.01, p<0.0001) and season of recruitment (lean versus non lean) (OR = 1.30, CI = 1.10 to 1.54, p<0.01). Literacy (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.74 to 0.98, p<0.05) and numeracy (OR = 0.75, CI = 0.62 to 0.91, p<0.01) were also significantly associated with lower odds of low MUAC. Poor nutritional status in pregnancy expressed as percent with low MUAC was high in Ethiopian women. It was associated with several nutrition-specific and -sensitive factors indicating the importance of multisectoral actions in improving outcomes within the first 1000 days."

Emotional well-being was assessed by the WHO (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Academic performance and the experience of being bullied at school were also evaluated as potential mediators of the effect of relative age.A total of 4,478 children participated in the study. In a univariate linear regression analysis, the relative birthdate (continuous variable starting from the school entry date and ending at the last date of the academic grade) was negatively associated with emotional well-being (β = -0.043, p = .005). The path analyses suggested that academic performance and bullying mediated the relationship between the relative birthdate and emotional well-being (both p < .01).Among a sample of 10-year-olds, children who were younger compared to class peers had lower levels of emotional well-being. Academic performance and victimization by peers mediated the relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2924780715,"Firefighters are exposed to carcinogens and have elevated cancer rates. We hypothesized that occupational exposures in firefighters would lead to DNA methylation changes associated with activation of cancer pathways and increased cancer risk. To address this hypothesis, we collected peripheral blood samples from 45 incumbent and 41 new recruit non-smoking male firefighters and analyzed the samples for DNA methylation using an Illumina Methylation EPIC 850k chip. Adjusting for age and ethnicity, we performed: 1) genome-wide differential methylation analysis; 2) genome-wide prediction for firefighter status (incumbent or new recruit) and years of service; and 3) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Four CpGs, including three in the YIPF6, MPST, and PCED1B genes, demonstrated above 1.5-fold statistically significant differential methylation after Bonferroni correction. Genome-wide methylation predicted with high accuracy incumbent and new recruit status as well as years of service among incumbent firefighters. Using IPA, the top pathways with more than 5 gene members annotated from differentially methylated probes included Sirtuin signaling pathway, p53 signaling, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. These DNA methylation findings suggest potential cellular mechanisms associated with increased cancer risk in firefighters."
https://openalex.org/W2925206005,"Soil salinity affects plant growth and development, which directly impact yield. Plants deploy many mechanisms to cope with, or mitigate, salt stress. One of such mechanism is to control movement of ions from root to shoot by regulating the loading of Na+ in the transpiration stream. The high-affinity K+ transporter 1 (HKT1) is known to play a role in the removal of Na+ from the xylem and bring it back to the root. As almond is a salt-sensitive crop, the rootstock plays an important role in successful almond cultivation in salt-affected regions. We currently lack knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in salt tolerance of almond rootstocks. In this study, we complemented the Arabidopsis athkt1 knockout mutant with HKT1 ortholog (PpHKT1) from the almond rootstock ‘Nemaguard’. Arabidopsis transgenic lines that were generated in athkt1 background with the constitutive promoter (PpHKT1OE2.2) and the native promoter (PpHKT1NP6) were subjected to different salt treatments. Both transgenic lines survived salt concentrations up to 120 mM NaCl, however, the mutant athkt1 died after 18 days under 120 mM NaCl. At 90 mM NaCl, the dry weight of athkt1 decreased significantly compared to the transgenic lines. Both transgenic lines showed significantly longer lateral roots compared to the athkt1 mutant at 80 mM NaCl treatment. The transgenic lines, PpHKT1OE2.2 and PpHKTNP6 had lower electrolyte leakage and higher relative water content compared to athkt1, suggesting that transgenic plants coped well with increased salt concentration by maintaining the integrity of the membranes. The expression analyses showed that PpHKT1 was induced in PpHKT1OE2.2 and PpHKTNP6 lines under salt treatment, which confirmed that both over-expression and native expression of PpHKT1 in the Arabidopsis mutant can complement salt tolerance function."

This study aims to provide evidence supporting the development and promotion of effective strategies for disaster response knowledge, including natural and human-made ones.A cross-sectional household survey on disaster response knowledge was conducted in Beijing, 2015. Using the multistage sampling method, data were collected from community residents through a self-administered questionnaire, and analyzed by descriptive methods and logistic regression models.Among the 847 respondents, 44.2% had advanced disaster response knowledge in general, while only 9.4% knew how to react to human-made disasters, and 61.4% had advanced natural disaster response knowledge. Rural residents and those with higher education had more disaster response knowledge (P<0.05). Economic status did not show significant effects on residents' disaster response knowledge.People's disaster response knowledge in Beijing was low, especially regarding human-made disasters. The findings implicate further health education on disaster preparedness and response should be implemented, also residents who lived in peri-urban and urban areas or with less education should be given more attention."
https://openalex.org/W2922723482,"Metabolic reprogramming is considered a hallmark of cancer. Currently, the altered lipid metabolism in cancer is a topic of interest due to the prominent role of lipids regulating the progression of various types of tumors. Lipids and lipid-derived molecules have been shown to activate growth regulatory pathways and to promote malignancy in pancreatic cancer. In a previous work, we have described the antitumoral properties of Yarrow (Achillea Millefolium) CO2 supercritical extract (Yarrow SFE) in pancreatic cancer. Herein, we aim to investigate the underlaying molecular mechanisms by which Yarrow SFE induces cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Yarrow SFE downregulates SREBF1 and downstream molecular targets of this transcription factor, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Importantly, we demonstrate the in vivo effect of Yarrow SFE diminishing the tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest that Yarrow SFE can be proposed as a complementary adjuvant or nutritional supplement in pancreatic cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2925099946,"N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans inhibits pro-inflammatory T cell responses and models of autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Metabolism controls N-glycan branching in T cells by regulating de novo hexosamine pathway biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, the donor substrate for the Golgi branching enzymes. Activated T cells switch metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. This reduces flux of glucose and glutamine into the hexosamine pathway, thereby inhibiting de novo UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and N-glycan branching. Salvage of GlcNAc into the hexosamine pathway overcomes this metabolic suppression to restore UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and N-glycan branching, thereby promoting anti-inflammatory T regulatory (Treg) over pro-inflammatory T helper (TH) 17 and TH1 differentiation to suppress autoimmunity. However, GlcNAc activity is limited by the lack of a cell surface transporter and requires high doses to enter cells via macropinocytosis. Here we report that GlcNAc-6-acetate is a superior pro-drug form of GlcNAc. Acetylation of amino-sugars improves cell membrane permeability, with subsequent de-acetylation by cytoplasmic esterases allowing salvage into the hexosamine pathway. Per- and bi-acetylation of GlcNAc led to toxicity in T cells, whereas mono-acetylation at only the 6 > 3 position raised N-glycan branching greater than GlcNAc without inducing significant toxicity. GlcNAc-6-acetate inhibited T cell activation/proliferation, TH1/TH17 responses and disease progression in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Thus, GlcNAc-6-Acetate may provide an improved therapeutic approach to raise N-glycan branching, inhibit pro-inflammatory T cell responses and treat autoimmune diseases such as MS."
https://openalex.org/W2923209651,"Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential elements of the human diet, which display increased plasma levels in obesity and regained particular interest as potential biomarkers for development of diabetes. To define determinants of insulin resistance (IR) we investigated 73 genes involved in BCAA metabolism or regulation by fine-scale haplotype mapping in two European populations with metabolic syndrome. French and Romanians (n = 465) were genotyped for SNPs (Affymetrix) and enriched by imputation (BEAGLE 4.1) at 1000 genome project density. Initial association hits detected by sliding window were refined (HAPLOVIEW 3.1 and PHASE 2.1) and correlated to homeostasis model assessment (HOMAIR) index, in vivo insulin sensitivity (SI) and BCAA plasma levels (ANOVA). Four genomic regions were associated with IR located downstream of MUT, AACS, SLC6A15 and PRKCA genes (P between 9.3 and 3.7 x 10−5). Inferred haplotypes up to 13 SNPs length were associated with IR (e.g. MUT gene with P < 4.9 x 10−5; Bonferroni 1.3 x 10−3) and synergistic to HOMAIR. SNPs in the same regions were also associated with one order of magnitude lower P values (e.g. rs20167284 in the MUT gene with P < 1.27 x 10−4) and replicated in Mediterranean samples (n = 832). In French, influential haplotypes (OR > 2.0) were correlated with in vivo insulin sensitivity (1/SI) except for SLC6A15 gene. Association of these genes with BCAA levels was variable, but influential haplotypes confirmed implication of MUT from BCAA metabolism as well as a role of regulatory genes (AACS and PRKCA) and suggested potential changes in transcriptional activity. These data drive attention towards new regulatory regions involved in IR in relation with BCAA and show the ability of haplotypes in phased DNA to detect signals complimentary to SNPs, which may be useful in designing genetic markers for clinical applications in ethnic populations."
https://openalex.org/W2923936404,"Optimal treatment of bone fractures with minimal complications requires implant alloys that combine high strength with high ductility. Today, TiAl6V4 titanium and 316L steel are the most applied alloys in bone surgery, whereas both share advantages and disadvantages. The nickel-free, high-nitrogen austenitic steel X13CrMnMoN18-14-3 (1.4452, brand name: P2000) exhibits high strength in combination with superior ductility. In order to compare suitable alloys for bone implants, we investigated titanium, 316L steel, CoCrMo and P2000 for their biocompatibility and hemocompatibility (according to DIN ISO 10993–5 and 10993–4), cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts, electrochemical and mechanical properties. P2000 exhibited good biocompatibility of fibroblasts and osteoblasts without impairment in vitality or changing of cell morphology. Furthermore, investigation of the osteoblasts function by ALP activity and protein levels of the key transcription factor RUNX2 revealed 2x increased ALP activity and more than 4x increased RUNX2 protein levels for P2000 compared to titanium or 316 steel, respectively. Additionally, analyses of osteoblast biomineralization by Alizarin Red S staining exhibited more than 6x increased significant mineralization of osteoblasts grown on P2000 as compared to titanium. Further, P2000 showed no hemolytic effect and no significant influence on hemocompatibility. Nanoindentation hardness tests of Titanium and 316L specimens exposed an indentation hardness (HIT) of about 4 GPa, whereas CoCrMo and P2000 revealed HIT of 7.5 and 5.6 GPa, respectively. Moreover, an improved corrosion resistance of P2000 compared to 316L steel was observed. In summary, we could demonstrate that the nickel-free high-nitrogen steel P2000 appears to be a promising alternative candidate for applications in bone surgery. As to nearly all aspects like biocompatibility and hemocompatibility, cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts and mechanical properties, P2000 was similar to or revealed advantages against titanium, 316L or CoCrMo."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of screening at age 65 in reducing cervical cancer mortality. A register-based cohort study was performed with a follow-up period between 1991 and 2014. Mortality risk ratios for incident cervical cancer cases diagnosed at age 65 or older were compared between women invited and not invited for screening. The background risk difference between the studied areas was accounted for by using a reference cohort. The relative risk of death for women invited for cervical cancer screening at the age of 65 was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29-0.94). The relative risks for women not attending and attending to screening with respect to the uninvited were 1.28 (CI: 0.65-2.50) and 0.28 (CI: 0.13-0.59), respectively. Inviting 65-year-old women for screening has been effective in reducing cervical cancer mortality."

We measured the concentrations of 27 inflammatory and neurotrophic proteins in blood specimens collected a week apart during the first postnatal month from 857 extremely preterm newborns in the United States. We classified children according to 3 indicators/correlates of socioeconomic disadvantage, mother's eligibility for government-provided medical care insurance (Medicaid), mother's formal education level, and mother's IQ approximated with the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test- 2. The risks of a top-quartile concentration of each protein on each of 5 days a week apart, on two occasions during the first two postnatal weeks, and during the next two weeks were modeled as functions of each indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage. The risks of top quartile concentrations of multiple (2-5) inflammation-related proteins on multiple days during the first two weeks were increased for each of the 3 indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, while the risks of top quartile concentrations of selected neurotrophic proteins were reduced. Adjustment for socioeconomic disadvantage did not alter the relationships between protein concentrations and both low IQ and low working memory 10 years later. Among extremely preterm newborns, indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with modestly increased risk of systemic inflammation in postnatal blood during the first postnatal month and with a slightly reduced risk of a neurotrophic signal, but do not confound relationships between protein concentrations and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2924288461,"Due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transparency, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has become a preferred model system to study gene function by microscopy. The use of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to proteins or targeting sequences of interest, further expanded upon the utility of C. elegans by labeling subcellular structures, which enables following their disposition during development or in the presence of genetic mutations. Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission spectra different from that of GFP accelerated the use of multifluorophore imaging in real time. We have expanded the repertoire of fluorescent proteins for use in C. elegans by developing a codon-optimized version of Orange2 (CemOrange2). Proteins or targeting motifs fused to CemOrange2 were distinguishable from the more common fluorophores used in the nematode; such as GFP, YFP, and mKate2. We generated a panel of CemOrange2 fusion constructs, and confirmed they were targeted to their correct subcellular addresses by colocalization with independent markers. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this new panel of fluorescent protein markers, we showed that CemOrange2 fusion proteins could be used to: 1) monitor biological pathways, 2) multiplex with other fluorescent proteins to determine colocalization and 3) gain phenotypic knowledge of a human ABCA3 orthologue, ABT-4, trafficking variant in the C. elegans model organism."
https://openalex.org/W2924883673,"Stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) are significant pests of cotton and soybeans in the southeastern United States with annual control costs exceeding $14 million in these crops. Three of the most prominent stink bug pests are the southern green (Nezara viridula), brown (Euschistus servus) and green (Chinavia hilaris) stink bugs. To determine trophic linkages between generalist arthropod predators and these pests, species-specific 16S molecular markers were designed and used to detect the presence of prey DNA in predator gut-contents. Over 2700 predators were collected over two growing seasons in cotton and soybean in southern Georgia in 2011 and 2012 and screened for stink bug DNA. Trophic linkages were analyzed relative to prey availability, crop type and field location. The frequency of stink bug DNA in predator guts was negligible on E. servus (0.23%) and C. hilaris (0.09%). Overall gut content detection of N. viridula was 3.3% and Geocoris sp. (Hemiptera: Geocoridae), Orius sp. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and Notoxus monodon (Coleoptera: Anthicidae) were the primary predators. This contrasts with previous studies that reported a much more diverse suite of predators consuming stink bugs with much higher frequency of gut-content positives. The discrepancy between studies highlights the need for replicating studies in space and time, especially if the goal is to implement effective and durable conservation biological control in integrated pest management."
https://openalex.org/W2922629547,"Throughout evolutionary history, humans have been exposed to a wide variety of diseases, some of which have serious and even lethal consequences. Memorizing medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases likely maximized the chances of survival and reproduction and was instrumental in the evolutionary success of our species. In the present study, we used the idea of adaptive memory to understand whether human memory evolved to recall information about medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases. We considered plant-disease pairs of words as units of information available in a medical system based on the use of medicinal plants. The pairs included in the categories of chronic infectious diseases and transmissible infectious diseases were considered to be of higher adaptive value, whereas those included in the category of common conditions were considered to be of lower adaptive value. Pairs grouped into the category of emerging and reemerging diseases were employed to investigate conformity bias; pairs belonging to the category esthetic uses were considered to be of little adaptive relevance and utilized as an experimental control. Our results revealed that plant-disease pairs associated with the category of common conditions, considered by us to be of lower severity and less adaptive relevance for humans, were better remembered and retained in the participants' memory. We believe that prior experience with common conditions and the frequency of these conditions in the population may have intensified the ability to remember the plant-disease pairs associated with this group of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2923866843,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe clinical form of leishmaniasis, and if untreated may be fatal. It affects important organs of the immune system and is characterized by a specific immunosuppression, along with intense cellular activation and cytokine storm. Moreover, VL is now recognized as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), in which multiple cytokines and other pro-inflammatory molecules are released. The action of these inflammatory mediators may be considered risk factors for poor prognosis and death. Leptin, a hormone derived from adipose tissue, has been described with several immunoregulatory functions in vitro and in vivo Leishmania infection models, particularly for enhancing the macrophage microbicidal mechanisms. Considering that evaluation of immunologic parameters that may be associated with this clinical scenario may help to decrease VL lethality, we evaluated whether leptin is associated with VL pathogenesis. Thirty-one patients were recruited in the active phase of VL, of which 22 were followed up until one month after therapy (1mpt). Except for creatinine levels, all clinical parameters were altered in active VL patients, especially leucocyte counts and albumin and hemoglobin levels. Also, elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), immunoglobulins (Ig)G1 and G3 anti-Leishmania and interleukins (IL)-6 and -10 were higher than in healthy individuals. In contrast, active VL patients presented diminished serum leptin levels and positive correlation with leukocytes counts and hemoglobin and albumin levels. After 1mpt, VL patients showed a significant increase in leptin levels, reaching values similar to healthy volunteers. As expected, only LPS levels remained elevated after 1mpt. These findings suggest that leptin levels are affected in Leishmania infection and the correlation with important parameters associated with the prognosis of VL points to the involvement of this molecule in VL immunopathogenesis. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the possibility of leptin as a prognostic marker of VL."

In this article, we test the assumption that equality-based respect from an opposing opinion-based group can reduce such biases. Results confirmed that identification as an opponent or proponent of a contested issue was negatively related to evaluations of outgroup arguments (Study 1) and that this negative link was no longer significant when intergroup respect was experimentally induced (Study 2). Results support the notion that disagreements over political issues are intergroup conflicts, in which different socio-political groups struggle for recognition, and that approaches that protect collective identities and improve intergroup relations should be employed to de-escalate them."
https://openalex.org/W2923160469,"Precipitation patterns are expected to change in the semi-arid region within the next decades, with projected increasing in extreme drought events. Meanwhile, the timing of extreme drought also shows great uncertainty, suggesting that the timing of drought, especially during growing season, may subsequently impose stronger stress on ecosystem functions than drought itself. However, how the timing of extreme drought will impact on community productivity and carbon cycle is still not clear. In this study, three timing of extreme drought (a consecutive 30-day period without precipitation event) experiments were set up separately in early-, mid- and late-growing season in a temperate steppe in Inner Mongolia since 2013. The data, including soil water content (SWC), soil temperature (ST) chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (Fv/Fm), ecosystem respiration (Re), gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem carbon absorption (NEE) and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were collected in growing season (from May to September) of 2016. In this study, extreme drought significantly decreased SWC during the drought treatment but not for the whole growing season. Extreme drought decreased maximum quantum efficiency of plant photosystem II (Fv/Fm) under “optimum” value (0.75~0.85) of two dominant species (Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis). While ANPP kept stable under extreme drought treatments due to the different responses of two dominant species, which brought a compensating effect in relative abundance and biomass. In addition, only early-growing season drought significantly decreased the average Re (P < 0.01) and GPP (P < 0.01) and depressed net CO2 uptake (P < 0.01) than mid- and late-growing season drought. ST and SWC influenced the changes of GPP directly and indirectly through photosynthetic ability of the dominant species by path analysis. Our results indicated that the timing of drought should be considered in carbon cycle models to accurately estimate carbon exchange and productivity of semi-arid grasslands in the context of changing climate."

The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection and the risk for a progression to active tuberculosis is higher in the homeless than in the general population. The objective was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection in a homeless population in Germany.Homeless individuals (n = 150) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study at three shelters in Münster, Germany (October 2017-July 2018). All participants were screened using an ELISPOT interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). Those participants tested positive/borderline by IGRA provided three sputa for microbiological analysis (line probe assay, microscopy, culture) and underwent a chest X-ray to screen for active pulmonary TB. Risk factors for tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection were analysed using a standardized questionnaire.Of the 142 evaluable IGRA, 21 (15%) were positive and two (1%) were borderline. No participant with a positive/borderline IGRA had an active tuberculosis as assessed by chest X-ray and microbiology. A negative IGRA was associated with a citizenship of a low-incidence country for tuberculosis (according to WHO, p = 0.01), low-incidence country of birth (p<0.001) or main residence in a low-incidence country in the past five years (p = 0.002).The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (diagnosed by a positive/borderline IGRA) was 16%; no active tuberculosis was detected. The highest risk for latent tuberculosis infection was found in patients from high-incidence countries.

The objectives of this study were to determine if chlorimuron-ethyl, fomesafen, and glyphosate applied separately and in mixtures control A. palmeri and confirm the presence of various genotypes surviving two- and three-way herbicide mixtures. Fifteen percent of A. palmeri treated with the three-way herbicide mixture survived. Mixing fomesafen with chlorimuron-ethyl or fomesafen with glyphosate to create a two-way mixture reduced A. palmeri survival 22 to 24% and 60 to 62% more than glyphosate and chlorimuron-ethyl alone, respectively. Previously characterized mutations associated with A. palmeri survival to chlorimuron-ethyl, fomesafen, and glyphosate Trp574Leu, a missing glycine codon at position 210 of the PPX2L gene (ΔG210), and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphase synthase (EPSPS) gene amplification; respectively, were present in surviving plants. However, 37% of plants treated with chlorimuron-ethyl did not contain heterozygous or homozygous alleles for the Trp574Leu mutation, suggesting alternative genotypes contributed to plant survival. All surviving A. palmeri treated with fomesafen or glyphosate possessed genotypes previously documented to confer resistance. Indiana soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Although the risks increase with greater prematurity and risk factors have been found to vary with gestational age and labour onset, few studies have focused on the myriad pathways to extreme preterm birth (20-27 weeks' gestation). The current study investigated trends in extreme preterm birth by labour onset type and examined the antecedent risks to further our understanding around the identification of high-risk pregnancies.Retrospective cohort study including all singleton extreme preterm births in Western Australia between 1986 and 2010. De-identified data from six core population health datasets were linked and used to ascertain extreme preterm births (excluding medical terminations and birth defects) after spontaneous onset of labour, preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes, and medically indicated labour onset. Trends over time in extreme preterm birth were analysed using linear regression. Multivariable regression techniques were used to assess the relative risks associated with each salient, independent risk factor and to calculate Population Attributable Risks (PARs).The extreme preterm birth rate including medical terminations and birth defects significantly increased over time whereas the extreme preterm birth rate excluding medical terminations and birth defects did not change. After medical terminations and birth defects were excluded, the rate of medically indicated extreme preterm births significantly increased over time whereas the rate of preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes extreme preterm births significantly reduced, and the rate of spontaneous extreme preterm births did not significantly change. In the multivariate analyses, factors associated with placental dysfunction accounted for >10% of the population attributable risk within each labour onset type.First study to show that the increase in extreme preterm birth in high-income jurisdiction is no longer evident after medical terminations and birth defects are excluded. Interventions that identify and target women at risk of placental dysfunction presents the greatest opportunity to reduce extreme preterm births."
https://openalex.org/W2922877917,"The additional value of ST analysis during labour is uncertain. In ST analysis, a T/QRS baseline value is calculated from the fetal electrocardiogram and successive T/QRS ratios are compared to this baseline. However, variation in the orientation of the electrical heart axis between fetuses may yield different T/QRS baseline values. In case of a higher T/QRS baseline value more ST events are encountered, although not always related to perinatal outcome. We hypothesised that we can partly correct for this effect by analysing T/QRS rises as a percentage from baseline (relative ST analysis). This study aimed to explore whether relative ST analysis has better diagnostic value for cord acidaemia compared to conventional ST analysis, where predefined fixed T/QRS ratios are used.A case-control study was performed in 20 term human fetuses during labour; 10 cases (umbilical cord artery pH <7.05 at birth, defining acidaemia) and 10 controls (pH >7.20) were included. The fetal electrocardiogram was recorded using a STAN monitor. We electronically extracted all T/QRS values, baseline and episodic ST events from the STAN monitor and calculated the relative T/QRS changes. The cut-off for relative ST events was determined in a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve at optimal specificity for cord acidaemia. Parameters of interest were area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve for relative ST events and test performance of both conventional and relative ST analysis.Relative ST analysis showed an AUC of 0.99. The optimal cut-off value for relative T/QRS rise was determined at 0.70. Relative vs conventional (absolute) ST analysis showed a specificity of 100% vs 40% (p = 0.031); sensitivity 90% vs 90%; positive likelihood ratio infinity vs 1.5; negative likelihood ratio 0.10 vs 0.25, respectively.Relative ST analysis seems to be a promising method to detect impending fetal acidaemia during labour.

https://openalex.org/W2923193740,"Objective The goal of this study was to analyze differences in the employment and wage trajectories of college-educated young workers in the United States, as distinguished by the timing of their entry into the labor market relative to the onset of the 2008–09 recession. Methods and findings Using annual American Community Survey microdata, we analyzed the first six years of employment and wage outcomes for cohorts of young workers on traditional-student pathways entering the market (1) in 2006, shortly before recession onset; (2) in 2009, during the recession; and (3) in 2012, three years after the recession officially ended. We found evidence for negative effects on outcomes and outcome trajectories differentiated by the recession’s proximity to workers’ labor market entry, including lower wages for the cohort entering in 2009. However, recession effects tended to be smaller for workers at the high end of the education gradient or with no direct exposure to the recession and were outweighed by gendered labor outcome disparities. We also observed a possibly enduring, recession-induced rise in the number of idle young males and the proportion of male and female high school graduates enrolled in college and not working. Conclusions Cohort differences in labor outcomes show that the disadvantages of entering the labor market during an economic downturn appear lasting. However, the subordinate role of timing effects in sorting young workers’ employment and wage rates, when compared to the stark stratification of employment and wage outcomes by education or sex, is a useful reminder that these latter social structures remain key determinants of labor outcomes."

Male youth’s knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and its association with the risk of their sexual partners’ pregnancy in China remains unexplored. This study investigates the KAP among Chinese unmarried male youth aged 15–24 years and identifies its association with partner pregnancy using nationally representative data from Survey of Youth Access to Reproductive Health in China (YARHC) in 2009. Methods Chi-square tests were applied to explore the prevalence of partner pregnancy by male youth’s KAP of SRH and logistic regression were applied to identify the associations of partner pregnancy with knowledge, attitudes and practice among male youth. Results Among 2853 sexually experienced male youth, totally 597 unmarried male youth caused 852 partner pregnancies and the prevalence rate was 20.93%. Lacking the knowledge of contraception access (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44–0.99) was significantly associated with lower risk of causing partner pregnancy. Contraception discussion before (1.49, 1.04–2.11) or after first sexual intercourse (1.46, 1.11–1.93), not using valid contraception (1.29, 1.03–1.64) and male contraception decision-maker (1.79, 1.41–2.28) were significantly associated with higher risk of causing partner pregnancy. Conclusion Our results indicated that male youth’s knowledge and behaviors of sexual and reproductive health were significantly associated with the risk of causing partner pregnancy, and highlighted the importance and need of sexual and reproductive programs targeting male for the prevention of unintended partner pregnancy in China."
https://openalex.org/W2923803515,"Habitat loss and fragmentation, together with related edge effects, are the primary cause of global biodiversity decline. Despite a large amount of research quantifying and demonstrating the degree of these effects, particularly in top predators and their prey, most fragmented patches are lost before their conservation value is recognized. This study evaluates terrestrial vertebrates in Playa Sandalo, in the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, which represents the last patch of ""primary"" forest in the most developed part of this region. Our study indicates that the diversity of ground species detected within Playa Sandalo rival other areas under active conservation like Lapa Rios Ecolodge. Historical fragmentation, together with the maintenance of forest cover in isolated conditions, are potentially responsible for the species composition observed within Playa Sandalo; facilitating the development of a prey-predator system including ocelots, medium-size mammals, and birds at the top of the trophic chain. The high diversity of both habitat and vertebrates, its prime location and cultural value, as well as its unique marine importance represent the ideal conditions for conservation. Conservation of Playa Sandalo, and other small tropical forest remnants, might represent the only management option for wildlife conservation within ever growing human-dominated landscapes."

These activators function during both replication initiation and elongation, however, it remains unclear whether Cdc45 performs the same function(s) during both events. Here, we describe the genetic and biochemical characterization of seven Cdc45 mutations. Three of these mutations are temperature-sensitive lethal mutations in CDC45. Intriguingly, these mutants are defective for DNA replication initiation but not elongation. Consistent with an initiation defect, all three temperature-sensitive mutants are defective for CMG formation. Two of the lethal mutants are located within the RecJ-like domain of Cdc45 confirming the importance of this region for Cdc45 function. The remaining two lethal mutations localize to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Cdc45 that is found in all eukaryotes. Despite the lethality of these IDR substitution mutants, Cdc45 lacking the IDR retains full function. Together, our data provide insights into the functional importance of Cdc45 domains and suggest that the requirements for Cdc45 function during DNA replication initiation are distinct from those involved in replication elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2925019616,"The objective of this study was to verify whether the inclusion of professionals who completed a specialized distance learning course in family health teams is associated with rates of hospitalization for primary healthcare-sensitive conditions and better monitoring of chronic conditions in municipalities within the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.Negative binomial regression models with fixed effects were used for the 79 municipalities in the state, with repeated observations for the selected years (2009-2015). For our reference, the parameter ""Municipality Ratio"" was the number of professionals who completed the course divided by the total number of PHC professionals in the municipality. This ratio has been cumulative over the years. No reference values were found in the scientific literature, so three cutoff points were used for tertile distribution: T3:high (0.35-1.00), T2:intermediate (0.02-0.33), and T1:Low (0.00-0.01). In order to avoid capturing biased results, the analysis was also performed for the years before the specialization course was offered (2009 and 2010).Indicators of the share of hospitalizations for primary care-sensitive conditions (overall rate and specific rates for asthma, gastroenteritis, and heart failure) decreased during the study period when related to a high and intermediate proportion of professionals who completed the specialization course, and the same was seen for indicators of chronic conditions (diabetic and hypertensive patients) who were registered, monitored and group care.The specialization course impacted important indicators related to the attributions of primary health care professionals, considering that decreases in hospitalizations for primary care sensitive causes (overall rate of sensitive causes, specific rates for asthma, gastroenteritis and heart failure) were seen in the territories where professionals who completed this course worked, along with increased registration and monitoring of diabetic and hypertensive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2925321028,"Amphibians are sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations but also respond to natural drivers of assemblage composition at many levels. Additionally, they are usually hard to detect in field inventories. We used a multiscale approach, from microhabitat to the landscape levels, to try to understand the effects of natural changes, and try to distinguish them from the effects of landscape level anthropogenic changes, on dynamic and diverse anuran assemblages, taking imperfect detection into account. We conducted thorough field inventories in 16 streams at Serra do Cipó, in the southern portion of Espinhaço Mountain Range, southeastern Brazil, during two time periods separated by 16 years. We compared species richness and diversity between periods, sampling both tadpoles and adult frogs. We quantified tadpole microhabitat availability, alterations in immediate riparian vegetation, and changes in classes of land cover within buffers around streams (adult habitats) to test for their effects on species composition. We also tested for effects of human occupancy around streams on nestedness and turnover components of species diversity. Microhabitats and riparian vegetation explained some of the changes in species composition (or detection) between time periods. Nestedness seemed to be influenced by the stability of the landscape. Detectabilities were too low to support robust occupancy estimates for most species. Natural changes in local habitats occupied by anurans in montane meadows are likely to influence species distribution. Some species with robust estimates experienced change in their occupancy over the studied 16-year interval, although no anthropogenic causes could be directly associated with such changes. The low detectability of most species, even with thorough sampling effort, makes it very hard to detect amphibian declines and possibly tell them apart from natural population fluctuations. New techniques are needed that improve species detectability in such diverse tropical habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2924149929,"Access to reliable and timely information ensures that decision-makers can operate effectively. The motivations and challenges of parliamentarians and policy-makers in accessing evidence have been well documented in the policy literature. However, there has been little focus on research-providers. Understanding both the demand- and the supply-side of research engagement is imperative to enhancing impactful interactions. Here, we examine the broader experiences, motivations and challenges of UK-based research professionals engaging with research-users relevant to policy-making and scrutiny in the UK using a nationwide online questionnaire. The context of the survey partly involved contributing to the UK Evidence Information Service (EIS), a proposed rapid match-making service to facilitate interaction between parliamentary arenas that use evidence and research-providers. Our findings reveal, at least for this sub-sample who responded, that there are gender-related differences in policy-related experience, motivations, incentives and challenges for research professionals to contribute to evidence-informed decision-making through initiatives such as the EIS. Male and female participants were equally likely to have policy experience; however, males reported both significantly broader engagement with the research-users included in the survey and significantly higher levels of engagement with each research-user. Reported incentives for engagement included understanding what the evidence will be used for, guidance on style and content of contribution, and acknowledgement of contributions by the policymaker or elected official. Female participants were significantly more likely to select the guidance-related options. The main reported barrier was workload. We discuss how academia-policy engagement initiatives can best address these issues in ways that enhance the integration of research evidence with policy and practice across the UK."
https://openalex.org/W2922952825,"Research analyzing male batterers' views of what constitutes an ideal partner is scarce, and rejected features have not been tested. Analyzing the association of attraction and rejection patterns with attachment could help us understand how these men choose their female partners and the biases that make violence against these women more likely. The objective of this study was to analyze these patterns in male batterers with different attachment styles, considering both their ideal and actual partner assessments and the discrepancies between the two. Participants were 108 male offenders who were serving sentences in Colombian prisons for violence against women. In addition to identifying their attachment styles (secure, dismissive, preoccupied, and fearful), the study had participants assess their ideal and actual partners. The results showed significant differences in their actual partner assessments and in ideal-actual partner discrepancies, but not in their ideals. Secure attachment was related to the best partner assessments (higher scores in positive features and lower scores in negative ones), whereas the fearfully attached participants stood out for showing the worst assessments (higher scores in negative features and lower scores in positive ones). The findings provide evidence of the association of attachment styles with attraction and rejection patterns and offer suggestions for tailoring interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2922610547,"Porcine gamma interferon is a cytokine produced by activated T cells and NK cells with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunomodulatory function. However, pIFN-γ is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-γ protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-γ protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-γ gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-γ gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-γ gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-γ protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0-24 h at 28°C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24-72 h at 25°C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3' end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-γ in animal husbandry."
https://openalex.org/W2922617262,"Complete resection of thymic neoplasms is important for achieving a favorable prognosis; however, the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial. We investigated the effect of induction therapy on complete resection and survival using 3-dimensionally reconstructed images to measure tumor volume.Eighty-nine patients who underwent surgical resection for Masaoka-Koga stage III-IV thymic neoplasms between January 2000 and December 2013 were enrolled, including 71 and 18 in the primary surgery and neoadjuvant therapy groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and survival rates were analyzed. Moreover, baseline and post-neoadjuvant therapy tumor volumes were compared among patients in the neoadjuvant group.Adjacent mediastinal structure invasion was significantly rarer in the primary surgery group than in the neoadjuvant group (1.27±1.09 vs. 2.61±1.42, p<0.001). On subgroup analysis of patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy, tumor volumes decreased significantly from 206.08±132.32 cm3 to 81.25±71.24 cm3 post-therapy (p = 0.001). Interestingly, only the pre-neoadjuvant tumor volume was significantly associated with complete resection, while the post-neoadjuvant volume was not (p = 0.012 and p = 0.458, respectively). Moreover, despite significantly reduced tumor volumes, patients in the neoadjuvant therapy group did not exhibit significantly different R0 resection rates (odds ratio 1.490, p = 0.581) or overall survival (p = 0.285) compared to those in the primary surgery group.Neoadjuvant therapy does not significantly influence the R0 resection rate or overall survival relative to primary surgery. Nevertheless, it may by useful for patients planning surgical resection because it significantly reduces the presurgical tumor volume and extent of invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2923050043,"The omnibus test is commonly applied to evaluate the overall disparity between group means in ANOVA. Alternatively, linear contrasts are more informative in detecting specific pattern of mean differences that cannot be obtained via the omnibus test. This article concerns power and sample size calculations for contrast analysis with heterogeneous variances and budget concerns. Optimal allocation procedures for the Welch-Satterthwaite tests of standardized and unstandardized contrasts are presented to minimize the total sample size with the designated ratios, to meet a desirable power level for the least cost, and to attain the maximum power performance under a fixed cost. Currently available methods rely exclusively on simple allocation formula and direct rounding rule. The proposed allocation strategies combine the computing techniques of nonlinear optimization search and iterative screening process. Numerical assessments of a randomized control trial for the overcoming depression on the Internet are conducted to demonstrate and confirm that the approximate procedures do not guarantee optimal solution. The suggested approaches extend and outperform the existing findings in methodological soundness and overall performance. The corresponding computer algorithms are developed to implement the recommended power and sample size calculations for optimal contrast analysis."
