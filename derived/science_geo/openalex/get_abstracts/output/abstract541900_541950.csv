https://openalex.org/W2185712725,"This paper studies P2P lending and the factors explaining loan default. This is an important issue because in P2P lending individual investors bear the credit risk, instead of financial institutions, which are experts in dealing with this risk. P2P lenders suffer a severe problem of information asymmetry, because they are at a disadvantage facing the borrower. For this reason, P2P lending sites provide potential lenders with information about borrowers and their loan purpose. They also assign a grade to each loan. The empirical study is based on loans’ data collected from Lending Club (N = 24,449) from 2008 to 2014 that are first analyzed by using univariate means tests and survival analysis. Factors explaining default are loan purpose, annual income, current housing situation, credit history and indebtedness. Secondly, a logistic regression model is developed to predict defaults. The grade assigned by the P2P lending site is the most predictive factor of default, but the accuracy of the model is improved by adding other information, especially the borrower’s debt level."
https://openalex.org/W2133664726,"According to the World Economic Forum, the diffusion of unsubstantiated rumors on online social media is one of the main threats for our society. The disintermediated paradigm of content production and consumption on online social media might foster the formation of homogeneous communities (echo-chambers) around specific worldviews. Such a scenario has been shown to be a vivid environment for the diffusion of false claim. Not rarely, viral phenomena trigger naive (and funny) social responses-e.g., the recent case of Jade Helm 15 where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of the civil war in the US. In this work, we address the emotional dynamics of collective debates around distinct kinds of information-i.e., science and conspiracy news-and inside and across their respective polarized communities. We find that for both kinds of content the longer the discussion the more the negativity of the sentiment. We show that comments on conspiracy posts tend to be more negative than on science posts. However, the more the engagement of users, the more they tend to negative commenting (both on science and conspiracy). Finally, zooming in at the interaction among polarized communities, we find a general negative pattern. As the number of comments increases-i.e., the discussion becomes longer-the sentiment of the post is more and more negative."
https://openalex.org/W2206559670,"A simple question about climate change, with one choice designed to match consensus statements by scientists, was asked on 35 US nationwide, single-state or regional surveys from 2010 to 2015. Analysis of these data (over 28,000 interviews) yields robust and exceptionally well replicated findings on public beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, including regional variations, change over time, demographic bases, and the interacting effects of respondent education and political views. We find that more than half of the US public accepts the scientific consensus that climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities. A sizable, politically opposite minority (about 30 to 40%) concede the fact of climate change, but believe it has mainly natural causes. Few (about 10 to 15%) say they believe climate is not changing, or express no opinion. The overall proportions appear relatively stable nationwide, but exhibit place-to-place variations. Detailed analysis of 21 consecutive surveys within one fairly representative state (New Hampshire) finds a mild but statistically significant rise in agreement with the scientific consensus over 2010–2015. Effects from daily temperature are detectable but minor. Hurricane Sandy, which brushed New Hampshire but caused no disaster there, shows no lasting impact on that state’s time series—suggesting that non-immediate weather disasters have limited effects. In all datasets political orientation dominates among individual-level predictors of climate beliefs, moderating the otherwise positive effects from education. Acceptance of anthropogenic climate change rises with education among Democrats and Independents, but not so among Republicans. The continuing series of surveys provides a baseline for tracking how future scientific, political, socioeconomic or climate developments impact public acceptance of the scientific consensus."
https://openalex.org/W2177193863,"Epigenetic control of gene expression is critical for normal fetal development. However, chromatin-related mechanisms that activate bone-specific programs during osteogenesis have remained underexplored. Therefore, we investigated the expression profiles of a large cohort of epigenetic regulators (>300) during osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal cells derived from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue (AMSCs). Molecular analyses establish that the polycomb group protein EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) is down-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation of AMSCs. Chemical inhibitor and siRNA knockdown studies show that EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), suppresses osteogenic differentiation. Blocking EZH2 activity promotes osteoblast differentiation and suppresses adipogenic differentiation of AMSCs. High throughput RNA sequence (mRNASeq) analysis reveals that EZH2 inhibition stimulates cell cycle inhibitory proteins and enhances the production of extracellular matrix proteins. Conditional genetic loss of Ezh2 in uncommitted mesenchymal cells (Prrx1-Cre) results in multiple defects in skeletal patterning and bone formation, including shortened forelimbs, craniosynostosis, and clinodactyly. Histological analysis and mRNASeq profiling suggest that these effects are attributable to growth plate abnormalities and premature cranial suture closure because of precocious maturation of osteoblasts. We conclude that the epigenetic activity of EZH2 is required for skeletal patterning and development, but EZH2 expression declines during terminal osteoblast differentiation and matrix production.

https://openalex.org/W2192459572,"Endophytic actinomycetes have shown unique plant growth promoting as well as antagonistic activity against fungal phytopathogens. In the present study forty-two endophytic actinomycetes recovered from medicinal plants were evaluated for their antagonistic potential and plant growth-promoting abilities. Twenty-two isolates which showed the inhibitory activity against at least one pathogen were subsequently tested for their plant-growth promoting activities and were compared genotypically using DNA based fingerprinting, including enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and BOX repetitive elements. Genetic relatedness based on both ERIC and BOX-PCR generates specific patterns corresponding to particular genotypes. Exponentially grown antagonistic isolates were used to evaluate phosphate solubilization, siderophores, HCN, ammonia, chitinase, indole-3-acetic acid production, as well as antifungal activities. Out of 22 isolates, the amount of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) ranging between 10–32 μg/ml was produced by 20 isolates and all isolates were positive for ammonia production ranging between 5.2 to 54 mg/ml. Among 22 isolates tested, the amount of hydroxamate-type siderophores were produced by 16 isolates ranging between 5.2 to 36.4 μg/ml, while catechols-type siderophores produced by 5 isolates ranging from 3.2 to 5.4 μg/ml. Fourteen isolates showed the solubilisation of inorganic phosphorous ranging from 3.2 to 32.6 mg/100ml. Chitinase and HCN production was shown by 19 and 15 different isolates, respectively. In addition, genes of indole acetic acid (iaaM) and chitinase (chiC) were successively amplified from 20 and 19 isolates respectively. The two potential strains Streptomyces sp. (BPSAC34) and Leifsonia xyli (BPSAC24) were tested in vivo and improved a range of growth parameters in chilli (Capsicum annuum L.) under greenhouse conditions. This study is the first published report that actinomycetes can be isolated as endophytes from within these plants and were shown to have antagonistic and plant growth promoting abilities. These results clearly suggest the possibility of using endophytic actinomycetes as bioinoculant for plant growth promotion, nutrient mobilization or as biocontrol agent against fungal phytopathogens for sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2178353191,"Microarray technologies are established approaches for high throughput gene expression, methylation and genotyping analysis. An accurate mapping of the array probes is essential to generate reliable biological findings. However, manufacturers of the microarray platforms typically provide incomplete and outdated annotation tables, which often rely on older genome and transcriptome versions that differ substantially from up-to-date sequence databases. Here, we present the Re-Annotator, a re-annotation pipeline for microarray probe sequences. It is primarily designed for gene expression microarrays but can also be adapted to other types of microarrays. The Re-Annotator uses a custom-built mRNA reference database to identify the positions of gene expression array probe sequences. We applied Re-Annotator to the Illumina Human-HT12 v4 microarray platform and found that about one quarter (25%) of the probes differed from the manufacturer's annotation. In further computational experiments on experimental gene expression data, we compared Re-Annotator to another probe re-annotation tool, ReMOAT, and found that Re-Annotator provided an improved re-annotation of microarray probes. A thorough re-annotation of probe information is crucial to any microarray analysis. The Re-Annotator pipeline is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/reannotator along with re-annotated files for Illumina microarrays HumanHT-12 v3/v4 and MouseRef-8 v2."
https://openalex.org/W2302073274,"Livestock-associated bacteria with resistance to two or more antibiotic drug classes have heightened our awareness for the consequences of antibiotic consumption and spread of resistant bacterial strains in the veterinary field. In this study we assessed the prevalence of concomitant colonization with livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and enterobacteriaceae expressing extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBL-E) in farms at the German-Dutch border region. Nasal colonization of pigs with MRSA (113/547 (20.7%)) was less frequent than rectal colonization with ESBL-E (163/540 (30.2%)). On the individual farm level MRSA correlated with ESBL-E recovery. The data further provide information on prevalence at different stages of pig production, including abattoirs, as well as in air samples and humans living and working on the farms. Notably, MRSA was detected in stable air samples of 34 out of 35 pig farms, highlighting air as an important MRSA transmission reservoir. The majority of MRSA isolates, including those from humans, displayed tetracycline resistance and spa types t011 and t034 characteristic for LA-MRSA, demonstrating transmission from pigs to humans. ESBL-E positive air samples were detected on 6 out of 35 farms but no pig-to-human transmission was found. Detection of ESBL-E, e.g. mostly Escherichia coli with CTX-M-type ESBL, was limited to these six farms. Molecular typing revealed transmission of ESBL-E within the pig compartments; however, related strains were also found on unrelated farms. Although our data suggest that acquisition of MRSA and ESBL-E might occur among pigs in the abattoirs, MRSA and ESBL-E were not detected on the carcasses. Altogether, our data define stable air (MRSA), pig compartments (ESBL-E) and abattoir waiting areas (MRSA and ESBL-E) as major hot spots for transmission of MRSA and/or ESBL-E along the pig production chain."
https://openalex.org/W2179075918,"A key component of colonization, biofilm formation, and protection of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide Psl. Composed of a pentameric repeating unit of mannose, glucose, and rhamnose, the biosynthesis of Psl is proposed to occur via a Wzx/Wzy-dependent mechanism. Previous genetic studies have shown that the putative glycoside hydrolase PslG is essential for Psl biosynthesis. To understand the function of this protein, the apo-structure of the periplasmic domain of PslG (PslG(31-442)) and its complex with mannose were determined to 2.0 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. Despite a domain architecture and positioning of catalytic residues similar to those of other family 39 glycoside hydrolases, PslG(31-442) exhibits a unique 32-A-long active site groove that is distinct from other structurally characterized family members. PslG formed a complex with two mannose monosaccharides in this groove, consistent with binding data obtained from intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. PslG was able to catalyze the hydrolysis of surface-associated Psl, and this activity was abolished in a E165Q/E276Q double catalytic variant. Surprisingly, P. aeruginosa variants with these chromosomal mutations as well as a pslG deletion mutant were still capable of forming Psl biofilms. However, overexpression of PslG in a pslG deletion background impaired biofilm formation and resulted in less surface-associated Psl, suggesting that regulation of this enzyme is important during polysaccharide biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2114785239,"Objective Digital retinal imaging is an established method of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). It has been established that currently about 1% of the world’s blind or visually impaired is due to DR. However, the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and DR is creating an increased workload on those with expertise in grading retinal images. Safe and reliable automated analysis of retinal images may support screening services worldwide. This study aimed to compare the Iowa Detection Program (IDP) ability to detect diabetic eye diseases (DED) to human grading carried out at Moorfields Reading Centre on the population of Nakuru Study from Kenya. Participants Retinal images were taken from participants of the Nakuru Eye Disease Study in Kenya in 2007/08 (n = 4,381 participants [NW6 Topcon Digital Retinal Camera]). Methods First, human grading was performed for the presence or absence of DR, and for those with DR this was sub-divided in to referable or non-referable DR. The automated IDP software was deployed to identify those with DR and also to categorize the severity of DR. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of IDP versus the human grader as reference standard. Results Altogether 3,460 participants were included. 113 had DED, giving a prevalence of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.7–3.9%). Sensitivity of the IDP to detect DED as by the human grading was 91.0% (95% CI, 88.0–93.4%). The IDP ability to detect DED gave an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI 0.850–0.905). It showed a negative predictive value of 98%. The IDP missed no vision threatening retinopathy in any patients and none of the false negative cases met criteria for treatment. Conclusions In this epidemiological sample, the IDP’s grading was comparable to that of human graders’. It therefore might be feasible to consider inclusion into usual epidemiological grading."

Dopamine transporter function is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and other signaling pathways through mechanisms that are complex and poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of Ser-7 phosphorylation and Cys-580 palmitoylation in mediating steady-state transport kinetics and PKC-stimulated transport down-regulation. Using both mutational and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that these post-translational modifications are reciprocally regulated, leading to transporter populations that display high phosphorylation-low palmitoylation or low phosphorylation-high palmitoylation. The balance between the modifications dictates transport capacity, as conditions that promote high phosphorylation or low palmitoylation reduce transport Vmax and enhance PKC-stimulated down-regulation, whereas conditions that promote low phosphorylation or high palmitoylation increase transport Vmax and suppress PKC-stimulated down-regulation. Transitions between these functional states occur when endocytosis is blocked or undetectable, indicating that the modifications kinetically regulate the velocity of surface transporters.

Here we investigate the relationship between Ser-7 phosphorylation and Cys-580 palmitoylation of DAT in steady-state transport kinetics and PKC-stimulated down-regulation, finding that these modifications are reciprocally regulated and induce opposing effects on Vmax and PKC responsiveness. The functional differences are driven by a trafficking-independent process in which reduced transport correlates with Ser-7 phosphorylation and increased transport correlates with Cys-580 palmitoylation. This demonstrates a previously unknown mechanism for control of DAT function and suggests the potential for these modifications to represent sites of dysregulation in DA imbalance disorders.

For DHHC experiments, cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids 24 h before the start of the experiment. Plasmids encoding HA-tagged DHHC2 and GST were the generous gift of Dr. Masaki Fukata, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Japan. DHHA2 negative control with residue Cys-156 changed to alanine to create an inactive protein was created from DHHC2 by site-directed mutagenesis with codon substitution verified by sequencing (Eurofins MWG), and expression of all constructs was verified by anti-HA immunoblotting (not shown). Cells were labeled with phosphate-free medium containing 0.5–1 mCi/ml 32P for 2 h at 37 °C followed by application of test compounds for the indicated times. Cells were washed, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 min, and resulting supernatants were adjusted to contain 0.5% SDS and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble material. DATs were immunoprecipitated with poly16 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (19.Foster J.D. Pananusorn B. Vaughan R.A.

For experiments in brain tissue, rat striatal synaptosomes were prepared and labeled with 32P as previously described (25.Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J.

Briefly, synaptosomes prepared in sucrose-phosphate buffer (0.32 m sucrose and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at 120 mg/ml original wet weight were diluted 4-fold in oxygenated Krebs bicarbonate buffer (25 mm NaHCO3, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3) containing [32P]orthophosphate (2 mCi/ml) and 10 μm OA to suppress tonic dephosphorylation. Samples were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 10 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), or 1 μm PMA and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. Synaptosomes were then placed on ice and washed 3 times with ice-cold Krebs bicarbonate buffer by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 12 min. Final synaptosomal pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, and 3% β-mercaptoethanol with 4 passages through a 26-gauge needle. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min, and resulting supernatants were diluted 5-fold for DAT immunoprecipitation with poly16 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Total DAT levels in each sample were determined by immunoblotting using mAb 16 (23.Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Uptake inhibitors but not substrates induce protease resistance in extracellular loop two of the dopamine transporter.Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate labeling was performed in rDAT-LLCPK1 cells by incubation for 6–18 h with medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate and treatment with vehicle or test compounds for an additional 60 min. The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 125 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride), and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with poly16 followed by SDS-PAGE, treatment of gels with Fluoro-Hance, and autofluorography. Analysis of palmitoylation by acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) was performed as described (17.Foster J.D. Vaughan R.A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 5175-5186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For experiments in cells, lysates were prepared as above with 20 mm MMTS added to the lysis buffer to block free thiols. For experiments using brain tissue, rat striatal slices were preincubated in oxygenated Krebs bicarbonate buffer for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking at 105 rpm followed by treatment with vehicle or 1 μm OA plus 10 μm OAG for an additional 30 min. Oxygen (95% O2, 5% CO2) was gently blown across the top of the plate during the incubation. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold sucrose-phosphate buffer with 15 strokes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 12 min. The resulting P2 synaptosomal pellet was resuspended to 50 mg/ml original wet weight in ice-cold sucrose-phosphate buffer. The synaptosomal suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors and 20 mm MMTS. Cell and synaptosomal lysates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mixing followed by acetone precipitation and resuspension in lysis buffer containing MMTS and incubation at room temperature overnight with end-over-end rotation. Excess MMTS was removed by three sequential acetone precipitations followed by resuspension of precipitated proteins in 300 μl of a buffer containing 4% (w/v) SDS (4SB: 4% SDS, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Each sample was divided into two equal portions that were treated for 2 h at room temperature with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as control or 0.7 m hydroxylamine (NH2OH), pH 7.4, which cleaves the thioester bonds and removes endogenous palmitate groups. NH2OH was removed by three sequential acetone precipitations followed by resuspension of the precipitated proteins in 240 μl of 4SB buffer. Samples were diluted with 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 mm HPDP biotin to label the liberated sulfhydryl groups and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with end-over-end mixing. Unreacted HPDP biotin was removed by three sequential acetone precipitations followed by resuspension of the final pellet in 75 μl of lysis buffer without MMTS. Samples were adjusted to contain 0.1% SDS by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and biotinylated proteins were extracted using NeutrAvidin resin. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm DTT plus 3% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. DAT was identified by immunoblotting using mAb 16 (23.Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Uptake inhibitors but not substrates induce protease resistance in extracellular loop two of the dopamine transporter.Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In all experiments the level of signal intensity from Tris controls was <5% of NH2OH levels. Immunoprecipitation of 32P- or [3H] palmitate-labeled DATs was conducted for 2 h at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked with poly16 antibody (17.Foster J.D. Vaughan R.A.

Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for detection of radioactivity. For immunoblotting, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and DATs were detected with mAb 16 as previously described (23.Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A.

For all experiments, palmitoylated or phosphorylated DAT band intensities were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software and normalized to the amount of total DAT protein in the sample, and signals for treatment groups were expressed relative to control samples set to 100%. For cell surface expression determination WT or mutant rDAT-LLCPK1 cells were incubated with the membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, and biotinylated DATs were purified from cell lysates (25 μg of protein) by chromatography on NeutrAvidin beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by immunoblotting (16.Foster J.D.

All experiments were performed a minimum of three times with similar results, and values were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test or one way ANOVA as indicated. S7A, C522A, and C580A DAT mutants used in this study were characterized previously (17.Foster J.D. Vaughan R.A.

S7A/C580A DAT was produced from a pcDNA 3.0 plasmid containing the DAT C580A cDNA sequence using the Stratagene QuikChange® kit with codon substitution verified by sequencing (Eurofins MWG). For production of stable transformants, LLCPK1 cells were transfected using X-tremeGENE transfection reagent and 0.5 μg of the mutant plasmid. Transformants were selected 24–48 h later by the addition of 800 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) to the cell culture medium. All mutants were active for [3H]DA transport, expressed at 30–50% that of the WT protein level, and showed ratios of total to cell surface expression that were comparable with that of the WT protein. WT or mutant rDAT-LLCPK1 cells were grown in 24-well plates to ∼80% confluence and rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of 37 °C Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer (KRH: 25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Where indicated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with vehicle or 1 μm PMA or with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) for 30 min before the addition of PMA. Uptake was performed in triplicate for 8 min, with nonspecific uptake determined with 100 μm (−)-cocaine. For single point assays uptake was initiated by the addition of 10 nm [3H]DA plus 3 μm DA. For saturation analyses DA was varied from 1 to 30 μm. Cells were rapidly washed 2 times with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and radioactivity contained in lysates was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic values were analyzed by Prism, and Vmax values for each form were normalized to surface expression transporter levels determined in parallel for each experiment. Subcellular fractions were generated by differential centrifugation as described (26.Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). LLCPK1 cells stably expressing WT rDAT were cultured in 150-mm dishes, grown to ∼90% confluence, labeled with 32P when indicated, and treated with vehicle or 1 μm PMA for 30 min. Cells were washed, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer C (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) and homogenized in ice-cold Buffer C with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g to remove nuclei, and post-nuclear supernatants (totals) were centrifuged sequentially at 16,000 × g for 12 min (16,000 × g membranes) and at 200,000 × g for 1 h (200,000 × g membranes). Resulting pellets were resuspended at the original volume in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Fractions were immunoblotted for DAT, Na+/K+ ATPase, Rab5A, Rab7, and Rab11 or analyzed by ABE for detection of DAT palmitoylation. 32P-Labeled fractions were immunoprecipitated with poly16 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography for detection of DAT phosphorylation. To determine if phosphorylation of DAT is affected by its level of palmitoylation, we examined the 32P labeling of C580A DAT, which shows an ∼50% reduction in palmitoylation, and C522A DAT, which shows no reduction in palmitoylation (17.Foster J.D.

LLCPK1 cells expressing WT, C522A, or C580A DATs were labeled with 32P and treated with vehicle or PMA to activate PKC, and equal amounts of DAT were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography (Fig. 1A). WT DAT displayed typical levels of basal and stimulated phosphorylation, with PMA inducing increases to 420 ± 77% of basal (p < 0.001). C522A DAT showed the same pattern and intensity of labeling, indicating no effect of this residue on phosphorylation. In contrast, 32P labeling of C580A DAT was enhanced in both basal (263 ± 25% of"

Methods The hospital-based observational study included 172 patients (336 eyes) with a mean age of 61.9±12.3 years and mean axial length of 30.1±2.3 mm (range: 24.7–39.1mm). Glaucomatous-type optic discs were defined by glaucomatous optic disc appearance. Glaucoma was defined by glaucomatous optic disc appearance and glaucomatous Goldmann visual field defects not corresponding with myopic macular changes. Results Larger disc area (mean: 3.18±1.94 mm2) was associated with longer axial length (P<0.001; standardized correlation coefficient: 0.45). Glaucoma was detected in 94 (28%; 95% Confidence intervals: 23%, 33%) eyes. In multivariate analysis, glaucoma prevalence was 3.2 times higher (P<0.001) in megalodiscs (>3.79 mm2) than in normal-sized discs or small discs (<1.51 mm2) after adjusting for older age. Axial length was not significantly (P = 0.38) associated with glaucoma prevalence in that model. Glaucoma prevalence increased by a factor of 1.39 for each increase in optic disc area by one mm2. Again, axial length was not significantly (P = 0.38) associated with glaucoma prevalence when added to this multivariate model. Conclusion Within highly myopic individuals, glaucoma prevalence increased with larger optic disc size beyond a disc area of 3.8 mm2. Highly myopic megalodiscs as compared to normal sized discs or small discs had a 3.2 times higher risk for glaucomatous optic nerve neuropathy. The increased glaucoma prevalence in axial high myopia was primarily associated with axial myopia associated disc enlargement and not with axial elongation itself."

Motivated by findings on enlarged corpus callosum in musicians and asymmetric somatomotor representation in string players, we investigated the relationship between musical training, callosal anatomy, and interhemispheric functional symmetry during music listening. Functional symmetry was increased in musicians compared to nonmusicians, and in keyboardists compared to string players. This increased functional symmetry was prominent in visual and motor brain networks. Callosal size did not significantly differ between groups except for the posterior callosum in musicians compared to nonmusicians. We conclude that the distinctive postural and kinematic symmetry in instrument playing cross-modally shapes information processing in sensory-motor cortical areas during music listening. This cross-modal plasticity suggests that motor training affects music perception."

This sequence-driven process can be influenced greatly by mutations, even those that do not change the protein coding potential of the transcript. Synonymous mutations have been shown to alter gene expression through modulation of splicing, mRNA stability, and translation.

Although phylogenetic conservation scores are insufficient to identify synonymous positions important for exon inclusion, an alignment of organisms filtered based on similar exon/intron architecture is highly successful. Although many of the splicing neutral mutations are observed to occur, none of the exon inclusion reducing mutants was found in the filtered alignment. Using the modified phylogenetic comparison as an approach to evaluate the impact on pre-mRNA splicing suggests that up to 45% of synonymous SNPs are likely to alter pre-mRNA splicing.

These results demonstrate that coding and pre-mRNA splicing pressures co-evolve and that a modified phylogenetic comparison based on the exon/intron architecture is a useful tool in identifying splice altering SNPs. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential process necessary for both proper gene expression and the generation of transcript diversity throughout metazoans (1.Nilsen T.W. Graveley B.R. Expansion of the eukaryotic proteome by alternative splicing.Nature. 2010; 463: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Intron removal, directed by sequence signals within the pre-mRNA, is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large ribonuclear protein complex (2.Black D.L.

The presence of sequence elements that influence splicing throughout the transcript suggests that organisms that rely on high fidelity splicing will be under evolutionary pressure to maintain optimal splice signals within the pre-mRNA molecule (5.Fox-Walsh K.L.

Indeed, it has previously been shown that splicing regulatory elements exhibit positive selection, that intron/exon boundaries have a decreased frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and that certain codons are generally preferred around intron/exon junctions (6.Willie E.

These observations suggest that the spliceosome has to recognize exons by using sequences that are co-evolving with the amino acid sequence code to generate an RNA molecule that both translates and properly splices. However, it is difficult to uncouple sequence requirements imposed by evolutionary coding pressures from sequence requirements necessary to generate the appropriate mRNA through splicing. Splicing requires sequence elements from both the intron and the exon for proper intron excision. Within the exon, those sequence elements are restricted in sequence by the need for correct protein coding. Given the diversity of the genetic code in the third or wobble position, it has been possible in a few cases to separate splicing constraints from coding constraints (9.Goren A. Ram O. Amit M. Keren H. Lev-Maor G. Vig I. Pupko T. Ast G. Comparative analysis identifies exonic splicing regulatory sequences: the complex definition of enhancers and silencers.Mol.

Here, we characterize the contribution of splicing evolutionary pressures through the identification of synonymous mutations that specifically alter the efficiency of intron removal. We created a library of synonymous mutations across exon 7 of the SMN1 gene to identify positions that influence exon inclusion using deep-sequencing approaches. Phylogenetic comparisons with organisms that have a similar SMN1 exon 7 architecture demonstrated a selection against exon inclusion-reducing mutants, clearly demonstrating that evolutionary pressures exist at wobble positions to uphold efficient splicing of this crucial exon. A survey of human synonymous SNPs showed that 45% contain potentially splice altering nucleotide substitutions. These observations suggest that a large proportion of synonymous SNPs can cause defects in splicing. Thus, filtering multiple species alignments by exon architectural similarity represents a novel strategy to identify exonic splicing regulatory elements and synonymous mutations that disrupt proper pre-mRNA splicing. HeLa cells used in this work were maintained at 37 °C in a monolayer in Dulbecco's high glucose modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamate, and 1 mm Na-pyruvate. Their cell confluence was kept to ∼80% or less before splitting cells. Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's specifications for Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plate sizes of 10-cm 6-well plates with 3-cm wells, or 15-cm plates. We used previously described SMN mini-genes containing exons 6, 7, and 8 with shortened introns between each exon (11.Geib T. Hertel K.J.

To generate a library of synonymous mutations across exon 7, we created a series of mutagenesis primers to make a site-directed saturation mutagenesis library of exon 7. This library is comprised of synonymous site-directed mutations spanning the 54-nucleotide exon 7 region of the SMN1 gene. All possible combinations of synonymous mutations were generated within a sliding 2-codon window such that the gene amino acid sequence remained the same and all possible synonymous mutations were created. Sets of oligonucleotide primers were used to generate the mutations to each synonymous position in exon 7. To generate the library with fewer per-base errors, oligonucleotide sets used were kept as short as possible and the mutagenesis reactions were split into three separate pooled reactions (sequences of oligonucleotides used are available upon request). The first reaction contained a pool of 8 forward and 8 reverse oligonucleotides (oligos 1–8), the second reaction contained a pool of 10 forward and 10 reverse oligonucleotides (oligos 9–18), and the third reaction contained a pool of 12 forward and 12 reverse oligonucleotides (oligos 19–30), all of which contain a double randomized NNN NNN codon at its center such that the two amino acids are simultaneously mutated (but only to synonymous mutations). PCR amplifications for each mutagenesis pool of SMN1 exon 7 were performed in 50-μl reactions containing: 50 ng of the plasmid based pCi SMN1 mini-gene template, 5 units of Pfu Ultra-High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene); 400 μm dNTPs; 1× Pfu Ultra-High Fidelity reaction buffer; and 0.03 μm of each complementary mutant primer pair. Primer extension and PCR amplification reactions were carried out by: 10 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 16 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and a final step of 10 min at 72 °C. The 50-μl PCR products were digested with 30 units of DpnI for 3 h at 37 °C to remove the methylated template plasmid. 5 μl of the digestion reaction was used for transformation of DH5α cells and plated onto LB-agar plates (100 μg/ml of ampicillin). At this point, a plasmid library containing saturated site-directed mutated target regions is generated. Colonies were selected and suspended in 5 ml of LB medium (100 μg/ml of ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. 15% glycerol stocks were created, and larger 200-ml flasks of LB medium (100 μg/ml of ampicillin) were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Plasmid libraries were purified from the large cultures using the Nucleobond Midi-prep Purification system. Plasmid libraries were then combined in equal molar amounts to make one master library. The approach for the generation of sequencing libraries is outlined in Fig. 1. To generate a library of spliced mRNAs, HeLa cells at ∼80% confluence in 10-cm plates were transfected with 22 μg of the master plasmid library using Lipofectamine 2000 for 6 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C. After 6 h, the Lipofectamine medium was removed and medium-containing serum was added. The cells were incubated another 18 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was purified from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and treated with DNase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription using SuperScript II reverse polymerase (Invitrogen) was carried out using library plasmid-specific primers (pCI backbone forward primer: GCTAACGCAGTCAGTGCTTC; pCI backbone reverse primer: GTATCTTATCATGTCTGCTCG) and 4 μg of RNA. The cDNA reaction was then cleaned up using a Qiagen PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 0.5 μg of purified cDNA was then amplified using primers specific to exon 6 and exon 8 (output cDNA forward primer: CCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCATGAGTGGCTATCATACTGGC; output cDNA reverse primer: CCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCTGTCATTTAGTGCTGCTCTATGC; Seq. tail forward primer: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT; Seq. tail reverse primer: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT) that also had tails containing the initial segment of Illumina-specific sequencing primers in a 50-μl reaction containing 400 nm dNTPs using proofreading DNA polymerase. PCR amplification reactions were carried out by: 5 min denaturation at 95 °C, 3 cycles of: 15 s denaturing at 95 °C, 30 s primer annealing at 55 °C, 20 s of extension at 72 °C, and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. This initial PCR library amplification was then run out on a 1.5% agarose gel to remove exon exclusion events and gel purified using a Qiagen Gel extraction kit. The purified PCR product was then amplified again for 12 cycles using the same PCR cycle conditions as described above, except using a full-length Illumina sequencing primer. The products of this reaction were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and the PCR product band was purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This final library was analyzed for quality on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, quantified using a Nanodrop (ND-1000 Thermo), and then diluted to 10 nm and submitted for sequencing on the Illumina Hi-seq platform. The spliced mRNA pool is referred to as the “output pool.” To generate an equivalent sequencing library of the expression plasmid pool, the same procedure (minus transfection and RNA purification) was carried on the plasmid pool using primers specific to introns 6 and 7 (input DNA forward primer: CCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGCTATTTTTTTTAACTTCCTTTATTTTC; input DNA reverse primer: CCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCTGTAAGATTCACTTTCATAATGCTG). The expression plasmid pool is referred to as the “input pool.” PCR analysis of SMN exon 7 mutants for validation and comparison of our sequencing experiment was carried out using primers as previously described (11.Geib T. Hertel K.J. Restoration of full-length SMN promoted by adenoviral vectors expressing RNA antisense oligonucleotides embedded in U7 snRNAs.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17.Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). We received 54,780,073 single-end reads of 100 nt from our sequencing run. Using Bowtie these reads were aligned to a custom index made from the genomic segment of SMN1 spanning exons 6 to 8 (14.Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14993) Google Scholar), from the spliced mRNA sequence spanning exons 6, 7, and 8, and from all library mutants made. Thus, the alignment index contained an entry for each library mutation to control for possible mutations or sequencing errors. Only reads that contained the wild-type sequence or library mutations were aligned. Approximately three fourths of the reads were aligned to the custom index. Another 8% of the reads corresponded to exon exclusion reads, and the remaining reads did not align. The total read count for each library mutation was used to determine the relative representation of each mutation within in the sequenced input and output pools. To evaluate changes in exon 7 inclusion, we calculated WT-normalized differences in mutant output and input ratios according to “fitness index” = (output/WT output)/(input/WT input). These ratios are defined as the fitness index. The average fitness index for a position is the average of the fitness indices for all mutations at that position. For statistical analysis we compared the output and input reads for each mutation to the non-mutated reads using a Fisher's Exact test and determined the significance using a Bonferroni correction for comparison between the 138 mutations. In addition to the Fisher's Exact test, we applied a biological cutoff for significance of the fitness index value. Twenty percent exon 7 inclusion is consistent with mRNA expression reports for SMA type I. An observable difference in the exon inclusion phenotypes between SMA types I and III has been reported (12.Madocsai C. Lim S.R. Geib T. Lam B.J. Hertel K.J.

In SMA type III there is ∼70% inclusion of exon 7 compared with WT levels, versus the 20% observed in type I. Therefore, we set our biological significance cutoff at this 70% value. Our analysis relied on the circumstantially validated assumptions that all plasmids transfect and transcribe with the same efficiency and that the resulting RNAs are similarly stable in HeLa cells. A decrease in transcription or transcriptional pausing causing a loss of reads is unlikely, as significant numbers of reads were generated and analyzed corresponding to each mutation (average cDNA reads 209,891/mutation, median: 39,288). This suggests that each mutation was represented within the input plasmid pool, successfully transfected, and successfully expressed. The lowest read count observed for a single mutant was 30 output reads for the mutations in positions 24 and 27. This position is known for being a splicing regulator (Tra2-β1/SRSF10) binding site, suggesting that the loss in reads was due to the loss of an enhancer binding sequence (18.Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Htra2-β 1 stimulates an exonic splicing enhancer and can restore full-length SMN expression to survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Consistently, low output reads correlated with a loss of a known positive splicing regulator, the gain of a negative splicing regulator, or increasing known local RNA secondary structures. It is not known whether mRNAs generated from the reporter plasmids are translated, and therefore are potential NMD targets. However, because all exon 7 mutations are located within 50 nt of the last exon-exon junction, it is unlikely that the resulting mRNA would be targeted by NMD (19.Maquat L.E. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: splicing, translation and mRNP dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). It is also unknown whether the stability of exon 7 included mRNAs generated from the mini-gene constructs is different from mRNAs lacking exon 7. The position of SMN1 exon 7 was identified through the UCSC Genome Browser. The UCSC Table Browser was then used to download the PhyloP Score by position across the exon (position chr5: 70,247,768 to 70,247,821) using the Comparative Genomics Group and the Conservation Track in the Vertebrate 46 way alignment table SMN1. PhyloP conservation scores allow a measure of conservation by position. Multiple alignment data were generated by taking this same genomic position into the Esembl! database (GRCh37) and selecting the comparative genomics (text option) tool for all 36 eutherian mammals in the Ensembl! Genome Sequence Viewer. This was also used to validate intron/exon architecture. Intron/exon architecture similarity was determined through sequence analysis using the comparative genomics tool. Organisms with similar exon length (±6 nt) and splice site sequences were compared. Species that exhibit similar exon/intron architecture were kept in the alignment. Species exhibiting differing exon/intron architecture were excluded from the alignment. In the case of the SMN alignment, all primates were included in the intron/exon architecture filter, however, this excluded multiple species from rodents to the alpaca. The same approach was used for filtering SNP-based species alignments. Synonymous SNPs associated with human disease were taken from the literature and from the Entrez dbSNP web browser and added to synonymous human SNPs downloaded using the Ensembl! PerlAPI (20.Sauna Z.E. Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Understanding the contribution of synonymous mutations to human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The 40 disease associated SNPs and 40 Ensembl! SNPs were randomly selected and analyzed using the Ensembl! genome browser comparative genomics alignment tools as was done for the SMN exon analysis. Eighty more human synonymous SNPs from non-coding exons, plus an additional 82 synonymous SNPs with a single exon were also acquired using the Ensembl! PerlAPI and analyzed in the same manner (supplemental Table S1). Filtered organisms were compared by sequence conservation in an 11-nucleotide window around the SNP position. The numbers of the classified putative splice altering SNPs and neutral SNPs were compared using a χ2 test of independence. To determine the influence of synonymous mutations on exon inclusion, we used the well studied SMN1 mini-gene, spanning exons 6–8 (13.Lim S.R. Hertel K.J.

Each set of two neighboring codons in exon 7 was mutated to every possible combination of silent mutations within the context of a hexamer, a minimal binding platform for splicing regulatory proteins (Fig. 1A) (22.Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. SR Proteins.Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Chichester2005Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting library of plasmids was transfected into HeLa cells and plasmid-specific mRNAs were analyzed by deep sequencing (Fig. 1B). Relative exon inclusion indexes were determined by calculating the abundance of mutations present in the exon 7-included mRNA population, normalized to the abundance in the input plasmid control. Presumably, differences in inclusion indexes reflect differences in exon 7 inclusion levels (Table 1). To test this assumption a small number of mutants (Table 2 and Fig. 2) were tested individually for exon inclusion levels using standard RT-PCR approaches. The near linear relationship between the different experimental approaches demonstrate that changes in the fitness indexes are largely driven by altered pre-mRNA splicing efficiencies. If a mutation was observed more frequently in the spliced mRNA pool than the input plasmid pool, that mutation was considered to be beneficial to exon inclusion. If a mutation was observed less frequently in the spliced mRNA pool compared with the input plasmid pool, that mutation was considered to be inhibitory to exon inclusion.TABLE 1All mutations analyzed Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Validated mutationsMutation and positionInclusion index valueLog inclusion index valuePreviously analyzed % inclusion for exon 7CitationsWild-type, no mutations1075–100%11.Geib T.

The present study was designed to examine the protective effect of date palm pollen (DPP) extract on thyroid disorder-induced testicular dysfunction. Rats were divided into six groups. Group I was normal control. Group II received oral DPP extract (150 mg kg(-1)), group III (hyperthyroid group) received intraperitoneal injection of L-thyroxine (L-T4, 300 μg kg(-1); i.p.), group IV received L-T4 plus DPP extract, group V (hypothyroid group) received propylthiouracil (PTU, 10 mg kg(-1); i.p.) and group VI received PTU plus DPP extract. All treatments were given every day for 56 days. L-T4 or PTU lowered genital sex organs weight, sperm count and motility, serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone (T), testicular function markers and activities of testicular 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). Moreover, L-T4 or PTU increased estradiol (E2) serum level, testicular oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptotic markers. Morphometric and histopathologic studies backed these observations. Treatment with DPP extract prevented LT4- or PTU induced changes. In addition, supplementation of DPP extract to normal rats augmented sperm count and motility, serum levels of LH, T and E2 paralleled with increased activities of 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD as well as testicular antioxidant status. These results provide evidence that DPP extract may have potential protective effects on testicular dysfunction induced by altered thyroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2177303033,"The melanocortin-2 (MC2) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates responses to ACTH. The MC2 receptor acts in concert with the MC2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) that is absolutely required for ACTH binding and signaling. MRAP has a single transmembrane domain and forms a highly unusual antiparallel homodimer that is stably associated with MC2 receptors at the plasma membrane. Despite the physiological importance of the interaction between the MC2 receptor and MRAP, there is little understanding of how the accessory protein works. The dual topology of MRAP has made it impossible to determine whether highly conserved and necessary regions of MRAP are required on the intracellular or extracellular face of the plasma membrane. The strategy used here was to fix the orientation of two antiparallel MRAP molecules and then introduce inactivating mutations on one side of the membrane or the other. This was achieved by engineering proteins containing tandem copies of MRAP fused to the amino terminus of the MC2 receptor. The data firmly establish that only the extracellular amino terminus (Nout) copy of MRAP, oriented with critical segments on the extracellular side of the membrane, is essential. The transmembrane domain of MRAP is also required in only the Nout orientation. Finally, activity of MRAP-MRAP-MC2-receptor fusion proteins with inactivating mutations in either MRAP or the receptor was rescued by co-expression of free wild-type MRAP or free wild-type receptor.

Thigh muscle strength, postural stability, and joint position sense were compared in 48 patients with acute ACL tears and in 28 with chronic ACL tears. Maximal torque (60°/sec) of the quadriceps and hamstring was evaluated using an isokinetic testing device. Postural stability was determined from the anterior-posterior (APSI), medial-lateral (MLSI), and overall (OSI) stability indices using stabilometry. Joint position sense was also tested by reproduction of passive positioning (RPP). Muscle strengths and stability indices on both the involved and uninvolved sides were similar in the acute and chronic ACL tear groups. RPP on the involved side was significantly greater in the chronic than in the acute ACL tear group (7.8° vs. 5.6°, P = 0.041). Two of three stability indices (APSI, OSI) and RPP were significantly greater on the involved than the uninvolved side in the chronic ACL tear group."
https://openalex.org/W2270310143,"Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects livers. In this paper, we formulate a hepatitis B model to study the transmission dynamics of hepatitis B in Xinjiang, China. The epidemic model involves an exponential birth rate and vertical transmission. For a better understanding of HBV transmission dynamics, we analyze the dynamic behavior of the model. The modified reproductive number σ is obtained. When σ < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, when σ > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and the disease is uniformly persistent. In the simulation, parameters are chosen to fit public data in Xinjiang. The simulation indicates that the cumulated HBV infection number in Xinjiang will attain about 600,000 cases unless there are stronger or more effective control measures by the end of 2017. Sensitive analysis results show that enhancing the vaccination rate for newborns in Xinjiang is very effective to stop the transmission of HBV. Hence, we recommend that all infants in Xinjiang receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth."
https://openalex.org/W2237696852,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections contributes to a substantial proportion of liver disease worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and virological features of HBV-HCV co-infection.Demographic data were collected for 3238 high-risk people from an HCV-endemic region in China. Laboratory tests included HCV antibody and HBV serological markers, liver function tests, and routine blood analysis. Anti-HCV positive samples were analyzed for HCV RNA levels and subgenotypes. HBsAg-positive samples were tested for HBV DNA.A total of 1468 patients had chronic HCV and/or HBV infections. Among them, 1200 individuals were classified as HCV mono-infected, 161 were classified as HBV mono-infected, and 107 were classified as co-infected. The HBV-HCV co-infected patients not only had a lower HBV DNA positive rate compared to HBV mono-infected patients (84.1% versus 94.4%, respectively; P < 0.001). The median HCV RNA levels in HBV-HCV co-infected patients were significantly lower than those in the HCV mono-infected patients (1.18[Interquartile range (IQR) 0-5.57] versus 5.87[IQR, 3.54-6.71] Log10 IU/mL, respectively; P < 0.001). Furthermore, co-infected patients were less likely to have detectable HCV RNA levels than HCV mono-infected patients (23.4% versus 56.5%, respectively; P < 0.001). Those HBV-HCV co-infected patients had significantly lower median HBV DNA levels than those mono-infected with HBV (1.97[IQR, 1.3-3.43] versus 3.06[IQR, 2-4.28] Log10 IU/mL, respectively; P < 0.001). The HBV-HCV co-infection group had higher ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, APRI and FIB-4 levels, but lower ALB and total platelet compared to the HBV mono-infection group, and similar to that of the HCV mono-infected group.These results suggest that co-infection with HCV and HBV inhibits the replication of both viruses. The serologic results of HBV-HCV co-infection in patients suggests more liver injury compared to HBV mono-infected patients, but is similar to HCV mono-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2342247635,"Cold-sensitive nerve terminals (CSNTs) encode steady temperatures with regular, rhythmic temperature-dependent firing patterns that range from irregular tonic firing to regular bursting (static response). During abrupt temperature changes, CSNTs show a dynamic response, transiently increasing their firing frequency as temperature decreases and silencing when the temperature increases (dynamic response). To date, mathematical models that simulate the static response are based on two depolarizing/repolarizing pairs of membrane ionic conductance (slow and fast kinetics). However, these models fail to reproduce the dynamic response of CSNTs to rapid changes in temperature and notoriously they lack a specific cold-activated conductance such as the TRPM8 channel. We developed a model that includes TRPM8 as a temperature-dependent conductance with a calcium-dependent desensitization. We show by computer simulations that it appropriately reproduces the dynamic response of CSNTs from mouse cornea, while preserving their static response behavior. In this model, the TRPM8 conductance is essential to display a dynamic response. In agreement with experimental results, TRPM8 is also needed for the ongoing activity in the absence of stimulus (i.e. neutral skin temperature). Free parameters of the model were adjusted by an evolutionary optimization algorithm, allowing us to find different solutions. We present a family of possible parameters that reproduce the behavior of CSNTs under different temperature protocols. The detection of temperature gradients is associated to a homeostatic mechanism supported by the calcium-dependent desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2152001581,"Bleaching episodes caused by increasing seawater temperatures may induce mass coral mortality and are regarded as one of the biggest threats to coral reef ecosystems worldwide. The current consensus is that this phenomenon results from enhanced production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodinium. Here, the responses of two important antioxidant defence components, the host coenzyme Q (CoQ) and symbiont plastoquinone (PQ) pools, are investigated for the first time in colonies of the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora, during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools, together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: (i) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment, after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; (ii) by contrast, an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress, prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals, and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis. This study adds to a growing body of work that indicates host cellular responses may precede the bleaching process and symbiont dysfunction."

Methods An open cohort was established from September 2009 to April 2012. Participants were followed up with every three to four months after recruitment and for thirty-one months in total. Chi-square tests were used to compare demographic and behavioral characteristics between participants who were followed up with and those lost to follow up. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine demographic and behavioral associations with HIV and syphilis incidence. Results 69.7% (699/1,003) of the participants finished at least two follow-up surveys during the study period. Variables which corresponded to increased loss to follow-up included younger age, less education, non-identification of homosexual identity, and migrant status. A total of 1,045 person-years (PYs) and 1,016.4 PYs were followed up for HIV and syphilis incidence estimation, respectively. The HIV incidence was 5.9 per 100 PYs and 7.8 per 100 PYs for syphilis. The predictors for the high HIV incidence included unsafe anal sex, sex after drinking alcohol and STI infection. Conclusion HIV incidence increased rapidly within the cohort, but syphilis incidence remained stable and decreased. More research is needed to provide multi-pronged HIV prevention interventions among MSM in order to reduce the increasing burden of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in China."

Socio-demographic information was collected using a structured questionnaire, and medical records from the local hospitals were used to determine the final diagnosis of birth defects. Poisson regression analysis was performed to assess the association between maternal lifestyles during pregnancy and the burden of birth defects, while adjusting for potential confounders.We sampled 29098 infants, of whom 629 (i.e. 216.17 per 10000) were observed to have congenital defects. Cardiovascular system defects (77.32 per 10000) were found to be the most common. Mothers who had ever consumed alcohol during pregnancy were found to have infants with a higher prevalence of some categories of birth defects, including nervous system (Prevalence Rate Ratio, PRR:14.67, 95% CI: 1.94, 110.92), cardiovascular system (PRR:3.22, 95% CI: 1.02, 10.16) and oral clefts (PRR:9.02, 95% CI: 2.08, 39.10) in contrast to infants of mothers without any alcohol consumption. Maternal passive smoking during pregnancy lead to the increased burden of malformations of eye, ear, face and neck (PRR:1.95, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.33), cardiovascular system (PRR:1.70, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.31) and respiratory system (PRR:9.94, 95% CI: 2.37, 41.76) in their newborns. Further, tea or coffee consumption during pregnancy was positively correlated with the burden of specific birth defects, such as cardiovascular system (PRR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.33, 4.46) and genital organs (PRR:14.72, 95% CI: 1.87, 116.11) among infants.The prevalence of birth defects was high in Shaanxi province of Northwest China. The unhealthy lifestyles of mothers during pregnancy may increase the prevalence of congenital malformations. These findings in future may have some important implications for prevention of birth defects in Northwest China."

Thiomonas (Tm.) bacteria are found ubiquitously in AMD and can withstand these extreme conditions, in part because they are able to oxidize arsenite. In order to further improve our knowledge concerning the adaptive capacities of these bacteria, we sequenced and assembled the genome of six isolates derived from the Carnoulès AMD, and compared them to the genomes of Tm. arsenitoxydans 3As (isolated from the same site) and Tm. intermedia K12 (isolated from a sewage pipe). A detailed analysis of the Tm. sp. CB2 genome revealed various rearrangements had occurred in comparison to what was observed in 3As and K12 and over 20 genomic islands (GEIs) were found in each of these three genomes. We performed a detailed comparison of the two arsenic-related islands found in CB2, carrying the genes required for arsenite oxidation and As resistance, with those found in K12, 3As, and five other Thiomonas strains also isolated from Carnoulès (CB1, CB3, CB6, ACO3 and ACO7). Our results suggest that these arsenic-related islands have evolved differentially in these closely related Thiomonas strains, leading to divergent capacities to survive in As rich environments."
https://openalex.org/W2108516132,"Species can respond to climate change by tracking appropriate environmental conditions in space, resulting in a range shift. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can help forecast such range shift responses. For few species, both correlative and mechanistic SDMs were built, but allis shad (Alosa alosa), an endangered anadromous fish species, is one of them. The main purpose of this study was to provide a framework for joint analyses of correlative and mechanistic SDMs projections in order to strengthen conservation measures for species of conservation concern. Guidelines for joint representation and subsequent interpretation of models outputs were defined and applied. The present joint analysis was based on the novel mechanistic model GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution) which was parameterized on allis shad and then used to predict its future distribution along the European Atlantic coast under different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then used a correlative SDM for this species to forecast its distribution across the same geographic area and under the same climate change scenarios. First, projections from correlative and mechanistic models provided congruent trends in probability of habitat suitability and population dynamics. This agreement was preferentially interpreted as referring to the species vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could not be accordingly listed as a major threat for allis shad. The congruence in predicted range limits between SDMs projections was the next point of interest. The difference, when noticed, required to deepen our understanding of the niche modelled by each approach. In this respect, the relative position of the northern range limit between the two methods strongly suggested here that a key biological process related to intraspecific variability was potentially lacking in the mechanistic SDM. Based on our knowledge, we hypothesized that local adaptations to cold temperatures deserved more attention in terms of modelling, but further in conservation planning as well."

The driving simulator evaluated reaction times to high and low contrast peripheral divided attention stimuli presented while negotiating a winding country road, with central driving task performance assessed as ""curve coherence"". Drivers with MVC during follow-up were identified from Department of Motor Vehicle records.Survival models were used to evaluate the ability of driving simulator and UFOV to predict MVC over time, adjusting for potential confounding factors.Mean age at baseline was 64.5 ± 12.6 years. 11 of 117 (9.4%) drivers had a MVC during follow-up. In the multivariable models, low contrast reaction time was significantly predictive of MVC, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.19 per 1 SD slower reaction time (95% CI, 1.30 to 3.69; P = 0.003). UFOV divided attention was also significantly predictive of MVC with a HR of 1.98 per 1 SD worse (95% CI, 1.10 to 3.57; P = 0.022). Global SAP visual field indices in the better or worse eye were not predictive of MVC. The longitudinal model including driving simulator performance was a better predictor of MVC compared to UFOV (R2 = 0.41 vs R2 = 0.18).Longitudinal divided attention metrics on the UFOV test and during simulated driving were significantly predictive of risk of MVC in glaucoma patients. These findings may help improve the understanding of factors associated with driving impairment related to glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2337338195,"Maternal and perinatal mortality remain a challenge in resource-limited countries, particularly among the rural poor. To save lives at birth health facility delivery is recommended. However, increasing coverage of institutional deliveries may not translate into mortality reduction if shortage of qualified staff and lack of enabling working conditions affect quality of services. In Tanzania childbirth care is available in all facilities; yet maternal and newborn mortality are high. The study aimed to assess in a high facility density rural context whether a health system organization with fewer delivery sites is feasible in terms of population access.Data on health facilities' location, staffing and delivery caseload were examined in Ludewa and Iringa Districts, Southern Tanzania. Geospatial raster and network analysis were performed to estimate access to obstetric services in walking time. The present geographical accessibility was compared to a theoretical scenario with a 40% reduction of delivery sites.About half of first-line health facilities had insufficient staff to offer full-time obstetric services (45.7% in Iringa and 78.8% in Ludewa District). Yearly delivery caseload at first-line health facilities was low, with less than 100 deliveries in 48/70 and 43/52 facilities in Iringa and Ludewa District respectively. Wide geographical overlaps of facility catchment areas were observed. In Iringa 54% of the population was within 1-hour walking distance from the nearest facility and 87.8% within 2 hours, in Ludewa, the percentages were 39.9% and 82.3%. With a 40% reduction of delivery sites, approximately 80% of population will still be within 2 hours' walking time.Our findings from spatial modelling in a high facility density context indicate that reducing delivery sites by 40% will decrease population access within 2 hours by 7%. Focused efforts on fewer delivery sites might assist strengthening delivery services in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W1913401155,"It is unclear whether the benefits that some patients derive from complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) are related to the therapies recommended or to the consultation process as some CIM provider visits are more involved than conventional medical visits. Many patients with gastrointestinal conditions seek out CIM therapies, and prior work has demonstrated that the quality of the patient-provider interaction can improve health outcomes in irritable bowel syndrome, however, the impact of this interaction on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is unknown. We aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of conducting a 2 x 2 factorial design study preliminarily exploring the impact of the patient-provider interaction, and the effect of an over-the-counter homeopathic product, Acidil, on symptoms and health-related quality of life in subjects with GERD.24 subjects with GERD-related symptoms were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive 1) either a standard visit based on an empathic conventional primary care evaluation or an expanded visit with questions modeled after a CIM consultation and 2) either Acidil or placebo for two weeks. Subjects completed a daily GERD symptom diary and additional measures of symptom severity and health-related quality of life.There was no significant difference in GERD symptom severity between the Acidil and placebo groups from baseline to follow-up (p = 0.41), however, subjects who received the expanded visit were significantly more likely to report a 50% or greater improvement in symptom severity compared to subjects who received the standard visit (p = 0.01). Total consultation length, perceived empathy, and baseline beliefs in CIM were not associated with treatment outcomes.An expanded patient-provider visit resulted in greater GERD symptom improvement than a standard empathic medical visit.

The study assessed whether juvenile redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (initial weight 0.99 ± 0.03 g) was able to compensate for feeding restriction at different temperatures (23 ± 1, 27 ± 1 and 31 ± 1 ° C). Hyperphagia, food utilization efficiency, energetic reserves, and hepatopancreas structure were analyzed. Three temperatures and two feeding regimes (DF-daily fed throughout the experiment and CF- 4 days food deprivation followed by 4 days of feeding, intermittently) were tested. The restriction period was from day 1 to 45, and the recovery period was from day 45 to 90. The previously restricted crayfish held at 23, 27, and 31 ± 1 ° C displayed complete body weight catch-up through compensatory growth following the restriction period with depressed growth. The mechanisms that might explain this response were higher feed intake (hyperphagia), and increased food utilization efficiency. Hepatopancreatic lipids were used as a metabolic fuel and hepatosomatic index was reduced in the previously restricted crayfish, but recovery at the same level of unrestricted crayfish occurred after the shift to daily feeding. The highest temperature affected adversely growth, feed intake, food efficiency, and metabolism of crayfish, whereas the lowest temperature and feeding restriction induced a more efficient growth of the crayfish."
https://openalex.org/W1941673548,"Cultured adipocytes (3T3-L1) produce large amounts of 3C fragments; largely lactate, depending on medium glucose levels. Increased glycolysis has been observed also in vivo in different sites of rat white adipose tissue. We investigated whether fructose can substitute glucose as source of lactate, and, especially whether the glycerol released to the medium was of lipolytic or glycolytic origin. Fructose conversion to lactate and glycerol was lower than that of glucose. The fast exhaustion of medium glucose was unrelated to significant changes in lipid storage. Fructose inhibited to a higher degree than glucose the expression of lipogenic enzymes. When both hexoses were present, the effects of fructose on gene expression prevailed over those of glucose. Adipocytes expressed fructokinase, but not aldolase b. Substantive release of glycerol accompanied lactate when fructose was the substrate. The mass of cell triacylglycerol (and its lack of change) could not justify the comparatively higher amount of glycerol released. Consequently, most of this glycerol should be derived from the glycolytic pathway, since its lipolytic origin could not be (quantitatively) sustained. Proportionally (with respect to lactate plus glycerol), more glycerol was produced from fructose than from glucose, which suggests that part of fructose was catabolized by the alternate (hepatic) fructose pathway. Earlier described adipose glycerophophatase activity may help explain the glycolytic origin of most of the glycerol. However, no gene is known for this enzyme in mammals, which suggests that this function may be carried out by one of the known phosphatases in the tissue. Break up of glycerol-3P to yield glycerol, may be a limiting factor for the synthesis of triacylglycerols through control of glycerol-3P availability. A phosphatase pathway such as that described may have a potential regulatory function, and explain the production of glycerol by adipocytes in the absence of lipolytic stimulation."

Despite the progress in understanding the significance of DISC1 at neural development, the mechanisms underlying DISC1 regulation of synaptic functions remain elusive. Because alterations in the cortical GABA system have been strongly linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, one potential target of DISC1 that is critically involved in the regulation of cognition and emotion is the GABAA receptor (GABAAR). We found that cellular knockdown of DISC1 significantly reduced GABAAR-mediated synaptic and whole-cell current, whereas overexpression of wild-type DISC1, but not the C-terminal-truncated DISC1 (a schizophrenia-related mutant), significantly increased GABAAR currents in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex. These effects were accompanied by DISC1-induced changes in surface GABAAR expression. Moreover, the regulation of GABAARs by DISC1 knockdown or overexpression depends on the microtubule motor protein kinesin 1 (KIF5). Our results suggest that DISC1 exerts an important effect on GABAergic inhibitory transmission by regulating KIF5/microtubule-based GABAAR trafficking in the cortex.

In the present study, the effects of reef density were assessed for fish communities and sizes of economically valuable Lutjanus campechanus 13 km off Port Mansfield, Texas, at a reef composed of more than 4000 concrete culverts. The study spanned from May to June in 2013 and 2014, and sites sampled included natural reefs, bare areas, and varying culvert patch density categories, ranging from 1–190 culverts. Abundances of adults and species evenness of juvenile populations differed between the years. Fish communities did not significantly differ among density categories; however, highest species richness and total abundances were observed at intermediate culvert densities and at natural reefs. Whereas the abundance of L. campechanus did not differ among density categories, mean total lengths of L. campechanus were greatest at the lower density. Our findings suggest that reefs should be deployed with intermediate patch density of 71–120 culverts in a 30-m radius to yield the highest fish abundances."
https://openalex.org/W2172855941,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPK) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the reversible phosphotransfer of γ-phosphates between di- and triphosphonucleosides. NDPK-D (Nm23-H4) is the only member of the NDPK family with a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Despite the high expression of NDPK-D in the developing central nervous system, its function remains to be determined. In this study, we show that NDPK-D knockdown induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells as well as in mouse cortex, suggesting that NDPK-D is required for neuronal survival. We identified NDPK-D as a binding partner of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, SIRT1, by yeast two-hybrid screening. NDPK-D co-localized with SIRT1, and the association of these molecules was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Inhibition of SIRT1 increases the acetylation of NDPK-D. Overexpression of NDPK-D along with SIRT1, or mutation in the acetylated lysine residues in NDPK-D, increases its nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, the NDPK-D acetylation-mimic mutant increased apoptosis in N1E-115 cells. Our data demonstrate that acetylation regulates the shuttling of NDPK-D between nucleus and cytoplasm, and increased acetylation of NDPK-D causes apoptosis."

Management of incontinence is currently suboptimal, especially in elderly patients. To optimise the provision of incontinence care a global optimum continence service specification (OCSS) was developed. The current study evaluates the costs and effects of implementing this OCSS for community-dwelling patients older than 65 years with four or more chronic diseases in the Netherlands.A decision analytic model was developed comparing the current care pathway for urinary incontinence in the Netherlands with the pathway as described in the OCSS. The new care strategy was operationalised as the appointment of a continence nurse specialist (NS) located with the general practitioner (GP). This was assumed to increase case detection and to include initial assessment and treatment by the NS. The analysis used a societal perspective, including medical costs, containment products (out-of-pocket and paid by insurer), home care, informal care, and implementation costs.With the new care strategy a QALY gain of 0.005 per patient is achieved while saving €402 per patient over a 3 year period from a societal perspective. In interpreting these findings it is important to realise that many patients are undetected, even in the new care situation (36%), or receive care for containment only. In both of these groups no health gains were achieved.Implementing the OCSS in the Netherlands by locating a NS in the GP practice is likely to reduce incontinence, improve quality of life, and reduce costs. Furthermore, the study also highlighted that various areas of the continence care process lack data, which would be valuable to collect through the introduction of the NS in a study setting."

Translocation of host materials into the pathogenic vacuole (termed ‘inclusion’) may facilitate nutrient acquisition and various organelles have been observed within the inclusion, including lipid droplets, peroxisomes, multivesicular body components, and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, few of these processes have been documented in living cells. Here, we survey the localization of a broad panel of subcellular elements and find ER, mitochondria, and inclusion membranes within the inclusion lumen of fixed cells. However, we see little evidence of intraluminal localization of these organelles in live inclusions. Using time-lapse video microscopy we document ER marker translocation into the inclusion lumen during chemical fixation. These intra-inclusion ER elements resist a variety of post-fixation manipulations and are detectable via immunofluorescence microscopy. We speculate that the localization of a subset of organelles may be exaggerated during fixation. Finally, we find similar structures within the pathogenic vacuole of Coxiella burnetti infected cells, suggesting that fixation-induced translocation of cellular materials may occur into the vacuole of a range of intracellular pathogens."

The study population was sepsis-related ALI patients. The primary outcome of the current study was the same as in the original trial, 60-day in-hospital mortality, defined as death before hospital discharge, censored 60 days after enrollment. Discrimination of APACHE III was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) with its 95% CI. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was used to assess the calibration of APACHE III. The Brier score was reported to represent the overall performance of APACHE III in predicting outcome.A total of 745 patients were included in the study, including 540 survivors and 205 non-survivors. Non-survivors were significantly older than survivors (59.71 ± 16.17 vs 52.00 ± 15.92 years, p < 0.001). The primary causes of ALI were also different between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.017). Survivors were more likely to have the cause of sepsis than non-survivors (21.2% vs. 15.1%). APACHE III score was higher in non-survivors than in survivors (106.72 ± 27.30 vs. 88.42 ± 26.86; p < 0.001). Discrimination of APACHE III to predict mortality in ALI patients was moderate with an AUC of 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.73).this study for the first time validated the discrimination of APACHE III in sepsis associated ALI patients. The result shows that APACHE III score has moderate predictive value for in-hospital mortality among adults with sepsis-associated acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2191143578,"Habitat loss causes population declines, but the mechanisms are rarely known. In the European Boreal Zone, loss of old forest due to intensive forestry is suspected to cause declines in forest-dwelling raptors by reducing their breeding performance. We studied the boreal breeding habitat and habitat-associated breeding performance of the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus). We combined long-term Finnish bird-of-prey data with multi-source national forest inventory data at various distances (100-4000 m) around the hawk nests. We found that breeding success of the goshawk was best explained by the habitat within a 2000-m radius around the nests; breeding was more successful with increasing proportions of old spruce forest and water, and decreasing proportions of young thinning forest. None of the habitat variables affected significantly the breeding success of the common buzzard or the honey buzzard, or the brood size of any of the species. The amount of old spruce forest decreased both around goshawk and common buzzard nests and throughout southern Finland in 1992-2010. In contrast, the area of young forest increased in southern Finland but not around hawk nests. We emphasize the importance of studying habitats at several spatial and temporal scales to determine the relevant species-specific scale and to detect environmental changes. Further effort is needed to reconcile the socioeconomic and ecological functions of forests and habitat requirements of old forest specialists."
https://openalex.org/W2339280267,"Background Estrogen is involved in neuron plasticity and can promote neuronal survival in stroke. Its actions are mostly exerted via estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Previous animal studies have shown that ERα is upregulated by DNA demethylation following ischemic injury. This study investigated the methylation levels in the ERα promoter in the peripheral blood of ischemic stroke patients. Methods The study included 201 ischemic stroke patients, and 217 age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. The quantitative methylation level in the 14 CpG sites of the ERα promoter was measured by pyrosequencing in each participant. Multivariate regression model was used to adjust for stroke traditional risk factors. Stroke subtypes and sex-specific analysis were also conducted. Results The results demonstrated that the stroke cases had a lower ERα methylation level than controls in all 14 CpG sites, and site13 and site14 had significant adjusted p-values of 0.035 and 0.026, respectively. Stroke subtypes analysis showed that large-artery atherosclerosis and cardio-embolic subtypes had significantly lower methylation levels than the healthy controls at CpG site5, site9, site12, site13 and site14 with adjusted p = 0.039, 0.009, 0.025, 0.046 and 0.027 respectively. However, the methylation level for the patients with small vessel subtype was not significant. We combined the methylation data from the above five sites for further sex-specific analysis. The results showed that the significant association only existed in women (adjusted p = 0.011), but not in men (adjusted p = 0.300). Conclusions Female stroke cases have lower ERα methylation levels than those in the controls, especially in large-artery and cardio-embolic stroke subtypes. The study implies that women suffering from ischemic stroke of specific subtype may undergo different protective mechanisms to reduce the brain injury."

Then pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed. Particularly, VEGF genes and the VEGF signaling pathway were analyzed. The sub-network was constructed followed by functional enrichment analysis.Total 1666 up-regulated and 1542 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the pathways associated with cancer. VEGFA and VEGFB were found to be the initiating factor of VEGF signaling pathway. In addition, in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGFA and VEGFB associated sub-network, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), fibronectin 1 (FN1), transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were found to interact with at least two of the three hub genes. The DEGs in this sub-network were mainly enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to cell proliferation.EGFR, KDR, FN1, TGFBI and PCNA may interact with VEGFA to play important roles in NSCLC tumorigenesis.

True LTFU correlated significantly with low CD4 count and high plasma viral load, but not history of IDU.Imprisonment is a major cause of disengagement from HIV care among patients with a history of IDU."
https://openalex.org/W2179585078,"Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 strains belonging to phylotype IIB, sequevars 1 and 2 (IIB-1&2) cause brown rot of potato in temperate climates, and are quarantined pathogens in Canada and Europe. Since these strains are not established in the U.S. and because of their potential risk to the potato industry, the U.S. government has listed them as select agents. Cultivated geraniums are also a host and have the potential to spread the pathogen through trade, and its extracts strongly inhibits DNA-based detection methods. We designed four primer and probe sets for an improved qPCR method that targets stable regions of DNA. RsSA1 and RsSA2 recognize IIB-1&2 strains, RsII recognizes the current phylotype II (the newly proposed R. solanacearum species) strains (and a non-plant associated R. mannitolilytica), and Cox1 recognizes eight plant species including major hosts of R. solanacearum such as potato, tomato and cultivated geranium as an internal plant control. We multiplexed the RsSA2 with the RsII and Cox1 sets to provide two layers of detection of a positive IIB-1&2 sample, and to validate plant extracts and qPCR reactions. The TaqMan-based uniplex and multiplex qPCR assays correctly identified 34 IIB-1&2 and 52 phylotype II strains out of 90 R. solanacearum species complex strains. Additionally, the multiplex qPCR assay was validated successfully using 169 artificially inoculated symptomatic and asymptomatic plant samples from multiple plant hosts including geranium. Furthermore, we developed an extraction buffer that allowed for a quick and easy DNA extraction from infected plants including geranium for detection of R. solanacearum by qPCR. Our multiplex qPCR assay, especially when coupled with the quick extraction buffer method, allows for quick, easy and reliable detection and differentiation of the IIB-1&2 strains of R. solanacearum."
https://openalex.org/W2192072697,"Successful prediction of the beta-hairpin motif will be helpful for understanding the of the fold recognition. Some algorithms have been proposed for the prediction of beta-hairpin motifs. However, the parameters used by these methods were primarily based on the amino acid sequences. Here, we proposed a novel model for predicting beta-hairpin structure based on the chemical shift. Firstly, we analyzed the statistical distribution of chemical shifts of six nuclei in not beta-hairpin and beta-hairpin motifs. Secondly, we used these chemical shifts as features combined with three algorithms to predict beta-hairpin structure. Finally, we achieved the best prediction, namely sensitivity of 92%, the specificity of 94% with 0.85 of Mathew's correlation coefficient using quadratic discriminant analysis algorithm, which is clearly superior to the same method for the prediction of beta-hairpin structure from 20 amino acid compositions in the three-fold cross-validation. Our finding showed that the chemical shift is an effective parameter for beta-hairpin prediction, suggesting the quadratic discriminant analysis is a powerful algorithm for the prediction of beta-hairpin."
https://openalex.org/W2128922458,"Hereditary 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR), a rare recessive disease, is caused by mutation in the VDR gene encoding the vitamin D receptor leading to the resistance to vitamin D. We described a female toddler with initial presentation of leg tenderness and clinical features of HVDRR including severe rickets, hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia without alopecia. Genetic analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations of p.M4I and p.H229Q in patient's VDR gene. In cis p.M4I with FOKI-F eliminated both translation start sites of the VDR protein. The p.H229Q VDR exhibited significantly reduced VDR transactivation activity with intact dimerization with RXR. Our report expanded the mutation spectrum of HVDRR, and provided the first case of a benign variant p.M4I plus a common p.M1T polymorphism leading to a pathogenic allele."
https://openalex.org/W2178320670,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Histopathological and radiological analysis revealed that neurodegeneration occurs early in the disease course. However, the pathological mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration are poorly understood. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Brown Norway rats (BN-rats) is a well-established animal model, especially of the neurodegenerative aspects of MS. Previous studies in this animal model indicated that loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve, occurs in the preclinical phase of the disease and is in part independent of overt histopathological changes of the optic nerve. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify genes which are involved in neuronal cell loss at different disease stages of EAE. Furthermore, genes that are highly specific for autoimmune-driven neurodegeneration were compared to those regulated in RGCs after optic nerve axotomy at corresponding time points. Using laser capture micro dissection we isolated RNA from unfixed RGCs and performed global transcriptome analysis of retinal neurons. In total, we detected 582 genes sequentially expressed in the preclinical phase and 1150 genes in the clinical manifest EAE (P < 0.05, fold-induction >1.5). Furthermore, using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), we identified amyloid precursor protein (APP) as a potential upstream regulator of changes in gene expression in the preclinical EAE but neither in clinical EAE, nor at any time point after optic nerve transection. Therefore, the gene pathway analysis lead to the hypothesis that altered cleavage of APP in neurons in the preclinical phase of EAE leads to the enhanced production of APP intracellular domain (AICD), which in turn acts as a transcriptional regulator and thereby initiates an apoptotic signaling cascade via up-regulation of the target gene p53."
https://openalex.org/W2191290165,"A novel enzyme-linked receptor assay (ELRA) based on β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) has been developed for rapid and high-throughput detection of β-adrenergic agonists (β-agonists) in urine. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were introduced as the expression system to enhance the functionality of the recombinant β2-AR, and the attempt to detect β-agonists in swine urine using such approaches was accomplished unprecedentedly. In this article, a recombinant porcine β2-AR was produced in the inner membrane of HEK293 cells and purified from crude membrane protein by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. After activity identification, the recombinant receptor was used in the development of direct competitive ELRA. Several parameters such as blocking buffer and blocking process were optimized and the performance of the system was determined. The IC50 concentrations of clenbuterol, salbutamol, and ractopamine were 34, 53 and 63 μg/L, and the average recovery rates were 68.2%, 60.3% and 65.5%, respectively. ELRA based on β2-AR shows a series of advantages such as safety, easy operation, and high efficiency, making it promising for the rapid screening of β-agonists in animal urine."
https://openalex.org/W2154350943,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a major cause of bacterial meningitides and septicaemia. This study shows the results of the laboratory-based surveillance of IMD in Belgium over the period 1997-2012.The results are based on microbiological and molecular laboratory surveillance of 2997 clinical isolates of N. meningitides received by the Belgian Meningococcal Reference Centre (BMRC) over the period 1997-2012.Serogroup B has always been a major cause of meningococcal disease in Belgium, with P3.4 as most frequent serotype till 2008, while an increase in non-serotypable strains has been observed in the last few years. Clonal complexes cc-41/44 and cc-269 are most frequently observed in serogroup B strains. In the late nineties, the incidence of serogroup C disease increased considerably and peaked in 2001, mainly associated with phenotypes C:2a:P1.5,2, C:2a:P1.5 and C:2a:P1.2 (ST-11/ET-37 clonal complex). The introduction of the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine has been followed by an 88% significant decrease in serogroup C disease from 2001 to 2004 nationally, yet sharper in Flanders (92%) compared to Wallonia (77%). Since 2008 a difference in incidence of serogroup C was observed in Flanders (0-0.1/100,000) versus Wallonia (0.1-0.3/100,000).This study showed the change in epidemiology and strain population over a 16 years period spanning an exhaustive vaccination campaign and highlights the influence of regional vaccination policies with different cohorts sizes on short and long-term IMD incidences."
https://openalex.org/W2190194440,"Currently, a number of assays measure Orthopoxvirus neutralization with serum from individuals, vaccinated against smallpox. In addition to the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), newer higher throughput assays are based on neutralization of recombinant vaccinia virus, expressing reporter genes such as β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein. These methods could not be used to evaluate neutralization of variola virus, since genetic manipulations of this virus are prohibited by international agreements. Currently, PRNT is the assay of choice to measure neutralization of variola virus. However, PRNT assays are time consuming, labor intensive, and require considerable volume of serum sample for testing. Here, we describe the development of a high-throughput, cell-based imaging assay that can be used to measure neutralization, and characterize replication kinetics of various Orthopoxviruses, including variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox."
https://openalex.org/W2173170617,"Genetic control programs for scrapie in sheep build on solid knowledge of how susceptibility to scrapie is modulated by the prion protein genotype at the level of an individual sheep. In order to satisfactorily analyze the effectivity of control programs at the population level, insight is needed at the flock level, i.e., how the grouping of sheep in flocks affects the population-level transmission risk. In particular, one would like to understand how this risk is affected by between-flock differences in genotype frequency distribution. A first step is to model the scrapie transmission risk within a flock as a function of the flock genotype profile. Here we do so by estimating parameters for a model of within-flock transmission using genotyping data on Dutch flocks affected by scrapie. We show that the data are consistent with a relatively simple transmission model assuming horizontal transmission and homogeneous mixing between animals. The model expresses the basic reproduction number for within-flock scrapie as a weighted average of genotype-specific susceptibilities, multiplied by a single overall transmission parameter. The value of the overall transmission parameter may vary between flocks to account for random between-flock variation in non-genetic determinants such as management practice. Here we provide an estimate of its mean value and variation for Dutch flocks."
