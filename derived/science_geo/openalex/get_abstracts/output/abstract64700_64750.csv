https://openalex.org/W1597014450,"Abstract A new procedure for analyses for tryptophan in proteins and glycoproteins is described. The method utilizes p-toluenesulfonic acid as the catalyst for hydrolysis and the amino acid analyzer for the quantitative estimation of tryptophan. The hydrolysis of proteins is carried out in 3 n p-toluenesulfonic acid containing 0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)-indole in evacuated sealed tubes at 110° for 22, 48, and 72 hours. The values of tryptophan obtained were close to the expected integral values and the recoveries of all other amino acids were comparable to those observed after hydrolysis with 6 n HCl. Since the hydrolysate can be placed on the ion exchange column, without the prior removal of the solvent which is required when 6 n HCl is used for the hydrolysis, the present procedure is more convenient than the use of 6 n HCl. This procedure, however, is not designed for the analyses of proteins that are grossly contaminated with carbohydrates such as feeds. The limit of carbohydrate content that the present procedure can tolerate is 2.0 mg when 2 to 4 mg of protein are being hydrolyzed with 1.0 ml of the acid."

https://openalex.org/W1512671026,"A protected linear polypeptide of 124 amino acid residues with the sequence of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A was synthesized by the solid phase method. The polypeptide was removed from the solid support and purified, and the four disulfide bonds were closed by air oxidation of the reduced form. The synthetic enzyme was fractionated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and the material that eluted at the same position as natural reduced-reoxidized RNase A was isolated. The product was further purified by incubation with trypsin and removal of the enzymically degraded components. A fractional precipitation with (NH4)2·SO4 gave a purified synthetic RNase A with a specific activity of 78%. The synthetic RNase A was indistinguishable from natural bovine pancreatic RNase A by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose, and by electrophoresis. Amino acid analyses, peptide maps of tryptic digests, and the Michaelis constant agreed well with those of the natural enzyme. The synthetic enzyme showed the high substrate specificity to be expected of RNase A. It was highly active against yeast RNA and 2', 3'-cyclic cytidine phosphate and was completely inactive toward DNA, 2', 3'-cyclic guanosine phosphate, and the dinucleotides 5'-(3'-guanylyl)-cytidylic acid and 5'-(3'-adenylyl)-adenylic acid. During the synthesis, samples were removed after 99 and 104 residues had been coupled and the corresponding polypeptides, des-(21-25)S-protein and S-protein, were isolated. They were then reduced and reoxidized in the presence of natural or synthetic S-peptide to give RNase S and des-(21-25)RNase S. The specific activities of the two products were approximately equal, thus indicating that the five NH2-terminal residues of S-protein are not required for the protein to oxidize and fold in the presence of S-peptide to give an active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1564650229,"The terminal galactosyl residue of ceramide trihexoside of human erythrocytes and BHK fibroblasts and that of the ceramide trihexoside derived from of human erythrocytes were hydrolyzed and totally converted to ceramide lactoside by an α-galactosidase isolated from fig. The enzyme showed a strict substrate specificity for α-galactosides and was completely freed from β-galactosidase activity. With the sequential application of glycosidases, the carbohydrate sequence and anomeric linkages of glycosphingolipids have been simultaneously determined. The presence of α-anomeric (equatorial) proton in these glycolipids was supported by a doublet at δ 4.6 ppm (J = 2 Hz) in the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of a trimethylsilyl derivative and by an absorption at 850 cm-1 in the infrared spectra. From these results and the results of methylation study, the structures of ceramide trihexoside and of globoside were determined, respectively, galactopyranosyl-α-(1 → 4)-galactopyranosyl-β-(1 → 4)glucopyranosyl-(1 → 1)ceramide, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-galactopyranosyl-β-(1 → 3)galactopyranosyl-α-(1 → 4)galactopyranosyl-β-(1 → 4)glucopyranosyl(1 → 1)ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1982201704,"With 2.5 to 5.5 hours of tutoring, eight second-grade inner-city school children with clear reading disability were taught to read English material written as 30 different Chinese characters. This accomplishment eliminates certain general interpretations of dyslexia, for example, as a visual-auditory memory deficit. The success of this program can be attributed to the novelty of the Chinese orthography and to the fact that Chinese characters map into speech at the level of words rather than of phonemes. It is proposed that much reading disability can be accounted for in terms of the highly abstract nature of the phoneme (the critical unit of speech in alphabetic systems) and that an intermediate unit, such as the syllable, might well be used to introduce reading."

https://openalex.org/W1589858311,"Abstract Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis was purified by salt fractionations and Sephadex chromatography. Density gradient centrifugation and Sephadex chromatography indicated its molecular weight to be about 275,000. Enzymatic deamination of several ring-substituted phenylalanine analogues and d-phenylalanine was studied. While cinnamic acid, a product of deamination, acted as a competitive inhibitor, phenylpropiolic acid, its acetylenic analogue, was a noncompetitive inhibitor. This latter finding is consistent with the presence of more than one form of enzyme during the reaction sequence. The enzyme was inactivated by borohydride or cyanide. In addition, 0.7 to 1.2 atoms of tritium (incorporated from NaB3H4) or about 1.4 moles of cyanide completely inactivated 1 mole of enzyme. After acid hydrolysis of the enzyme labeled with Na14CN, the radioactivity was recovered primarily as 14C-aspartic acid. The 4-carboxyl group of this aspartate was radioactive. Hydrolysis of 3H-NaBH4-inactivated enzyme yielded radioactive alanine. This evidence indicates that bound dehydroalanine is at the active site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2112184006,"Comparing growing and density-inhibited cultures of mouse 3T3 cells, we have determined that when cells became density-inhibited: 1. The sizes of the ribonucleotide pools and of the inorganic and organic phosphate pools dropped only slightly, if at all. 2. The sizes of the deoxyribonucleotide pools dropped several-fold. 3. The rate of 32PO4 transport across the cell membrane declined 5-fold. 4. There was no reduction in the rate at which 32PO4 labeled the ATP pool beyond the initial inhibition of the rate of 32PO4 entry into the cell. This indicates that the rate of ATP turnover was approximately the same in growing and in density-inhibited cells. 5. Similarly, the rate at which 32PO4 labeled RNA of density-inhibited cells was reduced only slightly more than was the rate of labeling of the ribonucleoside monophosphates, indicating that much of the decreased incorporation of 32PO4 into RNA could be accounted for by the decreased rate of labeling of the precursor pools. Taking into account the differences in specific activity of the ribonucleoside monophosphates, we calculate that the rate of synthesis of pulse-labeled RNA in density-inhibited cells during a 3-hour pulse was approximately 75% of the rapidly growing rate. We conclude that the density-dependent inhibition of growth is not accompanied by gross, nonspecific reductions in the amount of available energy or in the rate of synthesis of pulse-labeled RNA, but is accompanied by changes in the rate of 32PO4 transport and in the sizes of the deoxyribonucleotide pools."

Mercury was also found in the urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid of humans who ate the contaminated pork. Mass spectral analysis confirmed the presence of organic mercury. This paper reports the first documented episode of indirect mercury poisoning in humans in the United States caused by the ingestion of contaminated meat from animals that had consumed mercury in their food supply."
https://openalex.org/W1569823605,"Abstract Fluorescence lifetime measurements have been used to obtain nanosecond time-resolved emission spectra of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate in ethanol, glycerol, and when adsorbed to bovine serum albumin. Red shifts with time were observed in the glycerol and bovine serum albumin experiments but not in ethanol. The effect of temperature between 4 and 60° supports the interpretation that the spectral shifts reflect nanosecond relaxations of polar groups around the dye during the lifetime of the excited state. It is suggested that this experimental approach has potential value for the investigation of relaxation kinetics on the nanosecond time scale."
https://openalex.org/W1972402688,"Poisoning due to the consumption of mercury in food is a well-documented but poorly understood medical phenomenon. Metallic mercury and inorganic mercury compounds usually attack the liver and kidney, but in ordinary exposures they do not remain in the body long enough to accumulate to serious levels. Methylmercury and other alkyl mercury compounds are more dangerous since they attack the central nervous system and remain in the body for longer periods of time. Symptoms of methylmercury poisoning in man may include loss of vision, hearing, coordination, and intellectual ability. There is still some uncertainty as to what constitutes lethal concentrations of methylmercury in man; there is variability in individual tolerance. Although mercury is a scarce element, it occurs widely in nature and readily forms a variety of compounds; the most commonly occurring is cinnabar, the mercuric sulfide. Consumption of the metal in the USA since 1900 has been about 10/sup 5/ metric tons, with world consumption probably several times as great. Reliable estimates of how much of this has been lost to the environment are hard to come by, but it may be as much as a third."
https://openalex.org/W2009031964,"In normal albino rats with a 4-day estrous cycle, the activity of ovarian ornithine decarboxylase undergoes a transitory rise on the evening of proestrus and only at that time. The response could be elicited by the administration of either luteinizing hormone or human chorionic gonadotrophin. When antiserum to luteinizing hormone was injected at 2 p.m. on the day of proestrus, the induction of ornithine decarboxylase was blocked, an indication that the enzyme is under luteinizing hormone control. The strategic positioning of the induction of ornithine decarboxylase between the normal release of luteinizing hormone and ovulation impties that putrescine is associated with the ovulatory process, and opens a new avenue of research on the control of ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W1491175805,"The reactions of p-nitroacetanilide and p-nitrophenyl acetate with aromatic and aliphatic amines catalyzed by a partially purified preparation of acetyl-coenzyme A:arylamine acetyltransferase follow ping-pong kinetics. At a given concentration of p-nitroacetanilide the identical maximum velocities observed for five substituted anilines, semicarbazide, hydroxylamine, and hydrazine, suggest that these reactions proceed through the rate-determining formation of a common acetyl-enzyme intermediate which reacts with the acceptor amine in a fast step. The maximum velocities are directly proportional to the p-nitroacetanilide concentration. p-Nitrophenyl acetate is the most active acyl donor substrate known for the enzyme, with a maximum velocity approximately 140-fold larger than that of acetyl-CoA. With weakly basic anilines the maximum velocity is different for different acyl acceptors, suggesting that with these substrates the reaction of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate with the acceptor amine is rate determining and that the saturation with increasing amine concentration represents binding of the acceptor amine to the acyl-enzyme. With strongly basic anilines the maximum velocities and the Km for p-nitrophenyl acetate are identical, within experimental error, for all anilines; this is interpreted as evidence for a change to rate-determining acylation of the enzyme with these more reactive nucleophiles. The increase in reactivity with increasing aniline basicity suggests the development of a partial positive charge on the attacking nitrogen atom, which may be accompanied by a relatively small degree of proton removal by a general base catalyst. It is suggested that the wide variation in the sensitivity of enzyme-catalyzed acyl transfer reactions to the basicity of the nucleophile or leaving group reflects different degrees of proton removal or addition by general acid-base catalysts in the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W1503039076,"Abstract The partial specific volume of phospholipid vesicles was determined by the sedimentation velocity method in various concentrations of hydrogen and deuterium oxide mixture. Since the density of D2O is very much greater than the reciprocal of the specific volume of phospholipids, the density of D2O-H2O medium corresponding to zero redistribution of phospholipids during sedimentation can be obtained with high precision by interpolation of the data. This method is therefore direct and accurate for phospholipids. Similar measurements on phospholipid vesicles in various concentrations of potassium chloride and sodium chloride solutions have also been made. The apparent isodensity point in the KCl solution was found to be approximately equal to that obtained in NaCl solution but smaller than that obtained in D2O-H2O medium. This difference can be attributed to the influence of preferential interaction of the vesicle with water. The partial specific volume and effective specific volumes of phosphatidylcholine vesicles are v = 0.9814 ± 0.0004 ml per g, φ'kcl = 0.9883 ± 0.0002, and φ'nacl = 0.9886 ± 0.0006 ml per g."
https://openalex.org/W1592085944,"The kinetics of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction have been examined at saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA, Mg++, and K+. The results of substrate kinetics and inhibition studies suggest a two-site ping-pong mechanism in which the enzyme-biotin-CO2 intermediate is formed at one site with the hydrolysis of MgATP. Because of its attachment to the enzyme by a carbon chain, the biotin-CO2 can swing to the second site where pyruvate is carboxylated to form oxalacetate. However, the initial velocity patterns indicate that the affinity for bicarbonate at the first site is dramatically increased by higher levels of pyruvate without any effect on the maximum velocity. The two-site mechanism was confirmed by inhibition patterns which indicated that competitive inhibitors of MgATP had only a small uncompetitive effect when pyruvate was varied at high MgATP. Similarly a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate had only a negligible effect on MgATP saturation at its site."
https://openalex.org/W1509924400,"Oleyl-CoA is the specific substrate for the microsomal oleyl-CoA desaturase from maturing seeds of Carthamus tinctorius L. Although there is a very high acyltransferase activity in the microsomes, which rapidly transfers the oleyl moiety to an endogenous acceptor to form β-oleylphosphatidylcholine, this oleyl-oxygen ester does not serve as a substrate for the desaturase. Since tritium-labeled CoA does not exchange with nonlabeled oleyl-CoA in the presence of the microsomal system, the possible roles of ACP and enzyme-bound oleyl complexes are also excluded. Hen liver desaturase utilizes stearyl-CoA as the substrate and the product is oleyl-CoA. There is no evidence for an oxygen ester substrate. Thus the substrate for the two desaturases is an acyl-CoA and the immediate product is an acyl-CoA. Acyl-oxygen esters (phosphatidylcholine) do not serve as substrates for the desaturation reaction."

The precipitin reactions are inhibited by simple sugars, such as d-glucose, d-mannose, and their glycosides, which are known to inhibit the hemagglutination reaction. Methyl α-d-mannoside is the most potent inhibitor of precipitation tested. Although methyl α-d-glucoside is also a good inhibitor, none of the dextrans tested precipitated with the lentil hemagglutinins. LcH-A, LcH-B, concanavalin A, and a homogeneous mushroom hemagglutinin (Agaricus campestris hemagglutinin) stimulate human lymphocytes in culture to incorporate tritiated thymidine. Stimulation of lymphocytes by LcH-A, LcH-B, and concanavalin A is inhibited by methyl α-d-mannoside. Stimulation of lymphocytes by A. campestris hemagglutinin is not inhibited by this sugar (nor is hemagglutination)."
https://openalex.org/W1564876674,"The extracellular aminopeptidase of Aeromonas proteolytica was purified to homogeneity by a simplified procedure that proved feasible for the isolation of gram quantities of this enzyme. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate and acetone, heating at 70°, and chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and DEAE-Sephadex yielded a product that showed a high degree of purity by polyacrylamide and free boundary electrophoresis over a wide range of pH values, and by immunoelectrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, chromatography, and assay for endopeptidase. Yields as high as 70%, representing 170-fold purification, were obtained by the isolation procedure. The enzyme was isoelectric near pH 3.0, a value that reflected the high ratio of acidic to basic residues found by amino acid analysis. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity measurements yielded molecular weight values of 28,480 and 29,500, respectively, and experiments on the stoichiometry of zinc to apoenzyme suggested that the aminopeptidase binds 2 g atoms of zinc per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1567994515,"Abstract A highly purified polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase, from bovine submaxillary glands glycosylates a particular threonine residue in the A1 protein, derived from central nervous system myelin, forming a N-acetylgalactos-aminyl-O-threonine linkage. Only one major receptor site was found in the A1 protein; over 80% of the N-acetyl-galactosamine-14C was attached to a single threonine residue as part of the following sequence: Special significance can be ascribed to the remarkable arrangement of the Pro-Pro-Pro region, which provides a rigid bend in the peptide region adjacent to the threonine residue. This is a rare sequence in proteins which has been found in the heavy chain of immunoglobulin IgG adjacent to a glycosylated threonine residue. On the basis of the specificity of the enzyme, it was concluded that the submaxillary glycoprotein probably contains a sequence very similar to the receptor sequence of the A1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1595570852,"Abstract When ATP was maintained at a high concentration by respiration or glycolysis (or both) in ascites tumor cells incubated in vitro, the adenine nucleotide quotient, (ATP) (AMP)/(ADP)2, was several-fold higher than the adenylate kinase equilibrium value. In such cells with high ATP:ADP ratios, incorporation of 32Pi into the γ-phosphoryl position of ATP was higher than that into the β position. Subsequent addition of excess inorganic phosphate to the medium of these cells effected more rapid loss of radioactivity from the γ-phosphoryl position. These results indicate that under conditions of rapid ATP generation the adenylate kinase fails to phosphorylate AMP as rapidly as necessary to maintain equilibrium. A number of conditions that retarded ATP generation, as shown by the lowering of the ATP:ADP ratio, also decreased the adenine nucleotide quotient to values in the range of the adenylate kinase equilibrium. These are the addition of 2-deoxyglucose, which depleted the cellular inorganic phosphate content and hence inhibited oxidative phosphorylation, and the addition of glyoxylate, which blocked the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Factors that reversed these effects, glucose and l-glutamate, respectively, also restored the high ATP:ADP ratio and the nonequilibrium state of the adenylate kinase reaction. Incubation of the cells with adenosine, inosine, or l-glutamine increased the total adenine nucleotide content. 2-Deoxyglucose induced rapid depletion of the adenine nucleotide pool, probably as a result of enhanced deamination of AMP in the inorganic phosphate-deficient cells. Although glyoxylate increased the AMP level, it also increased the cellular inorganic phosphate and thus had little effect on the total adenine nucleotide content. These results advance the conclusion that inorganic phosphate levels are important in the control of AMP deaminase activity in the intact cell."

Kinetic analysis of the formal mechanisms of the rhodanese-catalyzed and thiol-catalyzed transfer reactions has permitted comparative evaluation of the apparent rate constants for cleavage of the sulfur-sulfur bonds of two closely related aliphatic thiosulfonates. The results are relevant to several features of the catalytic mechanism of rhodanese. The simpler catalytic systems are inferior in protecting reactive intermediates from side reactions, as well as in overall efficiency, but appear to surpass the enzyme in formal mechanistic versatility."

https://openalex.org/W1572141470,"Abstract The purified preparations of phosvitin, the phosphoprotein of hens' egg yolk, contain 6.5% carbohydrate. Analysis showed 6 residues of hexose, 5 of glucosamine (assumed to occur as N-acetyl derivatives), and 2 of sialic acid per molecular weight of 40,000. In order to determine the mode of attachment of the polysaccharide moiety, phosvitin has been digested with pronase. A sequence of fractionation steps that included gel filtration, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex afforded isolation of a glycopeptide containing all of the carbohydrate attached to an aspartic acid residue. Edman degradation on this peptide and on a smaller peptide isolated from the tryptic digest of a partially dephosphorylated preparation of the glycopeptide yielded the sequence [see PDF for sequence] In addition to the demonstration of the occurrence of a sequence of 8 phosphoserine residues, at least 3 of the 5 nonphosphorylated serines of phosvitin were located near the single carbohydrate moiety of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1572226242,"Abstract Of the 4 tyrosyl residues of bovine α-lactalbumin, 2 were found to be quite reactive with N-acetylimidazole; the third group is less so, and the fourth is only weakly reactive. Acylation of the two most reactive groups results in a reversible increase in the quantum yield of a tryptophan residue or residues which emit maximally at 350 mµ. At relatively high concentrations of reagent, in addition to acylation of tyrosyl residues, six amino groups react giving rise to quenching of the fluorescence of tryptophan emitting maximally below 320 mµ and enhancement of fluorescence from groups which emit maximally at 350 mµ. Thus, acylation of the two tyrosyl groups perturbs tryptophan residues which are freely in contact with the medium, whereas acylation of amino groups, by contrast, appears to involve tryptophan residues which are not freely in contact with the solvent. Changes in circular dichroism were observed on acylation of bovine α-lactalbumin in the 250 to 300 mµ side chain band system, in the 208 mµ band, and in the 212 to 230 mµ region. These circular dichroism changes, which depend in a complex way on the nature of the groups acylated, appear to be due primarily to alteration of the environment of the side chains in the protein. Changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism properties observed on acylation of amino groups were shown to be similar to those observed on acid denaturation. It is likely that those processes, as well as alkaline denaturation, bring about essentially the same local conformational change which gives rise to increased freedom of rotation of tyrosyl and tryptophyl side chains. The pH dependence of the conformational transitions, as well as the chemical reactivity of side chains, suggests that breaking of charge pairs (amino and carboxylic acid groups) may initiate the structural change. Inspection of a recently proposed model for bovine α-lactalbumin indicates the proximity of a number of lysyl, glutamyl, and aspartyl side chains, in accord with the above hypothesis. The model further indicates that Tyr-36 and Trp-118, and Tyr-103 and Trp-104 are sufficiently close, respectively, to explain the changes in fluorescence on acylation of tyrosyl groups. The environments of Trp-60 and perhaps Trp-104, located in a crevice-like region of the molecule, are such that they may be the low wave length emitting groups normalized on acylation of amino groups."
https://openalex.org/W1586466529,"Rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) has been phosphorylated with γ-32P-ATP and then isolated by gel filtration. Phosphorylation was favored by the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate and a catalytic amount of pyruvate kinase, which appeared to remove ADP from the phosphorylation equilibrium. The phosphoenzyme was catalytically active, transferring its phosphoryl group to ADP to synthesize ATP. The phosphoenzyme also transferred its phosphoryl group to 3-phosphoglycerate to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, which, being unstable, was not isolated. It was converted instead to the corresponding hydroxamate or transformed enzymatically to fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Inorganic phosphate was released from the phosphoenzyme by neutral hydroxylamine at room temperature within 10 min. The pH stability profile of the phosphoenzyme is U-shaped. These facts accord with a covalent binding of the phosphoryl group to a carboxyl of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1554523143,"Abstract The interaction of glucagon with the cationic detergent, hexamethyl trimethylammonium bromide, has been studied by fluorescence and polarization of fluorescence of the tryptophanyl residue and by absorption of the aromatic residues and optical rotation of the peptide chromophore at 233 nm. All the measurements conform to the interpretation that glucagon acquires secondary and tertiary structure when combined with detergent. In contrast to other polypeptide hormones of similar chain length, the structural changes in glucagon occur before the region of micelle formation of the detergent. The effects of pH, ionic strength, concentration, glucagon and detergent chain size on the interaction have been evaluated. The concentration dependence of the association of detergent to form micelles has been investigated from the fluorescence and absorbance properties of three dyes, i.e. eosin y, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate and dichloroindophenol."
https://openalex.org/W1513454707,"Abstract 1. The amino acid composition of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase which had been carboxymethylated or oxidized was determined after hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for times up to 120 hours. The results were calculated on the basis of six identical polypeptide chains, each containing 506 amino acid residues, in good accord with both the determination of the sequence (calculated mol wt 56,100) and two sets of measurements by sedimentation equilibrium of the physical size of the subunit of 55,900 and 55,700. The partial specific volume of the protein is 0.735 ml per g as calculated from the amino acid composition. 2. From a tryptic hydrolysate of the carboxymethylated protein, 54 single or joined peptides were isolated in homogeneous form. Two dipeptides proved to be represented twice in the sequence. 3. The NH2 terminus of the protein was determined to be Ala-Asp, permitting identification of the NH2-terminal peptide. A peptide was identified as representing the COOH-terminal sequence of the protein, since it lacked a basic residue and contained the residues expected at the COOH terminus. 4. Hydrolysis produced by exposure to acid pH values was found to have occurred at two labile aspartyl-prolyl bonds in the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1552328143,"Abstract Two homologous disulfides of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen differ in their reactivity toward specific reducing agents. Disulfide 179 to 203 of trypsinogen was readily reduced with either 0.1 m sodium borohydride or 0.0005 m dithioerythritol. A second disulfide bond, at residues 122 and 189, required 0.01 m dithioerythritol for cleavage to occur. Disulfide 191 to 220 of chymotrypsinogen was reduced with 0.01 m dithioerythritol, while disulfide 136 to 201 was unreactive. The relative reactivity of the bonds provides a way to characterize the behavior of each and to classify the bonds as fully exposed (reactive with sodium borohydride and 0.0005 m dithioerythritol), partly buried (reactive with 0.01 m dithioerythritol), and buried (unreactive in the native state). These observations suggest that the two zymogens differ in conformation in regions of homologous sequences. S(Carboxymethylcysteine)4-(122, 179, 189, 203)-trypsinogen was activated with trypsin at pH 5, and the concentration of active molecules was estimated with p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate. The rate of formation of active sites and the yield were similar to the activation of the dicarboxymethyl derivative (Light, A., Hardwick, B. C., Hatfield, L. M., and Sondack, D. L., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 6289 (1969)). The formation of catalytically active molecules from the modified zymogen shows that the two disulfides are non-essential structural elements. Chromatographically purified α- and β-trypsin, and inhibited trypsins, were not reduced in a specific manner with dithioerythritol. Instead, a low yield was observed of randomly reduced disulfides. The apparent reduction of two disulfides of a commercial trypsin sample (Light, A., and Sinha, N. K., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 1358 (1967)) was caused instead by the reduction of the inert protein component. The difference in reactivity of the disulfides of trypsinogen and trypsin suggests that the conformation change accompanying the activation process includes the region of disulfide 179 to 203."

First, the incorporated arginine was reactive with fluorodinitrobenzene; and second, the two principal radioactive peptides obtained after digestion with pepsin were isolated and their structures established as Arg-Asp-Ile-Phe and Arg-Asp, respectively. The data also indicate that bovine thyroglobulin contains at least one and possibly two chains which possess the NH2-terminal sequence Asp-Ile-Phe-."
https://openalex.org/W1558546377,"The interaction of a variety of pyridoxal analogues with glutamate decarboxylase and aspartate aminotransferase has been studied. Pyridoxal phosphate N-oxide, N-methylpyridoxal phosphate, 3-O-methylpyridoxal phosphate, 4-de-(formyl)-4-vinyl pyridoxal phosphate, and pyridoxal analogues which contain modified substituents in position 5 (CH2CH2OPO3H2, CH(CH3)OPO3H2, CH2PO3H2, and CH2-CH2COOH) are bound at the pyridoxal phosphate binding site of the enzymes. The reaction of the analogues with the apoenzymes prevented activation with pyridoxal phosphate. Pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal phosphate N-oxide, O-methylpyridoxal phosphate, and the homologue of pyridoxal phosphate bind to apodecarboxylase to give absorption spectra characteristic of protonated Schiff bases. The rates of binding, the coenzyme constants, and the activation of the enzymes were determined for the analogues with aspartate apoaminotransferase and glutamate apodecarboxylase. The phosphate group of the coenzyme plays an important role in binding to the enzymes and in maintaining the enzymes and coenzymes in the proper conformation for catalysis. There are more stringent structural requirements for interaction of pyridoxal phosphate with the decarboxylase than with the transaminase. The free phenolic hydroxyl group and the free pyridine ring nitrogen are of importance in the interaction of pyridoxal phosphate with glutamate apodecarboxylase, but not as much as with aspartate apoaminotransferase. However, the phenolic hydroxyl group and the pyridine ring nitrogen are very important in the activation of the transminase. The addition of pyridoxal phosphate N-oxide to apodecarboxylase yields enzyme which is 29% as active as the native holoenzyme. The decarboxylase-N-oxide complex and the native glutamate decarboxylase have similar Km values for glutamate and Ki values for glutarate."
https://openalex.org/W1666178901,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of porcine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor I (Greene, L. J., Dicarlo, J. J., Sussman, A. J., Bartelt, D. C., and Roark, D. E., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 1804 (1968)) was determined by a combination of selective trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolysis reactions and conventional methods for sequence determination of small peptides. Arginine-directed cleavage was achieved by blocking lysyl and S-2-aminoethylcysteinyl residues with maleic anhydride. Hydrolysis of lysyl bonds in peptides containing S-2-aminoethylcysteine was accomplished by trypsin at pH 11.0. All of the overlap information required to order the small peptides was obtained by the identification of the amino- and carboxy-terminal residues of the products at each stage of the degradative procedure. The yields of the peptides, 38 to 93%, compared favorably with those obtained by the conventional complete trypsin hydrolysis of the bovine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, a molecule of the same size and similar structure. The amino acid sequence of the porcine inhibitor has been shown to be [see PDF for sequence]. This sequence exhibits 12 differences in 56 amino acid residues per molecule from that of the bovine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Greene, L. J., and Bartelt, D. C., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 2646 (1969))."
https://openalex.org/W1572393282,"Two classes of metal ion binding sites in horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase are distinguished by the observed rates of replacement of zinc by cobalt in acetate and in 2-(N-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid buffers. Hybrid enzymes containing both zinc and cobalt metal ions have been prepared and exhibit visible absorption maxima at 655 nm and 740 nm. Binding of azide, a substrate-competitive inhibitor, to yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and to native and metallo hybrid horse liver alcohol dehydrogenases has been investigated. The infrared absorption maximum for azide bound to yeast alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+ is 2070 cm-1, and that for azide bound to native horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase is 2065 cm-1. The frequency of azide in a solution of a hybrid liver enzyme is within experimental error equal to that observed upon binding to the zinc enzyme. Kinetic analysis also indicates that the binding of azide to zinc and hybrid liver enzymes is similar. No change is observed in the visible spectrum of the hybrid enzyme upon binding of azide. No change in the visible spectrum is observed upon binding of pyrazole, a neutral substrate-competitive inhibitor, to hybrid horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Stopped flow measurements show that the rate of binding of pyrazole to the hybrid enzyme is at least as great as, and perhaps greater by a factor of two than, binding to the native enzyme. Similarly, 1,10-phenanthroline binds twice as fast to the hybrid enzyme as to the zinc enzyme, and no change in the visible spectrum is observed upon binding of this coenzyme-competitive inhibitor. These results may be interpreted to indicate that none of these inhibitors binds to the easily exchangeable metal ions in horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1537988189,Abstract Bovine carboxypeptidase B has been alkylated at the active center by α-N-bromoacetyl-d-arginine-5-14C. The enzyme was treated at pH 7.0 with a 40-fold molar excess of the reagent. Subsequent fractionation of the reaction mixture on Sephadex G-25 and l-leucyl-d-arginine-Sepharose 4B columns has shown that inactivation is accompanied by incorporation of 1.09 moles of alkylating agent per mole of enzyme. Amino acid analyses of acid and basic hydrolysates of inactivated protein were identical with those of the native enzyme except for the presence of 1 extra residue of arginine. No amino acid was present in lower amounts nor were any new ninhydrin-positive peaks observed. Treatment with 2 m hydroxylamine at pH 9.0 partially reactivated the alkylated enzyme with the concomitant release of 1 equivalent of a 14C-labeled compound and the incorporation of 1 equivalent of hydroxamic acid. The radioactive compound was hydrolyzed in acid to release glycolic acid and arginine at a ratio of 0.94:1.00 and co-chromatographed with synthetically prepared α-N-glycolyl-d-arginine-5-14C on Dowex 50-X4. These results suggest that a carboxyl group of carboxypeptidase B is alkylated by α-N-bromoacetyl-d-arginine-5-14C.
https://openalex.org/W1580955835,"Abstract The pH rate profile for uncatalyzed formation of a complex between cyanide and sperm whale ferrimyoglobin at 25° and total ionic strength 0.11 has been established over the pH range 5 to 11 utilizing an integrated reversible second order rate equation of general applicability. The profile may be interpreted as reflecting three important routes for complex formation: (a) addition of cyanide ion to an unprotonated myoglobin, (b) addition of hydrocyanic acid to the unprotonated myoglobin (or the kinetically indistinguishable addition of cyanide ion to a protonated myoglobin), and (c) addition of hydrocyanic acid to the protonated myoglobin. Complex formation is strongly subject to catalysis by certain buffers: catalysis is most evident at intermediate values of pH and becomes negligible below pH 6 and above pH 10. Effective buffers include phosphate, glycine, and cyanide itself. Other buffers with forms capable of simultaneously accepting 2 protons through hydrogen bonding are also effective. Addition of cyanide to ferrimyoglobins from pilot whale, porpoise, and harbor seal is also subject to buffer catalysis. Guanidination of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin and carboxymethylation in the crystalline state have only small effects on the reactivity of the protein toward cyanide or on the sensitivity of this reaction to buffer catalysis. Carboxymethylation in solution, in contrast, markedly reduces reactivity toward cyanide. The hypothesis is developed that the buffer-binding site may lie between arginine-45 and histidine-64. A reasonable mechanism for the buffer catalysis is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1569501791,"Abstract Two tryptic hydrolysates of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase which had been maleylated prior to digestion were investigated. In one of these the carboxymethylated protein was used, in the other the protein had been oxidized with performic acid. These soluble derivatives were rapidly hydrolyzed by trypsin and after approximately 5 min, no additional hydrolysis was observed. From these two digests peptides accounting for 474 of the known 506 residues of the polypeptide chain were isolated. These peptides ranged in size from 2 to 73 residues. As expected, some of these peptides contained arginine as the only basic residue, indicating that these peptides are preceded by arginyl residues. Other peptides contained from 1 to 7 lysyl residues with a single arginyl residue, which was COOH-terminal in the peptide. Such peptides supplied overlaps for the component lysyl tryptic peptides. Many peptides were isolated which contained from 2 to 4 arginyl residues as well as several lysyl residues, thus providing additional overlaps at arginyl residues. Several segments of the protein were obtained which had not been found in fragments produced by other methods of scission. In all, the peptides obtained in this investigation established or confirmed 31 of the 33 overlapping sequences involving lysyl residues and at 9 arginyl residues as well. Some evidence is presented to explain the observations of limited action of trypsin at many arginyl residues. This appears to be due to the presence, at or near the potentially susceptible bond, of either acidic residues in the sequence itself or to hydroxyl groups which had become partially or completely maleylated. This is consonant with out observations that many peptides of identical composition manifested different electrophoretic mobilities or appeared in different fractions eluted from ion exchange columns."
https://openalex.org/W2090875700,"Rats were given electroconvulsive shock and bilateral cortical spreading depression, either alone or in combination, at various times after a single passive avoidance training trial. Assessment of retention deficits, 24 hours after training, revealed a U-shaped amnesic function for cortical spreading depression as compared with the short linear function consistently obtained with electroconvulsive shock in this situation. Induction of cortical spreading depression immediately after training resulted in an extension of the amnesic gradient produced by electroconvulsive shock, presumably by disruption of the subcortically confined memory trace. In addition to indicating a stibcortical locus of action for the amnesic effects of electroconvulsive shock, these results are interpreted as favoring a hypothesis of time-dependent memory trace localization in short-term memory processing, which involves an initial subcortical localization of the trace followed by a phase involving either direct or indlirect cortical participation in a mulltistage memory fixation process."
https://openalex.org/W1504395171,"Abstract Starting with intact basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas the artificial temporary inhibitor (14–38 bond reduced and substituted with carboxyamidomethyl groups) was prepared by previously described procedures. It was reacted with trypsin to form a complex, and the gradual liberation of tryptic activity from this complex was followed and correlated with the disappearance of the original Form A of the inhibitor. Concurrent with the disappearance of species A, three distinct sequentially appearing degradation products (B, C, D) were observed by disc electrophoresis. By choosing conditions favoring the accumulation of each of these species the forms B, C, D were isolated. All were inactive. The location of the first modifying cleavage (Form B) was confirmed by a direct analysis as Lys 15-Ala 16. Form C (2 hits) also had the Arg 39-Ala 40 bond cleaved, and Form D (3 hits) had in addition the Arg 17-Ile 18 bond cleaved with a loss of the dipeptide Ala-Arg. All 3 cleavages are located in the exposed apex of the pear-shaped molecule (Huber, R., Kukla, D., Ruhlmann, A., Epp, O., and Formanek, H., Naturwissenschaften, 57, 389 (1970))."

https://openalex.org/W1527053681,"Abstract The reaction of three N-substituted maleimides with horse oxy and deoxyhemoglobin has been studied. In all three cases, when the reactions were carried out with oxyhemoglobin, cooperativity between subunits was abolished (n = 1.0). When deoxyhemoglobin was used, cooperativity was reduced but not eliminated (n ∼ 2). A covalent bridge was introduced between cys F9(93)β (Perutz, M. F., J. Mol. Biol., 13, 646 (1965)) and his FG4(97)β when bis(N-maleimidomethyl)ether was reacted with horse oxyhemoglobin. When bis(N-maleimidomethyl)ether was reacted with deoxyhemoglobin, alkylation of one of the maleimide rings occurred at cys F9(93)β. The other maleimide ring did not react. Thus in contrast to oxyhemoglobin, no covalent bridge was formed in the protein. N-α-(bromoacetoxymethyl)maleimide (AM) reacted with horse oxyhemoglobin to link cys F9(93)β with val NA1(1)β'. This bridge decomposed rapidly leaving a carboxymethyl group on val NA1(1)β'. In the reaction of AM with deoxyhemoglobin, the ester bond in the reagent hydrolyzed after reaction with cys F9(93)β. Alkylation of the NH2 terminus of other β chains did not occur. N-α-(acetoxymethyl)maleimide, the monofunctional analogue of AM, reacted with both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at cys F9(93)β. It thus appears that the structure and functional properties of the derivatives depend on the ligand state of the hemoglobin used in the reaction with the maleimides."
https://openalex.org/W1480476973,"Abstract The reaction of N-α-(bromoacetoxymethyl)maleimide (AM) with human and horse hemoglobin was observed over a range of pH and ligand conditions. In the case of human hemoglobin, cys F9(93)β (Perutz, M. F., J. Mol. Biol., 13, 646 (1965)) was alkylated by the maleimide ring. This was followed by rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond in the reagent. With horse oxyhemoglobin, a transient covalent bridge between β chains was formed by reaction of the maleimide ring with cys F9(93)β followed by reaction of the bromoacetyl portion of the reagent with val NA1(1)β of the other β chain in the tetramer. After hydrolysis of the ester bond, which occurred spontaneously, the resulting hemoglobin derivative showed no cooperative interactions. A comparison of the dissociation behavior and rates of carboxypeptidase A digestion of horse oxy- and deoxy-AM-hemoglobin showed that the derivative resembled the oxy form of horse hemoglobin even in the absence of ligands. The alkylation of horse oxyhemoglobin could be carried out in two steps. By first reacting the AM reagent with cyanomethemoglobin at pH 5.7, the cys F9(93)β sulfhydryl group was alkylated. Addition of excess carbonmonoxyhemoglobin and raising the pH to 7 resulted in alkylation of the NH2 termini of the β chains by the bromoacetyl portion of the reagent. Separation of these hemoglobin derivatives was achieved. The two-step reaction sequence was also used to examine one feature of the conformation of a mixed cyanomet-AM-deoxyhemoglobin tetramer."
