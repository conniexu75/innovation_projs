https://openalex.org/W1681107818,"Chicks bursectomized by testosterone injection on the 5th day of incubation showed a marked inability to produce antibodies to Salmonella typhimurium. When portions of the bursa of Fabricius were enclosed in cell-impermeable Millipore diffusion chambers and implanted subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, the antibody-producing capacity of these animals was restored. Evidence strongly suggests that the bursa of Fabricius elaborates a noncellular agent capable of restoring immunologic reactivity in bursectomized chicks."

High concentrations of NaCl allow the addition of only a few nucleotide residues onto the 3' end of the primer. When pure oligonucleotides are used as primers and when the product is fractionated, pure block oligonucleotides can be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1990284839,"The appositional region between the intermediate element and adjacent cisternae in the triads of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle from humans, copepods, ostracods, and barnacles shows a five-layered construction similar to that of a tight junction. Known functions of tight junctions and cisternal elements suggest that a membrane depolarization, conducted by the intermediate element, is transmitted to the cisternae by way of the triadic junction to cause a release of calcium ions from the cisternae."

https://openalex.org/W2070401996,"The interactions in solution between purine or pyrimidine bases and polybenzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons probably consist in a vertical, stacking-type physical association. By molecular orbital calculations the role of the Van der Waals-London intermolecular forces in these interactions is determined. The electrostatic dipole-dipole forces are negligible, the polarization (or induction) dipole-induced dipole forces are contributory, but most important are the dispersion (or fluctuation) forces. This loose, physical type of interaction should not show any specificity with respect to the carcinogenic activity of the hydrocarbons."

https://openalex.org/W1976211830,"N-ACETYL-L-ASPARTIC acid (NAA) was discovered by Tallan et al. in 1956 and shown to be unique in its restricted localization to the brain of vertebrate species and in its very high concentration in that organ1. Occurring at a level of approximately 1 mg/g of brain, NAA is second only to glutamic acid in the level of free amino-acids in this tissue. Numerous attempts, using a variety of drugs and experimental procedures, to change the concentration of NAA in the brain have met with little success. Thus, electric shock, insulin shock, ammonia intoxication, and the administration to animals of tranquillizers, central nervous system depressants or convulsants, all failed to alter significantly the concentration of NAA in the brain2–4."

Sheep erythrocytes, sensitized with rabbit anti-sheep cell hæmolysin, were used as the indicator system for complement activity; a 50 per cent lysis end point was used. Complement activity was not detectable in the presence of 5 mg/ml. hydrocortisone; the titre was reduced significantly by concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml."

Cohen, then at the University of Edinburgh. Gahne and Rendel1 reported the findings of six different transferrin types which they explained on a basis of three alleles."

Even with yellow fever virus—which belongs to Casals's Group B—where extensive investigations have shown the natural cycle to involve forest dwelling primates and mosquitoes, many workers think that there still remains at least one other as yet undiscovered cycle of virus maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2249318956,"THE presence of C-6 oxygenated steroids in neonatal urine was first reported by Ulstrom et al.1. It has been demonstrated2,3 that placental tissue incubated under standard conditions, is able to oxygenate at the C-6 position, while the work of Frantz et al.4 has indicated that during pregnancy the urinary concentrations of the polar steroid 6β-hydroxycortisol is elevated above the normal non-pregnant state. It appeared likely, therefore, that similar polar steroids might be present in liquor amnii."

https://openalex.org/W2045668400,"DURING the course of investigations of the degradation of the normal and unsaturated-tetragalacturonic acids by a transeliminase1,2, it was found that unsaturated tetragalacturonic acid was attacked about 1.4 times faster than the normal tetramer. Furthermore, it was observed that the unsaturated tetramer must be almost completely converted to unsaturated digalacturonic acid since there was an approximate doubling (96 per cent increase) in the optical density. All activities were determined by measuring the change in optical density at 232 mµ. Unsaturated galacturonic acid does not absorb at this wave-length, presumably because of isomerization to the keto-deoxy derivative3. The observation with unsaturated tetragalacturonic acid was confirmed with the aid of paper chromatography using the ethyl acetate–pyridine–water–acetic acid solvent1. Only a spot with an RF identical to unsaturated digalacturonic acid was detected."

https://openalex.org/W1569898603,"CERTAIN hæmolytic strains of E. coli are associated with œdema disease and gastro-enteritis of young pigs. Timoney reproduced œdema disease in pigs by injecting supernatant material of the centrifuged intestinal contents from pigs which had died of this disease8. Since then, Erskine et al., Sojka et al. and Sweeney et al. have successfully reproduced the disease by injecting bacterial extracts prepared from hæmolytic strains of E. coli2,4,6. These reports suggest that œdema disease is caused by absorption of a toxic substance produced by specific strains of hæmolytic E. coli."
