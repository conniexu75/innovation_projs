Establishment of a course toward such stabilization will require the development within the coming decades of primary energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, in addition to efforts to reduce end-use energy demand. Mid-century primary power requirements that are free of carbon dioxide emissions could be several times what we now derive from fossil fuels (∼10 13 watts), even with improvements in energy efficiency. Here we survey possible future energy sources, evaluated for their capability to supply massive amounts of carbon emission–free energy and for their potential for large-scale commercialization. Possible candidates for primary energy sources include terrestrial solar and wind energy, solar power satellites, biomass, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, fission-fusion hybrids, and fossil fuels from which carbon has been sequestered. Non–primary power technologies that could contribute to climate stabilization include efficiency improvements, hydrogen production, storage and transport, superconducting global electric grids, and geoengineering. All of these approaches currently have severe deficiencies that limit their ability to stabilize global climate. We conclude that a broad range of intensive research and development is urgently needed to produce technological options that can allow both climate stabilization and economic development."

These dense states of matter exist momentarily before expanding. We analyzed the flow of matter to extract pressures in excess of 10(34) pascals, the highest recorded under laboratory-controlled conditions. Using these analyses, we rule out strongly repulsive nuclear equations of state from relativistic mean field theory and weakly repulsive equations of state with phase transitions at densities less than three times that of stable nuclei, but not equations of state softened at higher densities because of a transformation to quark matter."

https://openalex.org/W1971622317,"Recent years have shown steady progress towards molecular electronics, in which molecules form basic components such as switches, diodes and electronic mixers. Often, a scanning tunnelling microscope is used to address an individual molecule, although this arrangement does not provide long-term stability. Therefore, metal-molecule-metal links using break-junction devices have also been explored; however, it is difficult to establish unambiguously that a single molecule forms the contact. Here we show that a single hydrogen molecule can form a stable bridge between platinum electrodes. In contrast to results for organic molecules, the bridge has a nearly perfect conductance of one quantum unit, carried by a single channel. The hydrogen bridge represents a simple test system in which to understand fundamental transport properties of single-molecule devices."

Mutants defective in AON show supernodulation and increased numbers of lateral roots. Here, we demonstrate that AON in soybean is controlled by the receptor-like protein kinase GmNARK ( Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase), similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 (CLV1). Whereas CLV1 functions in a protein complex controlling stem cell proliferation by short-distance signaling in shoot apices, GmNARK expression in the leaf has a major role in long-distance communication with nodule and lateral root primordia."

Whereas changes in small nuclear RNA (snRNA) conformation are well documented, little is known about remodeling of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) structures during spliceosome activation. Here, human 45 S activated spliceosomes and a previously unknown 35 S U5 snRNP were isolated by immunoaffinity selection and were characterized by mass spectrometry. Comparison of their protein components with those of other snRNP and spliceosomal complexes revealed a major change in protein composition during spliceosome activation. Our data also suggest that the U5 snRNP is dramatically remodeled at this stage, with the Prp19 complex and other factors tightly associating, possibly in exchange for other U5 proteins, and suggest that after catalysis the remodeled U5 is eventually released from the postsplicing complex as a 35 S snRNP particle."

The alleles differ at only one amino acid position, where an arginine at position 107 in HLA-E*0101 (ER) is replaced by a glycine in HLA-E*0103 (EG). To investigate possible functional differences, we have undertaken a study of the physical and biochemical properties of these two proteins. By comparing expression levels, we found that whereas steady-state protein levels were similar, the two alleles did in fact differ with respect to cell surface levels. To help explain this difference, we undertook studies of the relative differences in peptide affinity, complex stability, and three-dimensional structure between the alleles. The crystal structures for HLA-EG complexed with two distinct peptides were determined, and both were compared with the HLA-ERstructure. No significant differences in the structure of HLA-E were induced as a result of binding different peptides or by the allelic substitution at position 107. However, there were clear differences in the relative affinity for peptide of each heavy chain, which correlated with and may be explained by differences between their thermal stabilities. These differences were completely consistent with the relative levels of the HLA-E alleles on the cell surface and may indeed correlate with functional differences. This in turn may help explain the apparent balancing selection acting on this locus.

These include the classical class I loci HLA-A, -B, and -C, whose role in immunological recognition is now well understood (1Townsend A. Bodmer H. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In addition to these genes, the MHC contains three highly homologous, nonclassical class I genes, HLA-E, -F, and -G, each of which probably plays a specialized role in the immune response. All three genes are located in relatively close proximity within the class I region and together with the classical class I antigens constitute the complete list of active class I genes in humans (2Geraghty D.E. Koller B.H. Hansen J.A. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1934-1946PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the class I-like sequences are apparently pseudogenes (e.g. HLA-H), gene fragments, and other inactive but structurally homologous sequences. Each of the nonclassical class I genes can be distinguished from classical class I genes by their expression levels, as is the case for HLA-E, which is ubiquitously expressed but at much lower relative levels (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), or by their tissue-specific expression patterns in the case of HLA-G (4Kovats S. Main E.K. Librach C. Stubblebine M. Fisher S.J. DeMars R. Science. 1990; 248: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) and HLA-F (5Geraghty D.E. Wei X.H. Orr H.T. Koller B.H. J. Exp.

O'Callaghan C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Each is hypothesized to have a unique function in immune responses.Of the three nonclassical class I genes, the function of HLA-E has been the most completely elucidated through its interaction with CD94-NKG2 receptors (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 7Braud V.M. Allan D.S.

CD94 is a type II glycoprotein that is expressed on most NK cells and a subset of T lymphocytes (8Aramburu J. Balboa M.A. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 714-721PubMed Google Scholar, 9Aramburu J. Balboa M.A. Ramirez A. Silva A. Acevedo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. De Landazuri M.O. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3238-3247PubMed Google Scholar). It forms a heterodimer with the NKG2A/B, NKG2C, NKG2E, and NKG2H glycoproteins (10Bellon T. Heredia A.B. Llano M. Minguela A. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Botet M. Aparicio P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3996-4002PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lazetic S. Chang C. Houchins J.P. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4741-4745PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction with such CD94 heterodimers can augment, inhibit, or have no effect on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production (12Perez-Villar J.J. Melero I. Rodriguez A. Carretero M. Aramburu J. Sivori S. Orengo A.M. Moretta A. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5779-5788PubMed Google Scholar). Surface expression of HLA-E requires, and is therefore controlled by, the availability of any of a set of highly conserved nonamer peptides that are available from the signal sequences of other HLA class I molecules including HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G but not HLA-F (13Lee N. Goodlett D.R. Ishitani A. Marquardt H. Geraghty D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4951-4960PubMed Google Scholar). When peptide is available, the resultant complex can interact normally with the CD94-NKG2 complex (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 7Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Further, the ability of HLA-E complexes to interact with CD94-NKG2 ligands is affected by the particular nonamer that is available for binding. For example, HLA-E may gain a novel function when it binds the unique peptide that only HLA-G can provide (14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Since HLA-E is also expressed in those placental cells normally expressing HLA-G, such a potentially activating function is suggestive of a unique role that HLA-E might be playing in the placenta.Polymorphism among HLA class I antigens has long been thought of as a hallmark of the functional diversity required of these molecules (15Little A.M. Parham P. Rev. Immunogenet. 1999; 1: 105-123PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas high levels of polymorphism in HLA class I have been maintained by overdominant selection (16Hughes A.L. Nei M. Nature. 1988; 335: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), in contrast the nonclassical class I molecules HLA-E, -F, and -G have been under a distinct selective pressure, exhibiting very low levels of allelic polymorphism. Two nonsynonymous alleles of HLA-E have been found, E*0101 and E*0103 (17Geraghty D.E. Stockschleader M. Ishitani A. Hansen J.A. Hum. Immunol. 1992; 33: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18Matte C. Lacaille J. Zijenah L. Ward B. Roger M. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and although others have been reported, it appears likely that they are the result of sequencing artifacts (19Grimsley C. Kawasaki A. Gassner C. Sageshima N. Nose Y. Hatake K. Geraghty D.E. Ishitani A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two confirmed HLA-E alleles have been referred to as HLA-EG (E*0101) and HLA-ER (E*0103), since they are distinguished by having either an arginine (-ER) or a glycine (-EG) at position 107 of the protein, located on a loop between β-strands in the α2 domain of the heavy chain. HLA-EG and -ER are found at nearly equal frequencies in diverse populations. Evidence that some form of balancing selection is acting on this gene to maintain the two alleles of HLA-E has been reported (20Grimsley C. Ober C. Hum. Immunol. 1997; 52: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such selection would imply that there are functional differences between the two alleles.In order to investigate the underlying rationale for potential functional differences, we examined the two HLA-E alleles individually for various characteristics that might affect function. Preliminary evidence had indicated that different levels of surface expression of HLA-E could alter its ability to protect cells from NK lysis by NKL cells (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). 2N. Lee, unpublished results. 2N. Lee, unpublished results. Therefore, we examined the HLA-E alleles for differential surface expression levels and, having found evidence for this, undertook experiments to understand the physical basis for these differences. By comparing differences in peptide affinity, three-dimensional structure, and thermal stability of the HLA-EG and -ER in complex with various peptides, we were able to elucidate important differences in the physical characteristics of these molecules that may form the basis underlying the effective balancing selection that appears to have been acting on this locus.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we opened a thorough investigation of the biochemical differences between the two nonsynonymous HLA-E alleles. This study was motivated primarily by our initial observation that, in most cases, the HLA-EG allele was expressed at higher levels than the HLA-ER allele in human transfected cells regardless of which peptide was bound. This observation was confirmed by a similar comparative analysis of HLA-E expression on normal cells, where, to a degree depending on the available classical class I signal sequences, the HLA-EG allele was expressed at significantly higher levels. Since studies have suggested that cell surface levels of HLA-E can affect the signaling through CD94-NKG2 (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 43Vales-Gomez M. Reyburn H.T. Erskine R.A. Lopez-Botet M. Strominger J.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), such a physical difference in cell surface expression levels might be translated into functional differences between these molecules. An additional dimension of complexity is introduced by the identity of the bound peptide and the particular allele, since such functional differences have been demonstrated to depend on these factors for HLA-E (14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).We first considered the possibility that the substitution of glycine for arginine at position 107 would result in structural differences between the two alleles, and since the crystal structure of HLA-ER had been solved (38O'Callaghan C.A. Tormo J. Willcox B.E. Braud V.M. Jakobsen B.K. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we undertook the crystallographic analysis of HLA-EG complexed with two different peptides. However, the structures of the peptide-binding, α1α2 platform domains of HLA-E with either peptide bound to either of the two alleles are essentially identical within the accuracy of the analysis. Therefore, the structures do not immediately provide an explanation for the significant difference in the stability of the two alleles. The one structural difference that is observed between HLA-EG and HLA-ER is the presence of an additional hydrogen bond in the HLA-ER molecule involving the side chain of arginine 107, although this might naively imply that the HLA-EG allele would be less stable than the HLA-ER allele, the opposite of what is observed. Likewise, the presence of an additional glycine in the HLA-E sequence would be predicted to result in a larger loss of entropy during folding, destabilizing the HLA-EG structure relative to HLA-ER, again the opposite of what is observed.Direct affects on stability, and thus indirect affects on cell-surface half-life and peptide or receptor affinity, can be explained by the gain or loss of stabilizing interactions between HLA-E alleles and the various bound peptides. Differences in the identity of the P2 residue of the peptide result in cavities within the peptide-platform domain complex structure by varying the quality of fit of the different peptides into an apparently rigid protein structure. The relative quality of the fit of peptide into platform correlates well with the differences in thermal stability and cell surface expression levels measured for HLA-E complexes with different peptides. As a consequence, each allele shows differing affinities with distinct peptides in a manner that correlates with the differing stability. The HLA-B27-derived nonamer provides a striking example of this difference. The HLA-EG heavy chain does form complexes with the B27 nonamer, albeit at relatively high concentrations, whereas the HLA-ER molecule does not bind the nonamer under the conditions tested. This is reflected precisely in surface expression using the hybrid constructs with the B27 signal sequence fused to either HLA-E allele, where no detectable HLA-ER was observed on the surface of 221 transfectants, whereas significant levels of surface HLA-EG were observed under the same conditions, and in T m measurements, where the stability of HLA-ER refolded in the presence of the B27 peptide is comparable with peptideless MHC class I proteins.The stability of the complexes was also consistent with a melting temperature of some 5 °C higher for the HLA-EG/B27 nonamer complex. Indeed, with all peptides tested, completely consistent differences were observed between the alleles among all three measures of cell surface expression level, peptide affinity, and complex stability. Thus, the differences in expression levels are not due exclusively to the affinities for available peptide or to any other single factor, but instead are due to the interrelated combination of relative affinity and stability of the refolded complex. The measurements of stability show clearly that the EG complex has a significantly higher melting temperature over ERregardless of the peptide bound. Further, it is unlikely that peptide is limiting, since classical class I molecules, the source of peptide, are over 20-fold more abundant than the HLA-E complex (13Lee N. Goodlett D.R. Ishitani A. Marquardt H. Geraghty D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4951-4960PubMed Google Scholar). Further, previous peptide feeding experiments had indicated that steady state HLA-E levels were controlled by the half-life of the complex and not by limiting peptide (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Although these studies implicate differing surface levels of HLA-E as a possible modulator of ligand interaction, we have not ruled out an effect of the substitution at residue 107 as altering an interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2. In experiments carried out with transfectants in vitro, essentially similar results were observed regardless of the HLA-E allele used (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, subtle effects that may have significance in vivo would probably not be detected in these experiments. However, no differences were observed in comparisons of HLA-EG and HLA-ERstructures that would directly or indirectly affect the interaction with NKG2-CD94 heterodimers. The possibility that TCRs recognize HLA-E directly (44Pietra G. Romagnani C. Falco M. Vitale M. Castriconi R. Pende D. Millo E. Anfossi S. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) adds the possibility that this position affects interactions with receptors other than NKG2-CD94. Therefore, it is at least conceivable that the allelic variation has two effects on ligand interaction, one determining quantitative differences in the amount of HLA-E complexes on the cell surface at any given time and the second distinguishing the molecules qualitatively through alterations in the effective affinity for interacting receptors.The level of selection acting on the HLA-E locus to balance these alleles in the population is not entirely clear, although at least two possibilities can be envisioned. Whereas the present study was limited to an examination of HLA class I signal sequence-derived peptides, TCR-derived peptides have been reported to bind and be presented by HLA-E (45Li J. Goldstein I. Glickman-Nir E. Jiang H. Chess L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If, as these studies suggest, HLA-E does prove to be involved in TCR Vβ peptide presentation, the likelihood that these peptides show differential binding between the two alleles seems plausible. Indeed, of the seven peptides tested, in every case the relative affinity of peptide was higher for HLA-EG (Fig. 3). Evidence for pathogen-derived peptides binding and being presented by HLA-E has also been suggested (46Ulbrecht M. Modrow S. Srivastava R. Peterson P.A. Weiss E.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4375-4385PubMed Google Scholar), and evidence for recognition of HLA-E by TCR α/β seems to support such a possibility (44Pietra G. Romagnani C. Falco M. Vitale M. Castriconi R. Pende D. Millo E. Anfossi S. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It therefore is conceivable that selection for maintenance of two HLA-E alleles could be acting at the level of regulation of peripheral T cell function, of pathogen-mediated immune recognition, or both.Alternatively, an additional and significant level of balancing selection might operate via HLA-E expression in the placenta. Several facts go together to implicate this as a mechanism for a relatively rapid stabilization of a new allele in a population. First, placental trophoblasts expressing HLA-G also express HLA-E complexed with the HLA-G nonamer (47Ishitani A. Sageshima N. Lee N. Dorofeeva N. Hatake K.H.M. Geraghty D.E. J. Immunol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A relatively large difference in binding affinity, derived from the differential ability of peptide to foster protein folding, between HLA-EG and HLA-ER for the HLA-G nonamer was observed (Fig. 3), suggesting a relative difference in surface expression levels between these alleles in the placenta. Since the HLA-E/G nonamer complex can evoke an inhibitory or stimulatory response from NK cells (14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and since relative surface levels are likely to directly influence the efficiency of either inhibition or stimulation via CD94-NKG2, it is plausible that there is significant room for modulation of function in the arena of the maternal-placental immune interaction. Indeed, a unique NK response is associated with pregnancy (48King A. Burrows T. Verma S. Hiby S. Loke Y.W. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1998; 4: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and rather than acting to inhibit NK activity in the maternal decidua, HLA-E may indeed act to stimulate NK to secrete cytokines appropriate for a stable immunological environment. The proper balance of inhibition and stimulation to yield a stable pregnancy may require higher or lower levels of HLA-E, depending upon other immunological and genetic factors present, thus conceivably providing strong selection on a newly introduced HLA-E allele.

These include the classical class I loci HLA-A, -B, and -C, whose role in immunological recognition is now well understood (1Townsend A. Bodmer H. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In addition to these genes, the MHC contains three highly homologous, nonclassical class I genes, HLA-E, -F, and -G, each of which probably plays a specialized role in the immune response. All three genes are located in relatively close proximity within the class I region and together with the classical class I antigens constitute the complete list of active class I genes in humans (2Geraghty D.E. Koller B.H. Hansen J.A. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1934-1946PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the class I-like sequences are apparently pseudogenes (e.g. HLA-H), gene fragments, and other inactive but structurally homologous sequences. Each of the nonclassical class I genes can be distinguished from classical class I genes by their expression levels, as is the case for HLA-E, which is ubiquitously expressed but at much lower relative levels (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), or by their tissue-specific expression patterns in the case of HLA-G (4Kovats S. Main E.K. Librach C. Stubblebine M. Fisher S.J. DeMars R. Science. 1990; 248: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) and HLA-F (5Geraghty D.E. Wei X.H. Orr H.T. Koller B.H. J. Exp.

O'Callaghan C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Each is hypothesized to have a unique function in immune responses. Of the three nonclassical class I genes, the function of HLA-E has been the most completely elucidated through its interaction with CD94-NKG2 receptors (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A.

CD94 is a type II glycoprotein that is expressed on most NK cells and a subset of T lymphocytes (8Aramburu J. Balboa M.A. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 714-721PubMed Google Scholar, 9Aramburu J. Balboa M.A. Ramirez A. Silva A. Acevedo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. De Landazuri M.O. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3238-3247PubMed Google Scholar). It forms a heterodimer with the NKG2A/B, NKG2C, NKG2E, and NKG2H glycoproteins (10Bellon T. Heredia A.B. Llano M. Minguela A. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Botet M. Aparicio P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3996-4002PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lazetic S. Chang C. Houchins J.P. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4741-4745PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction with such CD94 heterodimers can augment, inhibit, or have no effect on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production (12Perez-Villar J.J. Melero I. Rodriguez A. Carretero M. Aramburu J. Sivori S. Orengo A.M. Moretta A. Lopez-Botet M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5779-5788PubMed Google Scholar). Surface expression of HLA-E requires, and is therefore controlled by, the availability of any of a set of highly conserved nonamer peptides that are available from the signal sequences of other HLA class I molecules including HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G but not HLA-F (13Lee N. Goodlett D.R. Ishitani A. Marquardt H. Geraghty D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4951-4960PubMed Google Scholar). When peptide is available, the resultant complex can interact normally with the CD94-NKG2 complex (3Lee N. Llano M. Carretero M. Ishitani A. Navarro F. Lopez-Botet M. Geraghty D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 7Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Further, the ability of HLA-E complexes to interact with CD94-NKG2 ligands is affected by the particular nonamer that is available for binding. For example, HLA-E may gain a novel function when it binds the unique peptide that only HLA-G can provide (14Llano M. Lee N. Navarro F. Garcia P. Albar J.P. Geraghty D.E. Lopez-Botet M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2854-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Since HLA-E is also expressed in those placental cells normally expressing HLA-G, such a potentially activating function is suggestive of a unique role that HLA-E might be playing in the placenta. Polymorphism among HLA class I antigens has long been thought of as a hallmark of the functional diversity required of these molecules (15Little A.M. Parham P. Rev. Immunogenet. 1999; 1: 105-123PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas high levels of polymorphism in HLA class I have been maintained by overdominant selection (16Hughes A.L. Nei M. Nature. 1988; 335: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), in contrast the nonclassical class I molecules HLA-E, -F, and -G have been under a distinct selective pressure, exhibiting very low levels of allelic polymorphism. Two nonsynonymous alleles of HLA-E have been found, E*0101 and E*0103 (17Geraghty D.E. Stockschleader M. Ishitani A. Hansen J.A. Hum. Immunol. 1992; 33: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18Matte C. Lacaille J. Zijenah L. Ward B. Roger M. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and although others have been reported, it appears likely that they are the result of sequencing artifacts (19Grimsley C. Kawasaki A. Gassner C. Sageshima N. Nose Y. Hatake K. Geraghty D.E. Ishitani A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two confirmed HLA-E alleles have been referred to as HLA-EG (E*0101) and HLA-ER (E*0103), since they are distingui"
https://openalex.org/W2082698036,"Natural Caenorhabditis elegans isolates exhibit either social or solitary feeding on bacteria. We show here that social feeding is induced by nociceptive neurons that detect adverse or stressful conditions. Ablation of the nociceptive neurons ASH and ADL transforms social animals into solitary feeders. Social feeding is probably due to the sensation of noxious chemicals by ASH and ADL neurons; it requires the genes ocr-2 and osm-9, which encode TRP-related transduction channels, and odr-4 and odr-8, which are required to localize sensory chemoreceptors to cilia. Other sensory neurons may suppress social feeding, as social feeding in ocr-2 and odr-4 mutants is restored by mutations in osm-3, a gene required for the development of 26 ciliated sensory neurons. Our data suggest a model for regulation of social feeding by opposing sensory inputs: aversive inputs to nociceptive neurons promote social feeding, whereas antagonistic inputs from neurons that express osm-3 inhibit aggregation."

The ER provides a suitable environment for these processes, with optimal pH and redox conditions and a vast array of chaperones and enzymes available, including protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), GRP94, and calnexin (1Noiva R.

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The ER exerts also a tight quality control on its protein products; as a result, only proteins that attain their native state are transported to the Golgi. Proteins that fail to fold or assemble are dislocated to the cytosol for proteasomal destruction (4Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol.

In both yeast and mammalian cells, the accumulation of misfolded polypeptides in the ER lumen results in the transcriptional up-regulation of many genes encoding ER-resident chaperones and folding catalysts, a process known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (6Mori K.

Like other members of the Hsp70 family, BiP interacts with newly synthesized polypeptides in ATP-dependent cycles of binding and release that are controlled by co-chaperone molecules of the DnaJ family. Because the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins is weak (11Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), DnaJ molecules play a crucial role in catalyzing these reactions, stimulating the ATPase activity, and facilitating substrate binding (12Liberek K.

Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). DnaJ proteins can be divided into three subgroups based upon their degree of conservation in relation toEscherichia coli DnaJ. Type I DnaJ proteins contain an N-terminal J domain, a G/F-rich region, and a cysteine-rich Zn2+-binding region. Type II DnaJ proteins lack the cysteine-rich domain, whereas type III proteins contain only the J domain (14Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The latter mediates the interaction with the Hsp70 partner(s) via a conserved His-Pro-Asp motif. Catalysis of oxidative folding is necessary to rapidly generate the correct disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins (15Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A crucial component of the ER folding machinery is PDI. This multifunctional protein catalyzes disulfide bond formation and isomerization within the ER and displays both chaperone and anti-chaperone activities, depending on its redox state (15Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 16Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). PDI needs to be continually reoxidized to be effective as a catalyst for disulfide bond formation. Members of the Ero1 family carry out this reoxidizing function in yeast and mammalian cells (17Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 18Tu B.P., Ho- Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 19Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The structure of PDI encompasses five domains: four consecutive domains (a-b-b′-a′) followed by ac region, which is a putative, low-affinity, high-capacity Ca2+-binding site (15Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The two CXXC protein-thiol oxidoreductase active sites are located in thea and a′ domains, which display homologies to thioredoxin (20Sun X. Dai Y. Liu H. Chen S. Wang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Despite their low sequence homology to thea domain, the b and b′ domains also adopt a thioredoxin fold. Therefore, PDI is assumed to be composed of redox active and inactive thioredoxin modules (20Sun X. Dai Y. Liu H. Chen S. Wang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to PDI, the ER contains numerous other proteins endowed with oxidoreductase activity (ERp72, ERp57, p5, etc.). The abundance of these proteins probably reflects the high demand for efficiently forming, isomerizing, and also reducing disulfide bonds in proteins that are undergoing folding and quality control in this organelle (21Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The interactions between ERp57 and either calnexin or calreticulin underlie the necessity of coordinating folding with disulfide bond formation. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel ER-resident molecule (ERdj5) that features a DnaJ domain, a PDI-like domain, and a thioredoxin domain, suggesting a role as an ER folding assistant. BLAST (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) was used to identify human expressed sequence tag (EST) clones encoding proteins similar to thioredoxin. Some of these EST entries were found to encode a putative protein containing both a DnaJ domain and four putative thioredoxin-like active sites. Based on these sequences, the following primers were designed and used for 5′- and 3′-RACE/PCR in human testis and adrenal gland cDNA libraries (Clontech) to isolate human ERdj5 cDNA: human ERdj5-F1 and ERdj5-F2, nucleotides 1960–1985 and 1344–1359, respectively (nucleotide numbers refer to GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF038503); and human ERdj5-R1 and ERdj5-R2, nucleotides 2479–2455 and 2518–2482, respectively. The resulting sequences were used to amplify by PCR the full-length cDNA of ERdj5 from the same libraries. The DnaJ domain was amplified by PCR using primers ERdj5/GST-F1 (nucleotides 438–468) and ERdj5/GST-R1 (nucleotides 672–701), containing BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector. A fusion protein between GST and the DnaJ domain of ERdj5 (GST-DnaJ) was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by growing a 250-ml culture to A 600 ∼ 0.6 and then inducing protein expression by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubating for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 12.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mmNaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 150 μl of lysozyme (50 mg/ml) was added, and the solution was left stirring on ice for 30 min. Bacteria were then placed on ice, and 0.1 mMnCl2, 1 m MgCl2, 1 mg/ml DNase, and 1 mg/ml RNase (150 μl each) were added and incubated for a further 45 min on ice. Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to 2 ml of prepared glutathione slurry, and protein was eluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length ERdj5 was amplified by PCR using the specific forward and reverse primers ERdj5/GST-F1 (see above) and ERdj5/GST-R2 (nucleotides 2727–2756), including BamHI andSalI restriction sites, respectively; digested; and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pGEX-4T-1 vector. GST-ERdj5 fusion protein was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells according to the previously described protocol (23Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). GST-ERdj5 fusion protein was extensively dialyzed following purification. Human multiple-tissue Northern blots with poly(A)+ RNA from different tissues were purchased from Clontech. The human ERdj5 open reading frame (ORF) and the human PDI ORF were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rediprime random primer labeling kit,Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 65 °C overnight in ExpressHyb solutions following the protocol provided by Clontech. The blots were also hybridized with human β-actin as a control. First, the pEGFP-N3 plasmid was modified so that the ER retention signal would be at the end of the GFP sequence. PCR was used with specially designed primers including the appropriate restriction sites, the stop codon, and the ER retention signal KDEL to amplify GFP-KDEL. This product was ligated into the pGEMT-easy plasmid and sequenced to confirm the presence of the KDEL sequence. The GFP DNA was released from the pEGFP-N3 plasmid by digestion with the restriction enzymes NotI and EcoRI. The modified GFP-KDEL was released from the pGEMT-easy plasmid by digestion withNotI and EcoRI and subsequently cloned into the empty pEGFP-N3 NotI and EcoRI sites (also sequenced to confirm KDEL presence). This modified plasmid (pEGFP-KDEL) was used for GFP localization studies. The ERdj5 sequence not including the ER retention signal sequence (KDEL) was amplified using forward and reverse primers containing XhoI andBamHI restriction sites, respectively, and the Kozak sequence (24Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This ERdj5 product was digested and ligated in-frame into pEGFP-KDEL. HEK293 cells were chosen for these studies, as they are epithelial kidney adherent cells that are easily transiently transfected. The 293 cell line is a permanent line of primary human embryonic kidney cells transformed by sheared human adenovirus type 5 DNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). HEK293 cells were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin and transiently transfected using polyethyleneimine (Aldrich). 1 μg of GFP- plus KDEL-tagged ERdj5 DNA and 1 μg of pDsRed2-ER (Clontech) DNA were diluted in 20 μl of H2O, and 1 μl of 0.1 m polyethyleneimine was added. The mixture was vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and subsequently added to the medium and applied to the cells. 48 h after transfection, live GFP pictures were acquired with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. GFP was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm using an argon/krypton laser, and emitted light was collected between 500 and 540 nm; and for excitation of pDsRed2-ER (Clontech), we used the 568-nm line, and emitted light was collected between 570 and 620 nm. TheBiP cDNA including the signal peptide was amplified from a human liver cDNA library by PCR using the specific forward and reverse primers BiP-F5 (nucleotides 131–160) and BiP-R1 (nucleotides 2164–2180), corresponding to GenBankTM/EBI accession number X87949 for Homo sapiens BiPmRNA. The product was ligated into the pGEMT-easy vector. To generate suitable restriction sites for cloning into the pET-15b plasmid for subsequent protein purification, PCR was carried out using primers BiP-pET-F (nucleotides 268–291) and BiP-pET-R (nucleotides 2167–2193), containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, with pGEM-BiP cDNA as template. Following digestion with BamHI and NdeI, the product was ligated in-frame into the His-tagged pET-15b plasmid (Novagen). His-tagged BiP was purified essentially following a previous protocol (25Yu M. Haslam R.H. Haslam D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24984-24992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was carried out using a BIAcore2000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Using amine coupling, anti-GST antibodies (∼6000 response units) were immobilized onto all surfaces of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore). Subsequently, equal molar quantities of GST and the GST-DnaJ and GST-ERdj5 fusion proteins were captured. All proteins were diluted in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate) (BIAcore) supplemented with 5 mmMgCl2 and injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The GST signal was used for background correction. The BiP ORF cloned into the pET-15b vector from the previous BiP protein purification was used as template for in vitro translation. Protein was synthesized in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase-based rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription/translation kit (TNT, Promega) and labeled with [35S]Met. Briefly, GST, GST-DnaJ, and GST-ERdj5 (∼2 μg each) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated for 2 h upon rotating at 4 °C with 4 μl of in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled protein in incubation buffer (50 mm potassium inorganic phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Tween) containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin. (As a control, GST and the GST fusion proteins were incubated under the same conditions without in vitro translated BiP protein.) The beads were washed three times for 15 min with incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin, resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and pelleted in a microcentrifuge. 15 μl of each supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. To control the stability of the GST fusion proteins and equal loading, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, incubated in Amplify liquid (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min, and dried under vacuum before autoradiography. GST pull-down assays using His-tagged BiP were carried out essentially as described above. Briefly, 2 μg of purified His-tagged BiP protein was added to ∼2 μg of GST, GST-DnaJ, or GST-ERdj5 bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in the presence of 2 mm ATP or ADP and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond-C super membrane (AmershamBiosciences) using standard Western blotting techniques. Monoclonal anti-His tag antibody (Clontech) was used at a dilution of 1:2000 with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. For in situhybridization, adult male and female mice (2–3 months of age) were killed with carbon dioxide, and the tissues were excised and frozen on dry ice. The samples were sectioned with a Microm HM500 cryostat at 14 μm and thaw-mounted onto polylysine glass slides (Menzel). The sections were stored at −20 °C until used. Four oligonucleotide probes for the ORF of mouse ERdj5 (nucleotides 329–356, 543–582, 1269–1303, and 2232–2269, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF255459) were used and labeled to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg with [α-33P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Biosciences). The probe sequences exhibit <60% similarity to all known sequences in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. All probes gave similar expression results when used separately and were usually combined to intensify the hybridization signal. As a control for the specificity of in situ hybridizations, several probes for unrelated mRNAs with known expression patterns and with similar lengths and GC contents were used. The addition of a 100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled probe abolished all hybridization signals. In situhybridization was carried out as described previously (26Konenen, J., and Pelto-Huikko, M. (1997) Technical Tips Online http://www.tto.trends.com/Google Scholar). HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection), an easily transfectable derivative of HEK293 cells expressing SV40 T antigen, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Total cellular RNA preparation and Northern blot analysis were carried out as described previously (27Cabibbo A. Consalez G.G. Sardella M. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2935-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To induce the UPR or unrelated stress response, cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm), tunicamycin (10 μg/ml), thapsigargin (2 μm), A23187 (2 μm), EGTA (2 mm), or deoxyglucose (10 mm); deprived of fetal calf serum; UV light-irradiated; or incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. A screen of the GenBankTM/EBI EST Data Bank led to the identification of sequences containing putative thioredoxin active sites. 5′- and 3′-RACE/PCR analyses were performed using specially designed primers in both human testis and adrenal gland cDNA libraries to clone the full-length cDNA. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced, confirming the sequence obtained from the ESTs. The complete sequence reveals an ORF of 2379 base pairs, with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 415 and 1384 base pairs, respectively, surrounding an ORF that encodes a putative protein of 793 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 91 kDa and a pI of 7.03 (Fig. 1). The protein was named ERdj5 following the nomenclature proposed for ER proteins containing a DnaJ domain in the recent study by Shen et al. (28Shen Y. Meunier L. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15947-15956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, a domain with the features of DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins, including the His-Pro-Asp motif, is encountered (Fig. 2 A). Neither G/F-rich nor cysteine-rich regions are present, thus making ERdj5 a type III DnaJ protein (14Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 29Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Following the DnaJ domain are four thioredoxin-like domains, with different putative redox active sites, each containing a CXXC motif. The last domain has a typical thioredoxin signature, WCGPC. A KDEL tetrapeptide is present at the C terminus, possibly mediating ER retention (see below).Figure 2Genomic and domain organization of ERdj5. A, ERdj5 is an ER-resident protein containing DnaJ-, thioredoxin (Trx)-, and PDI-like domains. In the scheme, DnaJ proteins are classified based on the presence of a J domain, a G/F-rich region, and a cysteine-rich region. Classification of thioredoxin-like domains is based on sequence similarity of their putative active sites to the thioredoxin or PDI CXXC motif.B, genomic organization of human the ERdj5 gene. The 24 exons of human ERdj5 (represented by numbered gray and black bars) are distributed over ∼62 kb of chromosome 2 at p22.1–23.1. Exons 1–3 (gray bars) are composed of the 5′-untranslated region, with the ORF starting in exon 3. Exon 24 (gray bar) contains the stop codon plus the 3′-untranslated region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gene encoding ERdj5 has been identified in genomic data bases and mapped to human chromosome 2 at positions p22.1–23.1. Several disease genes have been mapped to this region, including a form of recessive deafness and some types of colon cancer. Using the CELERA Database, we were able to decipher the genomic organization of the ERdj5 gene. It spans ∼62 kb and is composed of 24 exons (Fig. 2 B). Splicing variants were detected both in ESTs and in cDNAs. Homologs of humanERdj5 are present in both Mus musculus andCaenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1). Human multiple-tissue Northern blots were used to determine transcript size and distribution using theERdj5 ORF as a probe. Signals were detected in all tissues analyzed; their distribution was similar to that of PDI mRNAs, being particularly abundant in secretory organs (Fig. 3). Multiple ERdj5 bands, possibly representing splicing variants, were identified in the pancreas and testis, with bands of less intensity identified in the heart, liver, spleen, prostate, and ovary and weaker bands seen in the rest of the tissue panel. A similar pattern was confirmed using the virtual tissue distribution program. 2Available at www.labonweb.com. In situhybridization was employed to further analyze the distribution ofERdj5 transcripts in mice. The results shown in Fig. 4 confirm that ERdj5transcripts are particularly abundant in secretory tissues. Thus, the adrenal gland showed very strong signals in the cortex and medulla (Fig. 4 A). Expression in the nervous system was variable. Strong signals were found in several areas of the central nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus and the granular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 4 B). Moderate signals were seen in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem, whereas the thalamus showed lower expression. White matter was negative. A strong signal was present in the ependyma covering the ventricles and plexus choroideus (Fig. 4 B). In the spinal cord, there was a moderate signal in the gray matter, but the signal was absent in the white matter. In the peripheral nervous system, a strong signal was evident in the sympathetic (superior cervical) and sensory (trigeminal) ganglia (Fig. 4 C). From emulsion autoradiography, it was apparent that the signal was present in the neurons, but absent in the glial cells (Fig. 4 D).ERdj5 mRNAs were abundant in genital organs. The epididymis showed a strong signal in the epithelium (Fig. 4 E). The prostate expressed ERdj5 at the highest level of all organs studied (Fig. 4 F). In dipped sections, the signal was restricted to the epithelium (Fig. 4 G). Also the alimentary tract expressed ERdj5 in several areas. In the tongue, the stratified epithelium showed moderate labeling, whereas the striated muscle was not labeled (Fig. 4 H). In the oral cavity, the epithelium and sublingual salivary glands were strongly labeled (Fig. 4 I). In the esophagus (Fig. 4 J) and larynx (Fig. 4 K), the signal was particularly intense in the mucosa and mucous glands, respectively. Throughout the intestinal canal, from the stomach to the colon, a strong signal was seen in the mucosa, whereas the smooth muscle layer was negative (Fig. 4 L). The presence of an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence and a C-terminal KDEL motif suggests that ERdj5 is an ER-resident protein. Indeed, a chimeric protein in which GFP was inserted immediately before the KDEL sequence of ERdj5 displayed a reticular pattern, largely coinciding with the ER marker used, pDsRed-ER (Fig. 5). Also, Myc-tagged ERdj5 was localized in the ER of HeLa transfectants. 3T. Simmen, G. Bertoli, and R. Sitia, unpublished data.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30534-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the DnaJ domain of ERdj5 can interact with BiP, we used surface plasmon resonance assays (33Fagerstam L.G. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Either full-length ERdj5 or its DnaJ domain fused with GST was immobilized in separate channels on a BIAcore CM5 chip (see “Experimental Procedures”). Binding to BiP was then tested in the presence of ATP and ADP. In the presence of ATP, the BiP protein bound to both GST-DnaJ and GST-ERdj5. No binding to the control channel containing the GST protein alone was observed. As expected, there was no binding in the presence of ADP or in the absence of either ATP or ADP. To further confirm the binding of ERdj5 and its DnaJ domain to BiP, in vitro GST pull-down experiments were carried out (Fig. 6, B andC). In vitro translated BiP bound to GST-DnaJ and GST-ERdj5, but not to GST (Fig. 6 B). Likewise, both GST-ERdj5 and GST-DnaJ bound to purified His-tagged BiP. Binding was more efficient in the presence of ATP (Fig. 6 C). The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates the UPR, thus inducing the transcription of many ER-resident chaperones. We examined whether ERdj5 is also up-regulated in times of ER stress. Following treatment of HEK293T cells with a panel of common UPR inducers as previously described (34Benedetti C. Fabbri M. Sitia R. Cabibbo A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), ERdj5 transcription was up-regulated (Fig. 7). Heat shock and serum deprivation resulted in no induction, suggesting that ERdj5is abona fide UPR gene. This correlates with the presence of an ERSE-like box (CCAATN9CGCGG) ∼330 bases upstream of theERdj5 ATG start codon, with N9 consisting of mainly guanine and cytosine nucleotides, which is common for ERSE motifs. The ERdj5 pattern of up-regulation following stress is similar to that seen for Ero1-Lβ, which is a known UPR gene (35Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We describe here a novel human ER-resident protein (ERdj5) ubiquitously expressed and abundant in secretory tissues such as pancreas and testis. Homologs of human ERdj5 are present in both M. musculus and C. elegans. The presence of DnaJ-, PDI-, and thioredoxin-like domains suggests that ERdj5 may be involved in assisting protein folding and quality control in the ER. Several lines of evidence including the transcriptional regulation ofERdj5 and its subcellular localization and molecular interactions support this hypothesis. The presence of an N-terminal leader sequence and a C-terminal KDEL motif confirm our findings that ERdj5 is localized in the ER. GFP-tagged ERdj5 with the ER retention signal KDEL yields a reticular staining pattern, largely superimposable on that obtained with ER markers. As in the case of many other proteins induced during the UPR, theERdj5 promoter contains a putative ERSE box (9Y"

S1P is synthesized from sphingosine by sphingosine kinase and is degraded either by S1P lyase or by S1P phosphohydrolase. Recently, mammalian S1P phosphohydrolase (SPP1) was identified and shown to constitute a novel lipid phosphohydrolase family, the SPP family. In this study we have identified a second human S1P phosphohydrolase, SPP2, based on sequence homology to human SPP1. SPP2 exhibited high phosphohydrolase activity against S1P and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate. The dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity was efficiently inhibited by excess S1P but not by lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, or glycerol 3-phosphate, indicating that SPP2 is highly specific to sphingoid base 1-phosphates. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis demonstrated that SPP2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the enzymatic properties and localization of SPP2 were similar to those of SPP1, the tissue-specific expression pattern of SPP2 was different from that of SPP1.

Once formed, S1P is rapidly degraded by S1P lyase to hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine or dephosphorylated by S1P phosphohydrolase. The existence of a S1P-specific phosphohydrolase had been suggested by biochemical analyses using cultured skin fibroblasts and rat liver (4Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem.

Recently, a human homolog of mSPP1, hSPP1, which exhibits 76% identity and 81% similarity to mSPP1, was identified (7Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

These mammalian SPP1s and their two yeast homologs, Lcb3p and Ysr3p, constitute the SPP family, which is distinct from another lipid phosphohydrolase family, the type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPP), both in sequence and in biochemical properties.

Proteins from both the SPP and LPP families contain the following three conserved motifs: motif 1, KXXXXXXRP; motif 2, PSGH; and motif 3, SRXXXXXHXXD. These motifs are found in a superfamily of phosphatases that include several lipid phosphatases, glucose-6-phosphatases, bacterial nonspecific acid phosphatases, and chloroperoxidase (15Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of chloroperoxidase disclosed that these conserved motifs were in close proximity and that together they constituted a binding pocket for the cofactor vanadate, a compound structurally similar to phosphate (16Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, these motifs are believed to constitute the active site in members of this phosphatase superfamily, a conclusion supported by mutational analyses of yeast Dpp1p and mammalian LPP-1 (17Toke D.A.

J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We report here that we have identified a second human S1P phosphohydrolase, termed hSPP2, based on sequence homology to hSPP1. hSPP2 exhibited high phosphohydrolase activity specifically against sphingoid base 1-phosphates. Additionally, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of hSPP1, the expression of hSPP2 was restricted to specific tissues. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we also demonstrated that hSPP2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that it functions in attenuating intracellular S1P signaling. pEGFP-C1 was purchased from Clontech. pcDNA3 HA4, a derivative of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), was constructed to create a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged gene. BLAST searches using the hSPP1 sequence identified an EST clone (GenBankTM accession numberBG696302) that contains an entire hSPP2 open reading frame (ORF) but lacks 45 bp of the 5′ sequence. To obtain the entire hSPP2 cDNA, the primers 5′-GCCACCATGGCCGAGCTGCTGCGGAGCCTGCAGGATTCCCAGCTCGTCGCCCGCTTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TTTCAGGGTAATCCCAGAAACC-3′ were used to amplify the hSPP2 cDNA from the EST clone BG696302. The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate the pCO64 plasmid. To construct a C-terminal HA-tagged gene, BamHI sites were created at both the 5′ and 3′ termini of hSPP2 by PCR amplification using primers 5′-GGATCCATGGCCGAGCTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGGATCCGAGGGTAATCCC-3′ from pCO64. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pcDNA3 HA4 to generate pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA. The pcDNA3 mSPP1-HA plasmid, which encodes C-terminal HA-tagged mSPP1, was constructed as follows. The mSPP1 cDNA was amplified from the EST clone (GenBankTMaccession number BG173194), which contains an entire mSPP1 ORF, using the primers 5′-AAAAAAGCTTGCGACCATGTCCCTGGGGGC-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCCCTTTATTGGTATCTCTTG-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into the HindIII-BamHI site of pcDNA3 HA4 to generate pcDNA3 mSPP1-HA. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the indicated cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells grown on coverslips and transfected with the indicated cDNAs were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with blocking solution (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with primary antibodies, anti-HA Y11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/ml, or anti-KDEL antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies) at 4.8 μg/ml in blocking solution. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody, Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit or Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking solution to 5 μg/ml. Coverslips were washed in PBS three times and in deionized water three times. Coverslips were then mounted with Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem) and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Poly(A)+ RNA blots containing 1 μg of RNA from human tissues (Clontech) were used. For detection of hSPP2 mRNA, blots were probed with a 0.48-kbPstI-NcoI fragment of pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA that was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. For detection of hSPP1 mRNA, a hSPP1 probe was prepared as follows. A 0.5-kb DNA fragment corresponding to the 3′ region of hSPP1 ORF was amplified using the primers 5′-GCTGTCTTCTATCCATTTGTGGACC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCCATCAAGAGATACC-3′ from the EST clone (GenBankTMaccession number BI458997), which contains most of the hSPP1 ORF but lacks the 5′ terminus. The amplified fragments were then gel-purified and labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech) for 2 h at 68 °C. Cells suspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in buffer A and used as a membrane fraction. Phosphohydrolase assays were performed by mixing the membrane fractions with 10 μm[4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P (50 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) or 10 μm [3-3H]S1P (23.5 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), each of which had been complexed with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma, A-6003) and then incubating the membrane fractions for 10 min at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted by successive additions of a 3.75-fold volume of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v), a 1.25-fold volume of chloroform and a 1.25-fold volume of 1% KCl with mixing. Phases were then separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The labeled lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v). To identify a new S1P phosphohydrolase, the GenBankTM human EST data base was searched using the BLAST program for sequences similar to the hSPP1 sequence. We found several ESTs including BG696302, BM127455, BM830654, and AW779536 with high sequence homology to hSPP1. These ESTs contained different fragments but were derived from an identical cDNA, subsequently named human SPP2 (hSPP2). The ORF of hSPP2 encodes 399 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44.7 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The hSPP2 sequence indicated 39.3% identity and 69.7% similarity to hSPP1. hSPP2 also shows significant homology to other SPP family members, whereas it is divergent from the LPP family (Fig. 1 B). Although the N-terminal hydrophilic region of hSPP2 was shorter than that of hSPP1, the overall hydropathy profile of hSPP2 was very similar to that of hSPP1 (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the transmembrane structure of hSPP2 is the same as that of hSPP1. The TopPredII 1.1 program (19Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Cabios. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) predicts hSPP2 to be an integral membrane protein with as many as nine membrane-spanning segments. The three conserved motifs found in the superfamily of phosphatases, including several lipid phosphatases, were also present in hSPP2 (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether hSPP2 had S1P phosphohydrolase activity, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA encoding the C-terminal HA-tagged hSPP2 (hSPP2-HA). For comparison we also constructed a pcDNA3 mSPP1-HA that encodes the C-terminal HA-tagged mSPP1 (mSPP1-HA). Total cell lysates were prepared from HEK 293 cells, transfected with the respective plasmids, and separated by SDS-PAGE. This was followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. A band with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa was specifically detected in hSPP2-HA-transfected cell lysates and was absent in vector-transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 1and 2). mSPP1-HA was detected as a band at 40 kDa (Fig. 2,lane 3). These mobilities were faster than the predicted molecular masses of hSPP2-HA (46.1 kDa) and mSPP1-HA (49.2 kDa). Using membrane fractions and [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P we also performed an in vitro phosphohydrolase assay. In contrast to vector-transfected HEK 293 cells, which had low levels of activity, cells overproducing hSPP2-HA and mSPP1-HA exhibited a 6.3- and 11.5-fold increase in phosphohydrolase activity, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B,lanes 1 and 2). However, because mSPP1-HA was expressed 1.6 times more abundantly than hSPP2-HA (Fig. 2), the specific activity of hSPP2 against dihydro-S1P was similar to that of mSPP1. To investigate the substrate specificity of hSPP2, the in vitro phosphohydrolase assay was performed using [3-3H]S1P. Similar to the results obtained using [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2), cells overproducing hSPP2-HA exhibited an ∼6-fold higher phosphohydrolase activity against [3-3H]S1P than did vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4). Next, we performed a competition assay using [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P and various excess cold lipids, including dihydro-S1P, S1P, LPA, PA, and glycerol 3-phosphate. S1P inhibited the dihydro-S1P phosphohydrolase activity as efficiently as dihydro-S1P (Fig. 3 C). However, LPA, PA, and glycerol 3-phosphate had little inhibitory effect (Fig. 3 C). These results indicated that hSPP2 is a phosphohydrolase specific to sphingoid base 1-phosphates. A previous study demonstrated that SPP1s are Mg2+-independent phosphohydrolases (7Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To examine the requirement of Mg2+ for the SPP2 activity, the S1P phosphohydrolase assay was performed in the presence of the metal chelator EDTA. The activity of SPP was not affected by 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4). Furthermore, addition of 10 mm Mg2+ did not enhance the phosphohydrolase activity (data not shown). These results indicated that SPP2 is also a Mg2+-independent phosphohydrolase. We next examined the effects of various phosphatase inhibitors such as NaF, sodium orthovanadate, and β-glycerol phosphate, as well as Triton X-100 on the SPP2 activity. Previous studies demonstrated that NaF, sodium orthovanadate, and Triton X-100 have strong inhibitory effects on SPP1 activity, whereas β-glycerol phosphate is not effective (6Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar to SPP1, SPP2 was significantly inhibited by 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and 0.2% Triton X-100 but not by 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate (Fig. 4). In contrast, 10 mm NaF, which efficiently inhibited the SPP1 activity, had no effect on the SPP2 activity (Fig. 4). Moreover, even 100 mm NaF did not inhibit the SPP2 activity (data not shown). S1P can act both extracellularly, via cell surface Edg family receptors, and intracellularly. Therefore, it is important to distinguish whether hSPP2 plays a role in attenuating intracellular or extracellular S1P signaling. For this purpose, we performed an indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analysis to determine the localization of hSPP2. HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with a pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA were subjected to immunostaining with anti-HA antibody. Fig. 5 A shows a reticular immunofluorescence staining pattern apparent in the perinuclear and cytosolic regions. This staining pattern was attributable to localization of hSPP2-HA in the ER, because it was superimposable upon the pattern of ER stained by an antibody against the ER retention signal, KDEL (Fig. 5 A). This staining pattern of hSPP2 was similar to that of mSPP1 (Fig. 5 B), which also co-localized with anti-KDEL antibody (data not shown). This result about the localization of mSPP1 is consistent with the recent report by Spiegel and co-workers (20Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that some fraction of hSPP2 is localized to the plasma membrane, we performed an immunofluorescence microscopic analysis using non-permeabilized cells. HEK 293 cells co-transfected with pEGFP-C1 and pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA were fixed and treated with or without Triton X-100, and hSPP2-HA was immunostained with anti-HA antibody. Permeabilized cells exhibiting green fluorescence protein fluorescence were stained with HA antibody (Fig. 5 C), indicating that pEGFP-C1 and pcDNA3 hSPP2-HA were efficiently co-introduced. However, when the permeabilization step was omitted, cells exhibited only green fluorescence protein fluorescence and were not stained with HA antibody (Fig. 5 D). This result indicated that permeabilization was essential for staining of hSPP2-HA. Thus, SPP2 may function in the ER to dephosphorylate intracellular S1P. To compare the tissue distribution patterns of SPP1 and SPP2 mRNAs, we first examined the expression of hSPP1 mRNA in human tissues by Northern blotting. Similar to previously reported data for mSPP1 mRNA (6Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), hSPP1 mRNA was found to be ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 6 A). A predominant 3.4-kb hSPP1 mRNA species was detected in all tissues, but the species varied in levels. The levels of the species were highest in placenta and kidney and lowest in peripheral blood and small intestine. A 1.0-kb transcript, which may be a spliced isoform, was detected only in placenta (Fig. 6 A, lane 10). In contrast, the expression of hSPP2 mRNA was rather tissue-specific (Fig. 6 B). We observed two mRNAs of 5.1 and 1.7 kb in size, and the 5.1-kb mRNA was detected in brain, heart, colon, kidney, small intestine, and lung but not in skeletal muscle, thymus, spleen, liver, placenta, and peripheral blood leukocyte (Fig. 6 B). The expression levels of the 5.1-kb mRNA were highest in kidney and heart. The expression pattern of the 1.7-kb mRNA was similar but weaker than that of the 5.1-kb mRNA (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the expression pattern of SPP2 was quite different from that for SPP1. In summary, we identified a second S1P phosphohydrolase that shows similar activity, substrate specificity, and localization to previously identified SPP1s. Sequence and substrate specificity of hSPP2 confirm that SPP2 belongs to the SPP family. Although the expression patterns of SPP1 and SPP2 were quite different, both were expressed abundantly in kidney. It is unclear why two such S1P phosphohydrolases with similar enzymatic properties exist in the same tissue. However, yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae also contains two sphingoid base 1-phosphate phosphatases, Lcb3p and Ysr3p, which also share similar enzyme activity and substrate specificity (8Mao C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and which are both localized to the ER (21Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In synthetic complete medium the Δlcb3 mutant, but not the Δysr3 mutant, was significantly protected from loss of viability after severe heat shock (9Mandala S.M. Thornton R., Tu, Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the Δysr3 mutant showed a dramatic enhancement in survival when cultured in YPD medium (9Mandala S.M. Thornton R., Tu, Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, transcription of YSR3 was up-regulated by heat shock (9Mandala S.M. Thornton R., Tu, Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Lcb3p and Ysr3p are differentially regulated by growth and stress conditions. Therefore, it is possible that SPP1 and SPP2 are differentially regulated by unidentified conditions and have different roles in such conditions. Additional work will be needed to determine their specific function and regulation. We thank A. Wada for the pcDNA3 HA-4 plasmid."

Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The photocycle of phot1 LOV2 has been elucidated in part (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J.

Blue light irradiation excites the FMN chromophore to a triplet state that absorbs maximally around 660 nm (designated LOV2L660) (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W.

The adduct thermally decays back to the ground state on a time scale of many seconds and is proposed to be the protein signaling state (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I.

Despite the above progress made in understanding the phot1 LOV2 photochemistry, specific mechanistic and conformational steps of the photocycle remain to be elucidated. Adduct decay for the LOV2 domain of oat phot1 has been shown to be 3 times slower in D2O than in H2O (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol.

To date, no comparable information has been established regarding the mechanism of adduct formation. Furthermore, negligible protein motions were detected during the photocycle in crystals of the LOV2 domain of fern phy3 (19Crosson S. Moffat K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), whereas major shifts in the amide proton region were reported in a one-dimensional NMR study of the LOV2 photocycle of oat phot1 (18Salomon M. Eisenreich W. Durr H. Schleicher E. Knieb E. Massey V. Rudiger W. Muller F. Bacher A. Richter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To elucidate the photocycle mechanism and structural changes further, we measured the D2O and pH dependences of oat phot1 LOV2 photocycle kinetics and monitored light-induced changes of the circular dichroism spectrum in the far UV region, where spectral bands are typically attributed to protein secondary structure. Significant D2O effects were observed but only minor pH effects. In addition, changes in the far UV CD spectrum of LOV2 were observed and may represent a reversible change in α-helicity during the photocycle. We also show that the light-induced changes in the far UV CD spectrum relax on the same time scale as those in the visible region.

Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The LOV domains were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by calmodulin affinity chromatography (Stratagene). Purified samples were washed into clean buffer (5 mm Tris, 5 mm NaCl, pH 8) using centrifugal concentrators (Continental Lab Products, San Diego, CA) and were centrifuged and/or filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by absorption spectroscopy using a Hewlett Packard HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer with ε447(LOV2) = 13,800 m−1cm−1 (14Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Difference spectra in the 30-ns to 690-ms time window were collected on an instrument described previously (21Lewis J.W. Kliger D.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 2828-2833Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A dye laser pumped by the third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser provided a 10-ns, 80-μJ/mm2light pulse at 477 nm. A fresh sample was provided for each laser flash, allowing the averaging of absorbance data of several samples. The laser pulse traversed the sample perpendicular to the path of white light from a flashlamp that was used to probe the absorbance change in the sample. The optical path lengths for the probe light and laser were 2 and 0.5 mm, respectively. The white light used to probe absorbance was linearly polarized at the magic angle (54.7°) relative to the laser polarization axis to prevent rotational diffusion artifacts (22Kliger D.S. Lewis J.W. Randall C.E. Polarized Light in Optics and Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., Boston1990Google Scholar). The temperature for all measurements was about 20 °C. As described previously (15Swartz T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), difference spectra in the 1–100-s time range were collected on an HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer at room temperature. The optical path length was 1 cm, and the excitation pulse was provided by a white light camera strobe flash. Data were analyzed using programs written in a Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) as described previously (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Briefly, data matrices were constructed and subjected to singular value decomposition followed by global exponential fitting (23Hug S.J. Lewis J.W. Einterz C.M. Thorgeirsson T.E. Kliger D.S.

The exponents contain the apparent rate constants for the observed kinetic changes, and the amplitudes at different wavelengths represent the spectral changes associated with the exponential process and are called the b-spectra (23Hug S.J.

Protein samples were divided into two equivalent aliquots and were lyophilized overnight in the dark as described previously (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). One aliquot was then reconstituted in H2O and the other in D2O. Protein samples (5 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl) began at pH 8. The pH was changed in a stepwise manner using 0.5–1 m HCl or NaOH and was monitored with a Corning Digital 110 meter and a Beckman Futura (model 511063; Fullerton, CA) semimicro AgCl combination electrode. Protein CD spectra were recorded using an Aviv 60DS CD spectrometer. A lid for the CD instrument was constructed containing shutters for blocking the CD lamp and detector, and a hole was made for a light guide that fit directly into the top of the cuvettes. Thus, samples placed into the CD sample chamber were in complete darkness while the CD lamp and detector were blocked and the external lamp was off. The adduct form was induced by 20 s of white light irradiation from an external 100-watt tungsten halogen lamp via the light guide. We observed no spectral or kinetic differences resulting from the use of white or blue light. The CD measuring lamp itself was not observed to be actinic. Full spectra were recorded at 2 °C in order to prolong the adduct form (14Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Spectra were smoothed using the smoothing program in SigmaPlot (SPSS Science). Using the same irradiation method described above, we monitored relaxation kinetics by CD at wavelengths of 450, 290, 222, and 208 nm at 20 °C. Control experiments were conducted at 500 and 250 nm, wavelengths at which little difference is observed between dark and light spectra (data not shown). Points were recorded every 1 s for 700 s at 20 °C. In the visible/near UV region (260–500 nm) 15 μm protein was used in a 1-cm path length rectangular cuvette; in the far UV region (190–250 nm), 7 μm protein was used in a 0.1-cm path length rectangular cuvette. Relaxation kinetics by CD were also measured at 10 and 4 °C for calculation of activation energy. We previously demonstrated by nanosecond laser spectroscopy (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol.

Using the same technique, we measured changes in the absorption difference spectrum of LOV2 in H2O and in D2O between 30 ns and 690 ms after an excitation flash. The flavin triplet state decayed in H2O with an apparent time constant 2In this work, the time constant (denoted τ) is used interchangeably with lifetime, which refers to 63% (e.g. (1/e)) reaction completion and is equal to the reciprocal of the apparent rate constant,k app. Accordingly, for branched reactions,k app = 1/τapp = 1/τ1+ 1/τ2 + … + 1/τn and τapp = (t 12) (ln 2). of 3 μs (data not shown), slightly slower than our previously reported value (15Swartz T.

A small difference in temperature could account for the difference in rate. Fig. 1 A shows the absorption difference spectra of LOV2 in D2O. Global exponential analysis of the measured difference spectra indicates a single first order process with an apparent time constant of 14 μs, almost 5 times slower than in H2O. The residuals (the difference between spectral data and calculated data from the exponential fitting) show no significant spectral features. Theinset of Fig. 1 A shows the relative first-order rates in H2O and D2O, approximated by the decay of the 660-nm band alone. Fig. 1 B shows the corresponding b-spectra that resulted from the global exponential analysis. The single exponential fit indicates that two unique spectra (represented byb 1 and b 0) exist over the time course of the measurements, where each spectrum represents at least one species. The b 1-spectrum represents the difference between the spectra of the first (present at 30 ns) and final (persisting at 690 ms) intermediates and corresponds to the apparent decay time constant of 14 μs. Theb 0-spectrum is the spectrum of the final intermediate referenced against the ground form. We showed previously that the b 1-spectrum resembles the difference spectrum of the FMN triplet state and that theb 0-spectrum is spectrally consistent with a flavin-cysteinyl adduct (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The presence of an isosbestic point (at about 420 nm) is also consistent with a two-state system, as observed previously (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Therefore, the b 1- andb 0-spectra in Fig. 1 B, which are nearly identical to those produced in H2O (data not shown) (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), represent the same transitions of the triplet state to the FMN-cysteinyl adduct and the ground form, respectively, as reported earlier (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Absolute spectra for the triplet state (LOV2L660) and adduct form (LOV2S390) were calculated previously (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) by adding to each intermediate spectrum (calculated from theb-spectra) enough ground state absorption spectrum to remove the bleach at 450 nm fully. Twice as much ground state absorption spectrum was required to remove the bleach in the first intermediate spectrum (calculated from b 1) as in the second intermediate spectrum (calculated from b 0). Hence, twice as much bleach at 450 nm exists in the triplet state as in the adduct form, and therefore the triplet state apparently decays into equal amounts of ground state and adduct. The apparent time constant of 3 μs for triplet decay in H2O therefore represents two equivalent time constants2 of 6 μs (for return to ground state and for adduct formation), as observed previously (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In D2O, the triplet state was also observed to decay equally to the adduct form and to the ground state, resulting in time constants of 28 μs for both adduct formation and triplet relaxation to the ground state. We showed previously that light irradiation of the LOV2C39A mutant, which lacks the sulfur group required to form the adduct, produces the triplet state, which then relaxes back to the ground state (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type, only a negligible D2O effect was observed for the truncated photocycle of the LOV2C39A mutant. The collected difference spectra are shown in Fig. 2 A. The time constant observed for decay of the triplet state to the ground state is 72 μs in H2O and 80 μs in D2O; the relative rates are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2 A. As can be seen from the difference spectra, the decay of the 660-nm band is concomitant with the full recovery of the bleaching at 450 nm, indicating that no spectrally observable intermediates are formed during triplet decay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, global analysis results in a b 1-spectrum that is consistent with the one from wild type LOV2 and a b 0-spectrum of zero. To probe the dependence of light-induced adduct formation on proton transfers further, we monitored triplet decay at the same time values used above from pH 6.3 to 9.5. We stayed within this range to minimize pH-dependent aggregation of LOV2 that occurs in solution at protein concentrations sufficient to show significant changes by absorption spectroscopy. The difference spectra andb-spectra obtained were the same as previously observed (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, only a slight effect on the rate of adduct formation was observed from pH 6.3 to pH 9.5. The time constant for triplet decay is near 2.5 μs at all pH values measured. The relative pH insensitivity of adduct formation indicates that titratable groups in the chromophore and mechanistically relevant protein residues are not titrated within this pH range. This finding is consistent with our previous results that showed no change in chromophore fluorescence intensity between pH 5.5 and 10 (15). We showed previously by absorption difference spectroscopy that the FMN-cysteinyl adduct decays back to the ground form with a half-life2 of about 45 s (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Here, we measured the rate of decay of the adduct form between pH 3.7 and 9.8. Slow chromophore release occurred below pH 5, as previously reported (15Swartz T. Corchnoy S. Christie J. Lewis J. Szundi I. Briggs W. Bogomolni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, the back-reaction kinetics were sufficiently slow to allow for longer signal integration times than were possible when measuring adduct formation. Further, samples restored to neutral pH showed recovered spectral and kinetic properties except for the expected loss of bleaching intensity due to some irreversible chromophore release. We were therefore able to acquire difference spectra down to pH 3.7. The difference spectra were unaffected by the presence of released FMN, because it does not undergo a photocycle on the slow time scale of the protein. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the rate of adduct decay was constant from high pH to about pH 7, below which a reproducible decrease in rate of about only 40% was apparent. The CD spectrum of the LOV2 ground form in the visible/near UV range was previously reported (14Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We extended the measurement to the far UV range, which contains protein secondary structural information. The solid linesin Fig. 4 represent the CD spectra obtained for the ground state of LOV2 from 500 to 260 nm (Fig. 4 A) and from 250 to 190 nm (Fig. 4 B). As previously shown (14Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), there are negative CD bands in the 350–500-nm range that coincide in wavelength with all of the absorption bands of the chromophore. The visible wavelength bands represent only the FMN chromophore, because there are no protein groups absorbing at these wavelengths. In addition to these optically active chromophore bands, there are CD-active positive and negative bands in the protein aromatic residue region (λmax ∼280 nm), where flavin chromophores have substantially stronger absorption (λmax∼270 nm) than individual aromatic protein residues. In the far UV range (Fig. 4 B), LOV2 shows a CD spectrum typical of a protein that contains significant fractions of α-helical and β-sheet structure (26Fasman, G. D. (ed) (1996) Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules, pp. 47-74, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The peptide bond has strong absorption bands at about 215 nm and below 200 nm. CD bands in this region arise from electronic transitions of the peptide bond in particular structural conformations. The observed double minimum at 222 and 208 nm and maximum around 195 nm are signature features of helical secondary structure. These bands represent the n → π* transition (∼222 nm) and exciton split π → π* transition (∼190 and 208 nm) of peptide bonds and have high extinction coefficients in the α-helical conformation. For the β-sheet conformation, the transitions occur at 215 nm and at 175 and 198 nm, respectively, with lower extinction coefficients than observed for the α-helix conformation. The primary absorption of the exciton split π → π* transition occurs around 190 nm, such that its intensity is typically stronger than that at 208 nm. This ratio is not observed in the absolute far UV spectrum of LOV2, suggesting that there are contributions to the spectrum other than α-helix and β-sheet. The LOV2 fusion protein used in this work, shown in Fig. 5 A, contains a 46-residue segment from the cloning expression vector and calmodulin-binding peptide, plus 10 native oat phot1 residues, that are N-terminal to the 107-residue LOV2 domain (11Huala E. Oeller P.W. Liscum E. Han I.-S. Larsen E. Briggs W.R. Science. 1997; 278: 2120-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and 50 additional native oat phot1 residues C-terminal to the LOV2 domain. The peptide bonds of these additional residues contribute to the far UV CD spectrum. The FMN chromophore is also expected to contribute to the spectrum, although only weakly. Free FMN in aqueous and organic solvents shows a positive CD band (λmax ∼222 nm) that is similar in magnitude to a single peptide bond (this work, data not shown) (27Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1720-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Harders H. Forster S. Voelter W. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3360-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For comparison, Fig. 4 B shows the molar ellipticity (CD magnitude) normalized to the concentration of protein (left axis) and peptide bonds (right axis). The LOV2 domain binds a single FMN chromophore such that the protein concentration is the same as the FMN concentration, whereas the peptide bond concentration is about 200 times larger because there is about one peptide bond per amino acid residue. The right axis in Fig. 4 B, which represents the per residue CD intensity, is therefore about 200 times smaller in magnitude than that of the left axis. In order for FMN to make a significant contribution to the LOV2 far UV spectrum, the protein-bound FMN would have to acquire a CD magnitude large enough to compete with about 200 amino acid residues; in other words, the FMN would have to increase its CD magnitude by a few orders of magnitude. The CD spectrum for LOV2 in the far UV range (Fig. 4 B) is therefore expected to reflect primarily CD from the peptide bond and thus reflects protein secondary structure. The spectrum is consistent with the α + β tertiary structure classification (26Fasman, G. D. (ed) (1996) Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analys"

The observation that Pex5p is predominantly found in the cytosol with only a small fraction associated with the peroxisome led several authors to propose the so-called cycling receptor mechanism (8Dodt G.

According to this model, newly synthesized PTS1-containing peroxisomal proteins would be recognized by cytosolic Pex5p, transported to the surface of the peroxisome, and translocated across the membrane of the organelle. Experimental evidence compatible with this model was first provided by Dodt and Gould (11Dodt G. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), reversible accumulation of Pex5p at the peroxisomal compartment could be demonstrated in vivo by manipulating ATP levels and temperature in cultured human fibroblasts. More recently, Dammai and Subramani (12Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were able to show that Pex5p goes through multiple rounds of cycling between the cytosol and the peroxisome. Peroxisomal membrane docking, translocation of cargo proteins, and recycling of Pex5p requires a complex machinery. In the last years, more than 20 peroxins have been identified in several organisms, most of them involved in the Pex5p-mediated peroxisomal protein import (reviewed in Refs. 1Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 623-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 2Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge on the mechanism by which peroxisomal matrix proteins are translocated across the organelle membrane is still very limited. Much of what is known regarding this matter derives either from steady-state level analysis of peroxisomal Pex5p on several mutant cell lines (e.g. Ref. 13Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or from studies aiming at the characterization of peroxin-peroxin interactions (see Ref. 14Fransen M. Brees C. Ghys K. Amery L. Mannaerts G.P. Ladant D. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and references cited therein). Collectively, these data provide the basis for a model in which peroxins are classified into three functional groups: 1) docking proteins; 2) proteins involved in the translocation of matrix proteins across the peroxisomal membrane; and 3) proteins mediating the release (recycling) of Pex5p from the peroxisomal compartment (reviewed in Refs. 1Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 623-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 2Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although many aspects of this model may indeed be correct, the recent isolation of stable protein complexes comprising peroxins belonging to different functional groups raises some questions regarding this classification (15Albertini M. Girzalsky W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

Here, we provide data suggesting that insertion of Pex5p into the peroxisomal membrane requires Pex14p, a proposed docking protein (17Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.

However, Pex14p-associated Pex5p exposes the majority of its mass into the peroxisomal matrix suggesting that translocation of cargo proteins into the matrix of the organelle occurs concomitantly with the formation of the Pex5p-Pex14p membrane complex. Furthermore, Pex14p-associated Pex5p is exported from the peroxisomal compartment in an ATP-dependent process. Thus, our results suggest, on one hand, that translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins across the organelle membrane occurs through a Pex14p-containing structure via Pex5p, raising the possibility that no other peroxins other than Pex5p interact with the PTS1-containing proteins during the membrane translocation event and, on the other hand, that Pex5p is retained at the peroxisomal membrane during all steps of this process.

This plasmid was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 35S-Labeled Pex5p was synthesized using the translation kit Reticulocyte Type II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [35S]methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) following the standard conditions of the manufacturer. Post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) from rat liver were prepared from male Wistar rats (1–2 months of age). Livers were rapidly removed and homogenized in SEM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2). PNS fractions were obtained by centrifuging the homogenate two times at 600 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the PNS fraction (at 40–60 mg/ml) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. These fractions remain import-competent for at least 1 month. Import reactions (100 μl final volume) were performed in import buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.2% (w/v) lipid-free bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm methionine) using 150 μg of rat liver PNS protein and 0.5 μl of the reticulocyte lysate containing35S-labeled Pex5p. In some experiments the concentration of lipid-free bovine serum albumin in the import buffer was decreased to 0.002% (w/v) (import buffer B). Where indicated, nucleotides (100 mm stock solutions, pH 7.2, with NaOH; Sigma) were used at 1 mm final concentration. The contributions of the reticulocyte lysate and rat liver PNS fraction to the levels of ATP in import reactions were not determined experimentally. Nevertheless, considering the total adenine nucleotide pool present in the reticulocyte lysate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and rat liver (23Zuurendonk P.F. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 333: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), this value was estimated to be lower than 36 μm. At the end of the import reaction, the samples were treated with proteinase K (300 μg/ml final concentration) for 30 min at 4 °C. The protease was inhibited with 500 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride (added from a 50 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol) for 2 min on ice. The import reaction was diluted to 1 ml with SEM buffer and the organelles were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. Under these conditions optimum import of Pex5p is observed at 26 °C (tested temperatures: 0, 8, 16, 26, and 37 °C) and occurs linearly during the first 45 min of incubation (data not shown). In antibody inhibition experiments, 150 μg of PNS protein, in 30 μl of import buffer, were preincubated with 20 μg of purified immunoglobins (5 μg/μl in PBS) for 20 min on ice before starting the import reaction. GST-Pex5p and GST recombinant proteins were used in import reactions at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Two aliquots of a PNS fraction (1.3 mg of protein) were incubated in import buffer either in the presence or absence (mock-treated sample) of 5 μl of a reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Pex5p. At the end of the incubation (30 min at 26 °C) both samples were treated with proteinase K as described above. The protease was inhibited and the organelles were diluted with 1 ml of SEM buffer containing 50 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride and 1:100 (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C) to sediment the organelles,35S-labeled Pex5p (0.1 μl) was then added to the mock-treated sample. To avoid nonimport related Pex5p-Pex14p interactions, 10 μg of GST-Pex5p was added to each tube. Both samples were then solubilized in 1.3 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm potassium acetate-acetic acid, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, and 1:100 (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitors mixture) for 15 min on ice and subjected to centrifugation (60,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) to remove insoluble material. One aliquot (100 μl) of each supernatant was kept on ice during the rest of the procedure and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation (10% (w/v) final concentration) before SDS-PAGE analysis. The remaining supernatants were divided into two halves.

Transport of PTS1-containing proteins across the peroxisomal membrane requires the concerted action of many different peroxins. Although a significant fraction of this machinery resides and functions in the peroxisomal compartment, there are several peroxins (Pex5p included) that seem to exist in a dynamic equilibrium between the cytosol and the peroxisome. Furthermore, presently, the involvement of other subcellular compartments in the process of peroxisomal biogenesis cannot be formally excluded (reviewed in Ref. 27Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we just decided to use a PNS to set up a peroxisomal in vitro import system. To test the validity of this strategy, in vitro synthesized35S-labeled Pex5p (the large isoform (20Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Otera H. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E. Nishimura M. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Ohashi K. Higuchi O. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 388-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was incubated with a rat liver PNS in import buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mmATPγS or no exogenous nucleotides. After 30 min at 26 °C, the samples were put on ice and treated with proteinase K to degrade nonimported Pex5p. The organelles were then isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1 A, in the presence of exogenous ATP, a small fraction of the 35S-labeled Pex5p used in these experiments (1–5%) resisted the protease treatment (lane 2). Most importantly, the vast majority of this protease-resistant Pex5p population (hereafter referred to as stage 2 Pex5p; see “Discussion”) does not represent the full-length peroxin; a 2-kDa fragment was clipped from Pex5p by the action of proteinase K. As shown before, this is exactly the proteolytic profile of Pex5p present in highly pure rat liver peroxisomes (22Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that the in vitro synthesized Pex5p entered the peroxisomal compartment. In the absence of exogenous nucleotides, two protease-resistant Pex5p populations were observed (lane 1): full-length Pex5p (hereafter referred to as stage 3 Pex5p) and a 2-kDa truncated form (stage 2 Pex5p; see later). All attempts to degrade stage 3 Pex5p, leaving stage 2 Pex5p intact, have failed (data not shown); stage 3 Pex5p can only be degraded under conditions that disrupt biological membranes (see below). The fact that35S-labeled Pex5p acquires a protease-resistant location in the absence of exogenous nucleotides could imply that the observed import does not require ATP. Alternatively, the low levels of ATP present under these conditions (derived from both the PNS fraction and the reticulocyte lysate; see “Experimental Procedures”) may be sufficient to promote this process. The result obtained when ATPγS is used in an import assay favors this last possibility, the amount of protease-resistant Pex5p is highly decreased (lane 3). A similar inhibition on the import of 35S-labeled Pex5p was observed in the presence of AMP-PNP or when the reaction components were pretreated with apyrase (data not shown). To provide evidence regarding the peroxisomal location of in vitro imported Pex5p, import experiments in the presence or absence of exogenous ATP were performed. After import, one-half of each import reaction was treated with proteinase K; the other halves received buffer only. The samples were then loaded onto the top of discontinuous Nycodenz gradients and centrifuged. The gradients were fractionated, and the distributions of in vitro synthesized Pex5p, endogenous Pex14p, and several marker enzymes were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 B (panels A and B), both catalase and endogenous Pex14p display a dual behavior under these conditions: one fraction is recovered in fractions 2 and 3 and corresponds to highly pure peroxisomes; the other fraction remains at the top of the gradient and probably reflects the existence of peroxisomes of lower density (28Lüers G. Hashimoto T. Fahimi H.D. Völkl A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) together with some disrupted organelles. When the behavior of 35S-labeled Pex5p in the samples not treated with protease is analyzed, a quite asymmetric distribution is observed (Fig. 1 B, panel C; shown only for the sample subjected to import in the presence of exogenous ATP). Most of the radiolabeled protein remains at the top of the gradient and only a small fraction is found in fractions 2 and 3. The majority (but not all) of the 35S-labeled Pex5p staying at the top of gradient represents nonimported peroxin, as expected. Indeed, when the behaviors of stage 2 Pex5p (panel D) and stage 2 plus stage 3 Pex5p (panel E) are analyzed a more symmetric distribution, paralleling the one displayed by endogenous Pex14p, is observed. Clearly, both peroxisomal populations detected in these kinds of gradients are import-competent for Pex5p. Taken together, these data indicate that in vitrosynthesized Pex5p can be specifically imported into peroxisomes. Previously, we provided data suggesting that endogenous Pex5p from rat liver peroxisomes is a subunit of a Pex14p-containing complex (16Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M., Sá- Miranda C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several authors have proposed that Pex14p is the docking protein for Pex5p (17Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Fransen M. Terlecky S.R. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, the possible involvement of Pex14p on the in vitro import of Pex5p was assessed on both functional and structural levels. We first asked whether antibodies directed to Pex14p block in vitro import of Pex5p. For this purpose, rat liver PNS fractions were preincubated with IgGs directed to either Pex14p or PMP70 (the most abundant peroxisomal membrane protein (26Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and subjected to an import reaction. The relative amounts of Pex5p in stage 2 and stage 3 in the two samples were compared. As shown in Fig. 2 A, IgGs directed to Pex14p strongly inhibit the appearance of protease-protected Pex5p. Virtually the same inhibition was observed when the import reaction was performed in the presence of ATP (data not shown). These experiments were also performed using Fab fragments directed to Pex14p. Although these Fab fragments were as efficient as the precursor IgGs in recognizing Pex14p in Western blots, we were unable to see an inhibitory effect of these fragments on the in vitro import rate of Pex5p (data not shown). It is likely that the observed import inhibition with anti-Pex14p IgGs results from sterical hindrance effects and not by blocking of the Pex5p-binding site on Pex14p. The Pex5p-binding domain of Pex14p (comprising the first 78 amino acid residues of Pex14p (29Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) is probably not exposed into the cytosol (30Will G.K. Soukupova M. Hong X. Erdmann K.S. Kiel J.A. Dodt G. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 2A. M. Gouveia, C. P. Guimarães, M. E. Oliveira, C. Reguenga, C. Sá-Miranda, and J. E. Azevedo, unpublished observations. Thus, taken together, these data do not prove that Pex14p is the initial peroxisomal docking protein for Pex5p, but they do indicate that Pex14p and/or some Pex14p-bound component(s) is functionally involved in the formation of stage 2 and/or stage 3 Pex5p. Data demonstrating a structural involvement of Pex14p on the import pathway of Pex5p was obtained as follows. 35S-Labeled Pex5p was subjected to an import reaction in the absence of exogenous ATP. After proteinase K treatment, the organelles were solubilized using a mild detergent and subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-Pex14p antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p can be co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-Pex14p antibody. Control experiments (see legend to Fig. 2) clearly indicate that the observed immunoprecipitation is specific and occurs only when35S-labeled Pex5p was subjected to an import reaction. Based on these data, we conclude that both stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p are components of a Pex14p-containing complex. As shown above, when 35S-labeled Pex5p is subjected to an import reaction in the absence of exogenous ATP, two different protease-resistant populations (stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p) are obtained. When the import kinetics of these two species are analyzed (see Fig. 3), no clear relationship between stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p can be established, although it seems that stage 2 Pex5p can be detected earlier than stage 3 Pex5p. To clarify this point, we tried to explore the fact that recombinant GST-Pex5p inhibits the import of in vitro synthesized Pex5p into peroxisomes (see Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, in the absence of exogenous ATP, GST-Pex5p is unable to displace stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p from the peroxisomal compartment (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of ATP a different result is obtained. After addition of the recombinant protein to the import reaction, the amount of stage 2 Pex5p decreases slowly over time (Fig. 4 B). There are two possibilities to explain this result: either GST-Pex5p is displacing35S-labeled Pex5p from the peroxisomal compartment in an ATP-dependent process; or, more likely, in vitrosynthesized Pex5p simply exits the peroxisome under these conditions (as observed for the endogenous peroxin, see below), in a process that is not directly related to the presence of GST-Pex5p but that can only be detected when import de novo is blocked. Independently of the reasons behind this event, we reasoned that the properties displayed by GST-Pex5p could still be explored to establish a relationship between stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p. For this purpose, two in vitro pulse-chase import experiments were performed. In the first experiment, Pex5p was imported into peroxisomes for 20 min in the presence of ATP. GST-Pex5p was then added to stop de novo import of Pex5p and, 7 min later, ATPγS (1 mm final concentration) was added to the import reaction (import of Pex5p in the presence of equimolar amounts of ATP and ATPγS results in the formation of stage 2 and stage 3 Pex5p; data not shown). Aliquots of the import reaction were removed at several time points and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5, stage 2 Pex5p can be transformed into stage 3 Pex5p upon addition of ATPγS. In the second experiment,in vitro synthesized Pex5p was subjected to an import reaction in the absence of exogenous ATP. After 20 min, import of Pex5p was stopped by adding GST-Pex5p and a chase in the presence of ATP (1 mm final concentration) was done. Stage 3 Pex5p disappears rapidly from the peroxisomal compartment; the amount of stage 2 Pex5p also decreases but in a slower way. Taken together, these experiments suggest that stage 2 Pex5p is the precursor of stage 3 Pex5p and that this population of peroxisomal Pex5p is capable of exiting the organelle in an ATP-dependent process.

We have previously identified a structural motif in the second transmembrane helix of CCR5, which plays a crucial role in the mechanism of receptor activation. We now report the specific role of aromatic residues in helices 2 and 3 of CCR5 in this mechanism. Using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling in a combined approach, we demonstrate that a cluster of aromatic residues at the extracellular border of these two helices are involved in chemokine-induced activation. These aromatic residues are involved in interhelical interactions that are key for the conformation of the helices and govern the functional response to chemokines in a ligand-specific manner. We therefore suggest that transmembrane helices 2 and 3 contain important structural elements for the activation mechanism of chemokine receptors, and possibly other related receptors as well.

Not only are chemokines and their receptors now considered as the main organizers of leukocyte trafficking, they have also been associated to an ever increasing number of physiopathological disorders (for review, see Refs. 1Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar and 2Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In particular, some chemokine receptors are used by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 as coreceptors (in addition to CD4) to infect target cells (reviewed in Ref. 3Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Among these, CCR5 has been shown to be essential for HIV pathogenesis, as individuals homozygous for the CCR5Δ32 mutation, which results in the synthesis of a non-functional receptor, are highly (although not fully) resistant to HIV infection. Chemokine receptors belong to the rhodopsin-like family (family A) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). CCR5 binds and responds to four natural chemokines, RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2, with nanomolar affinities (4Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our current understanding of the activation mechanisms of GPCRs is rapidly evolving, thanks to the availability of the crystal structure of the inactive state of one of its members, rhodopsin, and to the growing amount of biochemical and physicochemical data that can help in identifying the key aspects of this process (for review, see Refs. 5Meng E.C. Bourne H.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholarand 6Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). It is now well accepted that the transition from inactive to active states requires the reorganization of the transmembrane bundle made of seven imperfect α-helices. In the rhodopsin-like family, motions of transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) and TM6 during the activation process have been identified (7Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 8Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rigid-body movements have also been proposed for TM5 and TM7 (10Marjamaki A. Frang H. Pihlavisto M. Hoffren A.M. Salminen T. Johnson M.S. Kallio J. Javitch J.A. Scheinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21867-21872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Abdulaev N.G. Ridge K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of these conformational changes have been observed in a diverse set of receptors (mainly rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor), and it is believed that they constitute a common conformational path in the activation process, ultimately leading to the release of GDP in the bound G protein and its exchange for GTP.A striking feature within the rhodopsin-like GPCR family is that, despite a strong sequence conservation of the transmembrane helices, there is a wide structural diversity among extracellular ligands, ranging from small neurotransmitters to large glycoproteins. The structural adaptation of a receptor to its cognate ligand is expected to involve, in most cases, sequence specificity in the extracellular domains (for which sequence conservation is much lower across the family), but also in the transmembrane region, which holds the binding pocket of small ligands (for reviews, see Refs. 6Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar and 12Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Therefore, each receptor must have evolved specific structural characteristics to link the specific recognition of its cognate ligand to what is believed to constitute a common activation process (e.g. motion of TM6). Thus, for each receptor subfamily, specific structural features needed for the activation by agonists are expected to be found.In the case of chemokine receptors, we have recently identified a structural motif in TM2, which is central for chemokine-induced activation (13Govaerts C. Blanpain C. Deupi X. Ballet S. Ballesteros J.A. Wodak S.J. Vassart G. Pardo L. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This motif, which consists of a proline preceded by a threonine two residues ahead (TXP), is found only in chemokine receptors and a few related peptide receptors. Our study indicated that the extracellular part of TM2, whose conformation is governed by the TXP motif, is clearly involved in the activation process, as specific mutations of the motif led to unaffected chemokine binding but strong impairment of receptor activation (13Govaerts C. Blanpain C. Deupi X. Ballet S. Ballesteros J.A. Wodak S.J. Vassart G. Pardo L. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, modeling studies performed on this region suggested that, because of the action of the proline, the extracellular part of TM2 would strongly interact with TM3. This organization is structurally different from that of bovine rhodopsin, in which a TM2-TM1 interaction is found.As a follow-up of these observations, we have now investigated the possible role of the TM2-TM3 interface in the activation process of chemokine receptors. A sequence alignment of chemokine receptors (Fig. 1) reveals that the extracellular parts of TM2 and TM3 contain many aromatic residues. Within the rhodopsin template, these residues are located at relatively short distances, suggesting that they might form an aromatic cluster within the three-dimensional structure of the receptors. Aromatic residues have been proposed to be involved in the activation mechanism in various GPCRs (14Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R.

Among other examples, a role was attributed to such residues in the ligand selectivity and ligand-induced activation of the D2 and D4 dopamine receptors (20Javitch J.A. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H.

The high density of aromatic residues at the top of TM2 and TM3 in chemokine receptors suggested that aromatic side chains could mediate interactions between these helices.In the present study, we have mutated the aromatic residues of CCR5 TM2 and TM3 into their CCR2 counterparts, either individually or in combination, and the mutants were tested for cell-surface expression, receptor conformation, ligand binding, and functional response. Molecular modeling of the transmembrane region of CCR5 has been performed, providing a structural framework to interpret these data. Integration of the experimental and molecular modeling data indicates that aromatic residues at the TM2-TM3 interface are crucial to the mechanism of receptor activation and suggests that this aromatic cluster plays a key role in the conformational changes of CCR5, leading from ligand recognition to receptor activation.RESULTSTo investigate the possible role of aromatic residues at the TM2-TM3 interface in defining the structure and function of the CCR5 receptor, we have compared the amino acid sequences of CCR2 and CCR5 (Fig. 1 B). These receptors are strongly related, sharing ∼85% sequence identity within their TM helices. However, their extracellular domains are much more divergent, which certainly contributes to their strong selectivity toward their respective ligands (35Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The TM2-TM3 aromatic cluster was found to be quite divergent between the two receptors. This could suggest that these positions are not important for the structure and/or function of the receptors and therefore highly tolerant to variability. Alternatively, these positions could be functionally important although specific to each receptor, and the various substitutions would be expected in this case to be correlated. To study the functional consequences of the differences at aromatic positions observed between CCR5 and CCR2 (Fig. 1 B), we engineered CCR5 mutants in which aromatic residues were substituted by the corresponding amino acids in CCR2. The F85 2.59 L and Y89 2.63 S mutants affected TM2, L104 3.28 F; F109 3.33 H and F112 3.36 Y involved TM3. We also combined these point mutations either within TM2 (F85L/Y89S double mutant), within TM3 (F109H/F112Y, L104F/F109H/F112Y), or across both helices (F85L/L104F, Y89S/L104F, F85L/Y89S/L104F).Cell Surface Expression of the Mutant ReceptorsWe determined cell surface expression of the CCR5 mutants by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, using five well characterized monoclonal antibodies (40Blanpain C.

The epitopes recognized by these monoclonal antibodies have been mapped to the N-terminal domain of the receptor (MC-5 and 3A9), the second extracellular loop (2D7), or a combination of extracellular domains (523 and MC6).Fig. 2 illustrates the average surface expression of the different mutants following normalization to wild-type CCR5 expression level. The TM2 mutant F85L exhibited a moderate but significantly reduced expression, reaching ∼50% of the wt signal. Although the Y89S mutant was well expressed, the combination of both substitutions (F85L/Y89S) led to a reduced expression similar to that of F85L. Interestingly, although the single mutation L104F (in TM3) did not affect cell surface expression, its combination with F85L restored to normal the low expression observed for F85L alone (mutant F85L/L104F). Strikingly, the triple mutant F85L/Y89S/L104F was not found at the cell surface, indicating that, although single and double mutants are expressed, the combination of all three substitutions is not tolerated. This mutant will therefore not be considered further in the following experimental settings. Mutants Y89S/L104F, F109H, F112Y, F109H/F112Y, and L104F/F109H/F112Y are all expressed above 50% of the wt signal with a rather uniform pattern of recognition by the different monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that these mutations do not alter the conformation of CCR5 extracellular domains.Figure 2Expression efficiency of the receptor mutants. Cell-surface expression of wt-CCR5 and the different mutants measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using five different monoclonal antibodies. The data are representative of three independent experiments. The 2D7 antibody recognizes a conformational epitope centered on ECL2, MC-6 and 523 recognize multidomain conformational epitopes, whereas MC-5 and 3A9 target epitopes located in the N-terminal domain of CCR5. Values represent the mean (error bars: S.E.) of the mean cell fluorescence obtained in three different experiments, normalized by the value obtained for CCR5 (100%) separately for each antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding and Functional Properties of the Mutant ReceptorsThe functional consequences of the mutations and their combinations were characterized in terms of binding and intracellular responses, using the four natural agonists of CCR5: RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2.

Open table in a new tab We first focused on residues Phe-85, Tyr-89, and Leu-104, located at the extracellular ends of TM2 and TM3. The F85L mutant was clearly impaired both at the level of binding, and in its functional response to chemokines. Although binding of RANTES was almost unaffected, the apparent affinities for MIP-1β and MCP-2 were significantly lower than those observed for wt-CCR5 (see Table I and Fig. 3), and MIP-1α binding was undetectable. The functional responses of F85L were mild (Fig. 4) and grossly consistent with the binding data. The potency of RANTES was moderately affected on this mutant, but its efficacy was reduced by 4-fold; MIP-1β and MCP-2 displayed a strong impairment of both their potencies and efficacies, whereas MIP-1α was almost inactive. The phenotype of the L104F mutant was grossly similar in terms of functional responses (with slightly better efficacies) despite binding parameters much closer to the wild-type levels. Interestingly, the addition of the L104F substitution to the F85L mutant (F85L/L104F) allowed partial restoration of the function of this mutant. Indeed, on the double mutant, MIP-1α was characterized by a binding affinity close to wt, and the functional response was significantly improved. The functional properties of MCP-2 appeared somewhat more affected by the double mutation, whereas RANTES and MIP-1β showed similar behaviors on the double mutant and on both single mutants.Mutating Y89S affected mildly the activity of RANTES and MIP-1α (conserved potency, 2-fold reduction of E max) decreased moderately the E max and potency of MIP-1β, but affected strongly the functional parameters of MCP-2, despite the normal affinity of this mutant in binding assays. Combining F85L and Y89S substitutions led to a severe impairment of functional responses, particularly for MIP-1β and MCP-2 (no response), and to a lower extent for MIP-1α, whereas RANTES was moderately affected. These effects appeared more than simply additive as compared with the single mutants. The Y89S/L104F mutant was well expressed at the cell surface, but no specific binding could be detected by competition binding assays, and this receptor was barely functional. Only RANTES could elicit a small signal at high concentrations, with a strongly reduced E max but a decent potency (Table I).Modeling the TM2-TM3 InterfaceThe experimental data presented above demonstrate the importance of the TM2-TM3 aromatic cluster in the activation of CCR5. The fact that adding the L104F substitution to the F85L background partly restores the impaired function of this mutant (cell-surface expression and binding) might suggest a direct interaction between the two residues involved. Moreover, Tyr-89 might contribute to this interaction, as mutating this residue, although well tolerated by itself, is highly disruptive in the context of F85L, Y89S, or F85L/Y89S. Fig. 6 A shows the location of the side chains of these residues in a CCR5 model using strictly the rhodopsin crystal as a template (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le, T., I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). The orientation of these side chains toward the lipidic environment is in apparent contradiction with the hypothesis that these residues are important for the structure and the activation mechanism of CCR5.Figure 6Modeling procedure of the TM2-TM3 interface.

In such a model, these side chains face the membrane, which is hardly compatible with the functional role suggested by the mutagenesis experiments.

In CCR5 and other chemokine receptors, the extracellular side of TM2 is predicted to be in close contact with TM3 (and not with TM1 as in rhodopsin) as a result of the structural action of a conserved Thr2.56-X-Pro2.58 motif (13Govaerts C. Blanpain C. Deupi X. Ballet S. Ballesteros J.A. Wodak S.J. Vassart G. Pardo L. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We now propose that this region of TM2 would be part of a structural and functional motif involving the neighboring part of TM3 (aromatic cluster and surrounding residues).To provide a structural framework allowing to understand better the experimental data presented above, we adopted a modeling procedure (detailed under “Experimental Procedures”) based on the following scheme.Independent Exploration of the Conformation of TM2 and TM3 by Molecular Dynamics SimulationsFig. 6 (B andC) shows the computed structures of TM2 (green) and TM3 (yellow). The bending of TM2 toward TM3, in its outer half, is tolerated in the context of the CCR5 helical bundle as the result of the relocation of TM3 toward TM5.

Substitution of Ala for Asn130 in the third transmembrane domain resulted in additional constitutive activation of the B1 receptor. The constitutively active mutant N130A receptor could be further activated by the B1 receptor agonist des-Arg9-bradykinin. To gain insights into the physiological function of the B1 receptor, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type and constitutively active mutant receptors under the control of human cytomegalovirus immediately early gene enhancer/promoter. The rat B1receptor transgene expression was detected in the aorta, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, uterus, and prostate of transgenic mice by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/Southern blot analysis. Transgenic mice were fertile and normotensive. Overexpression of B1 receptors exacerbated paw edema induced by carrageenan and rendered transgenic mice more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock. Interestingly, the hemodynamic response to kinins was altered in transgenic mice, with des-Arg9-bradykinin inducing blood pressure increase when intravenously administered.

The B2 receptor is constitutively expressed, mediating the actions of intact kinins, bradykinin (BK) in rodents and Lys-BK or kallidin in humans (2Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol.

In contrast, the B1 receptor is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues in most animal species but is induced under the influence of inflammation or exposure of tissues to noxious stimuli, mediating the effects of the carboxypeptidase metabolites of intact kinins, des-Arg9-BK (DABK), and des-Arg10-kallidin (2Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cellular responses of kinin receptors to agonists are transduced primarily via coupling to either Gq protein, which in turn activates phospholipase C to stimulate inositol phosphate production, or the Giprotein, acting through phospholipase A2 to stimulate arachidonic acid pathway (5Schneck K.A.

Over the past years, transgenic and gene-targeting technologies associated with molecular biology tools have provided important knowledge concerning the role of kinin receptors in vivo. Transgenic mice expressing the human B2 receptor under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus 3′-long terminal repeat promoter were hypotensive compared with control littermates (7Wang D.Z. Chao L.

Administration of the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140 blunted the blood pressure-lowering effect of the transgene, whereas intra-arterial bolus injection of BK produced more pronounced blood pressure reduction (7Wang D.Z. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 488-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the B2 receptor in mice produced an unaltered blood pressure phenotype (8Borkowski J.A.

Using specific antagonists, the B1 receptor has been implicated in toxic shock, inflammation, and nociception (11Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of mice lacking the B1 receptor provided support to these observations. B1 receptor knockout animals were healthy, fertile, and normotensive and exhibited hypoalgesia and reduced inflammatory response (12Pesquero J.B. Araujo R.C. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Silva J.A., Jr. Walther T. Oliveira S.M. Pesquero J.L. Paiva A.C. Calixto J.B. Lewin G.R. Bader M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about the physiological role of the B1 receptor, most studies are about the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced B1 receptors, because the B1receptor is expressed at very low levels, if at all, in normal tissue. In such experimental set-ups, the animals are under systemic inflammation conditions, which preclude the direct study of the function of the B1 receptor. Therefore, the precise physiological and pathophysiological roles of the B1receptor remain elusive. To extend our understanding of the physiological function of the B1 receptor, we have created a constitutively active mutant of the rat B1 receptor and generated transgenic mice that overexpress the wild-type B1receptor and the mutant receptor under the control of human cytomegalovirus immediately early gene enhancer/promoter. The transgenic mice were characterized, and the findings are reported here. Human embryonic kidney 293A cells were obtained from Quantum Biotechnologies.

The mutations were created by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the previously cloned wild-type rat B1 cDNA in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used as a template (14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as forward primers: 5′-GGC CTC TTG GGGGCC CTT TTA GTC TTG TC-3′ for the preparation of clone N54A (nucleotide changes underlined), 5′-GTC ATC AAG GCC GCC CTG TTT GTC AG-3′ for clone N130A, 5′-GCT ATC AGT CAGCAA CGC TAC AGG CTC-3′ for clone D144Q, and 5′-GCT ATC AGT CAG ACC CGC TAC AGG CTC-3′ for clone D144T. The reverse primers were complementary to the forward primers described. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. TheNruI/NotI fragments in the resultant plasmids were released and inserted at NruI/NotI sites in pIRESpuro (Clontech Lab), leading to vectors for stable transfection. For transient transfection, 293A cells were seeded into 12-well trays and left to adhere overnight. pcDNA3-derived expression vectors were transfected with LipofectAMINE as previously described (14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures were left on cells for 5 h, and then the cells were treated with a change of standard growth medium for 48 h before functional studies. For stable transfection, 293A cells were transfected with pIRESpuro-derived expression vectors. After 16 h, the medium was changed with complete medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml) to start the selection of stably transfected cells. The medium was changed every 3 days, and after about 12 days, the colonies surviving selection were lifted into 12-well plates, expanded with a maintenance concentration of 2 μg/ml puromycin, and screened for ligand specific binding. All of the stock cultures were kept under constant selection pressure of 2 μg/ml puromycin, whereas cells seeded in dishes/wells were maintained without puromycin and used within 2–3 days. Monolayers of transfected 293A cells grown in 12-well trays were labeled for 24 h with 2 μCi of [3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and penicillin/streptomycin. After equilibrated in prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium containing 140 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μm Captopril, and 25 mm LiCl for 15–30 min, the cells were stimulated with various ligands at the indicated concentrations for 20 min at 37 °C. The released total inositol phosphates (IP) were isolated using Bio-Rad AG1-X8 anion exchange columns (1-ml volume) and quantified as described (15Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar,16Faussner A. Proud D. Towns M. Bathon J.M. J. Biol.

Transfected 293A cell monolayers in 12-well plates were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium and incubated at 4 °C with radioligand [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin (14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 5 μm of the unlabeled ligand in 0.3 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 140 μg/ml bacitracin, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 100 μm Captopril. The incubation lasted at least 3 h under gentle agitation. The cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% bovine serum albumin followed by solubilization in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. The radioactivity of the sample was quantified with a 1261 Mutigamma counter (Pharmacia Corp.). The cell number was determined in parallel wells. Stably transfected 293A cells grown in 6-well plates were preincubated for 15 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 100 μm Captopril and then stimulated with 1 μm DABK for 15 min. The stimulation was terminated by exchanging the incubation medium for 0.5 ml of ice-cold 0.1m HCl. The cGMP and cAMP productions were determined by radioimmunoassys as described (17Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang D. Yoshida H. Song Q. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F484-F491Google Scholar). The bovine growth hormone poly(A) sequence in pcDNA3 was released with ApaI and PvuII and inserted at ApaI/EcoRV sites in pBluescript KS II (Stratagene). The ApaI/SmaI bovine growth hormone poly(A) fragment was then released and inserted atApaI/SmaI sites in the pcDNA3-derived wild-type and N130A receptor expression vectors described above. The human 4F2 enhancer was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-TAC TCG AGT GCA GCG CGC CCC CG-3′ and 5′-CTG GGC CCT TCA CCT TCA GAG AGC-3′ (19Karpinski B.A. Yang L.H. Cacheris P. Morle G.D. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2588-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After being cut with XbaI andApaI, the 4F2 enhancer fragment was inserted atXbaI/ApaI sites, resulting in final transgene vectors. The vectors were cut with NruI and SmaI, and the linear transgenes were separated from the unneeded fragments with agarose gel and prepared for injection by Qiaquick gel extraction columns (Qiagen). Transgenic mice were created by the Transgenic Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina and the Transgenic Facility of University of Ohio at Cincinnati. Linear transgene was injected into the pronuclei of one-cell mouse embryos, which were then surgically implanted into pseudopregnant female mice. Transgenic founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. Positive founders identified from each line were bred with normal mice, and then F1 littermates were crossed between themselves. Tail DNA was digested with restriction enzyme KpnI, run on 0.7% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and transferred to Immobilon-N membrane by capillary action with 10× SSC overnight, and the blots were hybridized to a rat kinin B1 receptor cDNA probe as described previously (14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,20Chai K.X., Ni, A. Wang D. Ward D.C. Chao J. Chao L. Genomics. 1996; 31: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using the RNeasyTM columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR/Southern blot analysis was performed using the transgene-specific primers and internal probe as previously described (21Ni A. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2784-2791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The upstream primer is 5′-ATG GCG TCC GAG GTC TT-3′; the downstream primer is 5′-GAC AAA CAC CAG ATC GG-3′; and the internal probe is 5′-TGG CAG CAA CGA CAG AG-3′. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The kidney was removed, and the wet weight was determined. The tissue was homogenized using a Polytron in ∼20 volumes of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The membranes from the tissue were prepared, and binding assays were performed as described previously (7Wang D.Z. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 488-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Systolic blood pressure was measured using a computer system RTBP2000 (Kent Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the mice were placed into the prewarmed harness (38 °C). The tail was placed in the occlusion cuff/piezoelectric pulse sensor and distention caused by arterial blood pulses was detected by the sensor and read out onto the computer system. Pressure in the cuff was increased until the pulse was lost. Actual blood pressure was measured as the pressure at which a pulse was detected during cuff depressurization. Ten readings were taken for each animal. The mice were initially anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol intert-amyl alcohol (Avertin, 20 mg/ml, 0.4 ml/25 g of body weight) and placed on a heated table to maintain body temperature. The right jugular vein and the left carotid artery were cannulated with PE-l0 catheters (Clay Adams). After the animals were allowed to recover, blood pressure (in the carotid artery) and heart rate were recorded using a computer system MP100 (Biopac systems Inc). The mice were given a bolus injection of BK or DABK from right jugular vein. BK or DABK was serially diluted and administered at doses of 75, 150, and 300 ng in a volume of 50 μl of saline/mouse. Inflammation of one hind paw of mice was induced by intraplantar injection of 20 μl of 1% carrageenan (dissolved in saline), 3 μg of capsaicin in 10 μl (dissolved in 5% ethanol, 5% Tween 80 and 90% saline), or DABK (50 or 300 nmol in saline), whereas the contralateral paw received the same volume of vehicle. Thirty min post injection of capsaicin and DABK or 3 h after carrageenan administration, the mice were sacrificed, both hind paws were cut off at the ankle, and the difference between their weights, representing paw edema, was calculated. LPS was dissolved in sterile 0.9% NaCl. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of LPS (24 mg/kg body weight), and the percentage of survivors was determined at 12-h intervals. Both of the control groups were injected with 0.9% NaCl. The group data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were compared between experimental groups by one-way analysis of variance. Differences between groups were further evaluated by Fisher's protected least squares differences. Differences were considered significant at a value of p< 0.05. To generate the constitutively active mutants of B1 receptors, site-directed mutagenesis was directed at the Asn54, Asn130, and Asp144 residues in the rat B1 receptor (Fig. 1). The amino acid replacements were N54A, N130A, D144Q, and D144T. The receptor expression vectors were transiently transfected into 293A cells for assessing constitutive activity by determining agonist-independent IP production. At optimal transfection conditions, all of the mutants were expressed at a comparable level but significantly lower than the wild-type receptor (data not shown). As shown in Table I, the wild-type B1 receptor displayed a marked ligand-independent, spontaneous activity (104% above control levels of the mock-transfected cells), and the N54A mutant showed an impaired basal activity compared with the wild-type receptor. Substitution of Ala for Asn130 resulted in significantly constitutive activation of the rat B1 receptor (409% above control levels). In contrast, the agonist-independent IP accumulations in 293A cells expressing D144Q and D144T mutants were similar to that of mock transfected cells, and the constitutive activity of the wild-type receptor was abolished by the mutations. Interestingly, the maximal extent of DABK stimulation of IP production was significantly reduced for all mutants compared with the wild-type receptor.Table IIP accumulation in 293A cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptorsReceptor[3H]IP accumulationR max1-aThe R maxvalues are percentages above basal.Basal IP1-bThe basal IP values are percentages above control.WT1487 ± 112104 ± 27N54A433 ± 3510 ± 4N130A430 ± 18409 ± 23D144Q67 ± 70D144T20 ± 90R max indicates the percentage increase in the 1 μm DABK-induced IP accumulation above basal levels in the absence of DABK.

The expression levels of the receptors were comparable except for the wild type (WT) with a higher level of expression. The results are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. To better characterize the N130A mutant receptor, stable expression of the N130A mutant in 293A cells was established. For comparison, stable expression of the wild-type rat B1 receptor in 293A cells was also established. Such stably transfected 293A cells were analyzed for receptor density and their affinity for radioligand [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin and used in functional assays. The N130A receptor was expressed at a level of about 25% of the wild-type receptor in the stably transfected 293A cells (Table II). The maximum number of N130A receptor-binding sites (B max) using [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin is 1.4 × 105 sites/cell versus 5.3 × 105 sites/cell for the wild-type receptor. In contrast, the mutation of Asn130 into Ala significantly increased the affinity for [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin. The dissociation constant (K d) for the binding of [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin by the wild-type and N130A receptors in intact stably transfected 293A cells were 2.54 ± 0.40 and 1.63 ± 0.18 nm, respectively.Table IICharacterization of the wild-type and N130A mutant receptorsReceptorK dB maxcAMPcGMPBasalMaximalBasalMaximalnm(sites/cell × 10 −3 )pmol/mgfmol/mgWT2.54 ± 0.4053016 ± 21858 ± 55421 ± 292208 ± 218N130A1.63 ± 0.1814043 ± 7608 ± 53528 ± 21872 ± 14293A cells12 ± 113 ± 5454 ± 14461 ± 35293A cells stably expressing the wild-type (WT) and the N130A mutant (N130A) rat kinin B1 receptor were established, and the receptor binding sites (B max) and dissociation constant (K d) were determined by using radioligand [125I]Sar-Tyr-ɛAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The basal (Basal) and 1 μm DABK-stimulated (Maximal) intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels were also measured. The results are the means ± S.E. of three experiments. Open table in a new tab 293A cells stably expressing the wild-type (WT) and the N130A mutant (N130A) rat kinin B1 receptor were established, and the receptor binding sites (B max) and dissociation constant (K d) were determined by using radioligand [125I]Sar-Tyr-ɛAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The basal (Basal) and 1 μm DABK-stimulated (Maximal) intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels were also measured. The results are the means ± S.E. of three experiments. To assess the mode of coupling between the B1 receptor and adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase and the effect of the mutation of Asn130 into Ala on the DABK-induced cAMP and cGMP production, the intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels were measured in the stably transfected 293A cells. As shown in Table II, the basal cAMP and cGMP levels in the 293A cells stably expressing the wild-type receptor were similar to those in the nontransfected 293A cells, whereas in the 293A cells stably expressing the N130A receptor, the basal cAMP and cGMP levels were elevated. DABK challenge increased intracellular cAMP and cGMP production in the 293A cells stably expressing the wild-type and N130A receptors: 116-fold increase in cAMP levels and 5.2-fold increase in cGMP levels for the wild-type receptor versus14-fold increase in cAMP levels and 1.7-fold increase in cGMP levels for the N130A mutant. Using the stably transfected 293A cells, the dose-dependent DABK stimulation of IP production for the wild-type and N130A receptor was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2, the N130A mutant could be further activated by over 5-fold by saturation doses of DABK, whereas the wild-type receptor could be amplified to a even higher degree (∼16-fold). The properties of some kinins to modulate IP production by the wild-type and N130A receptors were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3, kinin B2 receptor agonist BK and antagonist Hoe-140 have no effects. Des-Arg9,[Leu8]-bradykinin and Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-[d-βNal7,Ile8]-des-Arg9-bradykinin are human B1 receptor-specific antagonists. Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-[d-βNal7,Ile8]-des-Arg9-bradykinin is still an antagonist for the wild-type rat B1 receptor, whereas des-Arg9,[Leu8]-braykinin becomes a partial agonist (70–80% of DABK), which provides support for the early observation that des-Arg9,[Leu8]-bradykinin has partial agonist activity in a contraction assay of smooth muscle of rat duodenum and ileum (22Paiva A.C. Paiva T.B. Pereira C.C. Shimuta S.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Meini S. Lecci A. Maggi C.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-[d-βNal7,Ile8]-des-Arg9-bradykinin becomes a partial agonist, and des-Arg9,[Leu8]-BK becomes a potent agonist for the N130A receptor. Using the wild-type and N130A cDNAs, we have constructed two transgenes for development of transgenic mice. The transgene consists of the cytomegalovirus immediately early gene enhancer/promoter, the wild-type or N130A rat B1 receptor cDNA, the human 4F2 enhancer, and the bovine growth hormone poly(A) sequence (Fig. 4). Three transmitting founder lines, including one wild-type line, WT2510, and two N130A lines, N130A58 and N130A2592, were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. Heterozygous wild-type and N130A transgenic mice showed no gross phenotypic abnormalities. All of the transgenic mice were fertile. However, mating F1 generation heterozygotes of both N130A lines produced smaller litters compared with the nontransgenic control and WT2510 line, and a non-Mendelian ratio against N130A mice was observed in the offspring. In the following studies heterozygous transgenic mice were used. The distribution of transgene mRNA expression in F1 and F2 generation heterozygous mice was determined by reverse transcription-PCR/Southern blot analysis. As expected, both male and female transgenic mice showed significant overexpression of the transgene mRNA in the aorta, kidney, liver, heart, brain, and lung and in the prostate of males and the uterus of females. Fig. 5 shows the result from line N130A58. Using specific B1 receptor radioligand [125I]Sar-Tyr-εAhx-Lys-des-Arg9-BK (14Ni A. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), strong B1 receptor binding activity was detected in membranes prepared from the kidneys of all transgenic lines (data not shown). In contrast, neither transgene mRNA expression nor B1 receptor (including endogenous) binding activity could be detected in the corresponding tissues of the nontransgenic control mice. All of the heterozygous transgenic mice were normotensive. The systolic blood pressures of transgenic mice 10 weeks old were 78.7 ± 8.5 mmHg (n = 11) for line WT2510, 75.0 ± 7.6 mmHg (n = 14) for line N130A58, and 76.2 ± 6.3 mmHg (n = 11) for line N130A2592 versus 80.9 ± 3.9 mmHg (n = 11) for age-matched nontransgenic control littermates. Intravenous injection of B1 receptor agonist DABK via the jugular vein produced a transient increase of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in anesthetized transgenic mice but not in nontransgenic control littermates (Fig. 6 A). The duration of MABP increase lasted over 5 min. 75 ng of DABK led to an increase of blood pressure by up to 15 mmHg. In contrast, intravenous injection of B2 receptor agonist BK into transgenic mice caused a remarkable primary MABP reduction, followed by a blood pressure bounce-back going beyond basal level, whereas in nontransgenic mice the blood pressure just returned to basal level, after a similar primary MABP reduction (Fig. 6 B). Single or subsequent injections of higher doses of DABK did not result in a further increase of blood pressure in transgenic mice (data not shown). Intraplantar injection of carrageenan resulted in a marked inflammation seen by paw swelling in normal and transgenic mice (Fig. 7). But the paw edema induced in transgenic mice was more severe. The percentage of the weight increase of the carrageenan-injected paw over the contralateral vehicle-injected paw was 38.4 ± 6.7% for"

The tetraspanin CD9 has been implicated in cell motility, metastasis, and sperm-egg fusion. In this study we characterize the first CD9 conformation-dependent epitope (detected by monoclonal antibody (mAb) PAINS-13) whose expression depends on changes in the activation state of associated β1 integrins. MAb PAINS-13 precipitates CD9 under conditions that preserve the association of this tetraspanin with integrins, but not under conditions that disrupt these interactions. Induction of activation of β1 integrins by temperature, divalent cation Mn2+, or mAb TS2/16 correlated with enhanced expression of the PAINS-13 epitope on a variety of cells. Through the use of different K562 myeloid leukemia transfectant cells expressing specific members of the β1 integrin subfamily we show that the expression of the PAINS-13 epitope depends on CD9 association with α6β1 integrin. The mAb PAINS-13 reactivity has been mapped to the CD9 region comprising residues 112–154 in the NH2 half of the large extracellular loop. Also, we show that the CD9 conformation recognized by mAb PAINS-13 is functionally relevant in β1 integrin-mediated cellular processes including wound healing migration, tubular morphogenesis, cell adhesion and spreading and in signal transduction involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

All tetraspanins share the presence of a CCG motif and several conserved cysteine residues in the large extracellular domain. The tetraspanin family currently comprises more than 25 members, including the differentiation antigens CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, CD82, and CD151. These proteins have been implicated in different cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, differentiation, and signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 1Boucheix, C., Duc, G. H.

The tetraspanins act as molecular facilitators or adaptors that organize a network of interactions among a subset of cell surface molecules, known as the “tetraspanin web.” Among the proteins identified as components of the tetraspanin web are many immunoglobulin superfamily protein members (including the CD4 and CD8 antigens on T cells), the CD19 molecule on lymphoid cells, the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and several members of the β1 subfamily of integrins on many cell types (Refs. 1Boucheix, C., Duc, G.

The first level relates to primary interactions between a particular tetraspanin and specific proteins known as tetraspanin partners. These first level interactions are direct, resistant to detergents such as digitonin and Triton X-100, and of high stoichiometry (i.e.>50% in the complex). A second level of interactions are indirect, more numerous and resistant to Brij 96 detergent extraction, and arise as tetraspanins associate to each other linking multiple primary complexes. A third level of tetraspanin organization relates to the large and light complexes that are resistant to detergents such as Brij 99 or CHAPS1 and display partial lipid rafts properties (8Yashiro-Ohtani Y.

The tissue and cellular distribution of CD9 is very wide, and most immortalized cell lines tested have been found to express detectable levels of this tetraspanin (20Boucheix C. Perrot J.Y.

Some members of the β1 integrin subfamily, particularly α3β1 (VLA-3), α4β1 (VLA-4), and α6β1 (VLA-6), are among the tetraspanin-associated cell surface proteins found in the tetraspanin web in most cellular systems. The contribution of tetraspanins to adhesion-dependent signaling seems to be linked to their ability to recruit signaling components such as protein kinase C, PI3K, or PI4K into the integrin complexes (23Hemler M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The β1 integrin subfamily comprises heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin (α3β1and α6β1), collagens (α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1), fibronectin (α4β1 and α5β1), and also cell-cell interactions (α4β1/VCAM-1) (25Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). Integrins not only mediate cell adhesion but work as effective bidirectional signal transducers (25Hynes R.O.

The adhesive and signaling capacities of integrins depend on transitions between conformational changes in these receptors that reflect distinct “activation states” defined by their increased or decreased ability to mediate ligand interactions or signal transduction (27Hogg N. Harvey J. Cabanas C. Landis R.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 148: S55-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hogg N. Bennett R. Cabanas C. Dransfield I.

Ligand binding, physiologic temperature (37 °C), the presence of divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ in the extracellular medium, and several specific “stimulatory” monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that provoke a conformational change upon binding to a particular integrin, are among the factors known to induce the activation of integrins. The activation state of many integrins can be monitored with the use of a different type of specific mAbs (“activation reporters”) that recognize conformation-dependent integrin epitopes whose expression reflect changes in the integrin avidity or/and affinity (29Sanchez-Mateos P.

In this study we characterize the first CD9 conformation-dependent epitope whose expression depends on changes in the activation state of associated β1integrins. Through the use of different K562 transfectant cells expressing specific members of the β1 integrin subfamily we have determined that the expression of the PAINS-13 epitope depends preferentially on the presence of α6β1integrin. These interactions are functionally relevant in β1 integrin-dependent cellular processes including wound healing, migration, tubular morphogenesis, cell adhesion and spreading, and signal transduction involving PI3K activation and may therefore play a regulatory role in cell migration during angiogenesis.

The anti-p85 subunit of PI3K antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). When necessary, purified antibodies were biotinylated with 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) as previously described (30Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J.

Matrigel basement membrane matrix was obtained from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells as previously described (43Fridman R. Giaccone G. Kanemoto T. Martin G.R. Gazdar A.F. Mulshine J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6698-6702Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fibronectin and poly-l-lysine were purchased from Sigma. Laminin I was either purchased from Sigma or purified from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells (44Timpl R. Rohde H. Robey P. Rennard S. Foidart J. Martin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9933-9937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent HMEC-1 endothelial cells were collected using 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, and intraperitoneally injected into Balb/c mice on days −22 and −12 and intravenously on day −3. Spleen cells were fused on day 0 with SP2 mouse myeloma cells at a 4:1 ratio and hybridomas were distributed in 96-well culture plates. After 7 days the hybridoma supernatants were harvested and their reactivity against the HMEC-1 used in the immunization was assayed by flow cytometry. Positive clones obtained by the limiting dilution method were selected and inoculated into Balb/c mice to generate ascitic fluid. Monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascitic fluid and concentrated by affinity chromatography using a column of protein G-Sepharose and eluted using sodium citrate 0.1m, pH 3.0. MAb PAINS-13 is an IgG3. Cells were washed twice, incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min, washed, and incubated for 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). After washing three times, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and fluorescence was measured using a FACScanTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To study the effect exerted by temperature on the expression of different cellular surface molecules, an aliquot of cells was incubated at 4 °C and another aliquot at 37 °C with the primary antibody for 20 min and subsequently FACS analysis was performed as described above. The effect of divalent cations was studied in cells washed with Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 2 mm EGTA, and then resuspended in Hepes buffer. The primary antibody was supplemented or not with MnCl2(1–6 mm depending on the cellular type) during 20 min at 37 °C. For direct activation of β1 integrins, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with the stimulatory mAb TS2/16 (10 μg/ml) in Hepes buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and biotinylated PAINS-13 or HUTS-21 (20 μg/ml) mAbs were then added and incubated at 37 °C for an additional period of 20 min and finally incubated with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) and processed for FACS analysis. To increase the HUTS-21 epitope expression on the K562 transfectants, N-acetylcysteine (50 mm) was used, and the FACS assay was performed after eliminating this agent before the primary antibody was added to the cells. HUVEC endothelial cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips precoated with 1% gelatin. Cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice, and incubated for 30 min in the presence of secondary antibody Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). After washing with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem). In some cases, cellular fixation was performed before the incubation with the primary antibody and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with TNB (0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% blocking reagent; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min. Samples were examined with a Nikon Labophot-2 photomicroscope and images were acquired with a COHU high performance CCD camera (Cohu, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a LEICA Q550 CW work station (Leica Imaging Systems, Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using the LEICA QFISH V1.01 Software. Mouse fibroblast L929 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum medium supplemented with 5 μl of 1.5 m NaCl, 20 μg of pBlueScript (Stratagene), and 5 μg of the CD9-EGFP or CD151-EGFP cDNAs. Cells were electroporated at 975 microfarads/200 V in a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) and used for immunofluorescence experiments 24 h after transfection. The CD9-EGFP fusion protein construct was obtained by PCR amplification of CD9-cDNA followed by cloning in the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech Laboratories) (45Longo N. Yanez-Mo M. Mittelbrunn M. de la Rosa G. Munoz M.L. Sanchez-Madrid F. Sanchez-Mateos P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3717-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For epitope mapping, the CD9 and CD82 negative colocarcinoma Colo320 cells were transiently transfected in 2.5% SBF RPMI 1640 with 20 μg of different cDNA coding for CD9, CD82, and for the different chimeric tetraspanin molecules CD9 × 82, CD82 × 9, CD82LEL9, and CD82CCG9 all subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Cells were electroporated at 412.5 V/cm in an ElectroSquarePorator ECM 830 (BTX) and used for FACS detection 24 h after transfection. HMEC-1 confluent monolayers were labeled using 0.3–0.5 mg/ml biotin 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in PBS with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% digitonin, 1% Brij 96, or in different concentrations of Triton X-100 buffer (in TBS supplemented with 1% BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After 30 min at 4 °C, cellular material was recovered using a cellular scraper and the insoluble portion was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein G-Sepharose was precleared with cellular lysates from unlabeled cells, and coupled with the specific antibodies for 2–4 h at 4 °C. After removing the excess antibodies, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the biotinylated lysates. Beads were then rinsed three times with diluted (1:10) lysis buffer in TBS and immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and resolved in a 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS and the chemiluminescence was measured using the Immunopure ABC peroxidase staining kit (Pierce) in TBST (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit, AmershamBiosciences). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above from unlabeled cells. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS at room temperature and developed with primary biotinylated antibodies followed by incubation with avidin peroxidase (Sigma). Chemiluminescence was measured as described above. For cellular adhesion and spreading assays, 96-microwell plates (Costar) were coated with different extracellular matrix components (30 μg/ml laminin I, 5 μg/ml fibronectin, or 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine as a control) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The trypsinized HMEC-1 cells were washed and resuspended in MDCB-131 medium (without serum and growth factors, and supplemented with 20 mm Hepes and 0.1% BSA) containing 10 μg/ml of each purified mAb. 1.25 × 105 cells (for adhesion assays) or 1.5 × 104 (for spreading assays) were added to the coated wells and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C to allow cells to sediment onto the well bottom, followed by 15 (for laminin-I) or 5 min (for fibronectin) incubations at 37 °C. In adhesion assays, unbound cells were removed by filling the wells with PBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% BSA, sealing with plastic, and inverting the plates for 30 min at 37 °C. After fixation of bound cells in 3.7% formaldehyde and treatment with 2% methanol followed by 70% crystal violet solution, adhesion was analyzed by measuring the absorbance of eluted crystal violet at 540 nm. For cellular spreading assays, the fixed adherent cells were photographed in a phase-contrast Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Sony SSC-M350 CE CCD video camera and VCR and the cellular perimeter was calculated using the image analysis software Optimas 5.2 (Bioscan, Edmonds, WA). 80 μl of Matrigel were added into flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates at 4 °C and allowed to gel during 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 25 × 103HMEC-1 cells were seeded at the top of the gel in a volume of 80 μl with 20 μg/ml purified mAbs. After 6 h incubation, tubular structures were formed and images were recorded on TMAX 400 film (Kodak) with a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon ELWD 0.3). Tubes were defined as cellular extensions linking cell masses (46Sincock P.M. Fitter S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wound healing assays were performed as a modification of the previously described method (42Yanez-Mo M. Alfranca A. Cabanas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 cells were seeded on 0.5% gelatin-coated 24-well plates until confluence. 16–18 h before the assay, complete medium was replaced by basal medium without growth factors. The cellular monolayer was disrupted by a 1200-μm wide wound and immediately the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing the antibodies (20 μg/ml), and cells were cultured at 37 °C. Wounds were photographed at the beginning and end of the assay with a phase-contrast Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Sony SSC-M350 CE CCD video camera and VCR. The area of the wound was calculated using the image analysis software Optimas 5.2 (Bioscan). PI3K assays were performed as described by Shaw et al. (47Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HMEC-1 cells were cultured on 0.5% gelatin-coated dishes to confluence and medium without growth factors was added 16 h before the assay. Antibodies (20 μg/ml) were added for 20 min at 37 °C. After two washes using cold PBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, an additional cross-linking was performed with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Sigma) for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by 30 min at 37 °C. Then, chilled lysis buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) was added and cells were removed using a cellular scraper. Lysis was performed during 30 min at 4 °C and the nonsoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Cellular lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-p85 subunit of PI3K antibody bound to Protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with diluted lysis buffer, and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, and 200 μm adenosine). Beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg ofl-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), the reaction was started by addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, carried out for 15 min at room temperature, and stopped on ice. Phospholipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol/HCl, desiccated under N2 flow,"

Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis in vitro in response to primary alcohol treatment and the kinetics of Golgi fragmentation in vivo were very rapid and tightly coupled. Preloading Golgi membranes with short chain phosphatidic acid abrogated the alcohol-mediated inhibition of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis in vitro. We also show that fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus in response to diminished PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis correlated with both the phosphorylation of a Golgi form of beta III spectrin, a PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-interacting protein, and changes in its intracellular redistribution. The data are consistent with a model suggesting that the decreased PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis and the phosphorylation state of beta III spectrin modulate the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1964111451,"Citron Kinase (Citron-K) is a cell cycle-dependent protein regulating the G2/M transition in hepatocytes. Synchronization studies demonstrated that expression of the Citron-K protein starts at the late S and/or the early G2 phase after that of cyclin B1. Expression of Citron-K is developmentally regulated. Levels of Citron-K mRNA and protein are highest in embryonic liver and gradually decrease after birth. Citron-K exists in interphase nuclei and begins to disperse into the cytoplasm at prophase. It concentrates at the cleavage furrow and midbody during anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis, implicating a role in the control of cytokinesis. However, studies with knockouts show that Citron-K is not essential for cytokinesis in hepatocytes. Instead, loss of Citron-K causes a significant increase of G2 tetraploid nuclei in one-week-old rat and mouse liver. In addition, Citron-K deficiency triggers apoptosis in a small subset of embryonic liver cells.

In summary, our data demonstrate that Citron-K has a distinct cell cycle-dependent expression pattern and cellular localization as a downstream target of Rho-GTPase and functions in the control of G2/M transition in the hepatocyte cell cycle.

Overexpression of the dominant negative mouse Ect2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RhoA, caused cytokinesis failure and the formation of binucleated cells in cultured mouse hepatocytes (10Sakata H. Rubin J.S. Taylor W.G. Miki T. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rho regulates cytokinesis through its downstream targets. The Rho-associated kinases ROCK1I and II and Citron kinase (Citron-K) bind to Rho-GTP and have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cytokinesis (2Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K.

ROCKs and Citron-K are serine/threonine kinases, and they probably regulate cytokinesis by phosphorylating downstream targets. ROCKs activate the regulatory myosin light chain (RMLC) directly by phosphorylating its Ser-19 and indirectly by inhibiting myosin phosphatases (12Kosako H. Yoshida T. Matsumura F. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6059-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Citron-K also phosphorylates RMLC at Ser-19 and Thr-18, but it does not phosphorylate myosin phosphatases (16Matsumura F. Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The gene encoding Citron kinase has two major transcripts, the full-length Citron-K and a form of Citron that does not contain the kinase domain (2Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 11Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol.

Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 96-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Furuyashiki T. Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Madaule P. Uchino S. Mishina M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 109-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of Citron-K mRNA is limited to the proliferating neuroblasts, as revealed byin situ hybridization (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Citron-K mRNA is detected by Northern blots in adult murine tissues including brain, kidney, spleen, thymus, skin, lung, and at very high levels in testis, but it is not detected in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle (11Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Considering its strong expression in highly proliferative tissues such as testis or embryonic neuronal cells, it is possible that the expression of Citron-K is cell cycle-dependent rather than tissue-specific. Therefore, the absence of Citron-K in adult mouse liver could be a consequence of the quiescent state of the tissue. The major function of Citron-K is the control of cytokinesis. Citron-K localizes to the cleavage furrow and midbody in anaphase and telophase in HeLa cells (2Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 9Eda M. Yonemura S. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J.

Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The requirement of Citron-K for cell division is cell type-specific as revealed by examining the knockout animals. Loss of Citron-K causes failure of cytokinesis and therefore triggers apoptosis in the male germ cells and a specific population of neuroblasts (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V.

Whether Citron-K is involved in the control of hepatocyte cell cycle and cytokinesis is not clear. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where otherwise indicated. Male adult Fisher 344 rats (2 months old) and pregnant Fisher 344 rats were purchased from the Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). One pair of heterozygous Wistar Kyoto rats with a mutation at the Citron-K gene was a gift from Dr. Lo Turco, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT. They were bred to generate the Flathead (FH) rats, the heterozygous rats, and the homozygous wild type (WT) rats. The autosomal recessive mutant FH rat is a spontaneous Citron-K knockout. It was named because of an easily recognized phenotype, a flattened skull of the neonate (21Cogswell C.A. Sarkisian M.R. Leung V. Patel R. D'Mello S.R. LoTurco J.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutation was confirmed to be a single base deletion in the exon 1 of theCitron gene, resulting in an early stop codon, and no Citron-K protein is synthesized (20Sarkisian M.R. Li W., Di Cunto F. D'Mello S.R. LoTurco J.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 (, 1–5): RC217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cogswell C.A. Sarkisian M.R. Leung V. Patel R. D'Mello S.R. LoTurco J.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Genotypes of the littermates were determined by PCR with genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme cutting. A fragment of exon 1 containing the mutation site was amplified by PCR followed by BanII (Promega, Madison, WI) cutting of the PCR products. The wild type gene has a BanII cutting site lost in the mutant. The primers to exon 1 of the Citron-K gene in rat were based on the sequence of mouse exon 1 and were 5′GAGATGTTGAAGTTCAAGTA-3′ and 5′CCTGGAAGAAGAGATTTAGC-3′ (20Sarkisian M.R. Li W., Di Cunto F. D'Mello S.R. LoTurco J.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 (, 1–5): RC217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotypes of FH rats are very similar to those observed in the Citron-K −/− mice with minor differences. Failure of cytokinesis causes the formation of binucleated neuronal cells. Massive apoptosis is detected in the developing central nervous system, which leads to the small brain size at birth (40% of normal) (22Roberts M.R. Bittman K., Li, W.W. French R. Mitchell B. LoTurco J.J. D'Mello S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FH rats begin to have seizures around postnatal day 7 and die in the first month (23Sarkisian M.R. Rattan S. D'Mello S.R. LoTurco J.J. Epilepsia. 1999; 40: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Experiments have been conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Single cell suspensions of hepatocytes were prepared with a modified two-step collagenase perfusion method (24Sattler C.A. Sawada N. Sattler G.L. Pitot H.C. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1540-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell viability was >90% as measured by trypan blue exclusion. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were seeded onto type I collagen (5–10 μg/cm2)-coated tissue culture plates or coverslips at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 to 20,000 cells/cm2for maximal cell proliferation (25Mossin L. Blankson H. Huitfeldt H. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 5 μg/ml insulin with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin for 4 h. The culture was then changed to a serum-free medium; RPMI 1640 was supplemented with 10 μg/ml iron-saturated transferrin, 100 nm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1 × 10−7m copper (CuSO4), 5 × 10−11m zinc (ZnSO4·7H2O), 3 × 10−10m selenium (NaSeO3), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 unit/ml penicillin. Both epidermal growth factor and insulin are hepatic mitogens and provide an additive stimulus for cell proliferation in culture. Single cell suspensions of rat hepatocytes were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml in PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were then checked under a fluorescence microscope. At least 2000 cells were counted for each sample, and the binucleation ratio of hepatocytes was calculated as the percentage of binucleated cells per total number of hepatocytes. Nuclei of rat hepatocytes were prepared by a modified trypsin-detergent method (26Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). A total of 20,000 events was collected for each sample with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Quantitative analysis of cell cycle parameters was performed using the WinMDI program. A human fetal cDNA panel was purchased from Clontech and used as the template for PCR. Total RNA from liver samples were isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScriptTM first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). To detect the specific signal for Citron-K, the forward primer was designed to locate within the kinase domain, and the reverse primer would be in the non-kinase domain of the molecule. The forward primer was designed according to the sequence of the ratCitron kinase domain nucleotides 883–906,i.e. 5′-TGGACTGTGACTGGTGGTCTGTCG-3′, whereas the reverse primer corresponds to rat Citron 1154–1177, i.e.5′-TGGCCTCTGTGCTGGCTTTTACAG-3′. The primers amplify a 1.1-kb PCR fragment according to the sequence information of mouseCitron-K. These two primers are separated by at least one intron. Thus, a positive PCR signal with the right length should reflect the existence of the Citron-K mRNA. The PCR product was purified and sequenced to confirm that it is an amplified fragment of rat Citron-K cDNA. Semi-quantitation of PCR products is performed according to the method of Relative RT-PCR (Ambion, Austin, TX) by using β-actin as an internal standard with Ambion's QuantumRNATM β-actin internal standards kit. In situ hybridization was performed as described (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F.

Hep3B cells were cultured on 22-mm2 coverslips in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). The cDNA of mouse Citron-Kwas cloned in-frame with an N-terminal FLAG tag in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) (11Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 24–48 h after transfection to allow gene expression. Rat hepatocytes and Hep3B cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min, and incubated with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min. Primary antibodies were diluted with blocking buffer and used as follows: mAb mouse anti-α-tubulin 1:100 (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA); mouse anti-FLAG 1:200 (M2, Sigma); mouse anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) 1:100 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); and a polyclonal rabbit anti-Citron antibody at 1:4000 (prepared by immunization of rabbits with a purified fragment of mouse Citron-K amino acids 454–637) (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F.

The secondary antibodies Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 594 conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:500 with blocking buffer and incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h. Cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) to visualize the DNA. The stained cells were examined with an Olympus IX70 microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) or a Leica confocal microscope. Embryos were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for over 12 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections containing liver were stained with hematoxilin-eosin. Activated Caspase-3 was detected with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum (dilution 1:1000), which recognizes the p17 subunit of cleaved caspase-3 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Nelsbach, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (11Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Liver tissue samples were homogenized in a high stringency buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with supplemented protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 45 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the rabbit polyclonal anti-Citron antibody (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:2000. Cultured Hep3B cells and primary cultures of hepatocytes were harvested in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH8.0, with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with the same set of protease inhibitors. Protein lysates or precipitates from immunoprecipitation were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Citron and Citron-K were detected with the same anti-Citron antibody at 1:4000. Other antibodies used were monoclonal antibody against cyclin B1, 1:200 (NeoMarker, Fremont, CA), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 1:10,000 (Sigma). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) and goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) used at a dilution of 1:10,000 and 1:40,000, respectively. The signal was detected with an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Densitometric analysis of Citron-K protein levels during development was quantified with the software Scion Image (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Relative expression levels were determined by dividing the mean densitometric value of each stage by that found in the livers of first postnatal week animals. Two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed on 2-month-old male F344 rats as described previously (27Assy N. Gong Y. Zhang M. Pettigrew N.M. Pashniak D. Minuk G.Y. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Liver samples removed during surgery were saved as time 0 quiescence controls. Animals were euthanized by CO2asphyxiation at the following hourly intervals after PH: 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 h. Portions of livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for protein extraction. A sham operation, including laparotomy and mobilization of liver without tissue removal, was performed as a control. Significance of differences between FH rats and WT control was assessed by the Student's t test.p < 0.05 means significant difference. Expression of Citron-K has been considered tissue-specific, because Citron-K mRNA is not detected in adult mouse liver, heart, and skeletal muscle by Northern blots (11Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies have shown that Citron-K mRNA was detected only in proliferating but not postmitotic neuronal cells (15Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that could occur in other tissues. If so, the negative signal in adult mouse liver, heart, and skeletal muscles could be a result of their quiescent states. A positive signal of Citron-K should be detected in these tissues if undergoing proliferation. To address this question, Citron-K expression in proliferating cells was evaluated. RT-PCR detected Citron-K mRNA in human fetal heart, liver, spleen, kidney, thymus, skeletal muscle, and lung (Fig. 1 A). In situ hybridization detected a positive signal of Citron-K mRNA in mouse fetal liver (Fig. 1 B). Citron-K is detected by Western blots in cultured Hep3B cells, embryonic day 15 (E15) rat liver, and cultured proliferating rat hepatocytes but not in quiescent adult rat hepatocytes (Fig. 1, C and D). These results strongly argue that Citron-K expression is cell cycle-dependent rather than tissue-specific. The expression pattern of Citron-K was further characterized in regenerating liver after two-thirds PH because the first round of DNA synthesis by hepatocytes is naturally synchronized, providing a convenient model for studying the cell cycle expression pattern of proteins. Rat hepatocytes reach first peak of DNA synthesis at 24 h after PH as revealed by BrdUrd labeling and PCNA expression (27Assy N. Gong Y. Zhang M. Pettigrew N.M. Pashniak D. Minuk G.Y. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Weglarz T.C. Sandgren E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Histochemistry. 1990; 93: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, we followed the protein expression ∼24 h after surgery. Previous studies have demonstrated that cell proliferation induced by PH is predominantly non-binucleating (31Melchiorri C. Chieco P. Zedda A.I. Coni P. Ledda-Columbano G.M. Columbano A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1825-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Gerlyng P. Abyholm A. Grotmol T. Erikstein B. Huitfeldt H.S. Stokke T. Seglen P.O. Cell Prolif. 1993; 26: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of Citron-K in the regenerative liver after PH will provide important information as to the relationship between Citron-K and liver cell cytokinesis. The expression of two well studied cell cycle markers was examined to define stages of the cell cycle. PCNA starts to appear at the end of G1, peaks in S, and declines at the G2/M phases (33Celis J.E. Madsen P. Nielsen H.V. Gesser B. Rasmussen H.H. Cruger D. Arch. Biol. Med. Exp. 1988; 21: 417-421PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hutchison C. Kill I. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the protein level of PCNA parallels DNA synthesis as revealed by BrdUrd or [3H]thymidine incorporation in the regenerating liver after PH (27Assy N. Gong Y. Zhang M. Pettigrew N.M. Pashniak D. Minuk G.Y. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Frederiks W.M. Marx F. Chamuleau R.A. van Noorden C.J. James J. Histochemistry. 1990; 93: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1 is a critical regulator of mitosis. Expression of cyclin B1 starts at late S phase and accumulates until metaphase (35Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). After that, it is degraded quickly by a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. The protein level of Citron-K was detected using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. The protein level of PCNA and cyclin B1 were analyzed using Western blots directly. PCNA protein level reached its first peak at 24 h after PH, a finding that is consistent with the literature. Citron-K was detected as early as 26 h after PH when cyclin B1 reached its first peak (Fig. 2 B). These protein expression changes were not observed in the sham-control animals (data not shown). The data presented here demonstrate that expression of Citron-K is cell cycle-dependent, not tissue specific. Its expression starts after that of cyclin B1 in the mitotic cell cycle, probably at late S and/or early G2 phase. Comparing the immunofluorescence signals from WT and FH hepatocytes permitted the identification of the specific signal derived from Citron-K. An evenly distributed positive nuclear signal was detected in a small subset of interphase nuclei in WT hepatocytes but not FH cells (Fig. 3 A). A positive nuclear signal was also detected in cultured Hep3B cells, and this was further confirmed by XZ scanning with a confocal microscope (Fig. 4 A). An examination of transfected FLAG-tagged Citron-K in Hep3B cells showed that overexpressed exogeneous Citron-K presented itself as puncta in interphase cells, and some puncta were localized in the nuclei as confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4 B). Double staining with an antibody against the phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 allowed the recognition of mitotic cells. Citron-K began to disperse into cytoplasm at prophase (Fig. 5, A and B) and was distributed to the whole cytosol during prometaphase (Fig. 5 C), metaphase (Fig. 3 B), and early anaphase (Fig. 3 A). It moved to the cleavage furrow during anaphase (Figs. 3 B and 6 A) and concentrated at midbody during telophase and cytokinesis (Fig. 6 B), which is consistent with previous reports on HeLa cells (2Madaule P.

Double staining with anti-α-tubulin antibody showed that the intracellular puncta resembled the signal from the midbody residue after cytokinesis (Fig. 6, C andD). The intracellular puncta could be detected in any part of the cytosol, including cleavage furrow. In most cases, only 1–3 puncta existed in a single hepatocyte.Figure 4Confocal microscopy to confirm the nuclear localization of Citron-K.

Providing that the coding sequence for the entire N-terminal extension is omitted from the plasmid, transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with plasmid-borne TgVP1 yields a stable and functional translation product that is competent in aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP)-inhibitable K+-activated pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis and PPi-energized H+ translocation.

Long considered to be restricted to plants and certain photosynthetic bacteria, V-PPases have recently been identified in a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotic extremophiles and the kinetoplastid protists Trypanosoma and Leishmania, the causative agents of Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis, and the apicomplexan protists Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The discovery of V-PPases in these parasitic protists has attracted much attention. The seemingly complete absence of V-PPases from their animal hosts has given rise to the exciting possibility that this enzyme might serve as an effective drug target for a number of the diseases caused by these pathogens.All characterized V-PPases are constituted of a single 75–82-kDa intrinsic membrane protein species that is now known to fall into two structurally and functionally distinct types, I and II. Type I V-PPases, as exemplified by the molecular prototype, AVP1 fromArabidopsis (3Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), exhibit a near obligate requirement for millimolar K+ for activity. Type II V-PPases, as exemplified by Arabidopsis AVP2 (4Drozdowicz Y.M. Kissinger J.C. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), by contrast, share only ∼36% sequence identity with their type I counterparts and are insensitive to K+.A property of all V-PPases characterized to date, regardless of whether they are type I or type II enzymes, which distinguishes them from soluble PPases, is their high sensitivity to competitive inhibition by the 1,1-diphosphonate, aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP), and their relative insensitivity to irreversible inhibition by fluoride (5Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Baykov A.A. Dubnova E.B. Bakuleva N.P. Evtushenko O.A. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Originally identified in screens for PPi analogs capable of functionally distinguishing V-PPases from soluble PPases and other phosphohydrolases, diphosphonates such as AMDP that contain a heteroatom (NH2 or OH) on the bridge carbon are exquisitely potent V-PPase inhibitors (5Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taking their cue from the finding that protozoal V-PPases are as sensitive to inhibition by AMDP as their plant and photosynthetic bacterial counterparts, several investigators have shown that this compound inhibits the growth of Plasmodium falciparum (7McIntosh M.T.

Although in all cases the apparent efficacy of AMDP in vivo is markedly lower than its efficacyin vitro, the potential for the development of derivatives of this compound or alternative V-PPase-specific agents for drug purposes is nevertheless evident.Those plant V-PPases that have been characterized in detail are found primarily in vacuolar and Golgi membranes, where their activity contributes to the transmembrane H+ gradient that drives H+- and/or electrically coupled secondary transport processes (1Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). By analogy, parallel biochemical and immunological investigations of the V-PPases of trypanosomatid and apicomplexan protists indicate that they are most closely associated with a vacuole-like organelle, the acidocalcisome (8Rodrigues C.O.

Acidocalcisomes are small, electron-dense vacuolysosome-like acidic compartments, replete with polyphosphates complexed with Ca2+, Mg2+, and other mineral ions, that are suspected to play a dominant role in Ca2+ storage and signaling (reviewed in Ref. 14Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration of V-PPases in the membranes bounding the contractile vacuoles of Chlamydomonas (15Ruiz F.A. Marchesini M. Seufferheld M. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Having made this point, it should be stressed that the association of V-PPases with acidocalcisome-like membranes does not preclude their association with other membranes. As indicated by the results of a number of studies of trypanosomatids and apicomplexans, V-PPase-like immunoreactivity is also to be found in the plasma membrane (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M.

Parasitol. 2002; 120: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), at least under some circumstances.Several publications have described the preliminary in vitrobiochemical characterization of PPase activities associated with membranes prepared from trypanosomatid and apicomplexan protists (reviewed in Ref. 14Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for these activities has been less well defined. Only a single type I V-PPase gene has been isolated from T. cruzi (18Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 315: 281-288Crossref Google Scholar), and in the apicomplexa, although genes for both type I and type II enzymes have been cloned from P. falciparum, PfVP1 andPfVP2, respectively, all attempts to elucidate the functional properties of these gene products by heterologous expression have been unsuccessful (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M. Laroiya K. Rea P.A. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In the following we report the isolation and characterization of a type I V-PPase, TgVP1, from the apicomplexan protist, T. gondii, and rigorous analyses of the subcellular localization of the enzyme and of the effects of the V-PPase inhibitor AMDP on parasite morphology both during and after host cell invasion. We demonstrate that, upon heterologous expression in yeast, TgVP1 encodes an intrinsic membrane protein competent in PPi-dependent H+ transport that is unique among V-PPases in containing an N-terminal signal sequence sufficient for targeting proteins to the secretory pathway in T. gondii. Furthermore, using affinity-purified V-PPase-specific antibodies, we demonstrate a dynamic pattern of distribution of the V-PPase in invading parasites. Under most conditions, immunofluorescence microscopy of the V-PPase reveals a punctate apical distribution. However, during invasion of the host cell, this immunofluorescence undergoes a dramatic redistribution to assume a collar-like structure at the periphery of the parasite that migrates in synchrony with the penetration furrow as the parasite enters the host cell. Given this association of the V-PPase with the invasion apparatus, it is perhaps surprising that application of even high doses of AMDP to invading parasites has no significant effect on their establishment in the host cell, despite the facility with which lower doses impair intracellular parasite division. These results demonstrate the effects of AMDP at doses much lower than those reported previously and suggest a function for acidocalcisomes in host cell invasion inT. gondii.DISCUSSIONThe findings reported here constitute the first molecular and functional characterization of TgVP1, a type I V-PPase from the apicomplexan protist T. gondii. It is established thatTgVP1 encodes a functional K+-activated, PPi-dependent H+ pump that bears a close resemblance to the canonical type I V-PPases from plants. In addition, it is shown that the V-PPase has a punctate apical distribution in both free and intracellular tachyzoites at steady state but a dynamic distribution during host cell invasion. Upon initiation of infection of the host cell by T. gondii, a collar-like structure with which most of the immunodetectable V-PPase is associated is formed. This structure, or the V-PPase that is associated with it, moves from the anterior to the posterior of the parasite coincident with propagation of the penetration furrow.Of the V-PPases that have been defined molecularly to date, TgVP1 is unusual in its possession of an N-terminal signal peptide. With the exception of the pump from T. cruzi which like TgVP1 does have one (18Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 315: 281-288Crossref Google Scholar), a survey of all available V-PPase sequences from archaea, eubacteria, and plants reveals none, not even the type I V-PPase from P. falciparum (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M. Laroiya K. Rea P.A. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), that contain a putative N-terminal signal peptide. The precise role of this sequence and why protists like T. gondii and T. cruzi have it and others not is not known, although in the case of TgVP1 it has been shown by the fusion experiments that the N-terminal extension is sufficient to direct polypeptides to the secretory pathway of T. gondii.More sequences are needed to decide this issue, but these findings are consistent with the notion that different parasitic protists have different intracellular V-PPase distributions and that these are determined by the 5′-coding sequences of their genes, namely whether they do or do not specify an N-terminal extension. In the kinetoplastid protist T. cruzi, low to intermediate resolution immunological methods localize the V-PPase to acidocalcisomes (11Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L., Lu, H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 44Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the results of more recent immunogold electron microscopic analyses of T. gondii have been interpreted in terms of localization of the V-PPase to both acidocalcisomes and the plasma membrane (10Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J., Li, Z. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium, by contrast, in which neither of the V-PPase genes, PfVP1 nor PfVP2 (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M. Laroiya K. Rea P.A. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), encode a polypeptide containing an N-terminal extension, V-PPase immunostaining is predominantly associated with the plasma membrane, an observation supported by the finding that PfVP1 fusions preferentially target to the plasma membrane in trophozoites (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M. Laroiya K. Rea P.A. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, the sufficiency of the N-terminal extension of TgVP1 for entry of this polypeptide into the secretory pathway, and the presence of this extension not only in TgVP1 but also in its cognate from T. cruzi, there is a possibility that targeting of the V-PPase to the acidocalcisome is contingent on initial entry of the translation product into the secretory pathway.The pronounced punctate apical distribution of the V-PPase described here clearly indicates localization of the V-PPase of T. gondii to the membranes bounding acidocalcisomes or similar vesicular structures. Moreover, from what we have determined to be necessary to maximize monospecificity, the differences between the results presented here and those published by other investigators are explicable in terms of the different cross-reactivities of the antibody preparations employed, namely that unless the antisera used (antisera generated by our laboratory (23Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in all cases) are not first carefully immunopurified, they react relatively indiscriminately with parasitic protists. We, like Rodrigues et al. (8Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Bailey B.N., De Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), observe plasma membrane immunostaining as well as a punctate and diffuse staining throughout the cell when crude antiserum is employed. However, if the monospecificity of the antiserum is maximized by immunoaffinity purifying it against heterologously expressed AVP1, only the structure-specific focused staining we describe here is observed. The implication is clear, the antisera raised against peptide sequences TKAADVGADLVGKIE and HKAAVIGDTIGDPLK from AVP1, which have since proven to contain universal V-PPase antibodies (2Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), also contain antibodies that react with other parasite antigens. Because these antibodies were originally intended to be used in plants and yeast, they were raised in New Zealand White rabbits whose preimmune and immune sera were prescreened against these organisms, not parasitic protists.What cannot be determined from the investigations we describe here is whether the immunofluorescence seen is solely attributable to TgVP1 or is inclusive of other V-PPases. The antisera used in these studies were raised against peptides that are conserved among all V-PPases identified to date and, as such, do not distinguish type I from type II V-PPases (2Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was disappointing but none of the strategies applied in an attempt to circumvent this limitation were fruitful. Overexpression of TgVP1 fusions, for instance YFP fusions, consistently yielded aberrant nondividing cells, and all of our attempts at isolating a type II sequence from T. gondii were negative. There is a possibility that T. gondii does not contain a type II equivalent, in which case the immunolocalizations obtained are indeed exclusively attributable to TgVP1, but it is more likely, as is the case for P. falciparum (7McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M. Laroiya K. Rea P.A. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), that the levels of the type II V-PPase transcript are low, perhaps undetectable in the tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages that were screened. Because of this it is not known if the dynamic distribution of immunostaining is specific to a particular V-PPase or is a property of acidocalcisomes in general. Confirmation or refutation of these two alternatives will have to await the results of further screens, completion of the Toxoplasmagenome sequencing project, and/or expansion of the corresponding EST data base.The functional significance of the collar-like structure to which the V-PPase immunolocalizes during host cell invasion is intriguing. Despite the seeming similarity of the distribution of the V-PPase antigen with that of micronemes, the lack of colocalization of this enzyme with the microneme MIC3 antigen dispels the notion of a micronemal localization. Analogously, equivalent experiments using antibodies raised against rhoptry and dense granule antigens show little or no colocalization with the V-PPase (data not shown). The most logical explanation of these findings is therefore that the V-PPase immunolocalization detected is primarily to acidocalcisomal membranes and that in T. gondii these structures redistribute to assume a collar-like configuration during host cell infection.A speculation that warrants further investigation is that acidocalcisomes associate at least transitorily with the cytoskeleton and micronemes at the anterior end of tachyzoites and redistribute with the penetration furrow during parasite host cell invasion. Previous studies (45Lu H.G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating an aligned organization of electron-dense, acidocalcisome-like organelles at the cell periphery of amastigotes and in close proximity to the flagellum in trypomastigotes ofTrypanosoma imply acidocalcisome-cytoskeleton interactions. Moreover, as would be expected if this were the case, subcellular fractionation of these electron-dense vacuoles often results in their adherence to and copurification with cell ghosts fromTrypanosoma, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium (reviewed in Ref. 14Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is therefore noteworthy that recent immunofluorescence studies of the calmodulin-actomyosin complex in intracellular T. gondiidisclose an apically focused pattern very similar to that found for the V-PPase in this study (46Pezzella-D'Alessandro N., Le Moal H. Bonhomme A. Valere A. Klein C. Gomez-Marin J. Pinon J.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that earlier studies demonstrated an anteriorally displaced concentration of intracellular Ca2+within unidentified compartments, possibly acidocalcisomes, in the same organism (47Bonhomme A. Pingret L. Bonhomme P. Michel J. Balossier G. Le Moal H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1993; 25: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Knowing that microneme discharge, one of the first events in host cell invasion, requires the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores (48Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that acidocalcisomes serve as a source of this Ca2+. Acidocalcisomes may thereby provide the Ca2+ required for activating the calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinases that regulate the actomyosin motor that governs parasite motility and host cell invasion (46Pezzella-D'Alessandro N., Le Moal H. Bonhomme A. Valere A. Klein C. Gomez-Marin J. Pinon J.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If this were the case, the V-PPase would provide the motive force for acidocalcisomal Ca2+ accumulation by H+/Ca2+antiport.The finding that even high levels of AMDP do not block host cell invasion by T. gondii despite the dynamic pattern of V-PPase immunofluorescence during this process was unexpected. In retrospect, however, it might be expected in that biochemical investigations of the acidocalcisome-like intracellular structures in trypanosomatids andP. falciparum, which react with the same antisera as used in this study, have shown these structures to release Ca2+upon treatment with V-ATPase inhibitors and/or AMDP (12Marchesini N. Luo S. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem.

Thus, the inactivity, not the activity, of acidocalcisome-associated H+-pumps like the V-PPase may promote Ca2+release from these organelles, in which case AMDP would be expected not to interfere with host cell invasion. It may be instructive to consider, given how sensitive heterologously expressed TgVP1 is to inhibition by Ca2+, that Ca2+ release itself may abolish V-PPase activity, so diminishing or eliminating futile PPi consumption and H+gradient-dependent organellar Ca2+ uptake during host cell invasion.As an extension of our studies of the in vitro sensitivity of heterologously expressed TgVP1 to inhibition by AMDP and the studies made by ourselves and others (7McIntosh M.T.

We, in contrast, by counting the number of parasites per vacuole and examining their ultrastructure, have determined that AMDP concentrations as low as 5 μm(concentrations commensurate with the I50 for the in vitro inhibition of TgVP1) interfere with parasite replication. AMDP concentrations of 5–10 μm and above block or stall cell replication but not cell growth such that the formation of highly enlarged tachyzoites containing multiple nascent daughter cells is apparent. The effects of AMDP are accompanied by extensive enlargement of the parasite nucleus which becomes highly lobed and the inflation and/or disruption of acidocalcisome-like vesicular structures.The apparent absence of V-PPases from vertebrates and their likely involvement in energy conservation and membrane transport make these enzymes potential targets for the development of antiprotozoal agents. Notwithstanding these hopes and needs, it should be appreciated that care is required when interpreting the antiparasitic effects of AMDP. Two considerations are crucial. First, the efficacy AMDP in vivo is usually less than its efficacy in vitro, which likely reflects its bulky anionic character and slow permeation of membranes. Second, the greater intrinsic sensitivity of V-PPasesversus soluble PPases and other phosphohydrolases to AMDP is in part attributab"

We have identified residues within the DBD of ER that are critical for the functional interaction of ER with Stat5b. We show that disruption of the second zinc finger structure abrogated cross-talk between ER and Stat5b, while the structure of the first zinc finger was not important. Furthermore, we confirm that intact DNA binding activity was not required for potentiation of Stat5b activity and that the dimerization of ER did not seem to be involved. Ligand-bound ERs also modulated activating protein 1-dependent transcription, and our data demonstrate that both zinc finger structures of the ER DBD are important for an intact response. We show that introduction of various point mutations within the DBD altered the response of the receptor to 17β-estradiol and to the estrogen antagonists 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182,870 on the collagenase promoter.

These receptors belong to a large superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that share a well conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a structurally conserved ligand-binding domain. The N-terminal domains of these receptors, on the other hand, do not resemble each other (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M.

The classical mechanism of activation of ERs depends on ligand binding to the receptor following which the receptor dimerizes and binds to estrogen response elements (EREs) located within the promoters of estrogen-responsive genes (for review, see Ref. 3Nilsson S.

Ligand binding also induces a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor, which allows the recruitment of co-activator proteins (4Bevan C. Parker M. Exp.

This mechanism is referred to as cross-talk and is common for several nuclear receptors (for review, see Ref. 6Gottlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Google Scholar). We recently showed that ERα and ERβ efficiently potentiate the transcriptional activity of Stat5b when Stat5b is bound to the β-casein promoter upon prolactin (Prl) stimulation (7Björnström L.

We demonstrated that ERα and ERβ can interact with Stat5 through the DBD/hinge domain, and furthermore, we showed that the interaction of ER with classical co-activator proteins is dispensable for the potentiation of Stat5 activity. Ligand-bound ERs have also been demonstrated to up- and down-regulate the transcription of genes that contain AP-1 sites, binding sites for the Jun·Fos complex, in a cell- and ER subtype-specific manner (8Webb P.

The mechanism by which such cross-talk controls the expression of genes is not completely understood, but it is believed that the DNA binding activity of ER is not involved. The discovery of this mechanism would explain how estrogens regulate genes in which no consensus ERE has been found.In this study, we further examined the domain of ER required for a functional interaction with Stat5b. We show that specific residues within the second helical structure of the ER DBD are essential for the potentiation of Stat5b transcriptional activity, whereas intact DNA binding activity per se is not required. We also analyzed the influence of various ER DBD mutations on the regulation of AP-1-dependent transcription and propose that distinct parts of the ER DBD distinguish between the classical mechanism of action and cross-talk with Stat5b and AP-1.

https://openalex.org/W1964002634,"The bifunctional allosteric enzyme HPr kinase/phosphatase (HPrK/P) from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is a key enzyme in the main mechanism of carbon catabolite repression/activation (<i>i.e</i>. a means for the bacteria to adapt rapidly to environmental changes in carbon sources). In this regulation system, the enzyme can phosphorylate and dephosphorylate two proteins, HPr/HPr(Ser(P)) and Crh/Crh(Ser(P)), sensing the metabolic state of the cell. To acquire further insight into the properties of HPrK/P, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, and BIACORE were used to determine the oligomeric state of the protein under native conditions, revealing that the enzyme exists as a hexamer at pH 6.8 and as a monomer and dimer at pH 9.5. Using an <i>in vitro</i> radioactive assay, the influence of divalent cations, pH, temperature, and different glycolytic intermediates on the activity as well as kinetic parameters were investigated. The presence of divalent cations was found to be essential for both opposing activities of the enzyme. Furthermore, pH values equal to the internal pH of vegetative cells seem to favor the kinase activity, whereas lower pH values increased the phosphatase activity. Among the glycolytic intermediates evaluated, fructose 1,6-diphosphate and fructose 2,6-diphosphate were found to be allosteric activators in the kinase assay, whereas high concentrations inhibited the phosphatase activity, except for fructose 1,6-diphosphate in the case of HPr(Ser(P)). Phosphatase activity was induced by inorganic phosphate as well as acetyl phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Kinetic parameters indicate a preference for binding of HPr compared with Crh to the enzyme and supported a strong positive cooperativity. This work suggests that the oligomeric state of the enzyme is influenced by several effectors and is correlated to the kinase or phosphatase activity. The phosphatase activity is mainly supported by the hexameric form."

Correlation between binding capacity and potency of CD8+ T cell responses has been established, and it was shown that only HLA-peptide complexes of sufficient binding affinity and stability can be loaded and efficiently recognized by T cell receptors (TCR) of cytolytic CD8+ T cells (CTL) (6Sette A.

In such disease processes, an attractive route for immunotherapy consists in interfering with peptide presentation by blocking the HLA-binding groove with antagonist peptide competitors. The use of synthetic peptides and analogues of immunogenic peptides is hence of particular interest in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies as well as in the development of peptide-based therapeutic vaccines (9Rabinowitz J.D.

APLs exhibiting TCR partial agonism can change the cytokine patterns secreted by T cells; they can also affect the expression levels of specific activation markers such as CD11a (LFA-1) and CD25 (IL-2R) on the surface of T cells, and consequently influence the nature of intracellular signaling. This can lead to anergy or deletion of autoreactive T cells or on the contrary to the stimulation of the other T cell subsets (12Kersh G.J. Allen P.M.

Design of novel peptides with both high HLA binding affinity and capable of targeting specific HLA alleles can therefore also be used for modulating the immune system.Many studies devoted to these goals have used theoretical approaches to predict peptide sequences with the required affinity and selectivity for specific MHC molecules (for review see Ref. 17Weng Z. DeLisi C. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Most of these approaches relied on sequence information alone (18Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P.

The majority of these studies were done on class I molecules, where peptide recognition is more specific and better understood than in the class II molecules (19Gulukota K. Sidney J. Sette A.

This approach uses an automatic procedure, implemented in the software DESIGNER (22Wernisch L. Hery S. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 713-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) for selecting amino acid sequences that are compatible with a given peptide backbone conformation. This conformation is considered in the context of the three-dimensional structure of a specific MHC class I allele, the human HLA-A0201 allele, to which the peptide is bound.DESIGNER has been developed as a general procedure for selecting families of amino acid sequence likely to fold into the three-dimensional structure defined by a given template (22Wernisch L. Hery S. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 713-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Jaramillo A. Wernisch L. Hery S. Wodak S.J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 643-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Selected sequences are those that minimize a fitness function, which represents the protein free energy of folding. This function relies on basic physical chemical principles that underlie molecular interactions and protein stability. It combines the all atom force field of CHARMM (24MacKerell A.D., Jr. Bashford D. Bellott R.L. Dunbrack R.L., Jr. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H., Ha, S. Joseph-McCarthy D.

A. 1987; 84: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that unlike most other studies (27Kuhlman B. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10383-10388Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 28Raha K. Wollacott A.M. Italia M.J. Desjarlais J.R.

Marshall S.A. Mayo S.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) the parameters of this fitness function have not been adjusted to yield native-like sequences, and no constraints are imposed on the amino acid composition of the designed sequences.To predict peptide sequences that bind to the HLA-A0201 molecule, DESIGNER was run on six different templates derived from representative x-ray structures of HLA-A0201-peptide complexes deposited in the PDB (31Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26602) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1. For each of the six templates, DESIGNER produced all the sequences within 2 kcal/mol of the minimum energy sequence, and the sequences computed for all the six complexes were combined and ranked in order of increasing energy. In addition, the computed low energy sequences were re-ranked on the basis of their similarity to sequences of peptides retrieved from the MHCPEP data base (32Brusic V. Rudy G. Harrison L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and known to bind the same MHC allele.The five best ranking peptide sequences produced by the pure free-energy ranking and five other sequences obtained by the combined energy and similarity ranking were retained for experimental analysis. The 10 peptides were chemically synthesized and tested for their ability to bind HLA-A2 molecules and to form stable HLA-A2-peptide complexes. In addition, the most efficient binders were tested for their capacity to inhibit the recognition of two known CD8+T effectors.The remarkable results reported here are that all 10 peptides were found to actually bind the HLA-A2 molecules. Six peptides displayed 50–113% of the binding activity measured with the natural peptide used as control, as well as significant MHC stabilization. Furthermore, of the six most active peptides three displayed significant inhibition of the CD8+ T responses.In the following these findings are described in detail. They are rationalized in light of our current understanding of the factors that determine MHC-peptide interaction and TCR recognition, and their implications for the design of peptides that modulate the MHC-mediated immune response are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSComputational ProceduresSelection of Template StructuresThe HLA-A0201 allele type chosen for this work has the largest number of structures of MHC-peptide complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (31Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26602) Google Scholar). The April 2000 release of the PDB contained a total of 13 complexes with 9-residue peptides with different sequences and conformations. To ensure adequate exploration of sequence space for the bound peptide by the sequence design procedure (see below), this procedure was applied to several of these complexes, used as structural templates. To select the templates, the peptide backbones from all 13 complexes were superimposed, and whenever two peptide backbones were within 1-Å r.m.s. deviation of one another, they were considered as too similar, and one of the complexes (with the lowest resolution structure) was discarded. This yielded six MHC-peptide complexes with the following PDB codes: 1AKJ, 1BD2, 1B0G, 1HHG, 1HHK, and 1HHI, which were used as template for the sequence calculations.Automatic Sequence Design of MHC-binding PeptidesThe peptide sequences are predicted using the procedure implemented in the software DESIGNER, described previously (22Wernisch L. Hery S. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 713-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This procedure selects amino acid sequences compatible with a given structural template. It has two main components as follows: the fitness function, which measures the fitness of a given sequence for the structure at hand, and the optimization procedure, which selects highly scoring sequences from a very large number of possibilities.The fitness function is a quantity akin to the folding free energy. This quantity is computed as the difference between the free energies of the protein native folded state and a reference state used as a model for the protein unfolded state.The free energy of the folded state comprises an interaction energy with terms computed using the standard all atoms molecular mechanics force field of CHARMM (24MacKerell A.D., Jr. Bashford D. Bellott R.L. Dunbrack R.L., Jr. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H., Ha, S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L.K.K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiorkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11526) Google Scholar, 25Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13833) Google Scholar), and an implicit hydration term that depends linearly on the solvent-accessible surface area of the solute (26Ooi T. Oobatake M. Nemethy G. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The electrostatic term is computed using a dielectric constant of 8 and a switching function operating at a distance of 6–7 Å. Side chain conformations are modeled using the backbone-dependent rotamer library of Dunbrack and Karplus (33Dunbrack R.L., Jr. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 543-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). At each position, all natural amino acids are considered, except prolines. The free energy of the reference state is computed as the sum of the free energies of isolated amino acids, using exactly the same force field.To select amino acid sequences with lowest free energies, we used both the Dead-End elimination and a heuristic procedure with 250,000 iterations (22Wernisch L. Hery S. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 713-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Peptide sequences were selected by running DESIGNER on each of the six representative MHC-peptide complexes of the HLA-A0201 allele. For each complex, the bound peptide was stripped of its side chains. The bared peptide backbone and both the backbone and side chains of the MHC molecule were kept fixed at their crystallographic positions, constituting the fixed structural template, in whose environment the peptide sequence selection was performed. For each of the six complexes, DESIGNER produced all the sequences within a 2 kcal/mol of the minimum energy sequence, and the sequences computed for all the six complexes were combined and ranked in order of increasing energy.Whenever the bound peptide used as template contained a Pro residue, this residue was re-modeled as an Ala residue, by removing the Cγ and Cδ atoms; the backbone was not re-modeled.Use of Profiles of MHC Binding Peptides to Re-rank Peptide Sequences Selected by DESIGNERThe above-described sequence selection procedure should in principle produce a family of sequences corresponding to peptides that form stable complexes with the considered MHC allele. By having ranked these sequences in order of increasing free energy, those most likely to yield stable complexes are expected to appear at the top of the list. This is however not guaranteed, given the inaccuracies of the sequence selection procedure. It therefore seemed useful to apply in addition another selection criterion, based on sequences of peptides that are known to bind the same MHC allele. Such a criterion was obtained by scoring the predicted sequence against the profile derived from sequences of peptides known to bind to the HLA-A0201 allele.This profile was derived from sequences stored in the MHPEP data base (32Brusic V. Rudy G. Harrison L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because this data base contains very similar peptide sequences, the sequences were first clustered into groups with more than 50% sequence identity. For each group the occurrence of each of the 20 natural amino acids was recorded at each sequence position (9 in all) as a binary event (a given amino acid either occurs at a given position or it does not). The number of times an amino acid occurred at a given sequence position in all groups was then determined and used to derive the position-specific amino acid frequency matrix, or probabilityp(a,k), of having the amino acid a, at positionk along the sequence.The similarity score Sim, of a peptide sequence against this profile was computed as shown in Equation 1,Sim=∑kwk·p(a,k)Equation 1 where w k are position-specific weights whose values were set to 1 for all k.All the peptides selected by DESIGNER as having a free energy of 2 kcal/mol above the minimum were then re-ranked in order of decreasingSim value. Those with the highest Sim values were considered as most resembling the sequences of peptides known to bind the considered MHC allele, and hence as most likely to yield a stable complex.Experimental ProceduresPeptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry with the stepwise solid-phase methodology using a multichannel peptide synthesizer (34Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). Protected amino acids were coupled by in situactivation with (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, and N-Fmoc de-protection was performed as described previously (34Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). Side chain deprotection and cleavage of peptides from the solid support was performed by treatment with reagent K (82.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% water, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol) for 2 h 30 min at 20 °C (35King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences preparative HPLC system on an Aquapore ODS 20-μm column (100 × 10 mm). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile, 20% water (B) at a flow rate of 6 ml/min with UV detection at 220 nm.Analytical RP-HPLC was run on a Beckman Instruments (Gagny, France) with a Nucleosil C18 5-μm column (150 × 4.6 mm) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight spectra were obtained on a Protein TOFTM mass spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France).Preparation of HLA-A2 MoleculesHLA-A2 molecules were purified as described previously (36Choppin J. Cohen W. Bianco A. Briand J.P. Connan F. Dalod M. Guillet J.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines by affinity columns coupled to BB7.2 antibodies (Ab) directed against HLA-A2 molecules (HB82, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and frozen at −80 °C. HLA molecules were denatured in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 12.5 mm NaOH (pH 11.7) and 1.5 m urea for 1 h at 4 °C. The heavy chains and β2-microglobulin (β2m) were separated from endogenous peptides on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD10, AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 3 μm sodium azide (PBS-Tw). Then 2 μg/ml exogenous β2m (Sigma) and 6 mm CHAPS were added just before addition of exogenous peptide.Detection of Peptide/HLA InteractionsDirect Binding TestThe conditions of the test were described previously (36Choppin J. Cohen W. Bianco A. Briand J.P. Connan F. Dalod M. Guillet J.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of denatured HLA molecules in 2.5 ml of PBS containing all the additives described above were divided in aliquots containing 1 μg of HLA and incubated with exogenous peptide at 10−5–10−9m, in Eppendorf microtubes for 2 h at room temperature and then for 24 h at 4 °C. Each aliquot was further divided into 2 wells of a microtiter plate (100-μl well, Maxisorp Nunc) coated with anti-HLA-A2 BB7.2 Ab (10 μg/ml in PBS) and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. Correctly folded HLA complexes were assessed using anti-β2m monoclonal Ab M28 coupled to alkaline phosphatase and 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate as a substrate (Sigma). Fluorescence was measured at 355/460 nm (VICTORTM, Wallac, Evry, France). The positive control was a viral CD8+ epitope presented by HLA-A2, M.58-66 (GILGFVFTL) from matrix of influenza virus, and the negative control was an epitope presented by HLA-B27, NP.383–391 (SRYWAIRTR) from the nucleoprotein of influenza virus.Stability of Peptide-HLA ComplexesHLA denaturation and renaturation with 10−6m exogenous peptide were performed as described above. After an overnight incubation, unbound peptides were removed by centrifugation on NANOSEPTM 10K (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA). Samples were diluted in PBS-Tw and aliquoted into Eppendorf microtubes for further incubations at 37 °C for 1, 3, 5, 24, or 48 h. One aliquot (time 0) was tested immediately to measure the maximum number of complexes. The incubations with anti-HLA-A2 BB7.2 Ab and anti-β2m M28 Ab, respectively, were performed in microplates at 37 °C for 1 h. Final detection was performed as described above.Inhibition of T Cell ResponsesGeneration of Effector T cellsHuman T cell effectors were generated as described previously (16Ostankovitch M. Guichard G. Connan F. Muller S. Chaboissier A. Hoebeke J. Choppin J. Briand J.P. Guillet J.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar) after in vitrostimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-A2-ositive donors with synthetic peptides. Unfractionated PBMCs were seeded in 24-well plates with 1 μg/ml tetanus toxoid and 1 μm peptide M.58-66 or MART (Leu-27) 26-35 (ELAGIGILTV). Interleukins IL-7 and IL-2 were added as reported previously. Anti-M.58-66 T cell effectors were obtained after 3 weekly stimulations and anti-MART (Leu-27)-(26–35) T cell effectors after 6 stimulations.T Cell Recognition of HLA-A2-Peptide ComplexesThis was assessed using an Enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISPOT) assay detecting secretion of IFN-γ (36Choppin J. Cohen W. Bianco A. Briand J.P. Connan F. Dalod M. Guillet J.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 96-well nitrocellulose plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were coated with 2 μg/ml mouse anti-human IFN-γ monoclonal (number 1598-00 Genzyme, Rüsselheim, Germany). PBMC, either freshly isolated or thawed, were cultured overnight in complete medium and plated in triplicate at serial dilutions (3 × 105–104 cells per well). Appropriate stimuli were then added, and the plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After washing, the cells were incubated with 100 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-human IFN-γ antibody diluted 1:250 (IP500, Genzyme), then with a biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G diluted 1:500 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and finally with alkaline phosphatase-labeled extravidin (Sigma). Spots were developed by adding chromogenic alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad), and colored spots were counted in a stereomicroscope. A result was considered as significant when the numbers of spots were at least twice the background (the value given by negative peptides) and were proportional to the numbers of plated cells. Frequencies of IFN-γ spot-forming cells were calculated. Positive controls for interferon detection consisted of 6 wells containing 300–1000 cells stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 500 ng/ml ionomycin. This strong mitogenic stimulus verified that freezing and thawing did not introduce artifacts and was an indirect check of overall T cell viability. Negative controls for immune recognition consisted of epitopes derived from various viruses (for example, peptide Tax 11–19 from HTLV-1, which associates with HLA-A2) and never elicited a significant response compared with PBMC incubated in medium alone.Inhibition AssayPresenting T cells were sensitized with 5 × 10−9m peptide MART (Leu-27)-(26–35) and 10−8m peptide M.58-66, respectively. Peptides being tested as inhibitors were simultaneously added at molar concentrations varying from 0.1 to 1000× compared with the respective cognate peptides. ELISPOT assay was then performed as described above.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we used an automatic procedure to compute the amino acid sequences of peptides that are likely to bind the HLA-A2 MHC class I allele. A first remarkable result described here is that out of the 10 highest scoring peptides selected by our procedure, all were shown to actually bind the expected MHC protein. The six strongest HLA-A2 binders also promoted the assembly of stable HLA-A2-peptide complexes, albeit to varying degrees, and three peptides displayed significant capacities to inhibit CD8+ T cell recognition (for a summary of these results see Table S1 of the Supplemental Material).Of the six most active predicted peptides, peptides 2 and 5 were the best ranking candidates for MHC HLA-A2 binding, selected from among a very large number of sequences solely on the basis of the fitness function used"
https://openalex.org/W2081028907,"Regions of the brain's frontal lobe that are associated with memory retention and retrieval1,2 begin to mature during the last quarter of the first year in humans. This implies that infants younger than 8 or 9 months should have difficulty in registering an experience and retrieving it after a long delay3,4. Here we show that 13-month-old children are unable to recall a sequence of actions performed in front of them when they were 9 months old, whereas 21- and 28-month-olds are able to retrieve representations of the same acts when these were witnessed at 17 and 24 months. Our findings indicate that long-term retention increases during the second year and support the idea that maturation of the frontal lobe at the end of the first year contributes to memory enhancement during this period."
https://openalex.org/W2055112164,"Microtubule-associated protein MAP1A is expressed abundantly in mature neurons and is necessary for maintenance of neuronal morphology and localization of some molecules in association with the microtubule-based cytoskeleton. Previous studies indicated that its complementary expression together with MAP1B during nervous system development is regulated at the transcriptional level and that the mouse Map1A gene is transcribed under the control of 5′ and intronic promoters. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms that govern the neuronal cell-specific activation of the MAP1A 5′ promoter. We found that two regulatory factor for X box (RFX) binding sites in exon1 of both the mouse and human genes are important for effective transcriptional repression observed only in non-neuronal cells by reporter assays. Among RFX transcription factor family members, RFX1 and 3 mainly interact with repressive elements in vitro. Cotransfection studies indicated that RFX1, which is expressed ubiquitously, down-regulated the MAP1A 5′ promoter activity in non-neuronal cells. Unexpectedly, RFX3, which is abundantly expressed in neuronal cells, down-regulated the transactivity as well, when it was expressed in non-neuronal cells. Both RFX1 and 3 did not down-regulate the transactivity in neuronal cells. These results suggest that RFX1 and 3 are pivotal factors in down-regulation of theMAP1A 5′ promoter in non-neuronal cells. The cell type-specific down-regulation, however, does not depend simply on which RFX interacts with the elements, but seems to depend on underlying profound mechanisms.

The cell type-specific down-regulation, however, does not depend simply on which RFX interacts with the elements, but seems to depend on underlying profound mechanisms. microtubule-associated protein regulatory factor for X box DNA-binding domain cytomegalovirus major histocompatibility complex MAP1A is a high molecular weight MAP1 that plays an important role in determining neuronal morphology and in determining the balance between plasticity and stability of neuritis (1Matus A. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 19-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Nunez J. Fischer I. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1997; 8: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MAP1A and 1B are particularly abundant filamentous MAPs in the brain and possess highly similar structures and functions in their stabilization of microtubule bands. Recent studies have demonstrated that MAP1A interacts with postsynaptic density-93, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (3Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is involved in the general attachment of mRNA to the cytoskeleton (4Defranco C. Chicurel M.E. Potter H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, MAP1A seems to act not only in stabilizing microtubule bands but also in regulating the distribution of associated molecules as a linker between them and the microtuble-based cytoskeleton. MAP1B has been shown to link γ-aminobutyric acid, type C receptors to microtubule (5Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), indicating that MAP1A and 1B anchor distinct target molecules to the cytoskeleton. The different expression patterns of MAP1A and 1B, which are transcriptionally regulated (6Garner C.C. Garner A. Huber G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), also support the functional dichotomy of these two filamentous MAPs. MAP1B is the earliest MAP expressed during central nervous system development; it is most highly expressed during the postneonatal period, diminishing as the animal matures to adulthood (6Garner C.C. Garner A. Huber G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Safaei R. Fischer I. J.

In contrast, MAP1A expression increases continually during the postneonatal period and is maintained at a high level throughout adulthood (6Garner C.C. Garner A. Huber G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6006-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Multiple promoters, cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements and interacting homeoproteins have been reported for the MAP1Bgene (11Liu D. Fischer I. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu D. Fischer I. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Montesinos M.L. Foucher I. Conradt M. Mainguy G. Robel L. Prochiantz A. Volovitch M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); little is known, however, about the transcriptional regulation of the MAP1A gene. We previously revealed that two mRNA species differing at their 5′ ends were transcribed from the mouse Map1a gene and that each transcript was regulated under independent promoters (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The two alternative transcripts were expressed principally in the brain, but a short transcript under the control of an intronic promoter had a broader tissue-specific expression pattern. However, no cis-regulatory elements that confer neuronal cell-specific expression in a reporter assay were identified within about 2 kb 5′ to the transcription initiation sites of either promoter region. In the present study, we further investigate the regulatory elements necessary for neuronal cell-specific expression of the MAP1A gene. We present here several lines of evidence that RFX proteins, which comprise a unique winged-helix transcription family, down-regulate its 5′ promoter activity in non-neuronal cells. RFX homologues in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans are expressed specifically in subsets of sensory neurons (15Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Vandaele C. Coulon-Bublex M. Couble P. Durand B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the C. elegans RFX homologue is necessary for the normal function of these cells (15Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that transactivation of target genes by RFX is crucial for the nervous system in these species. We propose that mammalian RFX proteins contribute to the neuronal cell-specific gene expression by their repressive activity outside the nervous system. For expression analysis of the human long isoform of MAP1A mRNA, 2 μg of RNA isolated from culture cells with an RNAeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), were primed with random hexamers and reverse-transcribed with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C. PCR was carried out using the primer pair hU94 (5′-GGCTGGGGCTCCGAAGTCC-3′) and hL456 (5′-GCTGCTAAGAAGATGATGAACCTC-3′). PCR with a primer pair for β-actin (forward: 5′-TCAGAAGGACTCCTATGTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-TCTCTTTGATGTCACGCACG-3′) was performed in parallel as a control. Each PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 cycles in a GeneAmp 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following conditions: denaturing at 96 °C for 10 s, annealing at 58 °C for 10 s, extension at 72 °C for 20 s. Some of the amplified products were subcloned into the pGEM T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced in both directions with either a Prism Dye primer Sequenase kit or a BigDye Sequenase kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequence products were analyzed with a Geneanalyzer 373 and 310 (Applied Biosystems). Based on the similarity between the mouse Map1a gene and sequence in the human chromosome 15 working draft sequence segment (GenBank accession no. NT010194), we designed primer sets (5′ primer: 5′-GGAATGGCTGGAATACTGTT-3′, 3′ primer: 5′-ACTGCGGTGGAGGGTGTGAC-3′) to amplify putative exon 1 and the 5′-untranslated region of the humanMAP1A gene. Fragments amplified from HeLa cell genomic DNA were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. The mouse Map1apromoter constructs p1(+23), p1(+57), and p1(+104) were made by inserting PCR fragments into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The PCR fragments were amplified from a subclone of the mouse Map1agene derived from the phage clone N4 described previously (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A 5′ primer used for all three constructs was designed to add anXhoI site at the 5′ end, and 3′ primers specific for p1(+23), p1(+57), and p1(+104) were designed to add NcoI,HindIII, and XhoI sites, respectively, at the 3′ end. Each amplified fragment was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the respective sites in the pGL3 basic vector. The human MAP1A promoter constructs hMP1–2,hMP1–7, and hMP1–8 were made in a similar way. PCR fragments were amplified from the human MAP1A gene subclone described above and were engineered to contain anXhoI site at the 5′ end and a HindIII site at the 3′ end. The fragments were introduced between theXhoI-HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic vector after restriction enzyme digestion. Reporter constructs with mutations at the RFX sites, hMP1–8mu1, hMP1–8mu2, hMP1–8mu3, and hMP1–8mu4, were obtained using a QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide replacements introduced into the parental hMP1–8 clone are shown in Fig. 4 C. Altered MAP1Agene fragments were sequenced for confirmation, excised, and subcloned again into the pGL3 basic vector. The reporter construct, hMP1–2 G4BS, was made by introducing a PCR-amplified fragment corresponding to 5 tandem repeats of the GAL4 binding site into hMP1-2. The original fragment containing the 5× GAL4-binding sites was derived from the pFR-Luc plasmid supplied as a component of the PathDetect® system (Stratagene) and engineered to contain appropriate restriction sites at both ends for subcloning. The human RFX1 and RFX3 expression constructs, pFC R1 and pFC R3, were generated by subcloning full-length human RFX1 and RFX3 cDNAs into the NotI andBamHI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-5a vector (Sigma). Full-length RFX1 and RFX3 cDNA (GenBank accession nos. NM002981 and X76092) were obtained by PCR from a MARATHON human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and engineered to contain aNotI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The pFC R1DBD was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding residues 420–512 of RFX1 into the pFLAG-CMV-5a. pFC R1-G and pFC R3-G were obtained by inserting a cDNA fragment encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in front of the RFX cDNA in pFC R1 and pFC R3. The fragment was derived from pAS2–1, the bait vector in the yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech). Expected chimeric proteins have PGGRVG residues between GAL4 DBD and RFX1, and PGGRPGRSPPSPSPTNNTTIIHSQETI between GAL4 DBD and RFX3. pFC E-G was constructed by introducing the cDNA fragment encoding GAL4 DBD alone into the pFLAG-CMV-5a vector. pEGFP-R1 and pEGFP-R3 were made by inserting the respective cDNAs into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as described above. All of the PCR fragments described above were sequenced and confirmed as not harboring any PCR errors. The constructs were introduced into HeLa cells, and the expression of proteins of the expected sizes was verified by Western blotting. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described in our previous report with minor modification (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, each culture cell was plated on Falcon 12-well tissue culture plates at appropriate densities 16–18 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE and PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.3 μg of the reporter DNA, 0.03 μg of the pRL-TK vector as internal standard for transfection efficiency, 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 3 μl of Plus reagent was applied to one well, in which cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. In cotransfection experiments, 0.2 μg of the reporter and 0.2 μg of the expression construct, instead of 0.3 μg of the reporter alone, were applied. After a 3-h incubation, 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h after transfection. Transfected cells were harvested by lysis after an additional 24 h culture. Cell lysis buffer and reagents used in the luciferase assay were supplied in a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by Lumicounter (MicroTech Niti-on, Saitama, Japan). For each measurement, luciferase activity was normalized by the activity of sea-pansy luciferase derived from the pRL-TK. Each transfection was performed in triplicate for one experiment, and at least three independent experiments were conducted. Nuclear proteins used for DNase I footprinting and EMSA were prepared as described previously (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To prepare the probe for DNase I footprinting, the DNA fragment from −141 to +116 relative to the transcription initiation nucleotide of exon 1 of the mouseMap1a gene was subcloned into pBlueScript II (Stratagene). The construct was digested with XhoI and filled in with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP to label the 3′ end of the coding strand. The end-labeled DNA was digested withBamHI, and the excised fragment was gel-purified. Nuclear proteins and 2000–3000 cpm of the labeled probe were incubated in a final volume of 100 μl (20 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 20 min. After the addition of 100 μl of salt mix (10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2), DNase I digestion was performed on ice for 3 min by adding 10 μl of diluted DNase I (Takara Biomedicals). Digestion was stopped by adding 200 μl of stop mix (200 mm NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 125 μg/ml tRNA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. DNA was extracted, precipitated, resuspended in denaturing loading dye, and separated on a sequencing gel. The Maxam-Gilbert sequencing G ladder of the probe was run in parallel as a molecular size marker. The oligonucleotides used as EMSA probes and unlabeled competitors were as follows: 5′ RFX, (5′-CGCGGGTGTTTCCATGGAGACCGAGGCC-3′); 3′ RFX, (5′-CGGCGTTGCCATGGAGACAACTGGC-3′); Polyoma virus EP site, (5′-GGCCAGTTGCCTAGCAACTAATAC-3′); 3′ RFX mutant1, (5′-GGCGTTGCCATGCAGTGAACT-3′); and 3′ RFX mutant2, (5′-GGCCATGGCATGGAGACAACT-3′). The above oligonucleotides were annealed with respective complementary oligonucleotides, and some of them were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP during a filling-in reaction using Klenow fragments. The labeled probes were purified with G-25 Quick Spin Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The binding reaction was carried out in a total volume of 16 μl (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol), containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at room temperature. The amounts of nuclear proteins used are indicated in thelegend for Fig. 5. The probes were applied at volumes corresponding to 10,000–20,000 cpm. The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide, 22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA gels at 200 V for 2–3 h at room temperature. For supershift assay, the binding reactions were incubated further with antiserum or preimmune rabbit serum at final dilutions of 1/100 for RFX1, 1/20 for RFX2, and 1/40 for RFX3, for 30 min at room temperature. Antisera against RFX 1, 2, and 3 were kindly provided by Walter Reith (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Of two 5′ alternative transcripts driven by independent promoters, the expression of the shorter transcript, regulated by the intronic promoter, was not highly restricted within neuronal cells (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused our investigation on the 5′ promoter that confers brain-specific expression of the long transcript in mouse tissues and neuronal cell-specific expression among culture cells. Because we did not find significant neuronal cell-specific cis elements within a 2.4-kb region 5′ to exon 1 (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we examined a region 3′ to the transcription initiation site. We made several constructs differing in their 3′ ends, but all constructs contained in common the 5′ basal promoter consisting of three Sp1-binding sites and one Y/CCAAT box (Fig. 1 A). 3′ extension of the inserted genomic fragment to a part of exon 1 resulted in repression of promoter activity in non-neuronal cells, especially in HeLa cells, whereas it did not significantly affect transactivity in neuronal cells (Fig. 1 B). Further extension of the 3′ end had no significant effects on promoter activity in either neuronal or non-neuronal cells (data not shown). To determine whether the region necessary for the transcriptional repression in non-neuronal cells was occupied by nuclear proteins, and to determine the precise nucleotide regions that interact with nuclear proteins, we performed DNase I footprinting. The result shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that protected patterns differed slightly from each other depending on the cell type from which the nuclear proteins were prepared. Two regions spanning from +24 to +46 and from +68 to +89 relative to the transcription start site of exon 1, however, were protected in all cases. In addition, multiple regions of the basal promoter were also protected, confirming our previous report (14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Data base search by MatInspector V2.2 at transfac.gbf.de (17Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) revealed that both of the protected regions in exon 1 include nucleotide sequences highly similar to the RFX1 binding consensus sequence. Thus, the results presented in Figs. 1 and2 suggest that exon 1 of the mouse Map1a gene contains repressive elements that confer neuronal cell-specific expression of the long transcript and that the elements are most likely RFX1 binding sites, yet they are occupied by nuclear proteins prepared from both non-neuronal and neuronal cells. To further investigate the role of the RFX1 binding sites inMAP1A transcriptional regulation, we searched for conserved elements in the human MAP1A gene, for which the long transcript has not yet been identified. We retrieved 20 kb in sequence 5′ to, and 5′ of the human MAP1A gene from a Homo sapiens chromosome 15 working draft sequence segment (GenBank accession no. NT010194). Comparison of the region with the 5′ part of the mouse Map1a gene (Ref. 14Nakayama A. Odajima T. Murakami H. Mori N. Takahashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, GenBank accession no.AF182208–11) revealed that the 5′ exons are conserved in the human gene. Segments highly similar to exons 1, 2, and 3 of the mouse gene were identified about 9.7 kb, 8.4 kb, and 3.0 kb, respectively, upstream from the previously identified human exon 1 (18Fink J.K. Jones S.M. Esposito C. Wilkowski J. Genomics. 1996; 35: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the segments homologous to mouse exons 1, 2, and 3 were transcribed as parts of MAP1A mRNA in human brain by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (data not shown); exon numbers of the human gene will be presented as they occur in the mouse gene hereafter in this study (Fig. 3 A). We designed primer sets to obtain a human genomic fragment containing theMAP1A 5′ promoter and exon 1 and amplified a fragment from HeLa cell genomic DNA. Its sequence was completely identical with the sequence reported in GenBank, and a portion is shown in Fig. 3 B aligned with the corresponding mouse genomic sequence. The basal promoter region containing three Sp1 sites and one Y/CCAAT box is conserved between human and mouse. Both RFX binding motifs in exon1 are also conserved in the human gene, with minor differences in the 5′ RFX binding motif. Next, we examined by RT-PCR whether the long isoform of MAP1A mRNA, the 5′ part of which consists of exons 1, 2 and 4, is expressed specifically in human neuronal cells. A 386-bp DNA fragment was amplified with a set of specific primers from RT products of neuroblastoma mRNA (Fig. 3 C,TGW and LA-N-5). The fragment was confirmed to be an expected product by sequencing. The long transcript was also expressed at low levels in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and HeLa adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, amplified products were hardly observed from HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate that the genomic structure and RFX-binding motifs in exon 1 are conserved in human, and the long transcript is expressed preferentially in human neuronal cells. On confirmation that the exon-intron structure and 5′ promoter region were conserved in the human gene, further reporter assays were conducted using human genomic fragments to take advantage of their ability to be examined in a variety of homologous cell lines. The human MAP1A basal promoter construct,hMP1–2, efficiently transactivated the reporter gene up to 70- to 300-fold above the promoterless reporter, pGL3 basic in all cell lines tested except for Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, in which the activity was 14- to 20-fold above the pGL3 basic. An additional potential Sp1 binding site found only in the human gene (Fig. 3 B, Sp1(H)) was not required for promoter activity (data not shown). Like the mouse promoter, the 5′ end of exon 1, which contains the two RFX-binding sites, has a remarkable repressive effect in non-neuronal cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Promoter activity of a reporter hMP1–8 construct containing the two RFX sites was 5% or less of that of a basal promoter construct, hMP1–2 in HeLa, HT29, and A431 cells. Repression was also seen in Saos-2 osteosarcoma and HEK293 embryonic kidney cells. In contrast to the mouse promoter, however, the two RFX sites acted as weak repressors in the neuronal cell lines TGW and LA-N-5. To confirm that the RFX-binding sites are critical for repression, we created reporters with mutations in the RFX sites. Because an RFX protein can bind to a half-consensus site as a monomer, albeit less effectively than as part of a homo- or heterodimers binding to a full palindromic consensus site (19Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), mutations were introduced in each of the four half-sites of the two full palindromic consensus sequences in theMAP1A gene (Fig. 4 C). As shown in Fig. 4 D, all mutations resulted in up-regulation of transactivity compared with the parental reporter hMP1–8 in HeLa, HT29, and A431 cells, indicating that all the mutations disabled repression. Among the four RFX-binding half-sites, the 3′ half of the 3′ RFX, mutated in hMP1–8mu1, which was 8- to 10-fold more active than the wild-type in epithelial cells, appears to be most crucial for repressive activity. This site also seemed responsible for the weak repression in TGW cells. The 5′ half of the 3′ RFX-binding site and either halves of the 5′ RFX-binding site were considered necessary for full repression in epithelial cells. These three mutations had no significant effects on promoter activity in TGW. The above reporter assays strongly suggested that the two RFX sites are repressors acting preferentially in non-neuronal cells. DNase I footprinting, however, indicated that the RFX sites in theMAP1A gene were occupied by nuclear proteins from all cell types. Identification of the binding proteins would give an insight into the mechanism by which transcription is regulated differently among cell types. Gel-shift experiments revealed that multiple complexes that differ among cell types interact with the 3′ RFX sequence of the MAP1A gene (Fig. 5 A). Five retarded bands, A, B, and C, representing relatively slow moving complexes, and D and E, representing fast moving ones, were identified using TGW nuclear extract. Bands A, B, and C were obtained using nuclear extracts from all cells examined, but their relative intensities were variable. Band E was also observed very faintly in experiments conducted with LA-N-5 and Neuro2A nuclear extracts. These retarded band patterns were observed as well when the 5′ RFX sites in the mouse and humanMAP1A genes, an RFX site in the interleukin 5 receptor α gene, and a polyoma virus EP site, were used as probes (data not shown). The specificity of complex formation was examined further by competition experiments. Complexes formed with both HeLa and TGW nuclear extracts were competed apart by an excess amount of non-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the 3′ RFX sequence (Fig. 5 B, lane self). Competing oligonucleotides containing the MAP1A 5′ RFX sequence or the polyoma virus EP sequence diminished complex formation as well, but less effectively than those encoding the MAP1A 3′ RFX (compare lanes 5′RFX and PyEP withlane self in Fig. 5 B). Oligonucleotides containing the MAP1A 3′ RFX site harboring the same mutations as were introduced in the reporter assay did not affect the band patterns, confirming that complex formation depends critically on the entire core sequence of the RFX site (Fig. 5 B, mu1 and mu2). Next, supershift experiments with specific antibodies were performed to identify which RFX proteins are involved in the complexes. Among mammalian RFX proteins, RFX1–RFX3 comprise a subfamily because of their highly similar target DNA specificities (20Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, all bands except for band E were supershifted by an anti-RFX1 antibody. The supershifted band ss1 was not thought to contain a complex derived from band A and B, because it was not observed when EMSA was conducted using the HeLa cell nuclear extract, which shifts band A and B intensely. The complex derived by the anti-RFX1 antibody and band A and B did not seem to enter the gel efficiently, because high amounts of radioactive complexes were observed in the loading wells above the gel in the lanes where anti-RFX1 antibody had been applied (data not shown). Thus, the supershifted band ss1 was most likely derived from band C. The complex E band was supershifted by an anti-RFX3 antibody, but the supershifted band could not be separated clearly from the other bands, as was reported previously (21Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E.

https://openalex.org/W2050765821,"Thymidine kinase (TK) is a growth factor-inducible enzyme that is highly expressed in proliferating mammalian cells. Expression of mouse TK mRNA is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms including antisense transcription. Here we report the identification of a novel gene that is divergently transcribed from the bidirectional TK promoter. This gene encodes kynurenine formamidase (KF), an enzyme of the tryptophan metabolism. Whereas the TK gene is induced upon interleukin-2-mediated activation of resting T cells, the KF gene becomes simultaneously repressed. The TK promoter is regulated by E2F, SP1, histone acetyltransferases, and deacetylases. The binding site for the growth-regulated transcription factor E2F is beneficial for TK promoter activity but not required for KF expression. In contrast, the SP1 binding site is crucial for transcription in both directions. Inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A leads to increased histone acetylation at the TK/KF promoter and thereby to selective activation of the TK promoter and simultaneous shut-off of KF expression. Similarly, TK gene activation by interleukin-2 is linked to histone hyperacetylation, whereas KF expression correlates with reduced histone acetylation.

The expression of these genes is low in resting cells but increases to high levels when cells traverse the G1/S boundary. Multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional as well as at the post-transcriptional level ensure the exclusive expression of the TK gene in replicating cells. As measured by run-on experiments, TK mRNA levels are regulated by a growth-dependent rise in transcription rate (1Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol.

It was demonstrated that upstream elements recognized by protein complexes containing E2F, pocket proteins, and SP1 are crucial for transcriptional activation of the TK gene (3Dou Q.P.

Recently, we have shown that in addition to its association with pocket proteins, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) can repress TK gene expression by targeting SP1 in resting mouse fibroblasts (11Doetzlhofer A.

E2F1 can compete with HDAC1 for binding to SP1, thereby relieving HDAC1-mediated repression of the TK promoter. Further, two DNase-hypersensitive sites within intron 2 of the murine TK gene had been identified, and the presence of these sequences was shown to positively modulate the activity of the TK promoter (12Rotheneder H. Grabner M. Wintersberger E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6805-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The identification of growth arrest-specific antisense transcription of the TK locus in mouse fibroblasts provided more evidence for the complex regulation of the TK gene during growth stimulation (2Sutterluety H.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that the sequence of about 500 bp upstream of the TK initiation codon contains a bidirectional promoter active in both directions, raising the possibility of a divergently expressed gene. In the present study, we identified a novel gene encoding for mouse kynurenine formamidase (KF) that is transcribed in antisense to the TK gene. The translational start codons of the TK and KF gene are separated by only 172 bp, suggesting a coordinated transcriptional regulation of these genes. Primer extension and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) analysis showed that transcription of the KF gene was mainly initiated within the bidirectional promoter region but also revealed a minor transcription start site within intron 2 of the TK gene, which was infrequently used in liver. Interestingly, we found that transcription of the KF gene in T cells was inversely regulated compared with the TK gene. The KF gene was only transcribed in resting cells, whereas transcription of the TK gene was activated in proliferating T cells. Finally, by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that activation of the TK gene involves hyperacetylation of histone H4 associated with the bidirectional promoter region. In contrast, transcription of the KF gene can occur in the presence of hypoacetylated histones. Cell lines Swiss 3T3, HeLa, and TIB73 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. B6.1 T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) (kind gift of M. Nabholz, ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland). B6.1 cells were growth-arrested for 34 h in medium without IL-2 and restimulated to enter the cell cycle by adding fresh medium containing IL-2 (1Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13074-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth arrest and stimulation were routinely controlled by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with a Partec PAS-II sorter. For transient transfection, a series of 5′ deletion constructs were generated spanning from −1 to −1800 bp of the translational start codon using PCR primers containing XhoI andKpnI restriction sites and cloned into the pGL2neo vector. To obtain pKF170, pKF-SP1mut, and pKF-E2Fmut, the vector pMSGTKCAT and the corresponding constructs with mutated binding sites for either SP1 or E2F (11Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were used as PCR template using primers containingXhoI and NheI restriction sites. To generate pTK, pTK-SP1mut and pTK-E2Fmut primers containing KpnI andNheI restriction sites were used. To obtain pKF1800-SP1mut and pKF1800-E2Fmut, plasmids pKF-SP1mut and pKF-E2Fmut were digested with XmnI and the fragment containing the individual point mutations were ligated into XmnI-digested pKF1800 vector. For transfection, 8 × 104 HeLa cells or TIB73 cells were seeded in 3-cm diameter Petri dishes and transfected the following day with a total of 2 μg of DNA using polyethyleneimine-assisted gene transfer (14Baker A. Saltik M. Lehrmann H. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 2 μl of polyethyleneimine were diluted in 125 μl of HEPES-buffered saline and added dropwise to 2 μg of DNA diluted in 125 μl of HEPES-buffered saline. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the transfection mix was added to the cells, which, prior to the transfection, had their growth medium replaced by 800 μl of serum-free medium. The transfection medium was replaced by fresh medium after 6 h. After 48 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. The KF cDNA sequence was determined by standard methods. Data base searching and alignments were performed at NCBI using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Algorithm (BLAST). The nonredundant and the expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases were sourced. Protein homology searches were performed by comparing the amino acid query sequence against the SWISSPROT data base at NCBI. The full-length mouse KF cDNA sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession numberAY099479). The BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the mouse KF cDNA was cloned in frame into theBamHI/EcoRI-digested retroviral pBabe-His2myc vector, and the stop codon of the mouse KF cDNA was removed. High titer retroviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of BOSC23 cells and used to infect Swiss 3T3 cells as described previously (15Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected for 2 weeks in culture medium supplemented with 2.5 μg of puromycin per ml and analyzed for expression of epitope-tagged KF by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Infected Swiss 3T3 cells expressing epitope-tagged KF were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The Myc-tagged proteins were detected with monoclonal antibody 9E10 and visualized with a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Accu-Specs) in a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope. Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver, and poly(A)+ mRNA was purified using the Oligotex mRNA midi kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides and 1 μg of poly(A)+-selected RNA were dissolved in 10 μl of water, heated up to 70 °C for 10 min, and chilled on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The same oligonucleotides were also used to sequence the mouse genomic regions cloned into pAT153 vectors. Reaction products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography overnight. The 5′-RACE procedure was carried out on 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a mouse liver using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers have been used: KF2ext as GSP1 (first-round PCR nested primer) and KFext or KFXhoI as GSP2 (second-round nested PCR primer). Adapter primers AP1 and AP2 were provided by the kit. All PCRs were performed with the Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix from Clontech using a Biometra trio thermoblock. 5′-RACE reaction products were cloned into a pT7Blue-3 vector using the Perfectly blunt cloning kit (Novagen). Clones were sequenced from both ends using primers T7 and U-19mer, and the sequence was aligned with the genomic region of the KF gene. Analysis of genomic DNA was performed as described (16Seiser C. Knofler M. Rudelstorfer I. Haas R. Wintersberger E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized by the sandwich method (17Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and washed under high stringency conditions. Isolation of total RNA was done with TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. Northern blot hybridization was performed by the sandwich method (17Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of Myc-tagged KF and HDAC1 was performed as previously described (11Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed for 20 min in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) as described previously (1Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13074-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing was done as reported by Sutterluety et al. (2Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Doetzlhofer A. Khier H. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4989-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TK and KF cDNA fragments were subcloned in M13-derived vectors and used as single-stranded probes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (18Hauser C. Schuettengruber B. Bartl S. Lagger G. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7820-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Chromatin was cross-linked for 10 min using formaldehyde. The resulting chromatin solution was diluted 1:10 and precipitated with 10 μl of acetyl-specific histone antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The following day, chromatin-antibody complexes were isolated from the solution by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) while rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were harvested and washed as described (18Hauser C. Schuettengruber B. Bartl S. Lagger G. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7820-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted from the A-Sepharose beads by the addition of 2% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3, and 10 mm dithiothreitol to the pellet. Cross-linking was reversed by the addition of 0.05 volume of 4m NaCl and incubation of the eluted samples for 6 h at 65 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in water. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for KF and histone H4 gene sequences by PCR. All PCRs were performed on a Biometra D3 thermocycler using Promega PCR Master Mix. Primer sequences are available upon request. The linear range for each primer pair was determined empirically using different amounts of B6.1 genomic DNA. PCRs with increasing amounts of genomic DNA were carried out along with the immunoprecipitated DNA. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose-TAE gels and quantified using the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences). Previous findings (2Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Doetzlhofer A. Khier H. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4989-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Weichselbraun I. Ogris E. Wintersberger E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggested the presence of an antisense orientated gene within the murine TK gene locus. In order to identify the corresponding antisense transcript, we performed a DNA data base search with the sequence corresponding to the 1-kb upstream region of the TK promoter (Fig. 1 A). Data base searches were carried out with the BLAST search algorithm at the NCBI. We detected a significant homology between a sequence within the murine TK promoter and an EST clone derived from mouse liver (GenBankTMaccession number AA245789). The homologous sequence began 170 bp upstream of the TK gene and extended for 83 bp to a 5′ splice consensus, in agreement with the presence of an exon of an antisense gene in the TK upstream region. Interestingly, the 83-bp sequence identity started exactly at the 5′-end of the EST clone. Further, this putative exon sequence included a potential start codon. The surrounding sequence had a reasonable match to the Kozak translation initiation consensus (19Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar), consistent with it being the first exon of a putative gene. Additional data base searches revealed homologous EST clones in humans (BG118921), rats (BI295156), and hamsters (X99216). The 5′-end of these cDNAs showed significant homology with corresponding sequences within the upstream region of the respective TK genes (data not shown). A previously identified 18-mer sequence, which is conserved in the TK promoter from mice, humans, and hamsters and was originally thought to have a potential regulatory function (16Seiser C. Knofler M. Rudelstorfer I. Haas R. Wintersberger E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is located at the end of exon 1 of the newly identified gene. To obtain more information about the full-length cDNA of the newly identified gene, cloning in silico was applied. Successive BLAST searches with the EST clone AA245789 as query sequence were used to identify overlapping sequences in the EST data base at the NCBI (Fig. 1 C). Each of these matches was, in turn, searched against the EST data base. Using this approach, we were able to identify several EST clones extending the 3′ part of the putative cDNA. No 5′-overlapping EST clones were found, suggesting that the 5′-end of the EST clone AA245789 corresponded to the 5′-end of the mature mRNA. The most 3′-located EST clone (GenBankTMaccession number AA920084) contained a putative polyadenylation signal, consistent with being the true 3′-end of the cDNA. The complete cDNA was about 2.3 kb in size with a 3′-untranslated region consisting of 1.4 kb. Sequence analysis showed that the EST clone contained an open reading frame of 918 nucleotides, which encoded a putative 305-residue protein (Fig. 1 B). This protein was very recently identified as KF, an enzyme involved in tryptophan degradation (20Pabarcus M.K. Casida J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with the size of the purified mouse KF enzyme (20Pabarcus M.K. Casida J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in vitro transcription-translation experiments confirmed the molecular mass of 34 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence (data not shown). The previously described cosmid TKcosA carrying the entire mouse TK gene and additional 10-kb upstream sequences (15Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was analyzed to map putative KF exon sequences. The EST clone AA245789 was subjected to detailed restriction analysis, and three subfragments (E/S-200, S-700, and S/N-540) were used for Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). Hybridization of these fragments to a Southern blot ofAccI-, EcoRI-, or HindIII-digested TKcosA DNA revealed the presence of multiple, putative exon sequences located within the upstream region of the TK gene (Fig. 2 B). Each fragment produced a characteristic pattern of signals, which resulted from the presence of KF exons. With the S/N-540 fragment, only a very weak hybridization signal was observed, indicating the presence of only short homologous DNA sequences on the TKcosA clone. Further detailed restriction and sequence analysis of the cosmid clone TKcosA allowed us to position 10 exons and the corresponding introns to set up the KF gene structure (Fig. 2 C). The first 10 KF exons representing the first 910 bp of the EST clone AA245789 included the complete open reading frame. The sequence of these exons showed 100% homology to the sequence of the KF mRNA. Based on sequence information, the exon-intron boundaries and the exact size of each exon were determined (Table I). The size of exons ranged from 49 to 105 bp, whereas the size of introns fluctuated widely from 76 bp to 4.3 kb. The DNA sequences of all splice donor and acceptor sites complied with the invariant GT and AG rule.Table IExam-intron boundaries of the mouse KF gene on the TKcos A clone3′ splice acceptorExon no.

The presence of related but yet uncharacterized proteins in bacteria, plants, worms, and flies indicates that the KF protein is conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 3 A). To investigate the intracellular localization of the mouse KF protein, the protein was expressed with a Myc epitope at its carboxyl terminus in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Expression was monitored by Western blot analysis, which showed a single band with the expected size of about 35 kDa for Myc-tagged KF (Fig. 3 B). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the KF protein is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm but also to some extent in the nucleus (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, vector-transfected control cells gave no detectable signal. Overexpression of the KF protein had no effect on proliferation and cell cycle progression of transfected fibroblasts (data not shown). 5′-RACE analysis was performed with mRNA isolated from adult mouse liver to determine the transcription initiation site of the KF gene. The two most pronounced PCR products were subcloned and subjected to sequence analysis. The results indicated that the mouse KF gene initiated transcription at multiple sites. The longest 5′-RACE fragment extended up to intron 2 of the TK gene, 404 bp upstream of the KF ATG start codon. The shorter 5′-RACE product expanded up to 92 bp upstream of the KF translational start codon. This suggests that in liver, transcription of the KF gene is not only initiated within the promoter region shared with the TK gene but also within intron 2 of the TK gene. In order to verify results from 5′-RACE, primer extension analysis was performed on poly(A)+-selected mRNA from mouse liver (Fig. 4 A). Primers were designed to span putative transcriptional start sites and used for reverse transcription. Primers KFXhoI (lane 5, located in KF exon 1), KFext, and KF2ext (lanes 6and 7, located in KF exon 2) were used to investigate the downstream start site within the bidirectional promoter region. Primer KF552 (lane 8, located in TK exon 1) was used to examine the upstream start site within TK intron 2. In all cases, positioning of initiation sites (Fig. 4 A, black arrows) was consistent with 5′-end points determined by 5′-RACE. The occurrence of multiple bands with primer KFXhoI indicated that transcription within the bidirectional promoter region is initiated from various sites. The result from primer KF552 revealed a strong signal indicating a major transcription start site within TK intron 2. Alignment with a dideoxynucleotide sequence ladder from the same primer indicated that the strong band corresponds to an A that is located 404 bp upstream of the translational start codon. In Fig. 4 B, the sequence of the KF/TK gene locus and transcription start sites of each gene are shown. Results obtained from 5′-RACE and primer extension analysis indicated that two regions separated by 300 bp were used as transcription initiation sites in liver. Initiation of transcription within the bidirectional promoter region should give rise to a 2.6-kb transcript. On the contrary, transcription initiation in intron 2 of the TK gene should result in a 2.9-kb KF mRNA with an extended 5′-untranslated region. However, both putative KF transcripts comprise the same open reading frame encoding for the 305-residue KF protein. To analyze the actual size of KF mRNAs and tissue-specific expression of the KF gene, Northern blot analysis of different mouse tissues was performed (Fig. 5). Hybridization with a 700-bp fragment of the KF cDNA (KF 700) revealed a 2.6-kb transcript expressed in particular tissues. The highest KF mRNA levels were seen in liver. Significant expression was detected in kidney, whereas only very low KF mRNA levels were found in heart and spleen. Interestingly, both KF and TK were expressed in liver and spleen. To examine the expression of the longer KF transcript, Northern blot analysis was performed with a genomic DNA fragment encompassing the first two TK exons (Fig. 2 C,KF5′RACE). A signal corresponding to the longer 2.9-kb KF transcript was only detected in the liver (Fig. 5,black arrow). However, the band was very weak, indicating that the upstream transcription initiation site is utilized infrequently in liver and not at any detectable levels in other tissues. A second transcript detected by the same genomic probe corresponded to the TK mRNA (Fig. 5, gray arrow). The detection of smaller transcripts by the 5′-RACE probe was most likely due to cross-hybridization. As previously reported, TK gene expression is strongly regulated during growth induction and cell cycle progression. To examine a potential growth factor-dependent regulation of the KF gene, we utilized the IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line B6.1 (22von Boehmer H. Hengartner H. Nabholz M. Lernhardt W. Schreier M.H. Haas W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1979; 9: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing B6.1 cells were deprived of IL-2 for various periods of time, and levels of KF mRNA and TK mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6 A). Growth arrest was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. TK mRNA expression was high in dividing cells but rapidly diminished when cells arrested in G0 phase. In contrast, KF mRNA was absent in proliferating cells and was found to be increased in resting B6.1 cells. To examine whether induction of the KF gene during cell cycle arrest occurred at the transcriptional level, we performed run-on transcription assays of nuclei isolated from resting or IL-2-induced B6.1 cells (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with arrest-specific KF mRNA expression, the KF transcription rate was high in IL-2-deprived cells and strongly decreased when cells were restimulated to cycle. In contrast, TK transcription was very low in resting B6.1 cells but increased during IL-2 stimulation as previously reported (1Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13074-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that increased KF expression in resting B6.1 cells is at least in part due to transcriptional activation of the KF gene. Previously, it has been shown that the 490-bp upstream sequence of the TK gene exhibit bidirectional promoter activity (13Weichselbraun I. Ogris E. Wintersberger E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine whether upstream sequences of the KF gene enhance promoter activity in the opposite direction of the TK gene, a series of 5′ promoter deletion constructs including introns 1 and 2 of the TK gene were generated (Fig. 7 A). PCR-amplified fragments were inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2neo, and promoter activities were assessed by tr"
https://openalex.org/W2083107324,"Chemokines comprise a family of proteins that function in the immune response to recruit leukocytes to sites of infection. This recruitment is believed to be carried out by the establishment of a chemokine gradient by the binding of chemokines to sulfated polysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) located on the extracellular surface of endothelial cells. In the present studies, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of monomeric and dimeric chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β variants with a series of differentially sulfated disaccharides. The data define a GAG binding surface, including both basic and uncharged residues such as Arg18, Asn23, Val25, Thr44, Lys45, Arg46, and Ser47. Dissociation constants determined from these NMR studies consistently show for each disaccharide that dimeric wild type MIP-1β binds more tightly than monomeric MIP(9). Furthermore, analysis of the binding surface suggests that participation in the dimer of residues Met3, Gly4, and Ser5 may be responsible for this higher affinity. These studies also indicate that the specificity of MIP-1β for particular GAG disaccharides is directly related not only to the degree of disaccharide sulfation but also to the position of the sulfate moiety, withO-sulfation at position 2 of the hexuronic acid unit and position 6 of the d-glucosamine being major determinants for binding.

The abbreviations used for the disaccharides are those designated by the commercial suppliers (chemical structures for the disaccharides can be found in Fig. 4) MIP-1β1 is a member of the chemotactic cytokine (chemokine) superfamily, a large group of proteins that causes chemotaxis and activation of various subpopulations of cells in the immune system (1Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The activity of chemokines is believed to be mediated primarily through two types of interactions, the first of which involves chemokines binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), polyanionic polysaccharides found on the endothelial surface and the extracellular matrix. This immobilization of chemokines by GAGs is likely to play a key role in the formation of chemokine gradients, which are sensed by leukocytes and trigger localization of leukocyte subpopulations to the site of infection or injury (2Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The other major interaction involves the tight binding of chemokines to their seven-transmembrane helix, G-protein-coupled receptors on the surface of leukocytes. This interaction causes cellular activation and mediates chemotaxis.The chemokine superfamily has as many as 50 members (1Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 4Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is divided into subfamilies on the basis of the pattern of conserved cysteine residues at their N termini. One major subfamily, the CC subfamily, has two contiguous cysteine residues and includes such members as MIP-1β, MIP-1α, RANTES, and MCP-1. Another major subfamily, the CXC subfamily, has an amino acid separating the conserved cysteines and includes such members IL-8, SDF-1, and PF-4. Two minor subfamilies also exist, the CX3C and C subfamilies, which include fractalkine and lymphotactin, respectively.The G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with MIP-1β is called the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), and this receptor also binds two other CC chemokines, namely MIP-1α and RANTES. CCR5 has been shown to be used by strains of HIV-1 known as the “R5 strains,” as a coreceptor, making contacts with the HIV-1 surface that allow viral entry into the cell. Consequently, it has been shown that the CCR5 ligands MIP-1β, MIP-1α, and RANTES are effective inhibitors of these strains of HIV-1 infection due to their ability to block viral access to CCR5, and in some cases, to cause the internalization and down-regulation of CCR5 upon chemokine binding (5Dragic T. Litwin V. Allaway G.P. Martin S.R. Huang Y. Nagashima K.A. Cayanan C. Maddon P.J. Koup R.A. Moore J.P. Paxton W.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar, 6Mellado M.

The physiological role of the chemokine dimer is not known, because monomeric variants of MIP-1β and other chemokines effectively bind their cognate receptor in vitro (28Laurence J.S. Blanpain C.

Because the dimer does not appear to be involved in receptor function, it is possible that the chemokine dimer may be a critical mediator of GAG binding (8Laurence J.S. Blanpain C., De Leener A.

J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In principle, NMR studies of a chemokine·GAG complex should provide a clear indication of the GAG binding site on the protein, because residues whose resonances shift in the presence of GAGs are likely involved in GAG binding in some manner. In addition, analysis of the NMR spectra of the titration of a particular GAG with a chemokine should provide the dissociation constant for the interaction. The paucity of such data for chemokines is likely related to the oligomerization that GAGs induce upon binding chemokines (30Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), leading to aggregates too large to be analyzed by NMR. We have found MIP-1β to be amenable to structural study with heparin disaccharides. In the present study, NMR was used to analyze MIP-1β in the presence of eleven different disaccharides and allowed for the determination of the dissociation constant for the five found to bind the chemokine. Similarly, the GAG binding properties of a monomeric variant of MIP-1β known as MIP(9) were investigated. Combined, these studies report the binding surfaces for the monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. Finally, using a mutant of MIP-1β that displays less of a tendency to aggregate than the wild type protein, we have obtained what we believe to be the first NMR spectra of an anti-HIV CC chemokine in the presence of a GAG near neutral pH. MIP-1β1 is a member of the chemotactic cytokine (chemokine) superfamily, a large group of proteins that causes chemotaxis and activation of various subpopulations of cells in the immune system (1Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The activity of chemokines is believed to be mediated primarily through two types of interactions, the first of which involves chemokines binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), polyanionic polysaccharides found on the endothelial surface and the extracellular matrix. This immobilization of chemokines by GAGs is likely to play a key role in the formation of chemokine gradients, which are sensed by leukocytes and trigger localization of leukocyte subpopulations to the site of infection or injury (2Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The other major interaction involves the tight binding of chemokines to their seven-transmembrane helix, G-protein-coupled receptors on the surface of leukocytes. This interaction causes cellular activation and mediates chemotaxis. The chemokine superfamily has as many as 50 members (1Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 4Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is divided into subfamilies on the basis of the pattern of conserved cysteine residues at their N termini. One major subfamily, the CC subfamily, has two contiguous cysteine residues and includes such members as MIP-1β, MIP-1α, RANTES, and MCP-1. Another major subfamily, the CXC subfamily, has an amino acid separating the conserved cysteines and includes such members IL-8, SDF-1, and PF-4. Two minor subfamilies also exist, the CX3C and C subfamilies, which include fractalkine and lymphotactin, respectively. The G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with MIP-1β is called the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), and this receptor also binds two other CC chemokines, namely MIP-1α and RANTES. CCR5 has been shown to be used by strains of HIV-1 known as the “R5 strains,” as a coreceptor, making contacts with the HIV-1 surface that allow viral entry into the cell. Consequently, it has been shown that the CCR5 ligands MIP-1β, MIP-1α, and RANTES are effective inhibitors of these strains of HIV-1 infection due to their ability to block viral access to CCR5, and in some cases, to cause the internalization and down-regulation of CCR5 upon chemokine binding (5Dragic T.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2120-2127PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that simultaneous elimination of the three positively charged residues in the 40s region of MIP-1β (K45A/R46A/K48A) completely abrogates heparin binding ability (8Laurence J.S. Blanpain C., De Leener A. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, basic residues in this region have been identified as critical for GAG binding to RANTES (11Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C.

A structural understanding of GAG binding by chemokines is complicated by the fact that many chemokines have been shown to form tight dimers, particularly MIP-1β, MIP-1α, and RANTES (24Lodi P.J.

The physiological role of the chemokine dimer is not known, because monomeric variants of MIP-1β and other chemokines effectively bind their cognate receptor in vitro (28Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Burgner J.W. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R.

Because the dimer does not appear to be involved in receptor function, it is possible that the chemokine dimer may be a critical mediator of GAG binding (8Laurence J.S. Blanpain C., De Leener A. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A.

Although the structure of a chemokine in complex with a GAG has not yet been reported, the NMR spectra of PF-4, IL-8, and RANTES in the presence of saccharides have allowed some analysis of the binding sites of those proteins (12Proudfoot A.E.I. Fritchley S. Borlat F. Shaw J.P. Vilbois F. Zwahlen C. Trkola A. Marchant D. Clapham P.R. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In principle, NMR studies of a chemokine·GAG complex should provide a clear indication of the GAG binding site on the protein, because residues whose resonances shift in the presence of GAGs are likely involved in GAG binding in some manner. In addition, analysis of the NMR spectra of the titration of a particular GAG with a chemokine should provide the dissociation constant for the interaction. The paucity of such data for chemokines is likely related to the oligomerization that GAGs induce upon binding chemokines (30Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), leading to aggregates too large to be analyzed by NMR. We have found MIP-1β to be amenable to structural study with heparin disaccharides. In the present study, NMR was used to analyze MIP-1β in the presence of eleven different disaccharides and allowed for the determination of the dissociation constant for the five found to bind the chemokine. Similarly, the GAG binding properties of a monomeric variant of MIP-1β known as MIP(9) were investigated. Combined, these studies report the binding surfaces for the monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. Finally, using a mutant of MIP-1β that displays less of a tendency to aggregate than the wild type protein, we have obtained what we believe to be the first NMR spectra of an anti-HIV CC chemokine in the presence of a GAG near neutral pH.

The phenotype results from a gain of function mutation inPDR1, which encodes a transcription factor that acts as a regulator of pleiotropic drug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutant allele, PDR1(R821H), was found to result in increased expression of at least 19 genes, three of which are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Expression of at least six genes was required to show the low iron growth defect. Wild type cells transformed with the PDR1(R821H) allele or a PDR1 dominant allele (PDR1–3) showed the low iron growth defect as well as increased resistance to drugs such as cycloheximide and oligomycin. Transformation of PDR1(R821H) into Δccc1 cells, which were previously shown to have increased sensitivity to high iron medium because of defective vacuolar iron storage (Li, L., Chen, O. S., Ward, D.

Cells expressingPDR1(R821H) also showed increased resistance to copper and manganese because of increased metal export. These results suggest that expression of PDR1-regulated genes affects both efflux and storage of transition metals.

Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of yeast mutants that show defective growth under iron-limited conditions have shown that growth on low iron medium requires a functioning high affinity iron transport system (2Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The structural components of the high affinity transport system are the products of the FET3 and FTR1 genes, which are induced in response to iron deprivation by the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Fet3p mediates iron transport by acting as a ferroxidase, converting ferrous iron to ferric iron, which is then transported by the permease Ftr1p (5Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Many mutants have been found to be unable to grow on low iron as a consequence of defects in genes that encode components of the high affinity iron transport system or in genes required for assembly of the system (6Radisky D.C. Snyder W.B. Emr S.D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5662-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other mutants have been found to be unable to grow on low iron media, despite having a functional high affinity iron uptake system. The gene for one such mutant was identified to encode a methyl sterol oxidase, Erg25p, an oxo-diiron containing enzyme that catalyzes an oxygen-dependent step in ergosterol biosynthesis (2Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The gene was cloned because the erg25 mutant enzyme has a low affinity for iron. When cellular iron levels were low, the mutant enzyme lost activity resulting in sterol deficiency. Because little is known regarding intracellular iron metabolism, we have pursued the identification of genes that lead to defective intracellular iron metabolism. In this article we describe a mutant that is unable to grow on low iron media despite normal high affinity iron uptake. We show that the mutation is a gain of function allele of the transcription factorPDR1,1 which regulates a diverse set of genes, many of which are multidrug resistance genes. We suggest that expression of this dominant allele results in transition metal efflux and storage. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were derived from DY150 and DY1457 of the W303 background. MS35 is a mutant derived from DY150 that was isolated in a screen that selected for resistance to streptonigrin (3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The mutant was backcrossed two times to ensure that the phenotypes were caused by a single gene. The Δccc1 strain was made as previously described (7Li L. Chen O.S. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A library of strains with deletions of each of the nonessential genes in homozygous diploid (BY4743) backgrounds was purchased from Research Genetics. Luria-Bertani medium was used to propagate Escherichia colistrain DH5α. The strain was supplemented with antibiotics as required (8Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) and yeast nitrogen-base synthetic complete media (CM) were used for the standard growth ofS. cerevisiae and were supplemented as needed (9Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cycloheximide containing medium was prepared by adding 0.7 μg/ml cycloheximide to standard growth media (10Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oligomycin containing medium was prepared by adding 0.7 μg/ml oligomycin to yeast extract-peptone-glycerol ethanol (YPGE) (11Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Low iron growth medium was made by adding 40 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), an iron chelator, to standard growth medium and then adding back varying amounts of FeCl3 (3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Synthetic low iron medium (LIM), supplemented with varying amounts of FeCl3 and CuSO4, was used to limit both iron and/or copper (12Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The various LIM and BPS media used in this work are referred to as LIM(x) and BPS(x), where x equals the concentration in micromolar of added FeCl3. High metal growth media was made by adding the indicated amount of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O, ZnSO4, MnCl2, CoCl2, or CuSO4 to standard CM. The Δpdr1 strains were generated by double fusion polymerase chain reaction (13Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primers were: 5′-GTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGCTTAGG-3′, 5′-CATAGTAACGCCAAACGATCGC-3′, 5′-TCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCGCTTACAGTATCCTGTGGAGCGACGT-3′, and 5′-GACTATCAGAGATTGTGGCGC-3′. The HIS3 gene was used as the selectable marker. The PCR fusion products were transformed into DY150 and MS35 cells, and the deletion of the PDR1 gene was confirmed by PCR. Cells in early exponential phase were grown in either CM or CMBPS(0) for 6–8 h. The cells were washed and iron transport was assessed as previously described (3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. To measure iron uptake, 5 × 106 cells were mixed with 1 mm ascorbate and 0.5 μm59Fe, supplied as59FeCl3. Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, placed on filters (Whatman GF/C), and washed with EDTA containing buffer to remove unincorporated iron. The filters were air dried and associated radioactivity was determined. The uptake activity is expressed as femtomole of 59Fe uptake per min per 106 cells. Assays to measure iron retention were done as described previously (14Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells growing exponentially in CMBPS(0) were harvested and incubated in LIM-EDTA (i.e. LIM prepared without EDTA) (12Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with 0.5 μm59Fe at 30 °C for 10 min. Then, 1 mm BPS was added to aliquots of cells to chelate the free 59Fe. The cells were then incubated for up to 5 h. Associated radioactivity was measured at various time points throughout the 5-h incubation. RNA was isolated from DY150 and MS35 in early exponential phase grown in YPD. Total RNA was isolated using standard techniques (15Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). Purification of mRNA was done using thePromega PolyATtractTM mRNA isolation system. Fabrication of DNA microarrays, synthesis of fluorescent-labeled cDNA, hybridization to the microarrays, and subsequent scanning were performed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed using standard techniques (15Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). All samples were isolated from mid-log phase cultures grown in either CM or CMBPS(0). A α-32P-labeledPDR5 probe was generated using random primers and aPDR5 (YOR153W) open reading frame template from the Research Genetics open reading frame collection. RadioactiveICT1, FET3, and ACT1 probes were generated in a similar manner using ICT1 (YLR099C),FET3 (YMR058W), and ACT1 (YFL039C) open reading frames. DNA transformations of E. coli and S. cerevisiae were performed by standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PDR1 gene was cloned by transformation of MS35 with a yeast genomic library and selection for complementation of the low iron phenotype using techniques described previously (3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A single unique plasmid was isolated and mapped to chromosome VII by sequencing the ends of the plasmid insert. Subcloning mapped a minimum MS35 complementing activity to an AvrII-NheI fragment containing only PDR1. This fragment complemented MS35 when cloned into both high and low copy yeast expression vectors. The laboratory of Karl Kuchler (Biocenter, Vienna, Austria) generously provided the PDR1–3 allele. PDR3 was amplified via PCR using genomic DNA extracted from DY150 as a template and the following reaction conditions: denaturation, 94 °C, 40 s; annealing, 55 °C, 40 s; and elongation, 68 °C, 4 min. The following primers were used: 5′-ATTCTCACTGCCCTCTATGCC-3′, 5′-TTCCTCAGTATGAGTAGGGGG-3′. The PCR product was cloned using the TOPO XL PCR CloningTM Kit from Invitrogen. The PDR3 open reading frame was isolated from the pCR-XL-TOPO cloning vector using BamHI andNotI. The BamHI-NotI fragment complemented the MS35 low iron phenotype when cloned into both high and low copy yeast expression vectors. The mutated gene in MS35 was identified by constructing a library from the MS35 genome as outlined in standard protocols (15Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from mid-log phase MS35 cultures grown in YPD. Partial enzyme digestions on the genomic DNA were done using Sau3A1. The partially digested DNA was fractionated on a 10–40% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 22 h. Once fractionated, the DNA was ligated to pRS416-zero, a centromeric plasmid, digested with BamHI. Ligations were transformed by electroporation into ElectromaxTM DH10BTM E. coli cells purchased from Invitrogen (17Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 18Calvin N.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Once the amplified MS35 genomic library was extracted from bacteria, it was transformed into DY150 and screened for genes that conferred cycloheximide resistance to the wild type cells. Approximately 15,000 colonies were screened and six colonies were found to be cycloheximide resistant. Plasmids were recovered from the six positive candidates, and when sequenced were found to contain the same gene: PDR1 with a mutation of the arginine at position 821 to a histidine. The allele is referred to asPDR1(R821H). Cells were grown to mid-log phase in the indicated media. For whole cell readings, 2.0 × 108 cells were collected, washed by centrifugation four times with 50 mm Tris (pH 6.5), 10 mm EDTA, and once with sterile deionized water. The washed cells were frozen at −20 °C. Vacuoles were prepared as previously described (7Li L. Chen O.S. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and also frozen at −20 °C. The frozen samples were then digested in 200 μl of 5:2 nitric acid:perchloric acid at 80 °C for 1 h. After digestion, the samples were diluted to 1.0 ml with sterile-deionized water and then flamed in a Perkin-Elmer inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectroscope (19Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The yeast mutant MS35 was identified by its reduced growth on low iron medium. This defect may be caused by inactive high affinity iron transport, resulting from mutations in genes directly involved in iron transport or in genes involved in assembly of the transport system. Measurements of 59Fe transport were performed to determine the rate of iron uptake in wild type and MS35 cells. For both strains,59Fe uptake increased when cells were incubated in iron-poor media, a condition that induces the transcription ofFET3 and FTR1 (Fig. 1 A). The MS35 strain did show a lower rate of uptake, but this decrease is not expected to result in a growth defect, as we have previously observed that much more substantial reductions (>90%) in high affinity iron transport activity are required to show a phenotype of poor growth on low iron media (22Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22415-22419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, increased levels of Fet3p and Ftr1p are synthesized in response to low iron in MS35. An inability to grow on low iron can also result from defective copper loading of apoFet3p (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). As apoFet3p is copper-loaded in a post-Golgi intracellular compartment, defects in either copper homeostasis or vesicular traffic result in the appearance of apoFet3p on the cell surface. Cell surface apoFet3p can be copper-loaded by addition of high copper and chloride, restoring iron transport (6Radisky D.C. Snyder W.B. Emr S.D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5662-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutations in genes required for the assembly of Fet3p can be identified through suppression of the low iron growth defect by growth in high copper media in the presence of chloride. MS35 showed poor growth in iron-deficient media that was not suppressed by adding copper and chloride (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results show that the defect in MS35 is not because of a mutation in the assembly or function of the high affinity iron transport system. Thus, the inability to grow on low iron must be caused by a defect in intracellular iron metabolism. With the exception of the dominant alleleAFT1up, all other known mutations in iron transport have been found to be recessive. A diploid from a cross between MS35 and wild type cells, however, showed that the inability to grow on low iron media was semidominant (Fig. 1 C), as growth of the heterozygote on low iron media was greater than that of a homozygous mutant diploid but less than that of a wild type diploid. Sporulation of the heterozygote showed a 2:2 segregation pattern for the low iron phenotype (data not shown), indicating that this phenotype is because of a defect in a single gene. We performed a transcript analysis of mRNA isolated from mutant and wild type cells grown in YPD using microarrays. Results from two independent experiments demonstrated that MS35 cells showed increased transcription of at least 19 genes (Table I). Some of these genes are notable as belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein transporter family (23Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This transcription pattern is similar to that of the transcription factor PDR1, which regulates a large family of ATP transporters (24DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These ATP-driven membrane transporters are homologous to the mammalian multidrug resistance proteins and confer resistance to a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated agents (23Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For two of the up-regulated genes, PDR5 (pleiotropic drug resistance) andICT1 (increased copper tolerance), we verified increased expression in mutant cells using Northern analysis (Fig. 2 A), and showed that increased expression of these genes was seen in both high and low iron media. We note that Northern analysis suggests a much greater induction of these genes than microarray. Consistent with their multidrug-resistant transcriptional expression pattern, MS35 cells showed a marked resistance to both cycloheximide and oligomycin, two drugs that are unrelated in structure and function (Fig. 2 B).Table IUp-regulated genes in the mutant MS35GeneFunctionPhenotypeFold inducedS.D.ABC transporters YGR281W/YOR1Multidrug ATPaseMultidrug resistance2.900.06 YOR153W/PDR5Multidrug ATPaseMultidrug resistance2.470.04 YDR011W/SNQ2Multidrug ATPase, responds to singlet oxygenMultidrug resistance1.800.15MFS and other permeases YLL028W/TPO1MFS vacuolar polyamine transporterMultidrug resistance1.730.13 YOR049CTransporter of unknown substrateHomology to molasses resistance2.140.06 YBR291C/CTP1Mitochondrial citrate transportViable deletion2.120.18 YOR382W/FIT2Transporter of unknown substrateIncreased iron use efficiency1.810.09Cell wall metabolism YPL088WAryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, oxidoreductaseCalcofluor resistance3.160.18 YLR099C/ICT1Aromatic esteraseAzoles, benomyl resistance & increased copper tolerance3.130.27 YNR050C/LYS9OxidoreductaseLysine auxotroph2.040.04Unknown YLR346C?

Similar to the low iron phenotype, increased drug resistance was semidominant in a heterozygotic diploid of MS35 and wild type yeast (Fig. 2 C). Sporulation of 15 heterozygotic diploids showed a 2:2 cosegregation of cycloheximide resistance with the phenotype of poor growth on low iron, suggesting that both phenotypes are because of mutations in a single gene. Transcription of ABC genes is primarily controlled by two homologous transcription factors, Pdr1p (25Balzi E. Chen W. Ulaszewski S. Capieaux E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16871-16879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pdr3p (26Subik J. Ulaszewski S. Goffeau A. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which belong to a large family of zinc finger-containing transcription factors (28Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Pdr1p and Pdr3p have an overlapping pattern of regulation in that they control many of the same genes (27Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Semidominant gain of function point mutations in PDR1 and PDR3 have been characterized in yeast that, like MS35, are resistant to abnormally high concentrations of various drugs (29Nourani A. Papajova D. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Subik J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these mutants, as in MS35, levels of Pdr1p- and Pdr3p-regulated ABC genes are increased at least 2-fold (24DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Several experiments indicated that MS35 has a gain of function mutation in Pdr1p. First, expression of PDR1 or PDR3 from a high copy plasmid partially suppressed the low iron growth defect although the cycloheximide resistance phenotype was less affected (Fig. 3 A), consistent with studies showing that expression of the normal allele reduces the phenotype ofPDR gain of function alleles (10Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Mahe Y. Parle-McDermott A. Nourani A. Delahodde A. Lamprecht A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, deletion ofPDR1 in MS35 confers growth on low iron medium and abrogates cycloheximide and oligomycin resistance (Fig. 3 B). Third, transformation of wild type cells with a genomic library derived from MS35 cells and cloned into single copy plasmids resulted in the identification of plasmids that conferred both cycloheximide resistance and the low iron growth phenotype. Sequence analysis of the genes encoded on two of the plasmids revealed a PDR1 gene with a mutation that resulted in the substitution of histidine for arginine at amino acid position 821 (referred to henceforth asPDR1(R821H)). That PDR1(R821H) is mutated in the same region as other gain of function mutations (28Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) suggests that the mutation in MS35 is a gain of function allele of PDR1.Further support was provided when transformation of the gain of function allele PDR1–3 also conferred cycloheximide resistance and a low iron defect to wild type cells (Fig. 3 C). Finally, transformation of PDR1(R821H) into wild type cells leads to a reduction in high affinity iron transport (Fig. 3 D). Whereas we hypothesized that the decrease in iron transport activity in MS35 cells or in cells transformed withPDR1(R821H) was not great enough to lead to the observed low iron growth defect, we devised a genetic experiment to test this hypothesis. If PDR1(R821H) causes a low iron growth defect by affecting iron uptake, we would not expect the growth defect to occur in cells with a deletion in a component of the high affinity iron transport system. Cells containing a deletion in FET3 and transformed with a PDR1(R821H) containing plasmid were found to have a decided growth disadvantage when plated on low iron medium (Fig. 4 A). This result suggests that the low iron growth defect is independent of iron uptake activity. We considered the possibility that the low iron growth defect results from export or sequestration of cytosolic iron through genetic manipulation of CCC1, which encodes a transporter that effects the transport of iron from cytosol to vacuole (7Li L. Chen O.S. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Deletion ofCCC1 produces sensitivity to high medium iron concentrations because of an inability to sequester excess iron in the vacuole. Transformation of PDR1(R821H) into Δccc1 cells suppressed this high iron sensitivity (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that PDR1(R821H) affects iron efflux from the cell, sequestration of iron into cellular compartments, or a combination of these two effects. We attempted to measure iron efflux through the use of 59Fe pulse-chase experiments. Neither wild type cells nor MS35 cells, when incubated with 59Fe for 10 min, showed loss of radioactivity over a subsequent 5-h period (data not shown). These experiments were performed after cells had been incubated in low iron medium for 6 h, and under such conditions, it may not be possible to easily observe iron efflux because of low intracellular iron pools and/or the possible rapidity of the efflux process. We therefore examined the effect of PDR1(R821H) on cells incubated in high iron medium. Initially, we measured the total cellular iron content in wild type and Δccc1 cells transformed withPDR1(R821H) or a control vector. We observed that, when incubated in high iron medium, either wild type cells (Fig. 5 A) or Δccc1cells (Fig. 5 B) transformed with PDR1(R821H) had higher levels of iron than cells transformed with only the vector. Interestingly, we observed that in low iron medium the reverse was true: wild type or Δccc1 cells transformed withPDR1(R821H) had less iron than vector-transformed cells. As mentioned previously, the sensitivity of Δccc1 cells to high iron is thought to be because of cytosolic iron accumulation. IfPDR1(R821H)-transformed Δccc1 cells have more total cellular iron but are less iron sensitive, then we might expect that the increased iron is not in the cytosol. In fact, vacuoles isolated from PDR1(R821H) Δccc1 cells were found to have a higher iron content than vacuoles isolated from vector-transformed Δccc1 cells (Fig. 5 C). This result suggests that the PDR1(R821H) allele leads to increased iron storage. As determined by microarray analysis, the effect of the PDR1(R821H) allele is to increase transcription of at least 20 different genes. To address which of these genes is responsible for the low iron phenotype, we took advantage of the collection of homozygous diploid deletion strains purchased from Research Genetics. This collection consists of 4,600 yeast strains, each of which has a targeted deletion in a specific gene. We transformed PDR1–3 or PDR1(R821H) into strains carrying a single deletion in 15 of the genes that were identified as overexpressed by microarray analysis. The strains that were not tested were not included in the deletion collection. Transformation of either of these PDR1 alleles into wild type diploids (BY4743) reproduced the mutant phenotype of reduced growth on low iron medium and increased cycloheximide resistance (Fig. 6 A). A Δpdr5strain transformed with PDR1(R821H) was cycloheximide-sensitive but still showed decreased growth on low iron medium (Fig. 6 B). This result confirmed previous studies indicating that Pdr5p is responsible for cycloheximide resistance (31Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and showed that Pdr5p is not involved in the low iron phenotype conferred by PDR1(R821H). We found that deletion of any of six of the top 19 genes shown to be up-regulated by microarray analysis resulted in the loss of the low iron growth defect while still retaining cycloheximide resistance. An example of the phenotype of transformed deletions and their phenotypes is given in Fig. 6 C and the names or designations of the relevant genes are listed in TableII. These results suggested that all six genes must be overexpressed for the low iron phenotype, as loss of any of the six was sufficient to complement expression ofPDR1(R821H).Table IIGenes required for low iron sensitivity and copper resistanceGenes required for low iron sensitivityGenes required for copper resistanceYOR1ICT1SNQ 2SNQ2TPO1YLR346CCTP1YCR061WYGR035CYKL071WYMR102CPDR5 Open table in a new tab The observation thatPDR1(R821H) can protect cells from high iron toxicity led us to examine whether this allele provides protection from toxicity of other transition metals. Wild type cells transformed withPDR1(R821H) showed increased resistance to Mn2+and Cu2+ but increased sensitivity to Co2+(Fig. 7 A). The increased resistance to Cu2+ was associated with decreased accumulation of Cu2+ as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 7 B). We did not observe a statistically significant difference in Mn2+ content between vector-transformed and PDR1(R821H)-transformed cells (Fig. 7 C). We took advantage of the homozygous deletion collection to ask whether the same genes that were responsible for iron sensitivity were responsible for copper resistance. As shown in Fig. 8 at least five genes are required to show the copper phenotype. These genes, however, are different from those that lead to the iron sensitivity (Table II). Thus, transition metal response because of PDR1(R821H) is a multigenic trait. Most previously characterized yeast mutants unable to grow in low iron are because of either defects in iron transport or mutations in iron-requiring proteins. Invariably, these mutants are recessive. MS35 is extraordinary in that it is semidominant, has a low iron growth defect, and yet has no defect in the assembly of the iron transport system. Identification of the mutant gene in MS35 revealed that it is a gain of function allele of PDR1, a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in multidrug resistance. The mutated amino acid in PDR1(R821H) is near the mutation in the gain of function PDR1–3 allele, which has a phenylalanine to serine substitution at position 815 (28Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The mechanism of thePDR1(R821H) and PDR1–3 gain of function mutations is unclear, as the altered amino acids lie neither in the inhibitory domain nor in the activation domain of Pdr1p (32Kolaczkowska A. Kolaczkowski M. Delahodde A. Goffeau A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this region, when mutated, could affect binding of the “major inhibitory effector.” We discovered that overexpression of PDR1-regulated genes results in a decrease in cytosolic iron, as shown by reduced growth ofPDR1(R821H) expressing cells in low iron medium and increased survival of PDR1(R821H) transformedΔccc1 cells in high iron medium. Whereas there is a decrease in the activity of the high affinity iron transport system inPDR1(R821H) expressing cells, the decreased low iron growth is not because of a defect in iron transport. This point is suggested by the fact that PDR1(R821H) expressing cells that lack a component of the high affinity iron transport system (Δfet3) are more sensitive to low iron thanΔfet3 cells transformed with a control vector. Whereas we were not able to directly demonstrate increased iron efflux caused byPDR1(R821H), we did find that expression ofPDR1(R821H) led to increased resistance to high iron medium in Δccc1 cells. We observed that, whereas expression ofPDR1(R821H) led to decreased cellular iron when either wild type or Δccc1 cells were grown in low iron medium, there was an increase in cellular iron when the same cells were grown in high iron medium. This observation suggests that there is a difference in the mechanism(s) leading to low iron growth sensitivity and high iron resistance conferred by PDR1(R821H). As high iron conditions down-regulate most of the known iron transporters,PDR1(R821H) is unlikely to affect changes in iron uptake. Rather, we observed that vacuoles fromPDR1(R821H)-transformed cells have higher levels of iron than those from vector-transformed cells. As CCC1 encodes the major, if not the only, vacuolar iron transporter,PDR1(R821H) expression must lead to an increase in vacuolar iron accumulation. These results suggest that PDR1 targets, depending on iron concentration, may affect both iron efflux and sequestration. The hypothesis that both efflux and sequestration occur is strengthened by the identification of the genes that are required to produce the low iron phenotype (see Table II). Some of the known genes encode ABC transporters present on the vacuole (TPO1) or plasma membrane (YOR1 and SNQ2). There is some limited data on the role of multidrug resistance genes in transition metal metabolism. A double deletion of SNQ2 andPDR1 were shown to effect Mn2+ and Ni2+ resistance (33Miyahara K. Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as wild type cells were shown to export Mn2+ at a greater rate thanΔsnq2Δpdr1 cells. It was not clear, however, whether the loss of these genes directly affected Mn2+ efflux or whether this effect was a downstream consequence of the gene deletions. It is known that many transporters that recognize Mn2+ also recognize Fe2+, suggesting that Snq2p could also modulate iron export (7Li L. Chen O.S. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the formal possibility remains that expression of Snq2p somehow modulates plasma membrane permeability rather than mediating active transport of metal ions. Expression of the PDR1(R821H) allele resulted in an increase in transcription of at least 19 different genes. We took advantage of a homozygous deletion collection to determine which of those genes were involved in transition metal metabolism by transforming thePDR1(R821H) allele into strains that have a deletion in a single gene and examining their phenotype on low iron and on cycloheximide containing medium. We observed that deletion of a single gene, PDR5, abrogated cycloheximide resistance but did not eliminate the low iron phenotype. This result confirms previous studies that show that PDR5 is responsible for cycloheximide resistance. In contrast, we discovered that at least six genes were required for the low iron phenotype. That multiple genes are required to fully express a multidrug resistance phenotype is not unprecedented (for review see Ref. 23Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is of interest that whereas both Snq2p and Pdr5p were shown to be required for resistance to Mn2+ and Li+, we observed that deletion of PDR5 did not affect the low iron growth phenotype (33Miyahara K. Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that PDR1(R821H) provided resistance to copper and manganese but rendered cells more sensitive to cobalt. The increased cobalt sensitivity may result from the affect on cytosolic iron on the allele of the PDR1(R821H). A recent study demonstrated that reduced cytosolic iron levels lead to increased cobalt sensitivity, whereas increased cytosolic iron protected against cobalt toxicity (34Stadler J.A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39649-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The finding that expression ofPDR1(R821H) results in low cytosol iron is consistent with the expectation that such cells might be cobalt-sensitive. Expression of PDR1(R821H) also led to increased resistance to copper and manganese. Measurement of cellular copper indicates that resistance is because of lowered cellular levels. Interestingly, the genes required for resistance to copper with one exception (SNQ2) are different from those required for the iron sensitivity. In both cases simultaneous expression of multiple genes are required to develop the phenotype. Our biochemical experiments suggest that copper resistance may be because of metal export. The high level of media copper should result in the down-regulation of copper transporters, suggesting that decreased cellular copper may be because of increased copper efflux. Experiments are currently in progress to determine whether the same genes that are required for copper resistance are also required to rescue Δccc1 cells from high iron."
