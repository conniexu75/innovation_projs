We present evidence that regulation of HIF-1 activity is primarily determined by the stability of the HIF-1α protein. Both HIF-1α and HIF-1β mRNAs were constitutively expressed in HeLa and Hep3B cells with no significant induction by hypoxia. However, the HIF-1α protein was barely detectable in normoxic cells, even when HIF-1α was overexpressed, but was highly induced in hypoxic cells, whereas HIF-1β protein levels remained constant, regardless of pO2. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding as well as the HIF-1α protein were rapidly and drastically decreased in vivo following an abrupt increase to normal oxygen tension. Moreover, short pre-exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide selectively prevented hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding via blocking accumulation of HIF-1α protein, whereas treatment of hypoxic cell extracts with H2O2 had no effect on HIF-1 binding. These observations suggest that an intact redox-dependent signaling pathway is required for destablization of the HIF-1α protein. In hypoxic cell extracts, HIF-1 DNA binding was reversibly abolished by sulfhydryl oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of reduced thioredoxin to cell extracts enhanced HIF-1 DNA binding. Consistent with these results, overexpression of thioredoxin and Ref-1 significantly potentiated hypoxia-induced expression of a reporter construct containing the wild-type HIF-1 binding site. These experiments indicate that activation of HIF-1 involves redox-dependent stabilization of HIF-1α protein.

A large body of research has putatively demonstrated that the Group IIA sPLA2 is involved in diverse pathologic processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, intestinal neoplasia, and epidermal hyperplasia, as well as in cellular signaling by regulating the formation of arachidonate-derived lipid messengers. However, we demonstrate herein the involvement of another sPLA2, i.e. the Group V sPLA2, in arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin production in the mouse macrophage-like cell line P388D1. Abundant message for Group V sPLA2 was detected in both resting and activated cells. In contrast, Group IIA sPLA2 message was undetectable as analyzed by Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, blockage of Group V sPLA2 gene expression by antisense RNA oligonucleotides resulted in inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production as well as reduction of the amount of sPLA2 protein at the cellular surface. Collectively, these results uncover Group V sPLA2 as a novel effector involved in arachidonic acid-mediated signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W1992511009,"We previously identified a protein-serine phosphatase designated PP5, based on the binding of its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (Chinkers, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 11075-11079). We have now identified another protein complex to which PP5 is targeted through its TPR domain. A 90-kDa protein, identified as heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) by immunoblotting, specifically co-immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cell lysates with the FLAG-tagged TPR domain of PP5. hsp90 also co-immunoprecipitated with full-length FLAG-tagged PP5 overexpressed in COS-7 cells and with endogenous PP5 from untransfected COS-7 cells or rat brain. During gel filtration, PP5 and hsp90 comigrated in a high molecular weight complex. Since glucocorticoid receptors (GR) exist as large heterocomplexes containing hsp90 bound to TPR proteins, we hypothesized that PP5 might be associated with these complexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, PP5 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with GR from mouse L cell lysates. To test the functional importance of this TPR-mediated association in living cells, we used a dominant negative PP5 mutant consisting only of its TPR domain. The mutant inhibited GR-mediated transactivation by approximately 70% in transfected CV-1 cells. This is the first evidence that the TPR proteins in steroid receptor heterocomplexes may be required for signaling in vivo. We previously identified a protein-serine phosphatase designated PP5, based on the binding of its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (Chinkers, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 11075-11079). We have now identified another protein complex to which PP5 is targeted through its TPR domain.

This is the first evidence that the TPR proteins in steroid receptor heterocomplexes may be required for signaling in vivo. Steroid receptors acquire the ability to bind hormone only after they are assembled into a heterocomplex containing several other proteins (1Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Based largely on in vitro reconstitution studies, it appears that receptors form hsp90 complexes by an ATP-dependent mechanism that requires hsp70 and proteins designated p60 and p23 (4Dittmar K.D.

Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). When p60 dissociates from its binding site on hsp90, one of the large immunophilins, such as FKBP52 or CyP-40, can bind (6Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B.

Upon binding of hormone, the receptor can dissociate from the complex and bind to DNA (1Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smith D.M. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The hormone-bound receptor can then activate transcription of specific genes, leading to a biological response. Although several of the proteins in steroid receptor heterocomplexes have been shown to be important for receptor assembly in vitro (1Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smith D.M. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A.

In particular, the normal roles of the large immunophilins and of p60, each of which associates with hsp90 through a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (6Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A.

TPR domains consist of a variable number of degenerate tandem 34-amino acid repeats (10Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The original studies describing the TPR motif predicted that each repeat would consist of two amphipathic alpha helices separated by a turn, and that the hydrophobic faces of these helices could interact with each other to mediate protein-protein interactions (11Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TPR domains have been described in proteins having a variety of functions in a variety of subcellular compartments and appear to function as targeting domains, mediating specific protein-protein interactions (reviewed in 10Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). While indirect evidence consistent with the model in which TPR domains interact with each other has been presented (13Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Haucke V. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), more evidence has accumulated implicating TPR domains in binding to non-TPR proteins (10Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Examples include the interactions between the TPR domains of human and yeast peroxisomal import proteins with the type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (15Brocard C. Kragler F. Simon M.M. Schuster T. Hartig A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), between the TPR domain of the Cyc8 corepressor and several associated proteins (17Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and between the TPR domain of the immunophilin FKBP52 and hsp90 (7Radanyi C. Chambraud B. Baulieu E.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11197-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We and others have isolated cDNA clones encoding a protein-serine phosphatase designated PP5 (18Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PP5 is distinctive in that it contains an amino-terminal TPR domain that we originally isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen, based on its ability to bind to the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor (20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since desensitization of the ANP receptor is associated with its dephosphorylation (21Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PP5 may be the enzyme responsible for ANP receptor desensitization. In some cultured cells, PP5 is present at higher concentrations in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (19Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The biological role of PP5 in the nucleus or cytoplasm remains to be elucidated. Since the specificity of protein-serine phosphatases is largely controlled by their subcellular targeting (22Brautigan D.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 197-214PubMed Google Scholar), and since TPR domains may mediate protein targeting (10Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), biological functions of PP5 might be identified by determining to which proteins its TPR domain binds. We report here that the TPR domain of PP5 binds to hsp90 and that this binding mediates an association of PP5 with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) heterocomplexes. We further show that a truncated PP5 containing only the TPR domain acts as a dominant negative mutant, blocking GR signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that steroid receptor-associated TPR proteins are required for hormonally induced transcriptional activation in living cells. COS-7 cells and CV-1 cells were maintained in DME containing 10% fetal bovine serum. L929 mouse fibroblasts (L cells) were grown in monolayer culture in DME containing 10% iron-supplemented calf serum. Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's medium supplemented with lactalbumin hydrolysate, Yeastolate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The 5′ end of rat PP5 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ primer that encoded an EcoRI site, an initiation codon, the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), the first five amino acids of PP5, and a 3′ primer complementary to nucleotides 815-832 of our rat PP5 cDNA clone (20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned and sequenced from its 5′ end to the NheI site at position 392 of the original cDNA, to ensure the absence of mutations. The 5′ end of the FLAG-tagged PP5 was then exchanged, as an XhoI/NheI fragment, with the corresponding 5′ fragment of the original cDNA clone. The resulting construct was cloned into the EcoRI sites of the pCMV6 vector (for expression in mammalian cells) or the pVL1393 vector (for baculovirus construction). During the course of these studies, it became clear that the sequence at the 5′ end of our original rat cDNA clone (20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was derived from a chimeric cDNA, and that the sequence published by Becker et al. (18Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponded to the authentic 5′-coding sequences of PP5 (23Xu X. Lagercrantz J. Zickert P. Bajalica-Lagercrantz S. Zetterberg A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our original cDNA clone encoded the sequence QGY immediately after the initiation codon, whereas the correct sequence is AEGERTECAEPPRDEPP. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to correct the amino-terminal coding sequence of the FLAG-tagged PP5. The oligonucleotide 5′-AAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCCGAAGGCGAACGTACTGAATGTGCTGAACCTCCTCGAGACGAACCTCCTGCCGAAGGCACTCTGAAGC-3′ was used to change the amino-terminal sequence of the FLAG-tagged construct from MDYKDDDDKQGYAEGTLK, to MDYKDDDDKAEGERTECAEPPRDEPPAEGTLK (underlined residues constitute the FLAG epitope). Sequencing was performed to confirm the mutagenesis and the absence of unwanted mutations. This corrected construct, pCMV6-FLAG-PP5, was then used for the mammalian cell expression studies described below. The FLAG-tagged PP5 construct in Bluescript SK(+) (with the corrected amino terminus) was truncated at a unique HindIII site to remove sequences encoding the carboxyl portion of PP5. Blunt-ending with Klenow fragment and insertion of a linker encoding an NheI site and a stop codon resulted in a cDNA encoding the FLAG-tagged TPR domain of PP5, terminating at Leu181. Few non-TPR residues were present in the FLAG-TPR construct; the TPR domain begins at Ala28 and ends at Leu165 (using the numbering of residues described in Becker et al. (18Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The cDNA fragment encoding the FLAG-tagged TPR domain was excised as an EcoRI/SalI fragment and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pCMV6 vector (24Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for mammalian cell expression. A baculovirus for expression of FLAG-tagged PP5 was prepared by homologous recombination of pVL1393-FLAG-PP5 with BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) as described previously (25Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Plaque-purified second passage virus stocks were used for infections. A 100-ml suspension culture of Sf9 cells was infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing FLAG-tagged PP5 at a multiplicity of infection of 3, then incubated for 3 days at 27°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and sonicated in 5 ml of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column at 4°C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Proteins were fractionated by elution with a 20-ml gradient of 50-500 mM NaCl in 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Peak fractions containing FLAG-tagged PP5, as determined by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (25Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), were pooled and further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The fractions were incubated batchwise with 1 ml of M2-agarose beads (IBI) for 1 h at 4°C, then transferred to a column and washed three times with 5 ml of Hepes-buffered saline containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Epitope-tagged PP5 was then eluted by five repeated applications of 1 ml of Hepes-buffered saline, 1 mM dithiothreitol containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) for 15 min each. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the M2 antibody, and peak fractions were pooled. The FLAG peptide was then removed by ultrafiltration. Approximately 200 μg of purified protein were typically recovered from a 100-ml culture. After collection of preimmune serum, female New Zealand White rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 25-50 μg of purified FLAG-tagged PP5. The antigen was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant for the initial injection and with Freund's incomplete adjuvant for two booster injections given at 30-day intervals. Blood was collected and serum prepared 10 days postinjection. COS-7 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg of pCMV6-FLAG-PP5, pCMV6-FLAG-TPR, or pCMV6 vector for control plates, using a DEAE-dextran procedure (26Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells in 6-cm plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of pSVL-GR (27Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), 2 μg of the reporter plasmid PRE-PBL7 (28Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), 0.5 μg of pRSV-luciferase (29de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar) (to normalize for transfection efficiency), and 5 μg of plasmid containing indicated amounts of pCMV6-FLAG-TPR (with the remainder of the 5 μg made up of control pCMV6 vector), using a calcium phosphate procedure (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). The GR and CAT reporter plasmids were obtained from Dr. Stoney Simons (NIH). One day after transfection, CV-1 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 26 h in fresh growth medium, in the absence or presence of 100 nM dexamethasone. COS-7 cells were incubated for 16 h in medium consisting of 9 parts methionine and cysteine-free DME and 1 part growth medium, containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, DuPont NEN). Cells were then placed on ice, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium molybdate, 10 mM MgCl2 (buffer A). Cells were then scraped into buffer A containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and lysed by passage 30 times through a 25-gauge needle. The lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 18,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant from this centrifugation was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. After samples were normalized for total radioactivity, the clarified lysates were precleared by incubating for 1.5 h at 4°C with 20 μl of goat anti-mouse-IgG beads (Sigma, for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody M2 (IBI) directed against the FLAG epitope) or protein A-agarose beads (Pierce, for immunoprecipitations using anti-PP5 serum). After removing the beads by centrifugation, the precleared extracts were incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C with either 20 μl of goat anti-mouse beads to which 2.25 μg of M2 had been preadsorbed, or 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads to which the IgG from 5 μl of preimmune or anti-PP5 serum had been preadsorbed. Beads were then washed five times with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium molybdate, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and immune complexes were released by heating in SDS sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as indicated in the figure legends, followed by fluorography using sodium salicylate (31Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Molecular weight markers were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue or (for immunoblots) by using Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.). Anti-PP5 immunoprecipitates were prepared from unlabeled COS-7 cells using the methods described above, normalizing for protein before performing immunoprecipitations, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE using Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) as standards. For analyzing the association of hsp90 with PP5 in rat brain, half of a rat brain was homogenized in 6 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 20 mM benzamidine, using three 15-s bursts with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant from that centrifugation was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Equal aliquots of the precleared supernatant were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune or anti-PP5 serum as described above, except using 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads and 10 μl of serum. Following SDS-PAGE of the washed immune complexes and blotting to nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotting to detect hsp90 was performed as described previously (25Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal antibody AC-16 (Sigma H1775) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescent detection. For immunoprecipitation of glucocorticoid receptors from L cells, cells were harvested by scraping into Earle's balanced salt solution followed by a wash in the same buffer and centrifugation at 500 × g. The washed cells were suspended in 1.5 volumes of 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium molybdate, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization. Homogenates were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant fluid was used for immunoprecipitation. The BuGR2 monoclonal antibody against glucocorticoid receptors (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or nonimmune mouse IgG was prebound to protein A-Sepharose pellets by incubating 40 μl of a 20% slurry of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C with 150 μl of TEG buffer (10 mM TES, 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6), and 6 μg of antibody, followed by centrifugation and washing with TEG. Glucocorticoid receptors were immunoadsorbed from 400 μl aliquots of L cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4°C with 8 μl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with BuGR2 or nonimmune IgG followed by three washes with 1 ml of TEGM buffer (TEG plus 20 mM sodium molybdate). Immune complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with 1 μg/ml BuGR2 antibody for the glucocorticoid receptor, 1 μg/ml of the monoclonal antibody AC88 for hsp90 (StressGen), or 1000-fold dilutions of anti-PP5 serum (above), an antiserum to the C-terminal peptide of CyP-40 (Affinity Bioreagents), or an antiserum designated UPJ56 raised against FKBP52 (32Ruff V.A. Yem A.W. Munns P.L. Adams L.D. Reardon I.M. Deibel Jr., M.R. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21285-21288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Karen Leach (The Upjohn Co.). For immunoadsorption of hsp90 from L cell cytosol (see Fig. 4B), cytosol was diluted 10-fold with 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100-μl aliquots were immunoadsorbed to 10-μl pellets of Actigel-ALD precomplexed with either nonimmune IgM or with 3G3 anti-hsp90 monoclonal IgM (Affinity Bioreagents). Immune pellets were washed three times in 1 ml of TEGM buffer, and both immune pellets and the immunoadsorbed cytosols were assayed by Western blotting for hsp90 and PP5. A rat brain cytosolic extract was freshly prepared essentially as described above, but in a reduced volume of a different buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl), and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. 200 μl of the filtered extract, containing approximately 5.6 mg of protein, were then loaded onto a 25-ml Superose 6 column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was previously calibrated with the following standards, using the same buffer: thyroglobulin (669,000), ferritin (440,000), catalase (232,000), ovalbumin (43,000). Samples were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. 40 μl of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 8.5% gels, followed by immunoblotting and detection with anti-PP5 (1:4000) or with monoclonal antibody AC-16 against hsp90 (1:1000), as described above. Tranfected CV-1 cells, incubated in the absence or presence of dexamethasone as described above, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 4°C for 3 min at 7,500 × g. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and lysed by three cycles of freezing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and thawing in a 37°C water bath. After clarifying the lysate by centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min at 18,500 × g, 85 μl of the supernatant were saved and diluted for luciferase (29de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar) and CAT (33Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) assays. To inactivate endogenous acetylating enzymes, cell extracts were heated at 65°C for 15 min before performing CAT assays. To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, CAT activity was normalized to luciferase activity. Luciferase and CAT activity were linear with respect to time and protein concentration. Background CAT activity from cells incubated in the absence of dexamethasone was subtracted from total activity in dexamethasone-stimulated cells to determine dexamethasone-induced activity. We have shown an interaction between the TPR domain of PP5 and the protein kinase-like domain of the ANP receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system (20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify additional proteins interacting with the TPR domain of PP5, we overexpressed the FLAG-tagged TPR domain of PP5 in COS-7 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. A prominent 90-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged TPR domain of PP5 from [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2), using a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope. The 90-kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated in stainable amounts (not shown), indicating that it was a major cellular protein that interacted efficiently with the TPR domain. The monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope did not immunoprecipitate the 90-kDa protein in the absence of the FLAG-tagged TPR domain (Fig. 1A, lane 1), indicating that its immunoprecipitation was due to its association with the TPR domain of PP5. The TPR domain of PP5 is most closely related to TPR domains found in several large immunophilins known to associate with hsp90 (20Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These immunophilins have been shown to interact with hsp90 through their TPR domains (6Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Radanyi C. Chambraud B. Baulieu E.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2961-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and on the fact that hsp90 is an abundant protein, we hypothesized that the 90-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitating with the TPR domain of PP5 might be hsp90. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to hsp90 confirmed this hypothesis. hsp90 was co-immunoprecipitated with the TPR domain of PP5 from lysates of unlabeled COS-7 cells overexpressing this domain, but not from lysates of control cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Under the same conditions, hsp90 also associated with full-length PP5 (Fig. 1). FLAG-tagged PP5, overexpressed in COS-7 cells, was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope, either from [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 1A) or unlabeled cells (Fig. 1B). As for the isolated TPR domain, a prominent 90-kDa protein that reacts with a monoclonal antibody to hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged full-length PP5 (Fig. 1, lanes 3). Thus, the association of the TPR domain of PP5 with hsp90 is not an artifact of removing the phosphatase domain. We next tested whether this association was merely an artifact of overexpressing PP5, or whether endogenous PP5 associated with hsp90. This required production of an antiserum to PP5. Recombinant rat PP5, tagged at its amino terminus with the FLAG epitope, was expressed in the baculovirus system. The protein was purified to homogeneity by MonoQ chromatography followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on a matrix containing a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope. The purified protein (Fig. 2) was used to immunize rabbits, resulting in specific, high titer anti-PP5 sera. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to test whether endogenous PP5 associated with hsp90 in untransfected COS-7 cells or in rat brain (Fig. 3). We found that hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PP5 from extracts of COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B) or rat brain (Fig. 3B). Neither PP5 nor hsp90 was immunoprecipitated by preimmune serum (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, endogenous PP5 forms a complex with hsp90 in both cultured cells and in a normal tissue.Fig. 3hsp90 co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous PP5 from COS-7 cells or rat brain. A, lysates from COS-7 cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine were immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (PI) or anti-PP5 serum (I). Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. B, immunoprecipitates prepared in the same manner from extracts of unlabeled COS-7 cells or rat brain were analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to hsp90.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used another method, gel filtration chromatography, to confirm the association between PP5 and hsp90. Rat brain extracts were fractionated on a Superose 6 column calibrated with various molecular weight markers, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antisera to PP5 or to hsp90 (Fig. 4A). While purified PP5 runs as a monomer (data not shown), much of the PP5 present in brain extracts comigrates with hsp90 in a peak of approximately 600 kDa. While most hsp90 migrated in a high molecular weight complex, free hsp90 was also seen in one of three experiments (data not shown). This result was consistent with the association between PP5 and hsp90 demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and suggested that both molecules were present in a large complex. In the experiment of Fig. 4B, hsp90 was immunoadsorbed from mouse L cell cytosol with a monoclonal IgM antibody, and the immune pellets were rapidly washed and assayed for hsp90 and PP5 by immunoblotting. Immunoadsorption of essentially all of the hsp90 from cytosol (compare lane 2 with lane 1) resulted in co-immunoadsorption of nearly all of the PP5. This suggests that nearly all of the PP5 is in high molecular weight form because of its association with hsp90. Since steroid receptors exist as large heterocomplexes containing hsp90 bound to TPR proteins (1Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smith D.M. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PP5 might be associated with these receptor complexes. Several different proteins, including hsp90 and the TPR-containing immunophilins FKBP52 and CyP-40, have been shown to be components of steroid receptor heterocomplexes (1Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smith D.M. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We tested whether PP5 was associated with GR heterocomplexes in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 5). Low salt extracts from L cells, prepared in the presence of sodium molybdate to stabilize receptor complexes (34Pratt W.B. Gehring U. Toft D.O. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-Inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhäuser/Springer, Heidelberg1996: 79-95Crossref Google Scholar), were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody to GR (lane 3) or a nonimmune control antibody (lane 2), followed by immunoblotting. Blots were probed with antibodies specific for the receptor itself, hsp90, PP5, FKBP52, or CyP-40. For comparison, an aliquot of the cytosol before immunoprecipitation was also subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 5, lane 1). As shown previously, hsp90, FKBP52, and CyP-40 co-immunoprecipitated with GR. In addition, PP5 was a prominent component of the receptor complexes. The above experiments demonstrated an association between PP5 and GR heterocomplexes, but did not address the possible function of this association. In order to test the functional importance of PP5 in GR heterocomplexes, we used a deletion mutant of PP5 containing the TPR domain, but lacking the phosphatase catalytic domain. The expressed TPR domain of PP5 should act as a dominant negative mutant by displacing endogenous PP5 from hsp90 in GR heterocomplexes. The TPR domain of PP5 was co-expressed with GR and a CAT reporter gene in CV-1 cells. We then examined the ability of dexamethasone to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene in the absence and presence of the PP5 mutant. As shown in Fig. 6, the TPR domain of PP5 inhibited transactivation in a concentration-dependent manner, with dexamethasone-induced transcription inhibited by approximately 70% at the highest concentration of the TPR plasmid tested. Similar results were obtained in six separate experiments. This result strongly suggests a functional role for PP5 or other TPR proteins in GR signaling. At this time, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effect on transactivation is due to displacement of other TPR proteins, in addition to PP5, from GR heterocomplexes. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a functional role of TPR domains per se in GR signaling in vivo. TPR domains are emerging as important mediators of protein-protein interactions and subcellular targeting (10Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We show here that the recently identified protein-serine phosphatase, PP5, is able to bind to hsp90 through its TPR domain and thereby associate with GR heterocomplexes. Steroid receptor heterocomplexes, in addition to a single steroid receptor and a dimer of hsp90, were previously known to contain proteins that bind via TPR domains to hsp90, as well as additional accessory proteins. Immature receptor heterocomplexes contain the TPR protein p60, the mammalian homologue of the yeast TPR protein STI1, while mature complexes contain the TPR proteins FKBP51, FKBP52, or CyP-40, and an acidic protein designated p23 (5Smith D.M. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The fact that PP5 associates with progesterone receptor heterocomplexes in co-immunoprecipitation experiments 2M.-S. Chen and M. Chinkers, unpublished data. suggests that the association of PP5 with steroid receptors may be a general phenomenon. hsp90 has been shown to be required for steroid receptor signaling in vivo (3Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), but the experiment presented here in Fig. 6 represents the first evidence that any of the TPR proteins that bind to hsp90 are required for signaling. The ability of the expressed TPR domain of PP5 to act as a dominant negative mutant, strongly inhibiting GR-mediated transcriptional activation, suggests a role for PP5 in GR signaling in vivo. PP5 could play a role by regulating the phosphorylation state of GR or of associated phosphoproteins. The mechanisms by which phosphorylation regulates steroid receptor activity and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling remain incompletely understood (35Orti E. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 105-128PubMed Google Scholar). While regulation of the phosphorylation state of steroid receptors or associated proteins by PP5 may be an important factor in controlling the activity of these receptors, further studies will be required to test whether this is the case. At least some of the TPR proteins appear to compete for binding to the same site on hsp90 (6Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Ratajczak T. Carrello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2961-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the TPR domain of PP5 inhibits signaling in vivo by displacing one or more of these other proteins rather than by displacing endogenous PP5 alone. In summary, we have shown that PP5, a recently discovered protein-serine phosphatase, forms a complex with hsp90 via a TPR domain. This complex is in turn associated with GR heterocomplexes. The observation that the TPR domain of PP5 acts as a dominant negative mutant to block GR signaling strongly suggests a role in vivo for PP5, or perhaps more generally for the TPR-containing proteins that bind to the same site in hsp90 complexes. This is the first direct evidence that these steroid receptor-associated TPR proteins are important for signaling. We thank Elizabeth M. Wilson for technical assistance, and June Shiigi and Heidi Davisson for preparing illustrations."

Molecular cloning of the PACAP receptor revealed the existence of five splice variant receptor forms differing in the third intracellular loop region, with four variants activating both adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositide phospholipase C and one variant activating only adenylyl cyclase (Spengler, D., Waeber, C., Pantaloni, C., Holsboer, F., Bockaert, J., Seeburg, P. H., and Journot, L. (1993) Nature365, 170-175). Here, we report cloning of a novel PACAP receptor variant, designated PACAPR TM4 (transmembrane domain IV), that differs from the previously cloned short form of the PACAP receptor (PACAPR) primarily by discrete sequences located in transmembrane domains II and IV. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and primer extension analyses demonstrated tissue-specific differential expression of mRNAs encoding PACAPR TM4 and splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor. PACAPR TM4 and PACAPR possess identical intracellular domains, implicated as primary determinants of G protein recognition by rhodopsin-like receptors. However, unlike the PACAPR, PACAPR TM4 does not activate either adenylyl cyclase or phosphoinositide phospholipase C in response to PACAP in either transient or stable expression systems. However, PACAP stimulates increases in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing PACAPR TM4 by activating L-type Ca2+ channels, a response not elicited by stimulation with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The signaling phenotype of PACAPR TM4 is characteristic of the PACAP receptor involved in regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β islets, a tissue expressing transcripts for PACAPR TM4 but not for PACAPR or its longer splice variant forms. These findings are consistent with a role of PACAPR TM4 in the physiological control of insulin release by PACAP in β-islet cells. The finding that PACAPR TM4 has a unique signaling phenotype, although it possesses intracellular domains identical to those of the PACAPR, suggests that receptor-G protein recognition by rhodopsin-like receptors can be determined by sequences other than those located in intracellular receptor domains.

Structural studies revealed the peptide to be a C-terminal amidated 38-amino acid peptide (PACAP-38), and subsequent studies resulted in identification of the other molecular form of PACAP (PACAP-27) that lacks the last 11 amino acids of the longer form (2Miyata A.

These two bioactive forms of PACAP are derived from a single gene and are formed by proteolytic processing of the encoded PACAP precursor protein (3Arimura A. Regul.

PACAP exhibits high sequence homology to VIP, indicating that it is a member of the VIP/secretin/glucagon/growth hormone-releasing factor family of neuropeptides.

The short splice variant form of the receptor was designated PACAPR with the longer splice variant forms designated as hip, hop, or hip-hop isoforms of the PACAPR. Four of these splice variants exhibited the multifunctional signaling characteristic of PACAP receptors found in various cells (23Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis of the PACAPR shows that it is a member of the new family of G protein-coupled receptors first identified by cloning of secretin, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone receptors and which now includes receptors for VIP, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide, and growth hormone-releasing factor (9Ishihara T.

The PACAPR is expressed in the central nervous system, pituitary, adrenal medulla, and testicular germ cells (10Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), while the VIPR is predominant in the lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (9Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Recently, a third PACAPR subtype was cloned, designated PACAPR-3, which has a tissue distribution distinct from that of the PACAPR and VIPR (32Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Mizuno N. Fujii Y. Gonoi T. Miyazaki J-I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This new subtype binds PACAP and VIP with equal affinity, like the VIPR, and activates both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. PACAPR-3 is expressed in lung, brain, stomach, colon, and pancreatic β-islet cells. Yada et al. (33Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that PACAP is a physiologically occurring neuropeptide in the pancreas and that PACAP is by far the most potent insulin secretagogue known. Expression of PACAPR-3 in β-islet cells implicated it in the insulin secretagogue actions of PACAP. However, PACAP stimulates insulin release in β-islet cells by interacting with PACAP receptors exhibiting the pharmacological selectivity of Type I PACAPRs and by a mechanism involving increases in [Ca2+]i mediated exclusively by activation of L-type calcium channels (33Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the cloned PACAP receptors exhibit the signaling specificity characteristics of the receptor present in pancreatic β-islet cells. Here, we report isolation of a novel PACAPR variant that differs from the cloned PACAPR primarily in predicted transmembrane domain IV (TM4) and, hence, is designated PACAPR TM4. PACAPR TM4 exhibits unique signaling properties, although it has intracellular domains identical to those of the PACAPR. Unlike all previously cloned PACAP receptors, PACAPR TM4 does not stimulate adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C. Instead, it stimulates Ca2+ influx through an L-type Ca2+ channel with the pharmacological selectivity of the Type I PACAPR, a signaling phenotype characteristic of the PACAP receptor expressed in β-islet cells. The mRNA encoding PACAPR TM4 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern unique from that of splice variant forms of the PACAPR, and β-islet cells express transcripts for PACAPR TM4 but not for PACAPR or its longer splice variant forms. These results suggest that PACAPR TM4 represents the receptor mediating the insulin-releasing actions of PACAP in β-islets. The present results suggest further that discrete sequences within transmembrane domains of a rhodopsin-like receptor can determine the specificity of receptor signaling. PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and VIP were purchased from Bachem. Fura-2 AM was obtained from Molecular Probes, and nifedipine and lanthanum were from Sigma. myo-[2-3H]Inositol (16.5 Ci/mmol) and adenosine 5′-[γ32P]triphosphate (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham. LipofectAMINE, OptiMEM, and inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. AmpliTaq was from Perkin Elmer, and pcDNAI vector was from Invitrogen. Cell culture medium and serum were provided by the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (the University of Iowa). Oligonucleotide primers and other molecular biological reagents were obtained from the University of Iowa DNA Core. BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (the University of Iowa). A novel PACAPR variant was amplified from oligo(dT)-primed rat cerebellum cDNA using a PCR-based strategy we described previously (34Chatterjee T.K. Sarkar G. Bolander M.E. Fisher R.A. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 26: 29-44Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The PCR strategy used would amplify any variants of the PACAPR sharing homology to the PACAPR at regions complementary to the primers used in PCR. Briefly, a 776-bp 5′-cDNA fragment (nucleotides (−)9-767) and a 713-bp 3′-cDNA fragment (nucleotides 710-1423) of the PACAPR cDNA were amplified by PCR using 5′-single-stranded ligation of cDNA end and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end methods, respectively. Recombinant PCR, i.e. using the overlapping cDNA fragments as template with forward and reverse primers corresponding to nucleotides (−5)-22 and 1375-1406 of the PACAPR, respectively, resulted in amplification of the expected full-length 1.4-kilobase cDNA product. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNAI, and sequence analysis of selected clones revealed the presence of a unique clone, differing from the PACAPR cDNA that we isolated using this approach (34Chatterjee T.K. Sarkar G. Bolander M.E. Fisher R.A. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 26: 29-44Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Double-stranded sequencing of the cloned PACAPR variant was performed by automated fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. We designated this new clone as PACAPR TM4 due to its divergence in sequence from the PACAPR primarily in transmembrane domain IV. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs were synthesized from total or poly(A)+ RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) or Superscript H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting cDNAs were used in PCR with forward and reverse primers corresponding to amino acids 23-29 (DCIFKKE) and 383-388 (FELGLG) of the PACAPR (Fig. 1) for 30 cycles (94°C/1 min + 50°C/2 min + 72°C/3 min). The resulting products were diluted 1/100 and subjected to nested PCR using a forward primer corresponding to (a) amino acids 275-280 (TPTVCV) of the PACAPR or (b) amino acids 275-281 (TPTVSAW) of PACAPR TM4, with a reverse primer corresponding to amino acids 374-380 (NVSKRER) of the PACAPR (Fig. 1) for 30 cycles (94°C/1 min + 60°C/1 min + 72°C/2 min). The primer pairs used in the second round of PCR span the predicted third intracellular loop of the PACAP receptor where splicing leads to generation of short (PACAPR) and long (PACAPR-hop, PACAPR-hip, PACAPR-hip-hop) forms of the receptor as shown by Spengler et al. (10Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The primer pairs used would yield a 317-bp PCR fragment of the PACAPR, a 401-bp fragment of the PACAPR-hip or PACAPR-hop, and a 485-bp product of the PACAPR-hip-hop. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs were synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) of rat cerebellum, lung, and pancreatic β-islet cells. One-tenth of the cDNA synthesis mixtures were PCR amplified using forward and reverse primers corresponding to amino acids 154-163 (ALYTVGYSTS) and 307-317 (VIKGPVVGSIM) of the PACAPR (Fig. 1), respectively. These primers are complementary to sequences conserved between the PACAPR and PACAPR TM4 cDNAs and span a region that encompasses the divergent sequences encoding the transmembrane IV region of these two receptor forms. The resulting PCR products were purified (Wizard PCR Preps, Promega), and approximately 50 ng of the DNAs were used as templates for extension of an end-labeled 23-nucleotide primer (0.3 pmol) using Klenow large fragment DNA polymerase I in the presence of 1 mM dideoxy-CTP and 0.1 mM each of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP. Authentic cloned PACAPR and PACAPR TM4 cDNAs were used as positive controls. The extension reaction was performed at 37°C for 10 min, and extension products were separated on a DNA sequencing gel. Extension products were visualized by autoradiography. BHK cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with PACAPR or PACAPR TM4 plasmid DNA (0.5 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE (5 μl/μg DNA) for 16 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments were performed 48 h following termination of transfection. For measurement of inositol phosphates (IPs), cells were labeled overnight with myo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma) 30 h following transfection. Incubations with vehicle or agonists were performed for 20 min at 37°C in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10 mM LiCl for measurements of IPs and for 5 min (also 1 min for experiments shown in Fig. 5C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine for measurements of cAMP. Total IPs were extracted with choloroform:methanol:water (1:1:0.5) and then separated on Dowex AG1-X8 columns as described by Brown et al. (35Brown E. Kendall D.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Total IPs were eluted with 1 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid. IP accumulation is expressed as dpm of IPs/105 dpm in the lipid fraction. Cyclic AMP was measured with a commercially available kit (Diagnostic Products). CHO cells were transfected with PACAPR TM4 plasmid DNA by lipofection as described above. Clonal cell lines expressing PACAPR TM4 were isolated by selection in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by replating selected cells at a low density in this selection medium and isolation of colonies using cloning cylinders. Four colonies were expanded and used for measurements of PACAP-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i. All four cell lines responded to PACAP with similar increases in [Ca2+]i. We selected one of these cell lines to characterize the functional activity of PACAPR TM4. These stable PACAPR TM4 transfectants, designated CHO TM4, expressed 19,200 ± 1,600 125I-labeled PACAP-27 binding sites/cell with a KD of 18 ± 3.1 nM. The level of expression of PACAPR TM4 in CHO TM4 cells (33 fmol/106 cells) is nearly identical to that found in a gonadotrope cell line (35 fmol/106 cells) where PACAP stimulates adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC and increases in [Ca2+]i (25Schomerus E. Poch A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, this physiologically relevant receptor level is equivalent to levels of receptors exhibiting dual signaling in the group III family of G protein-coupled receptors (32Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Mizuno N. Fujii Y. Gonoi T. Miyazaki J-I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Bringhurst F.R. Juppner H. Guo J.

Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of PACAP on IPs and cAMP in control CHO cells and CHO TM4 were performed essentially as described above for transient transfectants. [Ca2+]i was measured in individual cells using fluorescent and digital image analysis of Fura-2-loaded cells as described previously (38Sharma R.V. Bhalla R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C71-C79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of cDNAs encoding the PACAPR, PACAPR TM4, and VIPR (i.e. the “Type II PACAP receptor”). PACAPR TM4 differs primarily from the PACAPR in predicted transmembrane domain IV where there is a substitution and deletion of two amino acids each leading to a CVTV to SAXX conversion, resulting from replacement of the sequence GTGTAACAGTG (nucleotides 836-846) of the PACAPR with CAGCA in the PACAPR TM4 cDNA. PACAPR TM4 differs from PACAPR by two other substitutions; a D136N substitution (resulting from replacement of GAT withAAT, nucleotides 406-408 of the PACAPR cDNA) in the amino-terminal region, which is conserved in the VIPR, and a N190D substitution (resulting from replacement ofAAC with GAC, nucleotides 568-570 of the PACAPR cDNA) in transmembrane domain II. Interestingly, each of these amino acid sequence differences between PACAPR TM4 and PACAPR occur at sites where there is a similar divergence in the VIPR. These sites of divergence are contiguous with sequences conserved between all three receptors. PACAPR TM4 does not differ from the PACAPR in any intracellular regions including intracellular domains 2 and 3 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, regions identified as primary determinants of receptor-G protein recognition in G protein-coupled receptors (16Strader C.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The divergence in sequence of the cDNA encoding PACAPR TM4 enabled us to design primers to examine expression of its mRNA in tissues by RT-PCR. Alternative splicing of the PACAP receptor primary transcript has been shown to produce short and long forms of the PACAP receptor that differ in their predicted third intracellular loop (10Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Therefore, RT-PCR was used to compare expression of mRNA encoding PACAPR TM4 with that of short and long splice forms of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 2, PCR amplification using primers specific for the splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor (lanes a) produced two major bands corresponding to the size expected for the short form (PACAPR) and hip- or hop-cassette forms of the PACAPR. Amplification using primers specific for PACAPR TM4 (lanes b) produced a single band corresponding to the size expected for this variant. Control experiments using no template DNA or using authentic cloned PACAPR or PACAPR TM4 cDNAs as templates demonstrated the specificity of the primer pairs used in this RT-PCR (see Fig. 2 legend). Tissue-specific differential expression of mRNAs encoding splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor and PACAPR TM4 was observed. The ratio of amplified products corresponding to the short and hip- or hop-cassette forms of the PACAP receptor varied in different tissues, as reported by Spengler et al. (10Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In addition, exclusive amplification of the short and of the hip- or hop-cassette forms of the receptor occurred in vascular smooth muscle and liver, respectively, providing clear evidence of tissue-specific processing of splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that transcripts encoding PACAPR TM4 also are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and with unique patterns of expression relative to that of mRNAs encoding splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor. Coexpression of mRNAs for PACAPR TM4 and splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor was observed in cerebellum, cerebral cortex, brainstem, vas deferens, and lung. In contrast, transcripts encoding PACAPR TM4 were not detected in spinal cord, heart, liver, kidney, and vascular smooth muscle where transcripts encoding splice variant forms of the PACAP receptor were clearly expressed. The transcript encoding PACAPR TM4 was the only PACAP receptor mRNA detected in β-islet cells. A primer extension assay was developed to assess relative proportions of mRNAs encoding PACAPR and PACAPR TM4 in selected tissues. Rat cerebellum, lung, and pancreatic β-islet cell cDNAs were subjected to PCR with primers common to both PACAPR and PACAPR TM4 to amplify DNA segments encompassing the divergent regions existing between these forms of the receptor. The relative contribution of these forms of the PACAPR in the amplified product is expected to be proportional to their respective mRNA levels in these tissues. The amplified products were subjected to primer extension according to the scheme shown in Fig. 3, which will distinguish transcripts encoding PACAPR (the hip, hop, and hip-hop forms of the PACAPR share the targeted sequence of the PACAPR and, therefore, would not be detected individually in this assay) and PACAPR TM4. Fig. 3 shows that this assay reliably detected the expected extension products from each of the authentic receptor cDNAs and that the major extension product present in cerebellum and lung is the size expected for the PACAPR cDNA, while the major product in β-islets corresponds to that of the PACAPR TM4 cDNA. Although RT-PCR analysis demonstrated amplification of the transcript encoding PACAPR TM4 in cerebellum and lung (Fig. 2), these primer extension results suggest they represent minor transcripts relative to that of mRNA encoding PACAPR in these tissues. The opposite appears to be true in β-islet cells, in agreement with the exclusive amplification of mRNA encoding PACAPR TM4 by RT-PCR in these cells. Like other members of the group III family of G protein-coupled receptors, PACAP receptors exhibit multifunctional signaling activity stimulating both adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. Spengler et al. (10Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) reported minor differences in signaling by splice variants of the PACAP receptor that differ in their predicted third intracellular loop region. All splice variants stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to PACAP-27 or PACAP-38, although the hip and hip-hop isoforms exhibited 6-17-fold higher EC50 values for this effect, and all variants except the PACAPR-hip isoform also stimulated PI-PLC. Therefore, we examined effects of PACAP on cAMP and inositol phosphate production in BHK cells transiently expressing PACAPR and PACAPR TM4. Control experiments summarized in Fig. 4A demonstrated that PACAP-27 stimulated increases in cAMP and inositol phosphate accumulation in PACAPR transfectants with EC50 values of approximately 1 and 5 nM, respectively, while VIP was at least 100-fold less potent. In contrast, 100 nM PACAP-27 had no significant effects on cAMP or inositol phosphate accumulation in PACAPR TM4 transfectants, although it stimulated 20-40-fold increases in these second messengers in PACAPR transfectants in parallel incubations (Fig. 4B). PACAP-38 was also inactive in stimulating increases in either cAMP or inositol phosphate accumulation in PACAPR TM4 transfectants, although it was equipotent to PACAP-27 in producing these responses in PACAPR transfectants (not shown). The absence of effects of PACAP on adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC in PACAPR TM4 transfectants suggested that this receptor is incapable of activating these signaling pathways and raised the intriguing possibility that it has different signal-transducing capabilities. Because PACAPR TM4 is the primary, if not exclusive, Type I PACAP receptor expressed in β-islet cells (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), we investigated whether this variant possesses the unique signaling activity of the PACAP receptor in β-islets. In these cells, PACAP stimulates increases in [Ca2+]i, and hence insulin secretion, by a mechanism involving influx of Ca2+ through dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels rather than by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores through activation of PI-PLC (33Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular structure of this unique PACAP receptor is unknown. Because PACAP has no effects on PI-PLC in BHK cells transiently transfected with PACAPR TM4 (Fig. 4B), any effects of PACAP on elevation of [Ca2+]i in these cells would not result from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Therefore, we determined whether PACAP had effects on [Ca2+]i in cells transiently expressing PACAPR TM4. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that PACAP-27 (1 μM) produced a rapid (within 10 s) increase (2-4-fold) in [Ca2+]i in 20-50% of Fura-2-loaded BHK cells transiently expressing PACAPR TM4. To study this response in a homogeneous population of cells, we developed clonal CHO cell lines expressing PACAPR TM4 (CHO TM4 cells). Fig. 5A illustrates the effects of PACAP-27 (1 μM) on [Ca2+]i in individual CHO TM4 cells. As shown, PACAP-27 produced a robust (up to 5-fold) increase in essentially every cell. This effect was mediated by PACAPR TM4 because additional studies demonstrated that untransfected CHO cells did not respond to PACAP with significant increases in [Ca2+]i (i.e. see Fig. 6A). Although our studies in BHK cells transiently transfected with PACAPR TM4 demonstrated the inability of the receptor to mediate activation of PI-PLC, it seemed essential to investigate whether the observed Ca2+ response in CHO TM4 cells was similarly dissociated from PACAPR TM4-mediated PI-PLC activation. Therefore, we examined effects of PACAP on PI-PLC in CHO TM4 and CHO cells by measurements of inositol phosphate accumulation. As shown in Fig. 5B, PACAP-27 (1 μM) had no effects on inositol phosphate accumulation in untransfected CHO cells or CHO TM4 cells, whereas stimulation of endogenous purinergic receptors with ATP (10 μM) produced expected increases in inositol phosphates in each cell line. These findings demonstrate that PACAPR TM4 mediates increases in [Ca2+]i by a mechanism independent of phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids. In contrast, PACAP stimulates increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO cells stably expressing the PACAPR by inositol trisphosphate-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization (39Delporte C. Poloczek P. de Neef P. Vertongen P. Ciccarelli E. Svoboda M. Herchuelz A. Winand J. Robberecht P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional differences between PACAPR and PACAPR TM4 appear to reflect intrinsic differences in their abilities to recognize G proteins that activate distinct signaling systems. Fig. 5C shows that CHO TM4 cells also did not respond to PACAP-27 (100 nM) with increases in intracellular cAMP. These results confirm our findings in BHK cell transfectants and demonstrate that PACAPR TM4 has a signaling phenotype unique from other cloned PACAP receptors. Additional experiments were performed to determine how PACAP increases [Ca2+]i in CHO TM4 cells. Fig. 6A illustrates the time course of effects of PACAP in CHO cells and CHO TM4 cells. As shown, 5 nM PACAP-27 produced a rapid, transient monophasic increase in [Ca2+]i in CHO TM4 cells but had no significant effects in CHO cells at a 200-fold higher concentration. Fig. 6B shows that VIP did not elicit increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO TM4 cells, indicating that PACAPR TM4 displays the pharmacological selectivity of the Type I PACAP receptor in mediating this response. In contrast to results obtained in Ca2+-containing medium, PACAP did not stimulate increases in [Ca2+]i when CHO TM4 cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium or in Ca2+-containing medium supplemented with the Ca2+ channel blocker lanthanum (20 μM) or the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine (1 μM) (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that PACAPR TM4 stimulates increases in [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx via a dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel. Thus, PACAPR TM4 displays the signaling phenotype of the PACAP receptor in β-islet cells (33Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a tissue expressing mRNA encoding PACAPR TM4 but not for splice variant forms of the PACAPR (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Of considerable interest is the mechanism by which PACAPR TM4 stimulates L-type Ca2+ channels. These channels are known to be activated by the stimulatory G protein Gs and via phosphorylation by protein kinase A (40Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that PACAPR TM4 does not stimulate adenylyl cyclase in either transient or stable expression systems, indicating that the receptor does not couple to Gs. Moreover, the absence of increases in cAMP in cells expressing PACAPR TM4 was not a result of influx of Ca2+ because cells expressing this receptor did not increase cAMP in response to PACAP in incubation medium containing 1 μM nifedipine (not shown). Therefore, the stimulation of the L type-Ca2+ channel by PACAPR TM4 appears to occur by a mechanism that does not involve coupling to Gs and subsequent increases in cAMP. These results show that PACAPR TM4 has unique signal transduction properties compared with those of PACAPR. This finding was unexpected because both receptors possess identical intracellular domains, implicated as primary determinants of coupling of rhodopsin-like receptors to G proteins and, hence, of receptor signaling specificity. The involvement of intracellular domains of rhodopsin-like receptors in signaling specificity can be rationalized on a conceptual basis because G proteins are intracellularly located, and, therefore, receptors that regulate them presumably do so via their intracellular sequences. This has been borne out by a variety of studies using various approaches to study the role of these intracellular domains in signaling that have ascribed the specificity of G protein coupling to sequences within the third intracellular loop but also to sequences in the second intracellular loop and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (16Strader C.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present results suggest that regions other than these domains are responsible for determining the specificity of receptor-G protein coupling of PACAPR TM4, which differs from PACAPR only by discrete sequences located in transmembrane domains II and IV and the extracellular domain of the receptor. It is unclear from the present studies whether these sequence differences produce differences in receptor signaling as a result of indirect conformational changes in G protein-coupling domains of the receptor or by direct physical interactions of membrane-spanning domains of the receptor with G proteins, known to be associated closely with the plasma membrane (41Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 42Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In summary, the present study documents the existence of a novel PACAP receptor variant that has a signaling phenotype distinct from that of all previously cloned PACAP receptors. This receptor, designated PACAPR TM4, does not mediate activation of adenylyl cyclase or PI-PLC but stimulates increases in [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx via a dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel. Our results provide evidence that mRNA encoding PACAPR TM4 is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion unique from that of the splice variant forms of the PACAPR. The primary, or exclusive, expression of transcripts encoding PACAPR TM4 in β-islet cells, along with the fact that this receptor has a signaling phenotype like that of the PACAP receptor in β-islet cells mediating insulin secretion, suggests that PACAPR TM4 represents the receptor involved in physiological control of insulin release in β-islet cells by PACAP.

S., Carson, J. H., and Pfister, K. K. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19358-19366). Peptide sequence data (16/16 residues correct) implicate the Mr = 14,000 polypeptide as Tctex-1, a protein encoded within the mouse t-complex. Tctex-1 cosediments with microtubules and is eluted with ATP or salt but not with GTP as expected for a dynein subunit. The ATP-eluted protein precisely cosediments with known cytoplasmic dynein proteins in sucrose density gradients. Tctex-1 also is immunoprecipitated from brain and other tissue homogenates by a monoclonal antibody raised against the 74-kDa cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain. Quantitative densitometry indicates that Tctex-1 is a stoichiometric component of the dynein complex. As Tctex-1 is a candidate for involvement in the transmission ratio distortion (meiotic drive) of mouse t-haplotypes, these results suggest that cytoplasmic dynein dysfunction may play an important role in non-mendelian chromosome segregation."

A low basal level of B2 receptor phosphorylation was found in the absence of a ligand.

The B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 and the B1 receptor agonist des-Arg9-bradykinin failed to induce significant phosphorylation of the B2 receptor. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the B2 receptor is phosphorylated on serine and threonine, but not on tyrosine residues. The ligand-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was concentration-dependent, with an apparent EC50 of 33 nM, and peaked at 1 min after challenge. The kinin-stimulated phosphorylation of the B2 receptor was rapid and transient and paralleled the kinetics of desensitization/resensitization of the receptor as followed by [Ca2+]i release and radioligand binding assay, respectively. The ligand-induced phosphorylation of the B2 receptor was independent of the protein kinase C pathway. In vitro experiments suggest βARK1 (β-adrenergicreceptorkinase) as a candidate kinase that could mediate the homologous B2 receptor phosphorylation.

Using transgenically derived insulinoma cells (βTC3-neo) and β-cells purified from rodent pancreatic islets of Langerhans, we studied the expression and role of delayed rectifiers in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods to amplify all known candidate delayed rectifier transcripts, the expression of the K+ channel gene Kv2.1 in βTC3-neo insulinoma cells and purified rodent pancreatic β-cells was detected and confirmed by immunoblotting in the insulinoma cells. βTC3-neo cells were also found to express a related K+ channel, Kv3.2. Whole-cell patch clamp demonstrated the presence of delayed rectifier K+ currents inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine, with similar Kd values to that of Kv2.1, correlating delayed rectifier gene expression with the K+ currents. The effect of these blockers on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied with fura-2 microspectrofluorimetry and imaging techniques. In the absence of glucose, exposure to TEA (1-20 mM) had minimal effects on βTC3-neo or rodent islet [Ca2+]i, but in the presence of glucose, TEA activated large amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations. In the insulinoma cells the TEA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were driven by synchronous oscillations in membrane potential, resulting in a 4-fold potentiation of insulin secretion. Activation of specific delayed rectifier K+ channels can therefore suppress stimulus-secretion coupling by damping oscillations in membrane potential and [Ca2+]i and thereby regulate secretion.

Despite their importance in the regulation of β-cell signal transduction, detailed knowledge of K+ channel isoform expression in β-cells is incomplete. Of the 25 K+ channel-related families that have been reported, only a subset encode membrane proteins that produce voltage-sensitive delayed rectifier outward K+ currents similar to those found in β-cells (18Dukes I.D.

The recovered single cell pellet was resuspended in EH containing 1 mM EGTA and introduced into the sample stream of a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACStarPlus) equipped with an argon ion laser in the primary light path (90 mW at 488 nm, Ion Laser Technology, Salt Lake City, UT). Events were analyzed and collected on a forward scatter trigger. Signals and side scatter were displayed and collected via a 530/30 nm band-pass filter following transit through a 560 nm short-pass dichroic filter. The integrity of the cell preparation was checked by propidium iodide exclusion. The propidium iodide fluorescence signal was collected by transit of a 660/20 nm band-pass filter receiving signal from a 610 nm shortpass dichroic filter. Rectangular sort regions were defined by producing Cartesian plots displaying forward light scatter versus autofluorescence to delineate the β-cell population. The processing of the fluorescence signals in the linear mode aided in the resolution of two major cell populations; β-cells could be distinguished as a set of cells with elevated green fluorescence, elevated forward and side scatter relative to other cells in the preparation. The β-cell populations were sorted in two-drop packets into sterile glass collection tubes containing 2 ml of fetal bovine serum. All cell events with values outside of the sort region were diverted to a separate collection tube. The cytometer target fluorescence values were standardized using glutaraldehyde-fixed chicken red blood cells immediately before and after islet cell sample batches were run. In addition, the sorting efficiency of the instrument was evaluated using a mixture of labeled microspheres in the performance of a “test sort.” βTC3-neo and mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using an oligo-dT binding method (Quickprep micro mRNA kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and first strand was cDNA reverse-transcribed using random primers (Superscript Plus Transcriptase, Life Technologies, Inc.).

In some experiments (Table II), dual wavelength digitized video fluorescent microscopy with fura-2 in single βTC3-neo cells was performed using an intensified charge-coupled device (Hammatsu C2400) and Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging).Table II.Effect of TEA concentration on glucose-dependent [Ca2+]i alterationsTEAnIncrease in [Ca2+]iaPercentage of cells that display an increase in [Ca2+]i with TEA.[Ca2+]i oscillationsbPercentage of cells that demonstrate an oscillatory pattern of increased [Ca2+]i.mM15555115116644110868572203210088a Percentage of cells that display an increase in [Ca2+]i with TEA.b Percentage of cells that demonstrate an oscillatory pattern of increased [Ca2+]i.

Insulin secretion measurements were made in the presence of 0 or 1 mM glucose and increasing concentrations of TEA or 4-AP for 1 h. Insulin concentration was determined by SPA assay kit (Amersham Corp.) and calibrated using rat insulin as standard. While delayed rectifier K+ channels are known to regulate the membrane potential of electrically excitable cells (26Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar), detailed knowledge of K+ channel isoform expression and function in insulin-secreting β-cells is incomplete. A previous study, performed prior to the identification of multiple families of voltage-activated K+ channel genes, found transcripts encoding Shaker (Kv1.X)-related K+ channels in RIN and HIT insulinoma cells and whole islets isolated from leptin-resistant hyperglycemic ob/ob mice (20Betsholtz C. Baumann A. Kenna S. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Berggren P.-O. Grupe A. Pongs O. Rorsman P. Sandblom J. Welsh M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this investigation we used clonal insulinoma cells (βTC3-neo, derived from transgenic animals expressing the SV-40 T-antigen driven by the insulin promoter) and purified rodent β-cells to analyze the expression of delayed rectifier family genes with RT-PCR. Kv1 family expression was sought in βTC3-neo cells utilizing oligonucleotide primers (see Table I) designed to amplify the highly conserved pore region (pair B) or the highly conserved domain upstream from the first membrane spanning domain (pair A) followed by individual primer pairs for each member of the Kv1.1-Kv1.7 family. Identification of other families of delayed rectifier K+ channel genes in βTC3-neo cells relied on the use of isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers to amplify either the pore region or a section of the 3′ end of the coding region. DNA amplification experiments were performed using two positive controls, rodent brain cDNA with channel primers and insulinoma cell cDNA with proinsulin primers. We were unable to find evidence of expression of any of the seven Kv1 isoforms in βTC3 or βTC3-neo cells despite multiple attempts with degenerate and specific primers. Specific amplicons were, however, obtained with primers for Kv2.1 and Kv3.2 (Fig. 1A). DNA sequencing confirmed the closest matches of the amplified sequences were to Kv2.1 and Kv3.2, respectively (Fig. 2), although the sequence of the mouse isoform of Kv3.2 has not yet been published. An antibody specifically recognizing Kv2.1 was employed to show that a membrane preparation from βTC3-neo cells contained an immunoreactive band of 108 kDa as reported previously for Kv2.1 (Fig. 1B) (25Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10764-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Alignments of K+ channel sequences amplified from βTC3 cells.

The only delayed rectifier cDNA that could be reproducibly amplified from purified rat and mouse β-cells was Kv2.1. In some experiments DNA bands indicating Kv1.6, Kv1.2, and Kv3.2 expression were also faintly detected, but these could not be subcloned and confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). While a previous study reported expression of Kv1.X genes in ob/ob islets, the contribution of RNA from the non-β-cells present in whole islets, as well as from contaminating pancreatic acinar cells, makes it difficult to interpret in terms of specific expression in β-cells (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Studied by whole-cell patch clamp techniques, βTC3-neo cells have similar delayed rectifier K+ currents to normal rodent or human β-cells (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 22Philipson L.H. Rosenberg M.P. Kuznetsov A. Lancaster M.E. Worley III, J.F. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol.

Exposure of βTC3-neo cells to 10 mM TEA caused inhibition (>90%) of the outward currents (Fig. 4). TEA blocks a variety of K+ channel types over distinct concentration ranges. Most sensitive to TEA are calcium-activated K+ channels (Kd, 0.14 mM), followed by delayed rectifier K+ channels (Kd, 1.4 mM) and K-ATP (Kd, 22 mM) (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 14Kelly R.P. Sutton R. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 443: 175-192Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 311-325Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Kd for block was estimated to be 0.8 mM, approximating the reported Kd for block by TEA of the mouse β-cell delayed rectifier K+ current (15Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 327-342Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Exposure to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), another blocker of delayed rectifier K+ channels, also produced a dose-dependent suppression of the outward K+ currents with 80% block at 10 mM and an estimated Kd of 2 mM (Fig. 4). The Kd for block by TEA of Kv3.2 is under 1 mM and that for Kv2.1 is 5.6 mM (28McCormack T. Vega-Saenez de Miera E.C. Rudy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5227-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Hartmann H.A. Taglialatela M. deBiasi M. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The TEA sensitivity of 0.8 mM observed experimentally in the βTC3-neo and rodent β-cells could thus be achieved by co-expression of Kv3.2 and 2.1 channels. Similarly, the reported Kd values for 4-AP block of Kv2.1 and Kv3.2 in the low millimolar range (30Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Taglialatela M. Joho R. Brown B.

Veh R. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2473-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) are consistent with our experimental observations. By contrast, most Kv1 channels of the type encoding β-cell-like delayed rectifier K+ currents (Kv1.1-3. 1.5-7) are not sensitive to low millimolar concentrations of TEA (with the exception of Kv1.1 and 1.6) (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar, 32Kalman K. Tseng-Crenk J. Dukes I.D. Chandy G. Lancaster M.E. Spencer R.H. Ayair J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A268Google Scholar). Furthermore, Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 are blocked by low concentrations of dendrotoxin (10-20 nM) (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar), an agent that was without effect on βTC3 or rodent β-cells at 100 nM (data not shown). Also, others have shown that charybdotoxin, a potent blocker of Kv1.3, also has no significant effect on rodent β-cell delayed rectifier currents (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In summary, the combination of molecular biological and pharmacological evidence argues against the significant expression of Kv1 family channels in rodent β-cells. In order to study the physiological role of delayed rectifier K+ channels in stimulus-secretion coupling, we examined the effect of a range of TEA and 4-AP concentrations on [Ca2+]i oscillations in populations of βTC3-neo cells in the presence of glucose. Unlike normal mouse islets and β-cells, βTC3 cells do not respond to a step increase in glucose with periodic oscillatory increases in [Ca2+]i; instead, a slow rise in [Ca2+]i occurs with occasional intermittent spikes (Fig. 5A) (22Philipson L.H. Rosenberg M.P. Kuznetsov A. Lancaster M.E. Worley III, J.F. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27787-27790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gromada J. Dissing S. Bokvist K. Renstrom E. Frokjaer-Jensen J. Wulff B.S. Rorsman P. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, exposure of βTC3-neo cells to 20 mM TEA in the continued presence of 1 mM glucose stimulated large amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations of the type seen in normal β-cells exposed to glucose as the sole stimulating agent (Fig. 5A) (22Philipson L.H. Rosenberg M.P. Kuznetsov A. Lancaster M.E. Worley III, J.F. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27787-27790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While 1 mM TEA produced an elevation in [Ca2+]i and intermittent oscillations in only 10% of cells, increasing the TEA concentration to 5, 10, and 20 mM caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells responding to TEA as well as in the amplitude of the oscillatory [Ca2+]i response (Table II). The concentration range over which TEA exerted its effects suggested an important role for delayed rectifier K+ channels in regulating [Ca2+]i oscillations. Since 1 mM TEA exerted only a minor effect on [Ca2+]i in βTC3-neo cells, this ruled out a significant role for calcium-activated K+ channels which should be completely blocked under these conditions (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Based on the Kd estimates for the effect of TEA on K+ channels in primary β-cells, 1 and 5 mM TEA should block delayed rectifier K+ channels but have little effect on K-ATP (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The TEA-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations were suppressed in the absence of glucose, further supporting the idea that TEA was not exerting its effects via blocking K-ATP and alterations in the glucose concentration between 0.01 and 1 mM caused graded increases in the frequency of the TEA-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 5B). A similar effect of 4-AP inducing [Ca2+]i oscillations in βTC3 cells was also observed (data not shown). Similar [Ca2+]i responses to TEA were observed in rodent islets. As with βTC3-neo cells, in rat islets a step increase in glucose concentration induced a tonic rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6A). The addition of 20 mM TEA induced a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, followed by rapid oscillations, again similar to the responses seen with βTC3-neo cells (cf. Fig. 5A). Likewise, in mouse islets TEA augmented the [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by glucose, in agreement with previous results on the potentiating effects of TEA on mouse islet electrical activity (Fig. 6B) (17Henquin J.C. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by K+ channel block were immediately abolished by exposure to 500 nM nitrendipine, indicating their dependence on Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels (34Roe M.W. Mittal A.A. Kuznetsov A. Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 207AGoogle Scholar). To confirm that the induction by TEA of glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations was in fact due to facilitating depolarization-dependent increases in Ca2+ influx, we carried out simultaneous measurements of membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in single βTC3-neo cells. Application of 1 mM glucose caused a 20-mV depolarization and low amplitude spike activity (Fig. 7). Addition of 20 mM TEA caused a further abrupt depolarization followed by sinusoidal oscillations of membrane potential that were perfectly synchronized with the oscillations in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7). The oscillations, although small in magnitude, were centered around 0 mV, the peak membrane potential for Ca2+ permeation through L-type Ca2+ channels (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the oscillations in [Ca2+]i induced by TEA stem from augmentation of membrane potential oscillations as a result of TEA-induced modulation of a K+ channel conductance. Finally, the effects of delayed rectifier K+ current block on stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion were examined. In mouse islets, 20 mM TEA augments glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, with a threshold of about 2 mM (17Henquin J.C. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the βTC3-neo cells, TEA produced a dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion with a threshold of about 1 mM, and 20 mM TEA induced a 4-fold increase in insulin release compared with glucose alone (Fig. 4). TEA in the absence of glucose had no effect on insulin secretion, in agreement with its secretagogue effects depending on block of delayed rectifier K+ channels alone (34Roe M.W. Mittal A.A. Kuznetsov A. Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 207AGoogle Scholar). Insulin secretion was also stimulated by 4-AP in the presence of glucose over the same concentration range (3-10 mM) where suppression of delayed rectifier K+ currents occurred in βTC3-neo cells (Fig. 4). It is important to consider possible interactions of TEA with other membrane proteins. Although TEA can block K-ATP, the concentrations required for complete block are much higher than used here, and K-ATP is already substantially blocked in extracellular solutions with elevated glucose concentrations (data not shown). TEA has also been reported to block Cl− channels (35Sanchez D.Y. Blatz A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the higher concentrations required (Kd 11.8 mM, with a maximum block of only about 60% at 60 mM (35Sanchez D.Y. Blatz A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) cannot account for the dramatic stimulation of signal transduction shown (Figs. 5, 6, 7). Furthermore, 4-AP, which produced effects similar to TEA on insulin secretion, has no effect on Cl− channels (35Sanchez D.Y. Blatz A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In fact, several studies have shown that Cl− channel blockers actually inhibit, rather than stimulate, insulin secretion (36Kinard T.A. Satin L.S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Sandstrom P.-E. Sehlin J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 144: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our results confirm and extend previous observations on the importance of delayed rectifier K+ channels in repolarization of the β-cell plasma membrane and implicate specific delayed rectifier genes in this process. We report for the first time the expression in rat and mouse β-cells of Kv2.1 and in βTC3-neo insulinoma cells of Kv2.1 (Shab)- and Kv3.2 (Shaw)-related transcripts. The characteristics of the β-cell delayed rectifiers are in fact most consistent with those of Kv2.1 currents, as opposed to other known delayed rectifier genes. These findings extend the distribution of the Kv2.1 channel to hormone-secreting cells, in addition to striated muscle and neurons (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). The dose-response relationships for TEA- and 4-AP-stimulated insulin secretion correlate directly with the block of Kv2.1-like voltage-dependent outward K+ currents, as do the effects of TEA on glucose-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations. It is likely, therefore, that the observed oscillations in membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in βTC3 cells induced by TEA and 4-AP stem directly from block of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Furthermore, our observations in rodent islets where similar induction of [Ca2+]i oscillations was observed point to the importance of delayed rectifier K+ channels in normal β-cells as well. Taken together these studies have also revealed an important insight into the underlying mechanism regulating β-cell oscillations: essentially all of the outward K+ currents have to be suppressed in order to unmask the endogenous β-cell oscillator, indicating that the changes in conductance(s) underlying this mechanism could be very small.

We have shown previously that the GTP-binding protein, Gh, is a TGase II that mediates intracellular signaling by the α1B-adrenergic receptor (AR) (Nakaoka, H., Perez, D. M., Baek, K. J., Das, T., Husain, A., Mison, K., Im, M.-J., and Graham, R. M. (1994) Science 264, 1593-1596). Here, we evaluated the ability of Gh as compared with Gq to mediate receptor-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover by the three α1-subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D). In addition, we questioned if the transglutaminase function of Gh is involved in its receptor signaling activity. A mutant form of a human TGase II cDNA in which the codon for the active site cysteine (Cys277) was replaced by serine was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pMT2′. Compared with wild-type TGase II, no transglutaminase activity was observed with transient transfection of this Cys→Ser mutant in COS-1 cells. However, like wild-type TGase, the Cys→Ser mutant mediated receptor-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover when cotransfected with an α1B-AR cDNA. Gαq supported α1-AR-mediated inositol phosphate turnover by all three receptor subtypes. By contrast, although both the wild-type and Cys→Ser construct mediated receptor signaling by the α1B AR and α1D AR, the α1A-AR was unable to interact with Gh. However, a Gh-dependent signaling phenotype could be rescued by a chimeric α1A construct in which the third intracellular loop of the α1A-AR was replaced by that of the α1B-AR.

They are organized around a transmembrane cadherin, which binds a set of cytoplasmic proteins required for adhesion and to link the complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Three components of Drosophila adherens junctions, analogous to those in vertebrates, have been identified: Armadillo (homolog of β-catenin), Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin), and α-catenin. We carried out the first analysis of the interactions between these proteins using in vitro binding assays, the yeast two-hybrid system, and in vivo assays. We identified a 76-amino acid region of Armadillo that is necessary and sufficient for binding α-catenin and found that the N-terminal 258 amino acids of α-catenin interact with Armadillo.

In addition, many signaling molecules are localized to adherens junctions, suggesting a role in the transmission of intercellular signals (reviewed in 2Kirkpatrick C. Peifer M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions consist of transmembrane cadherins and a set of cytoplasmic proteins associated with cadherin cytoplasmic domains (reviewed in 1Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar and 3Peifer M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of cadherins interact homotypically with cadherins of neighboring cells. The cytoplasmic proteins α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin (or γ-catenin) are required for cadherin adhesive function and anchor the actin cytoskeleton. The Src tyrosine kinase substrate p120cas is also present in adherens junctions (4Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) correlate with transformation and associated changes in cell adhesion. To understand the cell biological function of adherens junctions, we must determine how interactions among different adherens junction proteins mediate assembly. β-Catenin and plakoglobin bind directly to the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in a mutually exclusive fashion (7Hinck L.

The core cadherin-catenin complex forms higher order assemblies such as the zonula adherens. Both E- and N-cadherins dimerize (19Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grübel G.

Armadillo Drosophila E-cadherin glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction radioimmune precipitation assay polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis concanavalin A adenomatous polyposis coli. Adherens junctions were first described in vertebrates, but precisely analogous structures exist in Drosophila. The Drosophila homolog of β-catenin is Armadillo, first discovered because of its role in transducing the Wingless cell-cell signal (reviewed in 3Peifer M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Arm is structurally similar to β-catenin and plakoglobin (it is 73% identical to β-catenin), with 13 Arm repeats (9Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) flanked by N- and C-terminal regions. Drosophila homologs of E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) and α-catenin have been identified (21Oda H. Uemura T. Shiomi K. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J.

Both Arm and DE-cadherin are required for proper cell-cell adhesion in vivo (23Peifer M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cox R.T. Kirkpatrick C. Peifer M. J.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 672-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We undertook a systematic study of the interactions between Drosophila Arm and its adherens junction partners, DE-cadherin and α-catenin. We localized binding sites for each of these proteins on Arm using in vitro binding assays, the yeast two-hybrid system, and in vivo binding assays. We also identified regions of α-catenin and DE-cadherin required for Arm binding. These experiments complement and extend analysis of the vertebrate homologs of Arm. Our parallel in vivo studies confirm the importance of these interactions for adherens junction function (27Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Further details are available upon request. Arm fragments were PCR-amplified from E9 cDNA (28Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) with Vent DNA polymerase in 10 cycles. 5′-Primers contain a BamHI site and a methionine codon; 3′-primers contain EcoRI and BamHI sites and a stop codon (Table I, Table II show end points of the constructs). PCR products were subcloned into both pBluescript KS+ and pLM1; pLM1 was generated by inserting oligomers creating BglII and EcoRI sites in the appropriate reading frame of pGEX2T128/129 (gift of Dr. M. Blanar (29Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar)). The vector/insert junctions were sequenced; many inserts were entirely sequenced. pLM1-N1 and pLM1-N5 were generated by cloning BamHI/partial BclI digestion products of the arm E9 cDNA into the BglII site of pLM1.Table IDiagram of portions of Arm tested for association with α-catenin either as GST-Arm fusion proteins or in the two-hybrid system.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) using pBS-N2 as a template. The fragments from the second PCR were digested with BamHI and subcloned into the pLM1 BglII site. Mutants were screened for fusion protein expression and confirmed by sequencing. The C-terminal two-thirds of α-catenin was subcloned from pBS-α-catenin (21Oda H. Uemura T. Shiomi K. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as a BglII/XbaI fragment, which was ligated with BglII/EcoRI-digested pLM1, followed by filling with Klenow fragment and a second ligation, creating pLM1-αC. The N-terminal end of α-catenin was made by PCR with Vent polymerase in 10 cycles. The 5′-primer contains BglII, EcoRI, and EcoRV sites, while the 3′-primer is just 3′ to a BglII site in α-catenin. The PCR product was cut with BglII and cloned into pLM1-αC, creating pLM1-α-catenin. pLM1-α-catRI was generated by eliminating the C-terminal half of α-catenin by EcoRI digestion. pCK2 and pCK4 were generated from pBTM116 (gift of P. Bartel and S. Fields) and pACT2 (gift of S. Elledge), respectively, by inserting oligomers creating BamHI and EcoRI sites in the desired reading frame. Arm fragments generated by PCR as described above were cloned into pCK2 and pCK4 as BamHI/EcoRI or BamHI fragments. Mutant Arm fragments were generated by PCR with full-length Arm mutant constructs (27Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) as templates. The α-catenin N terminus was isolated from pLM1-α-catenin by BglII digestion and cloned into the BamHI site of pCK2 and pCK4. The cytoplasmic domain of DE-cadherin and fragments thereof were amplified by PCR (with primers containing BamHI and EcoRI sites), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pCK4 (see Fig. 11A). Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10, grown for 1 h, and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. After 2 h of further growth, cells were lysed in MTPBS (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, and 4 mM NaH2PO4) by sonication (20% output) twice for 30 s. 1% Tween 20 and 1% Triton X-100 were added to lysates, and cell debris was pelleted at 6000 rpm for 10 min. Glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were added, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then washed with MTPBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% Tween 20. Wild-type Drosophila extracts were made from 0-20-h-old embryos. Embryos were rinsed with 0.1% Triton X-100, dechorionated in 50% bleach for 4 min, rinsed again, and then ground in RIPA buffer (23Peifer M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar) or NET (400 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40), both with 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM NaVO3. For bead binding assays, fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose was mixed with wild-type embryo extract in RIPA buffer or NET at room temperature on a nutator for 2 h, and beads were washed with excess buffer four times for a total of 20 min. Samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For blot binding assays, fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were stained with Ponceau S to detect total protein and incubated with wild-type embryo extract in RIPA buffer at room temperature for 2 h, followed by washing with excess RIPA buffer five times for a total of 1 h. Blots were immunoblotted with anti-α-catenin antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Wild-type flies were Canton S; armH8.6, armXM19, armXP33, and arm#2 are described in 31Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar. armΔN was generated as a germ line transformant by injection into y w flies. To create pUAST-3armRC, a fragment of Arm containing the repeats and the C terminus (amino acids 128-843) was excised from pLM1-RC with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pUAST-3 (a modified version of pUAST (32Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the EcoRI and BamHI sites inverted in the polylinker). ConA-Sepharose fractionation was done as described (23Peifer M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar), but using NET instead of RIPA buffer. We used a version (33Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) of the yeast two-hybrid system (34Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) in which one protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain of E. coli LexA and its putative partner is fused to the transcriptional activation domain of yeast Gal4p. Interaction of the partners activates two reporter genes, lacZ, whose product can be quantitated, and HIS3. The yeast strain L40 (MAT a his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (33Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was used for all experiments. The strain was transformed (35Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 329-346Google Scholar) simultaneously with two plasmids encoding different fusion proteins (in pCK2 and pCK4); transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. HIS3 activation was assayed by spotting dilutions of saturated liquid cultures onto synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 25 mM 3-aminotriazole; growth was compared with that of colonies on medium lacking only tryptophan and leucine. In all cases, HIS3 activation paralleled lacZ activation (data not shown). Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (36Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Cells from 3 ml of late log phase culture were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 40 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). 200-μl aliquots of this suspension were mixed with 600 μl of Z buffer, 20 μl of 0.1% SDS, and 3 drops of chloroform. Samples were vortexed for 15 s and incubated at 28°C for 10-15 min. Reactions were initiated by adding 160 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (in Z buffer) and stopped when the solution reached an appropriate yellow color (A420∼ 0.4-0.7) by adding 400 μl of 1 M Na2CO3. β-Galactosidase activity (in Miller units) was calculated as follows: A420× 1000 divided by (the A600 of the initial cell suspension × the volume of suspension used (0.2 ml) × the time in minutes of color development). All values shown are averages from assays in duplicate or triplicate on cultures of at least six independent transformants. Protein extracts for immunoblotting were made from samples of cultures grown for β-galactosidase assays. Cells from 1.5 ml of culture were resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer, frozen at −70°C, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-LexA antibody (a gift of Dr. E. Golemis) at 1:5000. To decipher the biochemical roles of Arm in adherens junctions, we set out to characterize the regions of Arm to which its adherens junction partners, α-catenin and DE-cadherin, bind. We simultaneously took three approaches: in vivo in Drosophila embryos (27Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar; see data below), in vitro binding assays, and the yeast two-hybrid system. These approaches were chosen to complement one another, minimizing problems caused by the limitations of each assay. Arm protein can be divided into three regions (Fig. 1). The central two-thirds of Arm is composed of 13 copies of an imperfect ∼42-amino acid repeat, the Arm repeat, with non-repeat amino acids between Arm repeats 10 and 11 (9Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 28Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). There are also regions N- and C-terminal to the repeats. For in vitro binding experiments, different parts of Arm were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. Many fusion proteins were generated and tested for their ability to bind α-catenin in two different assays. These assays localized the α-catenin-binding site to the junction of the N terminus and the Arm repeats (Table I). The first assay used to detect interaction was a bead binding assay, in which purified GST-Arm fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads (37Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) were used to recover interacting proteins from wild-type embryo extract. α-Catenin binding was assayed by immunoblotting with anti-α-catenin antibody (21Oda H. Uemura T. Shiomi K. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Neither the Arm repeats nor the C terminus contains strong α-catenin-binding sites (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The smallest region retaining full binding activity is a 76-amino acid region (fusion protein N4, amino acids 90-165) extending from the N-terminal region into Arm repeat 1. The second assay used was a blot binding (far-Western) assay, in which GST-Arm fusion proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose were incubated with wild-type embryo extract (Fig. 3). This assay confirmed that the 76-amino acid region is sufficient for binding and also implied that much of the sequence is necessary; removal of the C-terminal 17 amino acids of this minimal fragment (GST-Arm fusion protein N5) or removal of 23 amino acids from its N terminus (fusion protein N6) eliminates α-catenin binding in this assay (Fig. 3). These results are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3A 76-amino acid region of Arm is responsible for association with α-catenin. Fusion proteins (diagramed in Table I) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, which was stained with Ponceau S to detect the total protein present (right panel), and then incubated with wild-type embryo extract. The blot was then immunoblotted with anti-α-catenin antibody (left panel). Full-length fusion proteins are indicated with arrowheads. Note that only full-length N-terminal fusion proteins bind to α-catenin; C-terminally truncated proteins (generated during purification or in bacteria) fail to bind.

Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 34Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We generated constructs with boundaries identical to those used in the in vitro assays. As in those assays, a 76-amino acid fragment at the junction of the N terminus and the Arm repeats of Arm (amino acids 90-165) interacts with α-catenin (Fig. 4, A and B). In this assay, the C-terminal 17 amino acids of this region are not essential for α-catenin interaction (fusion protein N5). We also detected a very weak α-catenin interaction when 23 amino acids were removed from the N terminus of this region (fusion protein N6). Other fragments of Arm, such as the entire repeat region, do not interact with α-catenin (Fig. 4C). We also mapped the in vivo α-catenin-binding site. We generated a mutant, armS14, with a 39-amino acid deletion in the N terminus (removing amino acids 101-139); these amino acids are within the 76-amino acid region required for α-catenin binding in vitro. This mutation was reintroduced into flies and abolishes the ability of Arm to bind to α-catenin in vivo (27Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, the most N-terminal portion of Arm is not required for α-catenin binding in vivo. We generated and reintroduced in vivo a second mutant, armS10, with a 54-amino acid deletion in the N terminus (removing amino acids 34-87); this deletion falls outside the region defined as essential for binding in vitro. This mutant protein was tagged with a c-Myc epitope to distinguish it from wild-type endogenous Armadillo. Mutant protein can be specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc antibody; α-catenin co-immunoprecipitates with this mutant protein (Fig. 5A). The 76-amino acid region sufficient for binding α-catenin in vitro is highly conserved between Arm and its vertebrate relatives β-catenin (39McCrea P. Turck C. Gumbiner B. Science. 1991; 254: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and plakoglobin (40Cowin P. Kapprell H.P. Franke W.W. Tamkun J. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1986; 46: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar); β-catenin and Arm are 79% identical in this region, while Arm and plakoglobin are 51% identical. To determine whether the entire region or only a subset was required for binding, we generated point mutations using PCR mutagenesis, based on the hypothesis that clustered charged residues would probably be on the surface of the protein. We made seven different mutants with clustered point mutations within fusion protein N2, which has α-catenin binding activity. In the first set of mutants, two to four positively charged amino acids that are conserved among Arm, β-catenin, and plakoglobin were changed to alanines (Fig. 6A). α-Catenin binding activity is abolished in each mutant (Fig. 6B). We also made point mutations in nonconserved residues, replacing Arm residues either with corresponding β-catenin residues or with alanines (Fig. 6A). Both alanine substitution mutants greatly reduced α-catenin binding activity. Putting β-catenin residues at the center of the 76-amino acid region reduced binding, while β-catenin residue substitutions at the N-terminal end of the binding region did not alter binding (Fig. 6B). We generated a full-length GST-α-catenin fusion protein and used it in both bead and blot binding assays. Full-length α-catenin bound Arm in a blot binding assay (Fig. 7 and data not shown), as did proteolytic breakdown products with molecular masses of >25 kDa (data not shown). A smaller GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal half of α-catenin (amino acids 1-526) binds to Arm as well as full-length α-catenin (Fig. 7). We extended these data using the two-hybrid system; in this assay, the N-terminal 258 amino acids of α-catenin bind Arm (100-fold better than the vector control) (Fig. 4). Most of the original in vivo arm mutations truncate the coding sequence, yielding a series of C-terminally truncated mutant proteins (31Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of some of these mutant Arm proteins to associate with DE-cadherin in vivo. We also assayed a protein lacking the entire N terminus. We used binding to ConA-Sepharose to measure association with DE-cadherin. Cadherins are glycoproteins that are recognized by this lectin (41McCrea P.D. Gumbiner B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); since wild-type Arm associates with DE-cadherin, a fraction of Arm binds to ConA (23Peifer M. J.

In contrast, mutant protein that cannot form a complex will be exclusively in the unbound fraction. ArmΔN, which lacks the entire N-terminal domain, binds DE-cadherin in vivo (Fig. 5B). armH8.6 mutant protein, lacking virtually the entire C-terminal domain, also binds DE-cadherin (Fig. 5, C and D). Proteins encoded by armXM19, armXP33, and arm#2, with truncations in repeats 13, 10, and 9, respectively, also retain some binding activity (Fig. 5, C and D). Hence, the in vivo DE-cadherin-binding site on Arm lies at least in part between Arm repeats 1-9. To further narrow down the region of Arm interacting with DE-cadherin in vitro, we used GST-Arm fusion proteins containing portions of the Arm repeat region. Both full-length Arm and a fragment containing repeats 1-13 bind strongly to DE-cadherin. Repeats 3-10 and repeats 3-8 retain DE-cadherin binding activity, while the smaller fragment containing repeats 5 and 6 does not bind (Fig. 8). Regions of Arm were also tested for interaction with DE-cadherin in the two-hybrid system. The N-terminal region of Arm does not interact with the cytoplasmic domain of DE-cadherin (Fig. 4C), but parts of the repeat region do (Fig. 9 and Table II). The smallest fragment of Arm capable of binding DE-cadherin is one containing Arm repeats 3-8 (R3-8). Smaller fragments (containing repeats 3-"

In order to analyze whether this association reflects a direct effect of kringle IV repeat number on Lp(a) plasma concentration, we have studied the expression of recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) isoforms in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. Following transient transfection of apo(a) cDNA expression plasmids that differed only in the number of kringle IV repeats, we observed a gradual decrease of Lp(a) in the medium of the cells with an increasing number of kringle IV repeats, mimicking the relationship present in humans in vivo. The analysis of apo(a) protein in the lysate and in the medium of cells that were transfected with a plasmid encoding an apo(a) isoform with 22 kringles revealed a predominant intracellular precursor with little secretion of the mature apo(a) protein. In contrast, transfection of a plasmid encoding an isoform with 11 kringles led to effective secretion of the mature peptide into the medium, indicating differential processing rates of apo(a) isoforms in the secretory path way.

McGraw Hill Inc., New York1995: 1887-1912Google Scholar). In Caucasians, the genetic control of Lp(a) concentrations is mainly exerted by the apo(a) gene locus on chromosome 6q26-q27 (7Kraft H.G.

Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) and has been dissected into two components. The first relates to the number of K-IV type 2 repeats in apo(a) that correlates inversely with Lp(a) plasma concentrations in all human populations (7Kraft H.G. Köchl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 8Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin.

Császár A. Boerwinkle E. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1991; 86: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Second, it has been demonstrated by sibling-pair linkage studies that Lp(a) concentrations are almost entirely controlled by variation at the apo(a) gene locus (7Kraft H.G. Köchl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 14Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Genet. 1995; 56: 287-293PubMed Google Scholar), implying sequence variation in the apo(a) gene beyond the size variation. A pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism in the apo(a) promoter and microheterogeneity in the K-IV-2 repeats has recently indeed been associated with Lp(a) concentrations (17Mancini F.P. Mooser V. Guerra R. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Trommsdorff M. Köchl S. Lingenhel A. Kronenberg F. Delport R. Vermaak H. Lemming L. Faergeman O.

Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but the influence of these sequence variations on Lp(a) concentration is not a direct effect but reflects allelic associations with unknown sequence variation within or linked to the apo(a) gene in Caucasians (19Mooser V.

It is important to note that the inverse correlation between the number of K-IV repeats in apo(a) and Lp(a) concentration formally represents an association and that the epidemiological data do neither prove a causal relationship nor provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the association. There exist strong allelic associations between the number of K-IV repeats and sequence variation related to Lp(a) concentrations (17Mancini F.P. Mooser V. Guerra R. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Mooser V. Mancini F.P. Bopp S. Schramm A.P. Guerra R. Boerwinkle E. Müller H.J. Hobbs H. Hum. Mol.

Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that the secretion of apo(a) by primary baboon hepatocytes relates to the size of the apo(a) isoform and that larger isoforms have a longer residence time in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is, however, unknown whether there are internal polymorphisms in the natural apo(a) alleles analyzed in this work. In the present study, we have analyzed whether the association reflects a causal relationship between the K-IV repeat number and Lp(a) concentration by transient transfection of apo(a) cDNA plasmids that differed solely in the number of K-IV repeats into the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. This allowed us to investigate the effect of isoform size on the expression of apo(a) without interference from other genetic variation existing in vivo. The cloning of the cDNA expression plasmid pCMV-A18 encoding signal peptide, 17 K-IV repeats, 1 kringle V unit, and the protease domain of apo(a) have been previously described (22Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two internal BstXI fragments in pCMV-A18 encode 8 K-IV-2 repeats. Modification of the number of BstXI fragments in pCMV-A18 by standard cloning methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) resulted in a series of plasmids pCMV-A10, -A14, -A18, -A22, -A26, -A30, and -A34 that were named according to their total number of apo(a) kringle domains (see Fig. 1). The shortest apo(a) plasmid pCMV-A6 was obtained by recombination between pCMV-A10 and pCMV-A18 D32-35 (24Ernst A. Helmhold M. Brunner C. Pethö-Schramm A. Armstrong V.W. Müller H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6227-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and contained the 6 apo(a) kringles IV-1, IV-2/3, IV-4, IV-9, IV-10, and V. Plasmid pCMV-A11 resulted from the insertion of a single K-IV-2 domain between K-IV-1 and K-IV-3 in pCMV-A10. The reporter gene plasmid pLUC-TFA contained a firefly luciferase cDNA (25DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) linked to a human transferrin promoter fragment (26Lucero M.A. Schaeffer E. Cohen G.N. Zakin M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and was used for cotransfection studies. Standard cloning methods were used to insert the firefly luciferase expression cassette from pLUC-TFA into the apo(a) isoform plasmids. The resulting plasmids were named pCMV-A6-LUC, pCMV-A10-LUC, etc. and contained the luciferase and apo(a) cassettes in a head to head orientation (see Fig. 1) The human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described (22Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected by lipofection using the lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 0.5-2 × 106 cells were seeded in 5-cm dishes 1 day before transfection. A mixture of 25 μl of DNA (in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8), 35 μl of lipofectamine, and 165 μl of Hepes-buffered saline was incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 2 ml of Opti-MEM transfection medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 mM glutamine. HepG2 cells were washed once in transfection medium followed by transfer of the DNA/lipofectamine/medium mixture to the cells and overnight incubation at 37°C. Following replacement of transfection medium by 4 ml of culture medium, the cells were incubated for 48 h prior to analysis of gene expression. 2 ml of culture supernatant were adjusted to a density of 1.21 g/ml with potassium bromide. Following a 90-min centrifugation at 250,000 × g and 10°C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge equipped with a TLV-100 rotor, the upper 500 μl were collected as lipoprotein fraction. 1 × 106 HepG2 cells were cotransfected with equimolar amounts of apo(a) isoform plasmids and a constant amount of the luciferase reporter gene plasmid pLUC-TFA. 24 h after transient transfection, the media were replaced by MEM labeling medium minus methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 2 mM glutamine, and 200 μCi/ml [35S]-L-methionine (Amersham Buchler GmbH, Braunschweig, FRG). Following another 24-h incubation, the labeling was stopped by addition of 2 mM methionine (Sigma) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonic acid (Boehringer Mannheim). Media were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g prior to incubation with monoclonal antibody 012 (Chemicon), directed against human apoB. Immune complexes were absorbed to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times in buffer A (50 mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7) and once in buffer B (10 mM Tris, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7) prior to elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cytosolic extracts were obtained and analyzed for luciferase activity as described (20Bopp S. Köchl S. Acquati F. Magnaghi P. Pethö-Schramm A. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Taramelli R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Size-fractionation of proteins in the media, cell lysates and homogenates, and fractions from cell fractionation experiments by reducing or non-reducing SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Apo(a)-specific immunodetection was performed with the monoclonal antibodies 1A2 (28Dieplinger H. Gruber G. Krasznai K. Reschauer S. Seidel C. Burns G. Müller H.J. Csaszar A. Vogel W. Robeneck H. Utermann G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LM-1 and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (Amersham Buchler GmbH, Braunschweig, FRG). The monoclonal antibody LM-1 against kringle V of apo(a) was generated by immunization of mice with a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 33-44 from kringle V. A detailed description of this monoclonal antibody will be given elsewhere. 2H. Dieplinger, and G. Utermann, manuscript in preparation. The relative intensities of the bands corresponding to r-apo(a) glycoproteins or r-apo(a)·apoB complexes were determined by densitometry using a UVP E.A.S.Y. Plus system (Herolab, Wiesloch, FRG). 1.2 ml of cell culture medium were precleared by mixing with 100 μl of Immunoprecipitin (formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus, Life Technologies, Inc.). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C under gentle agitation and centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated for 16 h with 6 μl of a monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti-apo(a) antibody at 4°C under gentle agitation. 100 μl of Immunoprecipitin were then added, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for 2 h. Tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g. Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mM MOPS, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate) and centrifuged as described. This procedure was repeated twice. The final pellet was solubilized in 30 μl of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-apo(a) antibodies 1A2 (28Dieplinger H. Gruber G. Krasznai K.

To control for completeness of immuno-precipitation, Lp(a) was measured in the supernatant by ELISA (29Kronenberg F. Lobentanz E.-M. König P. Utermann G. Dieplinger H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1318-1328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitation procedure and immunoblotting were repeated with the supernatant. No apo(a) was found in any of the supernatants. HepG2 cells were stably transfected with plasmids containing r-apo(a) coding for apo(a) isoforms with 14 or 22 kringle IV repeats. 3H. J. Müller, and C. Brunner, manuscript in preparation. Cells were cultured in MEM with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and G418 as selection supplement. Stably transfected cells were grown to 70% confluency in 14-cm Petri dishes and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were then gently removed with a rubber policeman, centrifuged for 5 min at 100 × g and 4°C, and resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g and 4°C, the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer including 0.5 mM EDTA. Cells were homogenized in a glass homogenizer with several strokes. After each stroke, 2 μl of homogenate were withdrawn and checked by light microscopy. Homogenization was stopped after 85-90% of cell nuclei were cell-free. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate for 10 min at 1500 × g and 4°C. Subcellular fractionation of the homogenate was performed by a density step-gradient ultracentrifugation in the flotation mode (30Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of PNS were brought to a density of 40.6% sucrose by adding 500 μl of 62% sucrose. To this 1 ml of PNS, 1.5 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 25% sucrose was overlayered and filled with homogenization buffer including EDTA. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman rotor SW 56 at 150,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C; 500 μl fractions were collected. The separation of subcellular fractions was monitored by measuring NADPH-cytochrome C reductase activity (31Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J.

Stably transfected HepG2 cells expressing an apo(a) isoform with 14 K-IV repeats were metabolically labeled for 16 h with [35S]Met (500 μCi/ml) in methionine-poor (10%, v/v) medium, and chased in MEM (supplemented with 10% FCS) at 15°C (block at the ER level), 20°C (block at the Trans-Golgi-Network (TGN), and 37°C (no block, regular secretion) for 6 h. Cell culture media were collected, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2% CAPS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM iodoacetamide, and apo(a) was immunoprecipitated as described for (unlabeled) r-apo(a). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and metabolically labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography after fixation of gels in 7% acetic acid, 20% methanol. Fluorography was performed with commercially available solutions from DuPont (Entensify A, B™). Cytosolic luciferase activities in freeze-thaw extracts (25DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R.

The Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to prepare total RNA from transfected HepG2 cells. Total RNA was treated in two rounds with RNase-free DNaseI (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove traces of contaminating plasmid DNA. DNA-free total RNA from transfected cells was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim). The cDNA products were used as a template for competitive PCR analysis (33Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) with the primer pairs 5′-AACCCAAGGTACCTTTGGGACTGG-3′/5′-GGCTGATTATGATCTCTAGTCAAGG-3′ and 5′-TCAAAGTGCGTTGCTAGTACCAACC-3′/5′-ATGAAGAAGTGTTCGTCTTCGTCCC-3′ specific for apo(a) protease and luciferase cDNA sequences, respectively. Competitor fragments with binding sites for the apo(a)- and luciferase-specific PCR primer pairs were designed to result in PCR products that were, respectively, 100 and 150 base pairs smaller than the corresponding cDNA-derived amplification products. PCR products were visualized on 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and quantitated by video densitometry (UVP E.A.S.Y Plus, Herolab, Wiesloch, FRG). The human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2, which is widely used in lipoprotein research, secretes apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) containing lipoproteins (e.g. LDL) into the medium but no apo(a) or Lp(a) (22Brunner C.

Here, we have used apo(a) plasmids pCMV-A10, -A11, -A14, -A18, -A22, -A26, -A30, and -A34, which differed only in the number of K-IV-2 repeats (from null to 24 (Fig. 1)), in order to study the mechanism underlying the inverse correlation of apo(a) isoform size with Lp(a) concentration. The shortest apo(a) plasmid, pCMV-A6, differed from the pCMV-A10 plasmid by an internal deletion of the apo(a) repeats K-IV-5 to K-IV-8 (kringles 32-35 in the nomenclature of McLean et al. (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 300: 132-137Crossref Scopus (1597) Google Scholar)). In a first set of experiments, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids pCMV-A10, -A14, -A18, and -A22 (Fig. 1). Following transfection, aliquots from the conditioned media were subjected to immunoblotting. The sizes of the secreted apo(a) isoforms corresponded to the K-IV repeat number in the transfected apo(a) plasmids (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4). To test whether all r-apo(a) isoforms are associated with lipids and form Lp(a) particles, lipoproteins were separated from the media by ultracentrifugation at density of 1.21 g/ml (at which all lipoproteins float) and subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 2, lanes 6-9). Each r-apo(a) isoform was recovered almost quantitatively from the lipoprotein fraction as shown by ELISA analysis (not shown), indicating that it had assembled with LDL. This is consistent with our previous analysis of HepG2 derived r-apo(a) by density gradient ultracentrifugation (22Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The intensity of apo(a) isoforms on the immunoblots (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4) already indicated that cells transfected with the smaller isoforms secreted apo(a) more efficiently than those transfected with the larger isoforms. However, no correction for transfection efficiency was performed in these experiments. Next we tried to quantify metabolically labeled r-apo(a) of different length in the HepG2 medium. However, employing several conditions for metabolic labeling including >12-h labeling periods, we realized that r-apo(a) was only insufficiently labeled (not shown). In contrast, apoB was efficiently labeled. Therefore, we quantified r-apo(a) as r-apo(a)·apoB complexes by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. HepG2 cells were transfected with equimolar amouts of the four apo(a) isoform plasmids pCMV-A10, -A14, -A18, and -A22 (Fig. 1) and cotransfected with the luciferase reporter gene plasmid pLUC-TFA. 24 h after transfection, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine. Following a 24-h labeling period, media were collected, and apoB containing lipoproteins was precipitated with anti-apoB antibody. This resulted in the coprecipitation of all apo(a) from the media as measured by ELISA (not shown). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and gels were autoradiographed prior to semiquantitative determination of r-apo(a)·apoB complexes by densitometry. All HepG2 cells, whether transfected or not, produced free apoB in similar amounts (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5). Cells transfected with the A11, A14, and A18 plasmids in addition produced r-apo(a)·apoB complexes that varied in size depending on the expressed apo(a) isoform. The intensity of these complexes decreased with the length of the apo(a) isoform present in the complex (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). Following transfection with the largest (A22) plasmid, the cells produced only barely detectable amounts of r-apo(a)·apoB complexes (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Densitometric determination of the r-apo(a)·apoB band intensities and normalization for cytosolic luciferase activities revealed a clear inverse relationship between r-apo(a) isoform size and r-apo(a)·apoB complexes in the media of transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Theoretically, the different sizes of the apo(a) isoform plasmids used for transfection in the above experiments might have resulted in different transfection efficiencies for the apo(a) plasmids despite identical transfection for the cotransfected luciferase plasmids. Therefore, w"

https://openalex.org/W2030146437,"Cartilage matrix protein (CMP) is a trimeric protein present in many types of cartilage extracellular matrix. It has recently been purified under native conditions that allowed the proposal of a structural model (Hauser, N., and Paulsson, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25747-25753). To examine the functional properties of CMP we studied its interaction with aggrecan within cartilage extracellular matrix. Aggrecan-enriched fractions were purified from bovine tracheal cartilage of different ages under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions, respectively, and characterized by a combination of biochemical methods and electron microscopy. The fractions contained a pool of CMP noncovalently associated with aggrecan as well as a pool of CMP that appears covalently cross-linked to the aggrecan core protein. Only about two thirds of the CMP subunits could be released even upon reduction under denaturing conditions. It appears that CMP is attached by a nonreducible covalent interaction of one of its subunits with the protein core. The amount of CMP strongly bound to aggrecan increases with age. Electron microscopy revealed interaction sites for CMP in the extended chondroitin-sulfate attachment domain E2. In old tissue five distinct binding sites for CMP were found while in young cartilage only three of these were occupied. The extent of decoration of E2 with CMP increases with age.

The molecular composition and supramolecular structure of cartilage determines the physical properties essential for its function. The cartilage tissue consists of chondrocytes surrounded by an abundant extracellular matrix. This matrix is composed of collagens (1van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar), proteoglycans (2Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1984; 4: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and noncollagenous matrix proteins (4Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These have been partially characterized but the knowledge of their interactions and physiological functions is still fragmentary. Under associative conditions, the major large proteoglycan in cartilage, aggrecan, can be isolated as aggregates formed by the noncovalent interaction of aggrecan monomers with hyaluronate and link protein. A combination of biochemical and biophysical characterization with interpretation of sequence information and electron microscopy allowed the proposal of a detailed model for aggrecan (see 5Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and references therein). The core protein consists of two N-terminal globular domains G1 and G2, interspaced by an extended domain E1, followed by a long extended domain E2, which is terminated by the C-terminal globular domain G3. G1 corresponds to the hyaluronate-binding region (6Paulsson M. Mörgelin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegård D. Timpl R. Engel J. Biochem.

J. 1988; 253: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). G2 shows a high degree of sequence homology to G1, but lacks affinity for hyaluronate (7Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Hardingham T.E. Heinegård D. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Fosang A.J. Hardingham T.E. Biochem J. 1989; 261: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E2 carries the bulk of glycosaminoglycan side chains. In its N-terminal part it represents the keratan-sulfate-rich region substituted with some two thirds of the total keratan sulfate in a very dense arrangement (9Heinegård D. Axelsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1971-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This polypeptide, being extremely rich in glutamate and proline (10Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), consists of 23 hexapeptide repeats in bovine cartilage aggrecan but only 4 in rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan (11Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of E2 constitutes the chondroitin-sulfate-rich region accounting for the major part of the core protein. It contains most of the chondroitin sulfate chains and some of the keratan sulfate (9Heinegård D. Axelsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1971-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chondroitin sulfate is arranged in clusters (13Heinegård D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sequence analysis shows that this segment of E2 can be divided into several subdomains all containing the putative Ser-Gly glycosylation sites, but differing with respect to the length of internal repeats (11Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that all of the Ser-Gly sites are substituted with chondroitin sulfate chains as their number closely equals the number of side chains determined by biochemical analysis. E2 is of variable length (6Paulsson M. Mörgelin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegård D. Timpl R. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1980-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apparently due to proteolytic degradation within the matrix. Its average length in the intact monomer is 405 nm, but only 263 nm in the chondroitinase digested core protein fragment, implying a stretching effect by glycosaminoglycan repulsion in intact monomers (15Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Malmström A. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12080-12090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal globular domain G3 has a diameter of some 7.5 nm. It differs from G1 and G2 in sequence, but shares homology with a class of vertebrate hepatic lectins (11Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is present in up to 50% of the particles extracted from mature cartilage (6Paulsson M. Mörgelin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegård D. Timpl R. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A physiological ligand for G3 has not yet been identified although it binds to the same carbohydrate structures as most C-type animal lectins albeit with lower affinity (16Saleque S. Ruiz N. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and later purified from bovine tracheal cartilage under denaturing conditions (20Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The molecule consists of three identical subunits of about 50 kDa each which are obtained separately after reduction under denaturing conditions (20Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under native conditions, the trimeric structure of CMP is retained even upon reduction of the stabilizing interchain disulfide bonds in the C-terminal assembly domain (17Hauser N. Paulsson M. J.

The sequence of CMP is highly conserved between species as 79% of all amino acid residues are identical between chicken and man. Von Willebrand factor A domains have been implicated in interactions with collagen (for review, see Colombatti and Bonaldo (25Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Immunolabeling for CMP was detected on collagen fibrils produced by chondrocytes in culture and CMP, that had been isolated under denaturing conditions by extraction with 4 M guanidine HCl, was shown to bind to collagens in solid phase assays (26Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the pericellular matrix of cells transfected with CMP constructs CMP was also seen in a collagen-independent filamentous network (27Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CMP is expressed not only in tracheal rings, but also in a limited number of other cartilagenous tissues such as nasal septum, auricular, epiphysial, and xiphisternal cartilage (28Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Hauser N. DiCesare P.E. Paulsson M. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 19-21Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In bovine tracheal cartilage the total amount of CMP increases greatly with maturation, while the guanidine HCl-soluble pool decreases, indicating an age-dependent cross-linking of CMP in the matrix (30Paulsson M. Inerot S. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The observed cofractionation of CMP with aggrecan points to an interaction of these molecules (19Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe the isolation of aggrecan-CMP complexes under conditions minimizing contamination with unrelated proteins. By a combination of biochemical characterization and electron microscopy we demonstrate the age-dependent cross-linking of CMP to the aggrecan core protein and show distinct binding sites for CMP on the extended domain E2. Fresh bovine tracheal cartilage from steers (fetus, 3-6 months, 18 months, and 6 years) was obtained from the local slaughterhouse. The cartilage was dissected free from surrounding muscle, cut into cubes of about 1 mm3, frozen and stored at −70°C. An aliquot (10 g) of each sample was thawed in 25 volumes (ml/g wet weight) of prechilled 0.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.4, and homogenized three times for 10 s each using a Polytron homogenizer at full speed. The tissue residue was collected by centrifugation at 17,700 × gav for 30 min at 4°C. This wash cycle was repeated another three times. The prewashed tissue residues were subsequently homogenized in 10 volumes (ml/g wet weight) of 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.01 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mM EDTA as proteinase inhibitors, and extracted overnight at 4°C. Alternatively, cartilage was extracted by high speed homogenization for 30 min in either 0.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, or in 7 M urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, in the presence of protease inhibitors as described above. Homogenates were centrifuged at 17,700 × gav for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatants recovered. Solid cesium chloride (CsCl) was added to 4 M guanidine HCl extracts to yield a final density of 1.40 g/ml, and the samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 68 h at 18°C in a 12 × 40-ml fixed angle rotor (type 55.2 Ti, Beckman). The gradient was then divided into five fractions of equal volume from the bottom (D1) to the top (D5). All fractions were analyzed for CMP by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Further purification steps were performed at 4°C. D1 fractions were dialyzed against the 4 M guanidine HCl extraction buffer overnight at 4°C. The supernatants after high speed homogenization were dialyzed against the respective extraction buffers with protease inhibitors and passed through a column (35 × 2.6 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, which was equilibrated and eluted with the same buffers. Proteoglycans were eluted from the column with the respective extraction buffers, containing 1 M NaCl, and subsequently concentrated by ultrafiltration. Samples (6 ml each) were subsequently applied to a column (90 × 2.6 cm) of Sepharose CL-4B and eluted with 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.05 M Tris/HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those corresponding to the void volume pooled and stored at 4°C. CMP was extracted from adult bovine tracheal cartilage using 4 M guanidine HCl and purified as described previously (20Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against CMP were raised in rabbits, and their specificity was verified as described elsewhere (17Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of antibodies was performed using CMP immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The column was washed with TBS, the antibodies were eluted with 3 M KSCN, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and antibody-containing fractions immediately dialyzed against TBS. These steps were performed in the cold room. Aliquots (10 ml) of the void volume pools after Sepharose CL-4B chromatography of proteoglycans prepared from 4 M guanidine HCl, TBS, and urea extracts, respectively, were dialyzed against 0.1 M Tris/HCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 7.3. They were then digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.0025 unit/mg of proteoglycan) and keratanase (0.05 unit/mg of proteoglycan) for 4 h at 37°C. Undigested and digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against CMP and the aggrecan G1-domain, respectively. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the digested samples were applied to a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography-column and eluted with 0.5 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as above, and void volume fractions, enriched in aggrecan-CMP complexes, were pooled and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing electron microscopy. In a separate experiment the distribution of CMP was quantitated by radioimmunoassay before and after enzyme treatment and correlated to the altered distribution of the core protein in the following way: an aliquot of a D1 fraction of the 6-year-old steer cartilage was subjected to a second CsCl density gradient centrifugation using conditions as described above. The resulting D1D1 bottom proteoglycan fraction of the gradient was subsequently digested with chondroitinase ABC as above and chromatographed on a column (0.8 × 150 cm) of Sepharose CL-6B, eluted with 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.01 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Protein contents of column effluents were determined as the absorbance of solutions at 280 nm. A sample of each fraction was precipitated with 9 volumes of absolute ethanol before quantitative determination of CMP by radioimmunoassay as described previously (28Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the 6-year-old steer D1D1 fraction was diluted with an equal volume of 8 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, to achieve a final guanidine HCl concentration of 6 M. Dithioerythritol was added to a concentration of 10 mM, and the sample was incubated for 5 h at 37°C. The reduced aggrecan-CMP complexes were subsequently alkylated by addition of iodoacetic acid to a final concentration of 30 mM, followed by incubation overnight in the darkness at room temperature. The sample was diluted to 4 M guanidine HCl by addition of distilled water, followed by chromatography of reduced and alkylated as well as untreated control samples on a column (0.8 × 150 cm) of Sepharose CL-2B, eluted with 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.01 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Column effluents were analyzed for uronic acid content after ethanol precipitation by an automated version (31Heinegård D. Chem. Scr. 1973; 4: 199-201Google Scholar) of the carbazole reaction (32Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). CMP in fractions was determined by radioimmunoassay after ethanol precipitation (28Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the protocol of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using gradient gels of 4-15% polyacrylamide. When desired, samples were reduced with 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in sample buffer. Sample proteins and molecular mass standards were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R or by immunoblotting after electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins on immunoblots were stained with 10% Ponceau red to ascertain that transfer had been adequate. After washing with TBS, the blots were incubated with TBS containing 5% milk powder for 1 h and immunostained by sequential incubations for 1 h at room temperature with the desired rabbit antiserum, diluted 1:200 in TBS with 5% milk powder, and with peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), diluted 1:500 in TBS with 5% milk powder. The blots were washed with distilled water and bound antibodies were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Aggrecan-CMP complex samples were dialyzed against 0.2 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9, overnight at 4°C. Mixtures of aggrecan-CMP complexes with affinity purified antibodies to CMP (typical molar antigen:antibody ratios ranging from 1:5 to 1:1) were treated in the same way. Specimens were prepared for electron microscopy by glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing (34Shotton D.M. Burke B. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 35Fowler W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were diluted with an equal volume of 80% glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried in vacuo and rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon by means of electron bombardment heating. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as described previously (37Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar). Aggrecan-CMP complexes were isolated from tissues of different ages (fetus, 3-6 months, 18 months, and 6 years) by extraction with 4 M guanidine HCl, followed by CsCl density gradient centrifugation in the same solvent. The distribution of CMP in the different D1-D5 fractions was examined by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE and showed an age-dependent pattern (Fig. 1). In fetal tracheal cartilage, CMP was predominant in the top fraction (D5). With increasing age the distribution of CMP shifted toward the high buoyant density bottom proteoglycan fraction (D1). The 6-year-old cartilage extract contained the highest amounts of CMP in D1, but also in the D2-D4 fractions, indicating the presence of complexes of CMP with intact and fragmented aggrecan throughout the CsCl gradient. CMP was partially separated from aggrecan in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1). The aggrecan-CMP containing D1 fractions from 3-6-month and 6-year-old cartilage were selected for further purification by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B in 4 M guanidine HCl. CMP bound to aggrecan coeluted in the void volume, whereas unbound CMP eluted in the included volume of the column (Fig. 2). Thus, apparently three different pools of CMP were observed in the dissociative cartilage extracts. The first pool containing free CMP was seen in the low buoyant density, aggrecan-free D5 fraction. A second pool consisting of CMP associated with aggrecan but not covalently bound to it was removed by gel filtration in 4 M guanidine HCl. The third one apparently consisting of covalently cross-linked aggrecan-CMP complexes was identified by copurification with aggrecan even under dissociative conditions. The amount of CMP in the second and third pool increased with aging (Fig. 2). In attempts to exclude the possibility of artefactual, nonphysiological interactions between CMP and aggrecan, induced by guanidine HCl or CsCl, we performed parallel control experiments. We isolated aggrecan-CMP complexes under native conditions by high speed homogenization of 6-year-old tracheal cartilage in 0.25 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Alternatively, aggrecan-CMP complexes were isolated by high speed homogenization of samples of the same tissue in buffer containing 7 M urea. In order to avoid high concentrations of CsCl, aggrecan-CMP complexes were purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B instead of isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. Analysis of such aggrecan-CMP complexes by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy showed the same distribution of CMP. We distinguished a first pool comprising soluble CMP, a second pool consisting of CMP associated with aggrecan, but being released upon incubation in SDS prior to PAGE, and a third pool apparently being covalently cross-linked to aggrecan and partially released by reduction. Furthermore, electron microscopical inspection demonstrated aggrecan-CMP complexes similar to those after guanidine HCl extraction and CsCl density gradient centrifugation (results not shown). We therefore conclude that the observed covalent association of CMP with the aggrecan core protein reflects the in situ situation. Void volume fractions from Sepharose CL-4B were subsequently digested with chondroitinase ABC and keratanase. They were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to CMP and the aggrecan G1 domain. Comparison of the different staining patterns revealed the presence of CMP in all the aggrecan containing samples, even after enzyme treatment to remove the glycosaminoglycan side chains of the molecule (Fig. 3). This shows that CMP is bound to the core protein rather than being linked to the glycosaminoglycan side chains. In the same experiment, an age-dependent net increase in CMP cross-linked to the aggrecan core protein was observed. The respective sample from immature cartilage showed only little staining for CMP, when compared with the sample from old cartilage, while the staining pattern obtained for aggrecan G1 domain was similar to that of old cartilage (Fig. 3). In a parallel analytical experiment, a D1 sample from 6-year-old cartilage was used to further characterize the interaction of CMP with aggrecan core protein. The respective sample was subjected to a second CsCl density gradient centrifugation in buffer containing 4 M guanidine HCl, thus minimizing contamination of the preparation with unbound CMP. An aliquot of the D1D1 fraction was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B in buffer containing 4 M guanidine HCl after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. The distribution of CMP in column effluents was quantitated by radioimmunoassay and correlated to the altered distribution of the core protein upon deglycosylation (Fig. 4). The CMP coeluted with a distinct subpopulation of the core protein and was distinctly shifted from the void volume position of nondigested material (data not shown). The results provide strong evidence for a CMP-core protein interaction rather than a binding of CMP to the glycosaminoglycan side chains. Chondroitinase and keratanase digested purified aggrecan-CMP complexes, as described above, were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. They were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to CMP and the aggrecan G1 domain. A partial release of CMP subunits from the aggrecan core protein was observed, as free CMP subunits appeared upon reduction (Fig. 5b). This observation was examined in more detail using aggrecan-CMP complexes in D1D1 fractions, as above. Samples were chromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B in buffer containing 4 M guanidine HCl before and after reduction and alkylation. Quantitation of CMP by radioimmunoassay showed release of 2/3 of the CMP upon reduction (Fig. 5b), whereas one third of the total CMP still coeluted with aggrecan (Fig. 5a). Taken together, these findings indicate a nonreducible covalent cross-linking of CMP to the aggrecan core protein via one of its three subunits, where the other two subunits can be released by reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds under dissociative conditions. Fractions enriched in aggrecan-CMP complexes from tracheal cartilage of different ages were visualized by electron microscopy after glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing. Individual CMP molecules were observed as globular particles, found at distinct locations on the extended core protein domain E2 (Figs. 6A and 7, a and c). Labeling of aggrecan-CMP complexes with affinity purified antibodies to CMP confirmed the identity of these particles (Figs. 6B and 7, b and d). The proportion of protein cores carrying bound CMP increased with age, and so did the average number of CMP per core protein (Table I). The frequency of occupation of the different binding sites for CMP on E2 varied with age. In aggrecan from 3-6-month-old cartilage one major binding site at 60 ± 10 nm, and two additional minor binding sites at 25 ± 8 nm and 115 ± 10 nm, respectively, predominated (Fig. 7a). In aggrecan from 6-year-old tissue three major binding sites at 25 ± 8 nm, 55 ± 10 nm, and 105 ± 10 nm, respectively, and two minor binding sites at 80 ± 5 nm and 145 ± 5 nm were observed (Fig. 7c). These findings were generally confirmed by immunolabeling of the core proteins of different ages with affinity purified antibodies to CMP (Fig. 7, b and d). The overall increase of apparently covalently bound CMP with aging appears to be due to an increasing frequency of occupation of the binding sites already seen in young tissue, in addition to new binding sites on E2 being used.Table IAmounts of CMP bound to E2 in aggrecan-CMP complexes from cartilage of different agesExtractCartilage3-6 Months6 YearsGlobular particles on E2, % of total core proteins2138Immunostaining with anti-CMP, % of total core proteins1465Percent of total core proteins carryingOne molecule of CMP1926Two molecules of CMP210Three molecules of CMP02 Open table in a new tab Fig. 7Distribution of bound CMP along the extended aggrecan core protein domain E2. Relative amounts of CMP covalently cross-linked to E2 are shown for 3-6-month (a and b) and 6-year-old (c and d) bovine tracheal cartilage. CMP was determined either directly by measuring particles along E2 (a and c) or indirectly by labeling E2 with affinity purified CMP antibodies (b and d). In young cartilage, one major and two minor binding sites for CMP are found at 25, 60, and 115 nm, respectively (a and b), whereas in the older cartilage two additional minor binding sites at 80 and 150 nm become apparent (c and d). The binding positions on E2 are given as the distances from the globular core protein domain G2.

It appears that several pools of CMP occur within the tissue with different properties and possibly different functions. One pool of soluble CMP is released by EDTA-containing buffer, i.e. it is anchored within the matrix by a divalent cation-dependent mechanism (17Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another pool of CMP is strongly associated with aggrecan, but can be dissociated by chaotropic agents. A third pool consists of aggrecan-CMP complexes that are stable even in 4 M guanidine HCl or 2% SDS, presumably due to covalent linkage. From the latter pool about two thirds of the total CMP can be released by reduction under denaturing conditions. Upon maturation and aging of the tissue a remarkable increase in total tissue CMP is accompanied by a shift from CMP in the first pool to the third, tightly bound, pool. Electron microscopy revealed distinct binding sites of CMP on the extended aggrecan core protein domain E2. The relative extent of occupation of the different binding sites varies with aging. Furthermore, electron microscopic examination revealed the appearance of additional binding sites on E2 for CMP and an increased decoration of E2 with CMP upon aging. This is in general accordance with the observation of an overall age-dependent increase in apparently covalently bound CMP, as seen by biochemical analysis of the fractions enriched in aggrecan-CMP complexes and from previous results showing accumulation of CMP within tracheal cartilage with age (30Paulsson M. Inerot S. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The periodic appearance of CMP binding sites along E2 may be due to repetitive sequences in the core protein which could contain motifs for CMP binding. Alternatively, this might reflect less glycosylated regions of E2 which are thus accessible to CMP binding and subsequent cross-linking. The age-dependent altered occupation of the different binding sites with CMP may reflect a change in the availability of a given binding site for CMP in situ. The mechanism for covalent cross-linking of CMP is unknown. A possible candidate enzyme for cross-linking in situ, tissue transglutaminase, is expressed in some types of cartilage, including tracheal rings (38Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, in vitro assays using purified tissue transglutaminase, showed no incorporation of radiolabeled putrescine into CMP, aggrecan or the aggrecan core protein (results not shown). The interaction of CMP with cartilage collagen fibrils has been postulated by Winterbottom et al. (26Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This work was based on immunolabeling for CMP of collagen fibrils in the pericellular matrix of cultured chondrocytes, and binding of collagens to 4 M guanidine HCl-extracted CMP in enzyme-linked immunosorbent style assays. If this interaction truly occurs in vivo, and the interaction with aggrecan core protein shown in the present study exists simultaneously, CMP might play an integrating role in cartilage extracellular matrix organization as a bridging molecule between the two major cartilage matrix constituents, aggrecan and collagen.

The gene responsible for LGMD2A has been identified as the muscle-specific calpain (41Richard I. et al.Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), whereas the genes responsible for LGMD1A, −2B, and −2F are still unknown.Here, we first describe the cloning of a cDNA encoding a fourth sarcoglycan protein (δ-sarcoglycan), a novel 35-kDa component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Human δ-sarcoglycan is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and shares about 60% protein sequence identity with the recently cloned γ-sarcoglycan. We demonstrate that γ- and δ-sarcoglycan are separate entities within the DGC, despite their similar molecular weights and protein sequences. δ-Sarcoglycan is not an isoform of γ-sarcoglycan. We also show that α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan are equal in the sarcoglycan complex on a stoichiometric basis. We demonstrate that δ-sarcoglycan is reduced along with α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycan in LGMD2C, −2D, and −2E. Therefore, a common feature of LGMD2C, −2D, and −2E is a specific loss of the entire sarcoglycan complex from the sarcolemma membrane. Finally, we map the human δ-sarcoglycan gene to chromosome 5q33-34 within the recently reported disease interval for LGMD2F (5q33-34) (37Passos-Bueno M.R. Moreira E.S. Vainzof M. Marie S.K. Zatz M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe different components of the DGC were initially characterized based on their electrophoretic mobilities (1Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 2Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). One component, identified as a 35-kDa protein band has recently been cloned and named γ-sarcoglycan (23Noguchi S. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated here by direct protein sequencing and molecular cloning that the 35-kDa protein band contained a second protein distinct from γ-sarcoglycan and was encoded by a different gene. The identity of this protein, named δ-sarcoglycan, was characterized using a specific antibody. In particular, δ-sarcoglycan copurified with the DGC and sarcoglycan complexes and colocalized with the other components of the DGC to the sarcolemma. The identification of this novel component of the sarcoglycan complex allowed us to update the molecular organization of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Fig. 7).The predicted molecular mass of δ-sarcoglycan is 29 kDa, whereas its apparent molecular mass is 35 kDa. This discrepancy is mainly due to N-glycosylation of δ-sarcoglycan. Interestingly, the structure of δ-sarcoglycan is similar to β- and γ-sarcoglycan, with a short N-terminal intracellular domain and a large glycosylated C-terminal extracellular domain. Furthermore, δ- and γ-sarcoglycan share about 60% identity in primary structure, suggesting that these two proteins may have a similar function within the sarcoglycan complex. The structural homology as well as the similarity in molecular weight between γ- and δ-sarcoglycan have rendered these proteins indistinguishable by Western blot analysis. However, we demonstrated here that deglycosylation of purified DGC allows the separation of γ- and δ-sarcoglycan. Furthermore, the predicted isoelectric point (pI) of δ-sarcoglycan is 9.48, whereas γ-sarcoglycan displays a pI of 5.0 (23Noguchi S. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Yamamoto et al. (51Yamamoto H. Hagiwara Y. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown that the 35-kDa band from purified DGC is resolved on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE into two distinct spots, one being identified as γ-sarcoglycan with an acid pI and the second as an uncharacterized more basic protein. We observed that this more basic protein is specifically detected with the anti-δ-sarcoglycan antibodies. 2D. Jung, unpublished results. Therefore, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel analysis of purified DGC may also allow the separation of γ-sarcoglycan from δ-sarcoglycan.δ-Sarcoglycan, similarly to α- and γ-sarcoglycan, is strongly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, whereas the β-sarcoglycan transcript is ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, several transcripts were detected for δ-sarcoglycan, suggesting the existence of alternatively spliced forms. However, two peptides from the 35-kDa protein band were not found in γ- or δ-sarcoglycan. Using the TBLASTN search program, we identified an EST from mouse embryonic skeletal muscle containing one of these peptides. This EST encodes a C-terminal isoform of δ-sarcoglycan. Further work is currently in progress to characterize this isoform in human skeletal muscle.Immunostaining of skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with LGMD2C, −2D, or −2E demonstrated a reduction of all the sarcoglycan proteins (α, β, γ, and δ) at the sarcolemma, while the other components of the DGC were preserved. Therefore, a common feature of LGMD2C, −2D, and −2E is a specific absence of the sarcoglycan complex at the sarcolemma. This finding demonstrated that all sarcoglycans are required to maintain the integrity of the complex. We have previously demonstrated that in normal muscle the sarcoglycan proteins are tightly associated (24Jung D. et al.FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This tight association may confer a high stability to the complex. The loss of only one sarcoglycan may render the complex more vulnerable to degradation and result in a destabilization of the complex during the process of its translocation to the sarcolemma. Such a mechanism has already been described for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (52Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the absence of the sarcoglycan complex from the membrane leads to a dystrophic phenotype is currently unknown. It is possible that the sarcoglycan complex contributes to the DGC function, which is believed to link the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Absence of this functional link may result in sarcolemmal instability and greater susceptibility to stress-induced damage, as it has been suggested for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (26Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar).So far, LGMD2C, −2D, and −2E have been characterized by primary defects in γ-, α-, and β-sarcoglycan, respectively (19Roberds S.L. et al.Cell. 1994; 78: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 21Lim L.E. Duclos F. Broux O. et al.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Bönnemann C.G. et al.Nature Genet. 1995; 11: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 23Noguchi S. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 38Matsumura K.

Genet. 1995; 10: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), leading to the absence of the entire sarcoglycan complex. Since, the four sarcoglycan proteins are equal on a stoichiometric basis within the complex and that each protein is required to maintain the integrity of the complex, one may expect that a defect in δ-sarcoglycan also leads to the disruption of the sarcoglycan complex resulting in a LGMD phenotype. Interestingly, the δ-sarcoglycan gene has been mapped to chromosome 5q33-34, which overlaps with the region recently linked to a new form of autosomal recessive LGMD, LGMD2F (37Passos-Bueno M.R. Moreira E.S. Vainzof M. Marie S.K. Zatz M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Note Added in ProofRecently, two papers have been published which report the cloning of δ-sarcoglycan (Nigro, V., Piluso, G., Belsito, A., Politano, L., Puca, A. A., Papparella, S., Rossi, E., Viglietto, G., Esposito, M. G., Abbondanza, C., Medici, N., Molinari, A. M., Nigro, G., and Puca, G. A. (1996) Hum. Mol. Genet. 5, 1179-1186) and the demonstration that a mutation in δ-sarcoglycan causes LGMD2F (Nigro, V., de Sá Moreira, E., Piluso, G., Vainzof, M., Belsito, A., Politano, L., Puca, A. A., Passos-Bueno, M. R., and Zatz, M. (1996) Nat. Genet. 14, 195-198). Interestingly, the reported sequence of δ-sarcoglycan differs in the C-terminal region from our δ-sarcoglycan sequence suggesting the existence of two isoforms of δ-sarcoglycan (δ1 and δ2) in skeletal muscle.

Induction requires the activation and translocation to the nucleus of a transregulatory protein, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF), which converts from a monomeric non-DNA-binding form to an oligomeric form that binds to specific promoter elements (HSE) located upstream of heat shock genes (6Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several HSFs have been identified in mammalian cells (6Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously that prostaglandins of the A and J type (PGAs and PGJs) were able to activate HSF and induce the synthesis of the 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) in a wide variety of mammalian cells (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Stress Proteins: Induction and Function. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar). Induction of HSP70 by prostaglandins requires the presence of a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring (cyclopentenone), which renders this portion of the molecule able to form Michael's adducts with cellular nucleophilics and to covalently bind to cysteine residues of proteins via a thioether bond (8Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar, 9Khan S.H. Sorof S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9401-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have also shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins possess a potent antiviral activity against RNA and DNA viruses in a wide variety of experimental models in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in 7Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Stress Proteins: Induction and Function. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar and 10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In negative-strand RNA viruses the antiviral activity has been associated with the ability of cyclopentenone prostaglandins to induce HSP70 expression, and a role of this protein in the control of virus replication has been hypothesized (10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Amici C. Giorgi C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We now report that the cyclopentenone ring structure itself, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, is able to activate HSF and selectively induce HSP70 expression and show that the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is the key structure for triggering HSF activation. We also show that induction of HSP70 is associated with inhibition of infectious virus production and viral protein synthesis in monkey kidney epithelial cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHuman K562 erythroleukemic cells were exposed to varying concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one or were subjected to heat shock. Whole-cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA to determine HSF activation. 2-Cyclopenten-1-one induced HSF DNA binding activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Activation comparable with severe heat shock was achieved with concentration of 250-500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one. As in the case of heat shock, HSF type 1 (HSF1) is the primary component of the cyclopentenone-induced HSE binding activity, as determined by EMSA after preincubation of whole-cell extracts with polyclonal anti-HSF1 or anti-HSF2 antibodies (Fig. 1B).Heat shock-induced HSF activation is known to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis in the case of a mild (42°C) heat treatment, while HSF activation after severe (45°C) heat shock is independent of cellular protein synthesis (18Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether HSF1 activation by 2-cyclopenten-1-one was dependent on de novo protein synthesis, K562 cells were either treated with 500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one or were stressed at 42 or 45°C for 20 min, in the presence or in the absence of 100 μM cycloheximide (CHX). Ninety or 180 min after 2-cyclopenten-1-one treatment, or 30 min after heat shock, whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1C, 2-cyclopenten-1-one-induced HSF1 activation was found to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis, since it was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment.To investigate the kinetics of HSF activation by 2-cyclopenten-1-one, whole-cell extracts prepared at different times after treatment with 500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one or 3 h after heat shock (45°C for 20 min) were subjected to EMSA. The levels of HSF DNA binding activity in 2-cyclopenten-1-one-treated cells were quantitated by Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, activation of HSF by 2-cyclopenten-1-one was detected 1.5 h after treatment, and maximal levels of HSF·HSE complexes were detected 9 h after addition of the drug. In the same experiment, the effect of 2-cyclopenten-1-one on HSP70 mRNA transcription was examined by nuclear run-on analysis. 2-Cyclopenten-1-one specifically induced HSP70 mRNA transcription, while it did not affect the transcription rates of messengers for other stress proteins, including HSC70, the glucose-regulated GRP78/BiP, or heme-oxygenase (Fig. 2B). HSP70 mRNA transcription started as soon as 1.5 h after 2-cyclopenten-1-one addition, and transcription rates were maximal by 6-9 h, to decline 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect of 2-cyclopenten-1-one treatment on HSF activation, heat shock gene transcription, and protein synthesis in K562 cells. A, kinetics of HSF activation by 2-cyclopenten-1-one. Whole-cell extracts prepared at different times after treatment with 500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one or 3 h after heat shock (45°C for 20 min) were subjected to EMSA (right panel). Positions of HSF·DNA binding complex (HSF), constitutive HSE binding activity (CHBA), and nonspecific protein-DNA interactions (NS) are indicated, as in Fig. 1. The levels of HSF DNA-binding activity in 2-cyclopenten-1-one-treated cells were quantitated by Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager analysis (left panel). HSF values were normalized to the level of HSF DNA binding activity at 9 h after treatment, which was given a value of 100%. B, transcription rates, measured by nuclear run-on assay. 32P-Labeled RNA was hybridized to nitrocellulose filters containing plasmids for the following human genes: HSP70 (pH2.3), GRP78/BiP (pHG23.1), HSC70 (pHA7.6), HO (clone 2/10), or gapdh. The radioactivity quantitated by Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager analysis is shown in the left panel. Values are expressed as arbitrary units obtained by comparing transcription rates with control levels. C, effect of 2-cyclopenten-1-one on protein synthesis. K562 cells labeled with [35S]methionine at different times after treatment with 500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (right, upper panel) or by immunoprecipitation with anti-HSP70 antibodies (right, lower panel). HSP70 synthesis (∘) was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms (left panel). Total protein synthesis (•) was determined as [35S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the 2-cyclopenten-1-one-induced HSP70 mRNA was efficiently translated, K562 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/106 cells, 1-h pulse) at different times after treatment with 500 μM 2-cyclopenten-1-one. Total protein synthesis, determined as [35S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, was not inhibited by the drug under these conditions (Fig. 2C). Samples containing an equal amount of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and HSP70 synthesis was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. As shown in Fig. 2C, 2-cyclopenten-1-one-induced HSP70 mRNA was efficiently translated in K562 cells. Synthesis of HSP70 was sustained for at least 9 h after treatment. Increased expression of this protein was also detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C, lower panel).To investigate whether the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group present in 2-cyclopenten-1-one was the molecular structure responsible for HSF activation, K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one, cyclopentanone (a similar molecule with a saturated carbonyl), or with cyclopentene, which contains a double bond, but not a carbonyl group. Neither cyclopentanone nor cyclopentene were able to induce HSF DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A), indicating that the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is essential for HSF activation. Since the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) functions as signal for HSF activation in many types of mammalian cells (7Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Stress Proteins: Induction and Function. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar, 10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we compared the effect of PGA1 with either 2-cyclopenten-1-one, or with 1-octen-3-ol and oenanthic acid, whose structure resembles the two aliphatic side chains of PGA1. Neither 1-octen-3-ol nor oenanthic acid were able to induce HSF activation, confirming that the key structural component for HSF activation by prostaglandins is the cyclopentenone moiety (Fig. 3B). However, PGA1 is able to activate HSF at concentrations much lower (approximately 25 times) than 2-cyclopenten-1-one (Fig. 3C). The presence of the aliphatic side chains could be functional by facilitating either entry into cells or detection of the molecular target.Fig. 3The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is responsible for HSF activation. A, K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one (lanes 3-5), cyclopentanone (lanes 6 to 8), cyclopentene (lanes 9 to 11), or control diluent (lane 1) at 37°C or were stressed at 45°C for 20 min (HS; lane 2). After 3 h, whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA. A section of fluorograms from native gels is shown, and positions of HSF·DNA binding complex (HSF), constitutive HSE binding activity (CHBA), and nonspecific protein-DNA interactions (NS) are indicated, as in Fig. 1. B, K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one (lanes 3-5), 1-octen-3-ol (lanes 6 to 8), oenanthic acid (lanes 9 to 11), or control diluent (lane 1) at 37°C or were heat shocked at 45°C for 20 min (HS; lane 2).

Benedetto A. Carruba G. Garaci E. Jaffe B.M. Science. 1980; 209: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is now well established that cyclopentenone prostaglandins possess a potent antiviral activity against several DNA and RNA viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (20Rozera C. Carattoli A. De Marco A. Amici C. Giorgi C. Santoro M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in 10Santoro M.G.

Advances in Prostaglandins Thromboxane and Leukotriene Research. Vol. 21. Raven Press, New York1991: 867-874Google Scholar). The antiviral activity of a long acting synthetic analogue of PGA2 (di-M-PGA2) has also been shown in vivo, in a mouse model infected with influenza A virus (22Santoro M.G. Favalli C. Mastino A. Jaffe B.M. Esteban M. Garaci E. Arch. Virol. 1988; 99: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In negative-strand RNA virus models prostaglandins of the A and J type provoke a selective and dramatic block of virus protein synthesis (11Amici C. Giorgi C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pica F. Rossi A. Santirocco N. Palamara A. Garaci E. Santoro M.G. Antivir. Res. 1996; 29: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This block is exerted at the translational level and is dependent on HSP70 expression in infected cells (reviewed in 10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A possible model has been hypothesized, in which HSP and virus messages, both of which can be translated in conditions where cellular protein synthesis is impaired, could possess similar mechanisms for preferential translation and could then compete with each other (23Santoro M.G. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-Inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser-Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 335-355Google Scholar).To investigate whether 2-cyclopenten-1-one could mimic the PG-induced block of virus protein synthesis, epithelial monkey kidney MA104 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and then treated with 2-cyclopenten-1-one, at concentrations which induced HSP70 synthesis. VSV titers were determined 24 h post-infection by cytopathic effect 50% assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, 2-cyclopenten-1-one was found to inhibit the production of VSV infectious particles in a dose-dependent manner and with a selective index of 36.Fig. 4Effect of 2-cyclopenten-1-one on VSV replication and protein synthesis. Confluent monolayers of MA104 cells were infected with VSV (1 plaque-forming unit/cell) and treated with different concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one or control diluent soon after the 1-h adsorption period for the next 24 h. A, VSV titers were determined 24 h post-infection. B, uninfected (U) or VSV-infected (VSV) MA104 cells were treated with 500 μM (lanes 2and 4) 2-cyclopenten-1-one or with control diluent (lanes 1 and 3) soon after VSV infection and labeled with [35S]methionine (1-h pulse starting 5 h post-infection). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The position of HSP70, identified by Western blot analysis using anti-human HSP70 antibodies (data not shown), is indicated by the arrow. VSV proteins L, G, N, NS, and M (12Pica F. Rossi A.

Res. 1993; 20: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), higher concentrations of 2-cyclopenten-1-one were needed to inhibit virus replication. The relative potency of PGA1 and 2-cyclopenten-1-one in activating HSF (Fig. 3) correlates with the antiviral activity, reinforcing the hypothesis that the heat shock response is involved in the control of virus replication (10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Santoro M.G. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-Inducible Cellular Responses.

HSP70 has been shown recently to be critically involved in myocardial protection by ischemia-induced injury also in animals (32Marber M.S. Walker J.M. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations justify the attempt to characterize new HSP inducers, which could be used therapeutically. The results described identify 2-cyclopenten-1-one as a new inducer of HSP70 with antiviral activity and indicate that the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring is essential for induction. As shown previously for other HSP inducers, including antiviral prostaglandins, sodium arsenite, cadmium, and hyperthermia itself (10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Amici C. Giorgi C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pica F.

Res. 1996; 29: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), 2-cyclopenten-1-one-induced HSP70 synthesis is associated with a selective inhibition of virus protein synthesis, suggesting a cytoprotective role of this protein during viral infection. These results open new perspectives in the search for novel HSP inducers, which could be utilized as cytoprotective and antiviral drugs.In the present report we have also identified the molecular structure of natural prostaglandins responsible for HSF1 activation. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins are physiologically present in body fluids and, apart from the antiviral activity, are known to affect cell proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in 8Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar and 21Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Samuelsson B. Ramwell P.W. Paoletti R. Folco G. Granström E.

Recently the PGJ metabolite 15-deoxy Δ12,14PGJ2, which is characterized by the presence of a cyclopentenone ring and activates HSF (33Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), has been shown to be the natural ligand for the adipocyte determination factor PPARγ, inducing adipocyte differentiation (34Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

The fact that cyclopentenone prostaglandins activate HSF suggests the possibility that the heat shock response could play a role in physiological processes controlled by prostaglandins. INTRODUCTIONHeat shock proteins (HSP) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinHSFheat shock transcription factorHSEheat shock elementPBSphosphate-buffered salineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHXcycloheximide. and molecular chaperones have been known for several years to protect cells against a wide variety of toxic conditions, including extreme temperatures, oxidative stress, virus infection, and the exposure to heavy metals or cytotoxic drugs (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). HSP induction is not only a signal for detection of physiological stress, but is utilized by the cells in the repair process following different types of injury, to prevent damage resulting from the accumulation of non-native proteins (2Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1990Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, several HSP are expressed during normal growth conditions and can be induced by biologically active molecules such as hemin (3Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and prostaglandins (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas others are expressed upon stress-activated regulation of transcriptional and translational switches. Induction requires the activation and translocation to the nucleus of a transregulatory protein, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF), which converts from a monomeric non-DNA-binding form to an oligomeric form that binds to specific promoter elements (HSE) located upstream of heat shock genes (6Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several HSFs have been identified in mammalian cells (6Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously that prostaglandins of the A and J type (PGAs and PGJs) were able to activate HSF and induce the synthesis of the 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) in a wide variety of mammalian cells (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Stress Proteins: Induction and Function. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar). Induction of HSP70 by prostaglandins requires the presence of a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring (cyclopentenone), which renders this portion of the molecule able to form Michael's adducts with cellular nucleophilics and to covalently bind to cysteine residues of proteins via a thioether bond (8Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar, 9Khan S.H. Sorof S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9401-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have also shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins possess a potent antiviral activity against RNA and DNA viruses in a wide variety of experimental models in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in 7Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Stress Proteins: Induction and Function. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 27-44Crossref Google Scholar and 10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In negative-strand RNA viruses the antiviral activity has been associated with the ability of cyclopentenone prostaglandins to induce HSP70 expression, and a role of this protein in the control of virus replication has been hypothesized (10Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Amici C. Giorgi C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We now report that the cyclopentenone ring structure itself, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, is able to activate HSF and selectively induce HSP70 expression and show that the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is the key structure for triggering HSF activation. We also show that induction of HSP70 is associated with inhibition of infectious virus production and viral protein synthesis in monkey kidney epithelial cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)."
https://openalex.org/W2042700662,"In hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type (HCHWA-D), a genetic variant (E22Q) of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulates predominantly in the small vessels of leptomeninges and cerebral cortex, leading to fatal strokes in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Aβ deposition in the neuropil occurs mainly in the form of preamyloid, Congo red negative deposits, while mature neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characteristically absent. A recent hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of AD states that Aβ extending to residues 42-43 (as opposed to shorter species) can seed amyloid formation and trigger the development of neuritic plaques followed by neuronal damage in AD. We characterized biochemically and immunohistochemically Aβ from three cases of HCHWA-D to determine its length in vascular and parenchymal deposits. Mass spectrometry of formic acid-soluble amyloid, purified by size-exclusion gel chromatography, showed that Aβ 1-40 and its carboxyl-terminal truncated derivatives were the predominant forms in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels. Aβ 1-42 was a minor component in these amyloid extracts. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies S40 and S42, specific for Aβ ending at Val-40 or Ala-42, respectively, were consistent with the biochemical data from vascular amyloid. In addition, parenchymal preamyloid lesions were specifically stained with S42 and were not labeled by S40, in agreement with the pattern reported for AD, Down's syndrome, and aged dogs. Our results suggest that in HCHWA-D the carboxyl-terminal Aβ heterogeneity is due to limited proteolysis in vivo. Moreover, they suggest that Aβ species ending at Ala-42 may not be critical for the seeding of amyloid formation and the development of AD-like neuritic changes. In hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type (HCHWA-D), a genetic variant (E22Q) of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulates predominantly in the small vessels of leptomeninges and cerebral cortex, leading to fatal strokes in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Aβ deposition in the neuropil occurs mainly in the form of preamyloid, Congo red negative deposits, while mature neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characteristically absent.

In addition, mutation of Gly121 causes a relative reversal in the selectivity of opsin for 11-cis-retinal over all-trans-retinal. It was suggested that Gly121 plays an important role in defining the 11-cis-retinal binding pocket of rhodopsin (Han, M., Lin, S. W., Smith, S. O., and Sakmar, T. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32330-32336). Here, we combined the mutant opsin G121L with second site replacements of four different amino acid residues on TM helix 6: Met257, Val258, Phe261, or Trp265. We show that the loss of function phenotypes of the G121L mutant described above can be partially reverted specifically by the mutation of Phe261, a residue highly conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors. For example, the double-replacement mutant G121L/F261A has spectral, chromophore-binding, and transducin-activating properties intermediate between those of G121L and rhodopsin. This rescue of the G121L defects did not occur with the other second site mutations tested. We conclude that specific portions of TM helices 3 and 6, which include Gly121 and Phe261, respectively, define the chromophore-binding pocket in rhodopsin. Finally, the results are placed in the context of a molecular graphics model of the TM domain of rhodopsin, which includes the retinal-binding pocket.

https://openalex.org/W2044395145,"Human growth hormone binds two receptor molecules and thereby induces signal transduction through receptor dimerization. At high concentrations, growth hormone acts as an antagonist because of a large difference in affinities at the respective binding sites. This antagonist action can be enhanced further by reducing binding in the low affinity binding site. A growth hormone antagonist mutant Gly-120 → Arg, has been crystallized with its receptor as a 1:1 complex and the crystal structure determined at 2.9 Å resolution. The 1:1 complex is remarkably similar to the native growth hormone-receptor 1:2 complex. A comparison between the two structures reveals only minimal differences in the conformations of the hormone or its receptor in the two complexes, including the angle between the two immunoglobulin-like domains of the receptor. Further, two symmetry-related 1:1 complexes in the crystal form a 2:2 complex with a large solvent inaccessible area between two receptor molecules. In addition, we present here a native human growth hormone-human growth hormone-binding protein 1:2 complex structure at 2.5 Å resolution. One important difference between our structure and the previously published crystal structure at 2.8 Å is revealed. Trp-104 in the receptor, a key residue in the hormone-receptor interaction, has an altered conformation in the low affinity site enabling a favorable hydrogen bond to be formed with Asp-116 of the hormone.

Human growth hormone (hGH) 1The abbreviations used are: hGHhuman growth hormonePRLprolactinhGHRhuman growth hormone receptorhGHbphuman growth hormone-binding proteinPRLRprolactin receptorFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factorGMRgranulocyte macrophage receptor. is the structurally best characterized member of a family of closely related hormones. hGH and its relatives, prolactin (PRL) and placental lactogen, regulate a wide variety of physiological processes, including growth and differentiation of muscle, bone, and cartilage cells. hGH binds to the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) and its soluble binding protein (hGHbp, consisting of the extracellular portion of the receptor). hGH also binds to the prolactin receptor (PRLR). In contrast, PRL binds only PRLR (for a recent review, see 1Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In plasma, hGH and hGHbp exist predominantly as a 1:1 complex, and it has been speculated that hGHbp can serve as a dynamic buffer for bound and free hGH (2Baumann G. Lowman H.B. Mercado M. Wells J.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1113-1118PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, variants of the hGHbp expressed in Escherichia coli can be used to study the extracellular events in the receptor dimerization (3Fuh G. Mulkerrin M.G. Bass S. McFarland N. Brochier M.

To provide a framework for structural and functional studies de Vos and co-workers (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar) crystallized and solved the structure of the hGH·hGHbp 1:2 complex in 1992 (hereafter referred to as the 1:2 complex). The crystal structure showed that two receptor molecules bind one hormone molecule (Fig. 1) by using virtually the same residues of the receptor but that hGH uses different residues in the two sites. The hGH site 1-hGHbp interaction is of considerably higher affinity than the hGH site 2-hGHbp interaction (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). hGHR dimerization is thus the likely event that activates intracellular signal transduction pathways where receptor-associated JAK kinases and phosphorylation-dependent STAT factors play critical roles (5Argetsinger L.S.

A mutant of hGH, where Gly-120 is replaced with an arginine residue (hereafter referred to as G120R), is an antagonist that binds to the hGHbp in an 1:1 stoichiometry in solution rather than the 1:2 stoichiometry observed in the native complex (7Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A 1:1 complex between hGH and hGHbp mimics the first step in the formation of the ternary complex which is a prerequisite for binding of the second hGHbp (8Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the G120R-hGHbp complex (hereafter referred to as the 1:1 complex) has been discussed in the literature (9Kossiakoff A.A. Somers W. Ultsch M. Andow K. Muller Y.A. de Vos A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar) even though a detailed description of this structure has not yet been published. To understand the structural basis for the formation of the G120R-receptor 1:1 complex we have expressed its constituents and determined its three-dimensional structure at 2.9 Å resolution using protein crystallographic methods. We compared our 2.5 Å structure of the 1:2 complex with that of the 1:1 complex, as well as our structure of the 1:2 complex with that reported previously by de Vos et al. (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fluka. All protein purification equipment and material were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. A structural gene encoding the extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and part of the cytoplasmic domain of the hGHR was amplified from commercially available adult liver cDNA (Clontech) using the polymerase chain reaction. The sequence amplified starts at nucleotide position 22 in the 5′-untranslated region and ends at position 1076 within the cytoplasmic domain according to the numbering of the sequence by Leung et al. (11Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The sequence was identical to that published by Leung et al. (11Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). A second round of polymerase chain reaction amplifications was performed using the pUC19-hGHR clone as template. The sequence amplified encodes the first 237 residues of the hGHbp (nucleotide positions 98-808). After digestion with MluI and XbaI the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into standard E. coli expression vectors. To simplify expression of wild type and mutant forms of hGH, a synthetic hGH gene was constructed. An MluI site overlapping the codon for PheI and an XhoI site at the 3′ end of the gene were incorporated into the sequence to allow E. coli expression of the gene. The gene was constructed from a set of overlapping oligonucleotides derived from the cDNA sequence published by Goeddel et al. (12Goeddel D.V. Heyneker H.L. Hozumi T. Arentzen R. Itakura K. Yansura D.G. Ross M.J. Miozzari G. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1979; 281: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), which were allowed to hybridize and were subsequently extended using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The gene was constructed in two segments that were then combined by standard cloning techniques and transferred into the expression vector. Wild type and mutant forms of hGH were expressed in E. coli using standard methods. Periplasmic proteins were released from the cells by a freeze-thaw procedure and thereafter extracted in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, containing 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The hGH was purified in a two-step process. First the periplasmic extract was separated on a Mono Q HR 10/10 ion exchange column using the FPLC system in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, with a linear gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl. Relevant fractions were pooled and adjusted to 0.5 M Na2SO4 and subsequently applied to a phenyl-Superose HR 10/10 column equilibrated with 30 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.5% acetonitrile. Unbound proteins were washed away with a linear gradient of 0.5-0 M Na2SO4 and 0.5-5% acetonitrile. hGH-containing fractions were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mM NH4CO3, pH 8.0, using a Sephadex G-25 column. hGHbp was produced in E. coli essentially as described in the literature (3Fuh G. Mulkerrin M.G. Bass S. McFarland N. Brochier M. Bourell J.H. Light D.R. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3111-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic proteins were released as described above. The hGHbp was purified using an affinity chromatography procedure. The periplasmic extract was incubated with hGH-Sepharose Fast Flow gel in a batch procedure for 1 h at 4°C. Unbound proteins were washed away with 20 gel volumes of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. The washed gel was thereafter packed into a XK50 column and mounted on a FPLC system, and bound hGHbp was eluted using 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, with 4 M MgCl2. The hGHbp material was thereafter desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column into 1 × phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. The hGHbp degrades easily in the NH2-terminal region of the molecule. To obtain a homogeneous preparation of full-length material for crystallization, a final FPLC purification step was added using a Mono Q HR 10/10 ion exchange column. The protein was applied to the column in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 20 mM RbCl, pH 8.5, and separated from free forms of the constituents with a linear gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl. Relevant fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. Approximately correct molar amounts of the constituents of the G120R·hGHbp 1:1 complex and the hGH·hGHbp 1:2 complex were preformed by a short incubation at pH 7.5 in 20 mM Tris with 100 mM NaCl. The complex was concentrated to approximately 2 mg/ml before separation from noncomplexed proteins on a prepacked Hiload XK 26/60 Superdex 75 column. The relevant peaks were collected and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, and thereafter shock-frozen in 100-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen. The protein complexes were thereafter stored at −85°C prior to use in the crystallization experiments. The 1:1 complex was crystallized by vapor diffusion. Three μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 3 μl of 1.6 M LiSO4 and 50 mM Bis-Tris at pH 6.25-6.75 in a sealed tissue culture 24-well plate (Falcon). The crystallization droplets were equilibrated at 18°C with 1 ml of the mother liquor for 2-3 weeks to obtain optimal diffraction quality crystals. Crystals were 0.5 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm in size and diffracted to at least 2.9 Å with a conventional x-ray source. The 1:2 complex was crystallized under conditions similar to those for the 1:1 complex. To grow large crystals (1.2 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm) diffracting to 2.5 Å resolution using a conventional x-ray source, an addition of polyethylene glycol 500:dimethyl ether was essential. The best diffracting crystals were obtained by adding 1 μl of mother liquor at pH 6.25 with 46% (v/v) of a saturated LiSO4 solution and 2% polyethylene glycol 500:dimethyl ether (w/v) to 5 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) and thereafter incubating the mixture at 18°C for 1-2 weeks. To stabilize the crystals prior to x-ray diffraction data collection, the crystals were soaked in a 50% (v/v) saturated LiSO4 solution, 0.1 M MES, pH 5.25, and 0.5 mM MgCl2. All data were collected using a MAR image plate system. The data were processed with MOSFLM (13CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project 4, (1994) Acta Crystallogr., D50, 760–763.Google Scholar) using the refix algorithm (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar) for indexing and point group determination and were then further reduced and scaled using the CCP4 program package (13CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project 4, (1994) Acta Crystallogr., D50, 760–763.Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab At the time this work was initiated, only the Cα coordinates of the 1:2 complex solved by de Vos and co-workers (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar) were available from the Brookhaven PDB data bank (PDB entry 2hhr). Because of initial concern about the space group, we used a molecular replacement search procedure using the program AMORE (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The highest scoring solution in the resolution interval 8-4 Å was found in space group P21212 with one 1:2 complex molecule in the asymmetric unit. Since this confirmed that our LiSO4:polyethylene glycol-grown crystals were virtually isomorphous to the crystals grown by Ultsch et al. (16Ultsch M. de Vos A. Kossiakoff A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a polyalanine model of this backbone structure was generated, using the data base in O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and used as a starting model in the refinement of the structure. A rigid body refinement in X-plor (18Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar) preceded a careful cyclic process of model building in O introducing only clearly visible side chains followed by POWELL minimizations in X-plor. This cyclic procedure was repeated until approximately 80% of the side chains were visible at 3.0 Å resolution. At this stage the first simulated annealing run (19Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1989; A45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar) was performed using a slow cooling protocol from 2,500 to 300 K in 50-ps steps including data between 15 and 2.8 Å. An initial R value of 36.5% dropped to 22.1% (free R 31.5%) after 20 cycles of model building and X-plor refinement. Using this 2.8 Å model, all data between 10 and 2.5 Å were used in a process similar to the initial minimization and model building to create a refined model with a final R value of 21.3% (free R 30.1%) after B value refinement. Solvent molecules were introduced into FoFc densities above 3.0 σ. After three cycles, 312 solvent molecules had been introduced. A final POWELL minimization followed by a dynamics run from 3,000 to 300 K in 50-ps steps including data between 10 and 2.5 Å was performed. B value refinement was added as the final step, and solvent molecules with high temperature factors (>55 Å2) or absent 2FoFc electron densities at 1.0 σ cutoff were removed. The free R value (20Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) was used to validate the progress of the entire refinement. The final model consists of residues 1-147, 154-190 of hGH; 32-52, 63-235 of hGHbp 1; and 32-54, 62-72, 78-236 of hGHbp 2 as well as 283 solvent molecules. The R factor of this model is 19.1% (free R 28.3%), and the quality of the model has been assessed using PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Solvent-accessible areas were calculated using the program DSSP (22Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). For the 1:1 complex, our refined structure of the 1:2 complex, depleted of its low affinity receptor and solvent molecules, was used as a search molecule using the program AMORE. Data collected could be reduced in point group P422, and the highest scoring solution in the resolution interval 8-4 Å was found in the space group P43212 with one 1:1 complex molecule in the asymmetric unit. Using data between 15 and 3.0 Å, the initial R value of 36.1% dropped to 29.1% (free R 35.1%) upon rigid body refinement and POWELL minimization in X-plor. Correction for changed main and side chain conformations in the NH2 terminus of hGH and the loop 75-79 in hGHbp as well as introduction of an arginine side chain at position 120 in G120R lowered the R value to 26.3% (free R 33.2%) after a POWELL minimization. At this stage the first simulated annealing run was performed using a slow cooling protocol from 2,500 to 300 K in 50-ps steps, followed by manual model building in O and POWELL minimizations in a cyclic procedure that produced a final model with an R value of 21.3% (free R 31.2%) using data between 8 and 2.9 Å. The final model consists of the residues 1-146, 155-191 of G120R and residues 31-53 and 63-237 of hGHbp. The quality of the model has been assessed using PROCHECK. After we had refined the structure, de Vos and co-workers (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar) released their 2.8 Å structure with side chains to the Brookhaven PDB data bank (PDB entry 3hhr). A comparison of this structure with ours revealed that the two models were essentially identical, although differences with functional importance are observed in the site 2 hGH-receptor interaction. The overall structure of the 1:2 complex has been described thoroughly in several publications (4de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 23Wells J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Wells J.A. de Vos A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), thus we will discuss only briefly the general structural features of hGH and hGHbp. However, the major differences between our 1:2 structure and the previously published one will be discussed in detail. The two extracellular domains (domain 1 consisting of residues 1-123 and domain 2 of residues 128-234 in hGHbp) of hGHbp have topologies similar to the immunoglobulin fold. Regions in hGHbp having poorly defined or absent electron densities are residues 1-31, 50-62, 72-78, and 234-237. The hGH single domain four-helix bundle has the two first helices parallel to each other and antiparallel to the last two. This variant of a helix bundle was first seen in porcine growth hormone (25Abdel-Meguid S.S. Shieh H.S. Smith W.W. Dayringer H.E. Violand B.N. Bentle L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6434-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) but has later been observed in a variety of other cytokines (for review, see 24Wells J.A. de Vos A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). hGH binds at the connecting region between the two domains of the receptor. The area buried between hGH site 1 and hGHbp (2,700 Å2) is considerably larger than that observed in the hGH site 2-hGHbp interaction (1,500 Å2). This difference is compensated for by the additional surface that is buried between the two COOH-terminal domains of the receptors (900 Å2) (Table II). Regions in hGH with poor degree of order are residues 39-45 and 128-147. Residues 148-153 and 191 completely lack electron density.Table IISolvent accessibility for the free components and for the 1:2 complex in Å2, calculated using the program DSSP (22Kabsch W. Sander C.

Differences between the two 1:2 complex structures involve mainly residues in the low affinity site between hGH and hGHbp. The most important difference in this area is that Trp-104 in hGHbp has adapted a conformation different from that seen in the 2.8 Å structure (Fig. 2). We find that Trp-104 in this conformation enables the Nϵ1 of the indol ring to form a favorable hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) to the Oδ1 of Asp-116 of hGH. As a test case, we used the 3hhr coordinates and refined this model with our data. Pronounced FoFc densities around Trp-104 clearly showed that our interpretation of the orientation of this key residue in the low affinity site was correct. In addition, our Trp-104 orientation is very close to the most favorable rotamer of tryptophans according to the data base in O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The receptor surface area interacting with the hGH high affinity site 1 differs from the one seen in the lower affinity site 2 when structurally aligned mainly due to the different conformations of Trp-104 of the receptor (Fig. 3). As seen in Table III, the greater part of interacting residues from hGH in site 1 resides in the connecting loop between helix 1 and 2 (residues 41-68) and from the COOH-terminal part of helix 4 (residues 167-175). Site 2 interactions are mainly observed in the NH2 terminus (residues 1-16) and in helix 3 (residues 103-119) of hGH.Table IIIHydrogen bonds in the 1:2 complex between hGH and hGHbp in site 1 and 2 as well as in the hGHbp interface (≤3.2 Å) from the program CONTACT in the CCP4 program package(13CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project 4, (1994) Acta Crystallogr., D50, 760–763.Google Scholar)hGH-hGHbp interactions, high affinity sitehGHhGHbpDistance (Å)Lys-41NζGlu-127Oϵ22.9Gln-46Nϵ2Glu-120Oϵ23.2Ser-51OγArg-71NH13.0Glu-56Oϵ2Cys-53N2.9Glu-56Oϵ2Arg-71NH22.9Ser-62OIle-103N2.8Arg-64NϵAsp-164Oδ22.8Arg-64NH2Asp-164Oδ22.9Arg-167NH2Glu-127Oϵ13.2Lys-168NζTrp-104O2.6hGH-hGHbp interactions, low affinity sitehGHhGHbpDistance (Å)Asn-12Oδ1Arg-43NH22.4Arg-16NH2Glu-44Oϵ23.0Tyr-103OHAla-165O2.8Asp-116Oδ1Trp-104Nϵ12.9Glu-119Oϵ2Ser-102Oγ)2.6 Open table in a new tab Members of the cytokine receptor family have a consensus WSXWS sequence (WS motif) in the extracellular domain. In interleukin-2, erythropoietin, and PRLRs, alteration of the WS sequence disrupts ligand binding and receptor signaling (26Baumgartner J.W. Wells C.A. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29094-29101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In hGHbp, the WS sequence analogous motif is present in domain 2 involving the residues Lys-179, Trp-186, Arg-211, Phe-225, Arg-213, Tyr-222 and Lys-215 (Fig. 4). Since domain 2 lacks intramolecular disulfide bridges, this motif might serve to stabilize this domain. The initial electron density map of the 1:1 complex was of very good quality despite the relatively low resolution of the data. The overall similarity of the 1:1 complex to the 1:2 complex depleted of the low affinity receptor is very high with a root mean square difference of 0.81 Å comparing 368 Cα atoms. The majority of the side chains as well as the loop regions are remarkably similar to the 1:2 complex depleted of the receptor binding to hGH site 2. The angle between the two domains in hGHbp is virtually identical to that seen in the 1:2 complex, indicating that the low affinity site interaction between hGH and hGHbp does not induce any domain movements in the hGH site 1 binding receptor. One of the more striking differences compared with the 1:2 complex is that the NH2 terminus of the hormone, residues 1-5, extends out from the hormone with the side chain of Phe-1 packing against a hydrophobic motif around the hGHbp residues Trp-76 and Trp-80 of a symmetry-related molecule. From residue Leu-6 in the hormone, the main chain is very similar to the 1:2 complex. The exposed surfaces that are normally buried between the two receptors and the low affinity site in hGH form extensive interactions with symmetry-related molecules. In fact, the interactions are so extensive that one could argue that a 2:2 complex with two binding proteins and two hormone molecules has been formed across a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 5). The total area of the four molecules in the “2:2 complex” not accessible to solvents compared with the free components is approximately 7,300 Å2. Approximately 2,000 Å2 is buried in hormone-receptor or receptor-receptor interactions compared with approximately 2,400 Å2 in the 1:2 complex, excluding the high affinity sites from the calculations. Arg-8 in the NH2-terminal part of helix 1 of the hormone has adapted a conformation similar to the one we see in our 1:2 complex, differing from the 3hhr structure. Another residue in site 2 of hGH, Asn-12, which in the 1:2 complex structure is within hydrogen bond distance to Asp-126 and Arg-43 of the low affinity receptor, now is within favorable hydrogen bond distance and angle to the main chain oxygen of Pro-234 of the 2:2 complex thus stabilizing the COOH-terminal residues in hGHbp. Most other changes of side and main chain conformations are due to minor crystal packing effects and are therefore not discussed in any detail because of the relatively low resolution of the data. When the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the 1:2 complex structure was published in 1992, a new understanding of the events involved in protein-protein interactions was obtained. A protein complex that utilized virtually the same residues in both receptor sites was shown to interact with completely different residues in the hormone. The 1:2 complex structure as well as other studies indicated that a sequential dimerization would be sufficient for signal transduction. The wild type hGH as well as the hGH single site mutant Gly-120 → Arg in complex with its soluble binding protein crystallize under similar conditions. Wild type hGH and the hGHbp crystallize as a 1:2 complex and the G120R and hGHbp as a 1:1 complex. The crystal structure of the 1:1 complex shows, at least at high protein concentrations, that a 2:2 complex can be formed with an altered arrangement of the interface of two binding proteins. It is interesting to speculate whether such a 2:2 complex also could be biologically active, if the geometry of the receptors with respect to the mobility in the membrane allows it to be formed. A recent report by Harding et al. (27Harding P.A. Wang X. Okada S. Chen W.Y. Wan W. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6708-6712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) most likely show that G120R can form 2:2 complexes with the porcine GH receptor. However, the significance of this observation remains to be shown with similar experiments using the hGHR. It has become generally accepted that GH receptors and PRL receptors are activated by dimerization. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the hGHR can induce signal transduction, whereas their monovalent fragments could not. This indicates that the dimerization itself, without structural constraints such as domain movements within the receptor molecule, is sufficient for signal transduction (7Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of any structural information of the unliganded receptor one can only speculate on this matter. A mutant erythropoietin receptor (Arg-129 → Cys) is constitutively active when disulfide-linked homodimers are formed in the extracellular domain (28Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), suggesting that the wild type erythropoietin receptor is activated by ligand-induced homodimerization without structural constraints induced by the hormone. The high affinity receptor for the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a heterodimer composed of an α-receptor and a β-receptor (GMR-αβ). The GM-CSF·GMR-αβ complex is biologically active. A mutant in GM-CSF, Glu-21 → Ala, inhibits high affinity binding, leaving low affinity binding unaffected. Despite near to wild type biological response in cell assays, no detectable binding interaction of this mutant with GMR-β in the context of GMR-αβ was observed. This clearly demonstrated that GM-CSF receptor activation can occur independently of high affinity binding (29Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it was shown recently that the PRLR becomes constitutively active when the membrane proximal domain is deleted from the extracellular part of the receptor, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (30Gourdu I. Gabou L. Paly J. Kermabon A.Y. Belair L. Djiane J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 45-56PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these properties discussed above has so far been shown for the hGHR. However, the extracellular part of the hGHR contains one unpaired cysteine at position 241, as expected in close proximity to the membrane, which possibly could be involved in covalent linkage of hGHR dimers (31Frank S.J. Gilliland G. van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The formation of such a disulfide bridge might be an important prerequisite for efficient signal transduction via extracellular receptor dimerization. The single substitution Gly-120 → Arg in hGH creates a powerful hGH antagonist at moderate levels (20 nM) whereas wild type hGH exhibits antagonist action at much higher concentrations (2 μM). Further, G120R has been shown to act as an antagonist on human PRLR (32Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also to cause rodent PRLR-mediated proliferation of Nb-2 cells in the presence of Zn2+ (10 μM) (33Dattani M.T. Hindmarsch P.C. Brook C.G.D. Robinson I.C.A.F. Kopchick J.J. Marshall N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9222-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Zn2+ as a prerequisite for proliferation could possibly be explained with metal ion restoration of the ternary complex of hGH·PRLR. Crystals of the complex of wild type hGH·PRLR were initially expected to contain a 1:2 complex, but high performance liquid chromatography purification of the complex showed it to consist of stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of hormone and receptor (34Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because of better crystal growth-promoting properties the G120R mutant was used in the structural analysis. However, a crystal structure of a 1:2 complex of hGH·hPRLR would be of extreme interest for validation of the biological significance of the 1:2 complex of hGH·hGHbp. The 1:1 complex is remarkably similar to a 1:2 complex depleted of its low affinity receptor with no large domain shifts. The majority of side chain conformations and the main chain loop regions are close to identical to the 1:2 complex depleted of its site 2 binding receptor. The only main chain change clearly visible in the hGHbp is that the loop region 71-79 of the hGHbp is ordered because of symmetry molecule interactions with the hGH NH2 terminus. Because of this interaction the five NH2-terminal residues in hGH which normally are bound in site 2 interactions have an altered conformation and now extend out from the hormone. One could argue that this region in the absence of low affinity site interactions is readily available to bind to target receptors and thus might play a key role in hGH-mediated signal transduction. Thirty-one residues in the NH2 terminus of hGHbp are completely lacking electron density in both the 1:2 as well as in the 1:1 complex. The function of the NH2 terminus of the receptor is not understood, but a potential N-linked glycosylation site in this region (Asn-26) could be important for both function and stability. The Gly-120 → Arg substitution of hGH resides in a sequence motif consisting of residues of 111-129. The substitution of these residues to the corresponding residues in hPRL decreases activity more than 100-fold (EC50mut/EC50wt). A similar response is seen with a truncated variant of hGH lacking residues 1-8. Single site alanine mutations within these motifs revealed residues Phe-1, Ile-4, Leu-6, Arg-8, and Asp-116 as critical residues in the dimerization event upon site 2 binding with the Ile-4 → Ala as the single most critical mutation (8Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). As shown in this study, the most striking difference between the two independently refined 1:2 complex structures is the orientation of the indol ring of Trp-104 in the low affinity receptor, enabling a favorable hydrogen bond to be formed with Asp-116 in the hormone, in addition to its hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the functional importance of the observed interaction between Asp-116 in hGH and Trp-104 of the receptor correlates well with mutational data. The dramatic effect of the Gly-120 → Arg substitution in hGH can, at least partly, be explained by sterical hindrance of the hGH Asp-116-hGHbp Trp-104 interaction in addition to disruption of other side and main chain conformations in this area (Fig. 6). In another study, the effects of mutants of hGH were studied with respect to tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation of intracellular proteins and promotion of growth in mice. G120R was shown to be a potent hGH antagonist, but surprisingly it was also observed that the hGH mutant Ile-4 → Ala increased the amount of intracellular phosphorylation as well as exhibited full growth promoting activity (35Chen W. Chen N. Yun J. Wagner T. Kopchick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15892-15897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly in contrast to the predicted properties of this mutant hGH. The 1:1 complex of G120R·hGHbp mimics the first step in a dimerization process required for intracellular signal transduction. The small differences between the 1:1 complex and the 1:2 complex depleted of its site 2 binding hGHbp would suggest that conformational changes in the high affinity site upon binding of the second receptor are not required for efficient signal transduction. However, high resolution structures of the free and solvated forms of hGH and hGHbp will contribute significantly to our understanding of the events involved in binding of the hormone to its receptor as well as to the understanding of the requirements for efficient signal transduction in cells.

The photoreactive chromophore of rhodopsin is 11-cis-retinal, which is covalently bound in the interior of the protein as a protonated Schiff base. Photoisomerization of retinal causes receptor activation.

In order to understand the mechanisms of spectral tuning and receptor photoactivation in the visual pigments, it is vital to gain additional information about the specific protein-protein and chromophore-protein contacts that define the chromophore-binding pocket in the ground state and how these contacts are affected by chromophore isomerization. There have been several models for how the retinal-protonated Schiff base interacts with Glu113 on TM helix 3 (16Birge R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 293-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 17Gat Y. Sheves M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3772-3773Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Han M. DeDecker B.S. Smith S.O.

In the most recent model, NMR constraints were used to position the chromophore in the interior of rhodopsin, which resulted in retinal situated between TM helices 3 and 6 with the β-ionone ring oriented toward TM helix 5 (19Han M.

This binding site model suggests close interactions of the retinal with Gly121, which is strictly conserved in all visual pigments (21Alkorta I. Du P.

We show that site-directed mutation of Gly121 causes a decrease in thermal stability of the resulting pigment and an increase in reactivity with hydroxylamine. In addition, the size of the residue substituted at position 121 correlates remarkably well to the degree of blue-shift in the λmax value of the pigment. Furthermore, replacement of Gly121 results in a relative change of opsin selectivity for reconstitution with 11-cis-retinal over all-trans-retinal. In the following article (22Han M. Lin S.W.

All TM helix 3 mutant genes were generated by substituting a 63-base pair SpeI-RsrII restriction fragment with a synthetic duplex containing the desired codon alteration. The nucleotide sequences of all cloned synthetic duplexes were confirmed by the chain terminator method for DNA sequencing of purified plasmid DNA using [35S]dATPαS. Opsin genes were expressed in COS-1 cells as described previously (23Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

The cells were harvested and treated either with 11-cis-retinal followed by pigment purification in dodecyl maltoside as described (4Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) or were subjected to membrane preparation as described without chromophore regeneration (29Carruthers C.J.L. Unson C.G. Kim H.N.

The pellet of COS cell membranes from a single 10-cm plate was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer and stored at −80°C in 80-μl aliquots. Spectroscopy was performed on a λ-19 Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer at 25°C on purified samples unless otherwise specified. The molar extinction coefficient (ϵ) of each mutant was determined by an acid denaturation method (4Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Each ϵ value was calculated from the formula, ϵ = (A/ARh)(A440Rh/A440)ϵRh, where A was the absorbance at the λmax value, A440 was the absorbance at 440 nm after acid denaturation, and ϵRh was the molar extinction of rhodopsin (42.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1). The spectral ratio, which is used as a measure of pigment yield and stability, is defined as A280 divided by A at the visible λmax value after correction for any difference of the mutant pigment ϵ value as described above. A radionucleotide filter-binding assay, which monitors the light-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange by transducin, was carried out at 10°C as described previously (30Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9400-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For pigment samples purified in dodecyl maltoside, pigment concentration was determined before the assay by visible spectroscopy according to the ϵ values given in Table I., Table II.. The assay mixture consisted of 4 μM transducin, 3.0 nM purified pigment, and 20 μM [35S]GTPγS in 50 μl of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The activity assays of mutant opsins in COS cell membranes were performed as follows. Membrane aliquots were thawed at room temperature, and 1 μl of 11-cis-retinal (7.5 mM) or all-trans-retinal (4.7 mM) ethanolic solution was incubated with 30 μl of membrane suspension in the dark at room temperature for 1 h before assaying at room temperature. Opsin activity refers to any basal activity of a mutant in the absence of chromophore. Light activity refers to light-dependent transducin activation caused by samples incubated with 11-cis-retinal. All-trans-retinal activity refers to the light-independent transducin activation caused by opsin samples incubated with all-trans-retinal.Table I.Spectral properties of the Gly121 mutant pigmentsPigmentλmaxεaMolar extinction coefficient (ε) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Spectral ratiobSpectral ratio is the ratio between the protein absorption and the pigment absorption as determined by the formulaA280/[email protected]λmax×ε/εRh.Hydroxylamine reactivitycDecay of visible absorbance in the presence of 25 mM hydroxylamine at 20°C was determined (Fig. 4).

Open table in a new tab The rates of hydroxylamine reaction with mutant pigments were determined in darkness at pH 7.0 as described previously (31Zvyaga T.A. Min K.C. Beck M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1993,1994; 268: 4661-4667Google Scholar). The conditions for the reaction at 20°C were 25 mM hydroxylamine, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside. The regeneration time courses of mutant G121L with 11-cis-retinal or all-trans-retinal in COS cell membranes was measured by monitoring the initial rate of transducin activation at various periods after the addition of retinal to membrane aliquots. Retinal, 11-cis or all-trans (2 μl of 25 μM ethanolic solution), was mixed with 60 μl of COS cell membrane suspension containing mutant opsin G121L in darkness and incubated at room temperature. At various times after retinal addition, aliquots (5 μl) were removed and immediately assayed by the filter-binding method to determine transducin activity. Samples regenerated with 11-cis-retinal were illuminated to start the reaction. Samples regenerated with all-trans-retinal were assayed under dim red light. The initial rate (pmol of GTPγS bound per min) of the transducin activation determined from a linear regression analysis was then plotted as a function of the time of incubation. Activities at time equals 0 were opsin activity without added chromophore. The experimental data were fitted by an exponential-rise function of the form, y = a (1 − exp(−bx)) + c. Mutant opsin genes were prepared with single amino acid replacements at one of three sites in TM helix 3 of bovine rhodopsin, Gly114, Ala117, and Gly121 (Fig. 1). Each of the mutant opsin genes was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Each expressed opsin was regenerated with the 11-cis-retinal chromophore, and the mutant pigment was purified after solubilization with dodecyl maltoside detergent according to an established immunoaffinity absorption procedure (4Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 31Zvyaga T.A. Min K.C. Beck M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

The set of Gly121 mutants studied in detail included G121A, G121S, G121T, G121V, G121I, G121L, and G121W. The UV-visible spectrum of each of these mutants after purification in dodecyl maltoside is shown in Fig. 2. The spectral properties, including λmax value, molar extinction coefficient (ϵ), and spectral ratio (absorbance at 280 nm versus absorbance at the visible λmax value), were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy for each purified mutant. The results of the spectral properties of the Gly121 mutants are summarized in Table I. Replacement of Gly121 by alanine or serine had little effect on the spectral properties of the resulting mutants when compared with those of rhodopsin. Mutant pigment G121T displayed a blue-shifted λmax value (483 nm) and an increased spectral ratio. The λmax value of G121V was further blue-shifted to 477 nm. The introduction of a residue with a larger side chain at position Gly121 had dramatic effects on both λmax values and spectral ratios. The λmax values of both G121I and G121L were blue-shifted to 475 nm. In the G121I and G121W spectra shown in Fig. 2, the absorbance at 380 nm originated from free retinal since acid treatment did not shift the 380 nm peak to 440 nm (not shown). The G121W mutant did not form a stable pigment under the conditions of the purification. However, the λmax value of mutant G121W can be inferred to be 461 nm as described in Table I. The blue shift of the visible λmax values induced by mutation at the 121-position was linearly correlated with the volume of the side chain introduced (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The λmax value of each Gly121 mutant is plotted in wave numbers as a function of the volume of the amino acid residue introduced. There is an apparent linear correlation between the λmax values of the Gly121 mutant pigments expressed in wave numbers and the volumes of the residues introduced. The λmax value of mutant G121W was determined as described in Table I. The average volume values and the horizontal error bars representing standard deviations are from Chothia (64Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The standard errors of the measured λmax values are smaller than the symbols on this scale. For the regression line shown, the correlation coefficient is 0.95, and the slope is 10.9 cm−1/Å3, which corresponds to 31 cal/mol/Å3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of the Gly121 mutant opsins except G121W were expressed in transiently transfected COS cells at approximately the same levels as rhodopsin. G121W expression was about 70 ± 4% of that of rhodopsin as judged by the A280 value of immunoaffinity purified material from COS cells solubilized in dodecyl maltoside. Sets of mutants with single amino acid replacements at Gly114 or Ala117 were prepared as controls for the Gly121 mutants. Both Gly114 and Ala117 are predicted to be on the same helical face and are two and one helix turns toward the intradiscal end of TM helix 3, respectively (Fig. 1B). These residues should also be in close proximity to the retinal chromophore. In fact, a carboxylic acid group replacement at position 117 has been shown to be able to substitute for the Schiff base counterion at position Glu113 (31Zvyaga T.A. Min K.C. Beck M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1993,1994; 268: 4661-4667Google Scholar, 33Zhukovsky E.A. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10400-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of the set of Gly114 mutants that included G114A, G114V, G114I, G114M, and G114W, only G114A was able to form a pigment in dodecyl maltoside. Any replacement with an amino acid side chain larger than the methyl group of alanine markedly decreased the level of expression in COS cells. In this context, it should be noted that rhodopsin mutation G114D has been reported to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (34Millán J.M. Fuchs S. Paricio N. Wedemann H. Gal A. Nájera C. Prieto F. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1995; 9: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa phenotypes are thought to be associated with defective intracellular transport of the mutant opsin (35Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 36Sung C.-H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) Each of the Ala117 single replacement mutants, which included A117G, A117V, A117I, A117M, and A117W, formed a stable pigment with a spectral ratio similar to that of rhodopsin prepared under identical conditions. The λmax values of these mutants were also close to 500 nm, ranging from a slight blue shift to 496 nm for A117G to a slight red shift to 504 nm for A117W (Table II). Whereas bulky side chain replacements were not well tolerated at positions 114 or 121, at position 117 even the replacement of Ala117 by a tryptophan resulted in a stable pigment. The Schiff base in rhodopsin is remarkably stable in the presence of hydroxylamine in darkness but reacts rapidly upon illumination. Amino acid replacements that affect the Schiff base environment have been shown to decrease the stability of mutant pigments in the presence of hydroxylamine (4Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 28Zvyaga T.A. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9753-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, mutant pigment E113Q was shown to react with hydroxylamine even in the dark (4Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Each of the TM helix 3 mutant pigments described above was treated with hydroxylamine in darkness to probe Schiff base stability (Fig. 4). Rhodopsin did not react with hydroxylamine under the conditions of the experiment during 60 min in the dark. Each of the Gly121 mutant pigments reacted with hydroxylamine in the dark. However, the relative reactivity among the mutant pigments varied substantially. An inverse correlation between residue size at position 121 and reactivity is shown in Fig. 4, G121A was moderately reactive, whereas G121V reacted rapidly. Mutant pigment G121I reacted too rapidly to measure accurately. The experimental data points fit well to a single-exponential decay function. According to these values, mutant pigment G121L reacted with hydroxylamine at least 100-fold more rapidly than rhodopsin. Mutant pigment G121I was even more reactive than G121L. The remaining Gly121 mutant pigments displayed intermediate reactivities that generally increased as the size of the residue at position 121 increased from alanine to leucine. The half-time of decay (t1/2) values for each Gly121 mutant are presented in Table I. The ability of each of the Gly121 mutants to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange by transducin was assayed under a variety of conditions using a filter-binding assay method (30Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9400-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each mutant pigment reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal and purified in dodecyl maltoside detergent, light-dependent transducin activity was measured in solution. The activity values are presented in Table III relative to that of rhodopsin prepared and assayed in parallel. The level of light-dependent activity in Table III represents the value normalized for the amount of pigment based on visible spectroscopy and molar extinction as presented in Table I. Three of the mutant pigments were able to activate transducin at an approximately normal level. Three mutant pigments were as much as 15% defective in light-dependent transducin-activating ability in solution, G121S, G121T, and G121V.Table III.Transducin activation by Gly121 mutant pigmentsMembranesDodecyl maltoside, 11-cis-retinal (light)OpsinAll-trans-retinal11-cis-retinal (light)%aThe opsin and all-trans activities, which were measured in COS cell membrane preparations at room temperature, are presented as percentage of the activity of each mutant measured in aliquot of the same preparations after incubation with 11-cis-retinal and illumination.

https://openalex.org/W2034526004,"The carboxyl-terminal region of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump isoform 4b contains two autoinhibitory regions which keep the pump inactive in the absence of activators such as calmodulin. One of these regions is approximately coterminous with the calmodulin-binding domain, while the second region is downstream (Verma, A. K., Enyedi, A., Filoteo, A. G., and Penniston, J. T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1687-1691). The carboxyl-terminal region has also been identified as the site for phosphorylation of this isoform by protein kinase C (Wang, K. K. W., Wright, L. C., Machan, C. L., Allen, B. G., Conigrave, A. D., and Roufogalis, B. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9078-9085). Using constructs lacking various numbers of residues at the carboxyl terminus, we studied the degree of phosphorylation by protein kinase C and the resultant activation of Ca2+ transport. The results showed that the most specific and easy phosphorylation occurred in a region of about 20 residues which is downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain, and that the downstream inhibitory domain had also about the same size and location. Phosphorylation partially activated the pump by removing only the inhibition due to this region. Binding of calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding domain activated the pump more fully by removing the inhibition due to both regions, regardless of the state of phosphorylation at the downstream inhibitory region.

https://openalex.org/W1968363517,"Crk proteins are Src homology (SH) 2/SH3-containing adapter proteins that can mediate the formation of signaling complexes. We show that engaging the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) on the RAMOS B cell line caused both Crk-L and Crk II to associate with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We identified two of these phosphoproteins as Cas and Cbl and showed that both bound to the Crk SH2 domain after BCR engagement. BCR ligation also increased the amount of Crk proteins in the particulate fraction of the cells and induced the formation of Crk·Cas and Crk·Cbl complexes in the particulate fraction. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated Cas and Cbl creates binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and recruits Crk complexes to cellular membranes. Thus, Crk proteins may participate in BCR signaling by using their SH2 domains to direct the interactions and subcellular localization of proteins that bind to their SH3 domains. In RAMOS cells, we found that the SH3 domains of Crk-L and Crk II bound C3G. Since C3G activates Rap, a negative regulator of the Ras pathway, Crk proteins may participate in regulation of Ras signaling by the BCR. Crk proteins are Src homology (SH) 2/SH3-containing adapter proteins that can mediate the formation of signaling complexes. We show that engaging the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) on the RAMOS B cell line caused both Crk-L and Crk II to associate with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We identified two of these phosphoproteins as Cas and Cbl and showed that both bound to the Crk SH2 domain after BCR engagement. BCR ligation also increased the amount of Crk proteins in the particulate fraction of the cells and induced the formation of Crk·Cas and Crk·Cbl complexes in the particulate fraction. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated Cas and Cbl creates binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and recruits Crk complexes to cellular membranes. Thus, Crk proteins may participate in BCR signaling by using their SH2 domains to direct the interactions and subcellular localization of proteins that bind to their SH3 domains. In RAMOS cells, we found that the SH3 domains of Crk-L and Crk II bound C3G.

https://openalex.org/W2105266773,"Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) are essential cofactors for the lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains by acidic exohydrolases. SAP-A, -B, -C, and -D derive from proteolysis of a 73-kDa glycoprotein, the SAP precursor. In the present publication, we studied the intracellular transport and the endocytosis of SAP precursor in human skin fibroblasts. Our data indicate that SAP precursor bears phosphate residues on noncomplex carbohydrate chains linked to the SAP-C and the SAP-D domain and sulfate residues on complex carbohydrate chains located within the SAP-A, -C, and possibly the SAP-D domain. Treatment of fibroblasts with either bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine indicates that proteolytic cleavage of SAP precursor begins as early as in the late endosomes. To determine whether targeting of SAP precursor depends on mannose 6-phosphate residues, we analyzed the processing of SAP precursor in I-cell disease fibroblasts. In these cells nearly normal amounts of newly synthesized SAP-C were found, although secretion of SAP precursor was enhanced 2-3-fold. Moreover, SAP-C could be localized to lysosomal structures by indirect immunofluorescence in normal and in I-cell disease fibroblasts. Mannose 6-phosphate was not found to interfere significantly with endocytosis of SAP precursor. Normal fibroblasts internalized SAP precursor secreted from I-cells nearly as efficiently as the protein secreted from normal cells. To our surprise, deglycosylated SAP precursor was taken up by mannose 6-phosphate receptor double knock out mouse fibroblasts more efficiently than the glycosylated protein. We propose that intracellular targeting of SAP precursor to lysosomes is only partially dependent on mannose 6-phosphate residues, whereas its endocytosis occurs in a carbohydrate-independent manner.

Four SAPs, SAP-A, -B, -C, and -D, also called saposins A-D, derive from a common precursor protein by proteolytic cleavage (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 3O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N. Wenger D.A. Esch F. Fluharty A.L.

A portion of the precursor protein escapes from intracellular degradation. It is found in various human secretory fluids, predominantly in cerebrospinal fluid, milk, semen, bile, and pancreatic juice (5Hineno T. Sano A. Kondoh K. Ueno S. Kakimoto Y. Yoshida K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). High concentrations of the SAP precursor are found in brain and muscle (6Sano A. Hineno T. Mizuno T. Kondoh K. Ueno S. Kakimoto Y. Inui K. Biophys. Biochem. Res.

An in vitro study using both recombinant and native protein revealed that SAP precursor combines some functions of mature SAPs, e.g. as a ganglioside-binding protein (7Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 98: 11254-11258Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, SAP precursor was also identified as a neurotrophic factor in vivo (8O'Brien J.S. Carson G.S. Seo H.-C. Hiraiwa M. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9593-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Sano A. Matsuda S. Wen T.-C. Kotani Y. Kondoh K. Ueno S. Kakimoto Y. Yoshimura H. Sakanaka M. Biophys. Biochem. Res.

Early investigations of the biosynthesis and processing of SAP-B and -C have been performed by Fujibayashi and Wenger (10Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in cultured human fibroblasts. In both studies the authors found that a precursor glycoprotein of 65 kDa is initially synthesized, which is further processed to a 70-kDa polypeptide. A part of the latter is converted by proteolytic cleavage within lysosomes into 8-13-kDa mature SAP-B and SAP-C, respectively, whereas another part of the 70-kDa protein is secreted into the culture medium. In I-cell disease (ICD) fibroblasts, that fail to phosphorylate mannose residues on newly synthesized lysosomal proteins, only half of the normal SAP-C concentration (12Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1985; 146: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and very low levels of SAP-B were found (13Inui K. Wenger D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, increased amounts of the precursor protein could be immunoprecipitated from the media of ICD fibroblasts (11Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the transport of SAP precursor to lysosomes of human fibroblasts is predominantly mediated by the mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-dependent pathway (for review, see 14Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). However, many tissues such as brain, liver, spleen, and kidney from ICD patients have normal levels of lysosomal enzymes (15Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. van Elsen A. Leroy J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and SAPs (16Morimoto S. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3493-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating a Man-6-P-independent pathway of lysosomal enzyme targeting in various cell types of these organs. Most data on the Man-6-P-independent targeting of a lysosomal protein have been derived from studies of cathepsin D. Experiments with ICD lymphoblasts revealed that the lysosomal targeting of cathepsin D is not dependent on carbohydrate residues, but is probably mediated by a peptide determinant in the cathepsin D carboxyl-terminal lobe (17Glickman J.N. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, in human promonocytes the cathepsin D propeptide is also essential for targeting of cathepsin D to lysosomes (18Fortenberry S.C. Chirgwin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9778-9782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rijnboutt et al. (19Rijnboutt S. Aerts H.M.F.G. Geuze H.J. Tager J.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol.

The Man-6-P-independent membrane association of 73-kDa SAP precursor and procathepsin D is presumably accompanied by a transient association of these proteins to each other during their passage from the Golgi to dense lysosomes in HepG2 cells (20Zhu Y. Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3846-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same study these authors demonstrated an early association of a 68-kDa SAP precursor form and procathepsin D within the ER and the Golgi that was not combined with an association to either membrane. In order to elucidate the significance of Man-6-P residues for the targeting of the SAP precursor, we studied biosynthesis and processing of the protein in normal and ICD fibroblasts. We demonstrate that intracellular targeting of SAP precursor is partially dependent on Man-6-P residues. In contrast, endocytosis of the protein is not mediated by a carbohydrate recognition marker.

Rabbit anti-(human β-glucosylceramidase) antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. Hans Aerts (E. C. Slater Institute for Biochemical Research, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands). Monoclonal mouse anti-(human lamp-1) IgG1 (H4A3) was obtained form from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein-conjugated affinipure goat anti-(rabbit IgG (Fab′)2), Cy3™-conjugated affinipure mouse anti-(goat IgG (H + L)) and Cy3™-conjugated affinipure sheep anti-(mouse IgG (H + L)) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs (West Grove, PA). Normal human diploid fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies submitted to us for diagnosis. I-cell disease fibroblasts were a kind gift of Dr. M. Beck (Kinderklinik der Universität Mainz, Germany). Wild type and double MPR-knockout mouse fibroblasts deficient in both the cation-independent (300 kDa) and the cation-dependent (46 kDa) mannose 6-phosphate receptor, were a generous gift of Dr. R. Pohlmann and Dr. K. von Figura (Zentrum Biochemie und Molekulare Zellbiologie, Universität Göttingen, Germany). Human skin fibroblasts were grown to confluency at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Boehringer Mannheim). Confluent cells (25- cm2 flasks) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2. Starvation of the cells was performed for 2 h in 1 ml of deficient medium containing 4% dialyzed fetal calf serum. For pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were starved in methionine-free DMEM (ICN) and pulsed by addition of 50-150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. For [35S]SO4 labeling, cells were incubated with sulfate-free DMEM/F-12 (1:1 mixture, Sigma) and pulsed by addition of 200 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4. [32P]PO4 labeling was performed by starving the cells in phosphate-deficient minimal essential medium (Sigma) and subsequent addition of 200 μCi/ml [32P]Na2HPO4. In addition, some cells labeled with [35S]methionine were chased with 5 mM nonlabeled methionine. In some experiments the cells were starved and labeled in the presence of various reagents at concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. After removing the culture medium, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (PBS with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM pepstatin, 1 μM leupeptin, and, in the case of phosphate-labeled cells, 40 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate) by scraping the cells off of the plate. After twice freeze-thawing, the cell lysates were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 15000 × g. For removing DNA and histones, the supernatant was incubated with 0.03% protamine sulfate for 45 min at 4°C and centrifuged again at 15000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Media and pretreated cell lysates were then incubated with 10 μl of rabbit-preimmune serum overnight at 4°C, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). The supernatant was incubated at 4°C with 3 μl of rabbit-anti-SAP-A, -B, or -C antiserum or 3 μl of goat-anti-SAP-D antiserum overnight. Cross-reactive material was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (for rabbit IgG) or protein G-agarose (for goat IgG) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The immunocomplexes were then washed with PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.8 M KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.25% BSA, and with PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium desoxycholate, and 0.25% BSA. After a final wash with 10-fold diluted PBS, the immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using 12.5, 7-17, or 5-20% acrylamide and 14C-labeled methylated molecular mass standards (Amersham Corp.): phosphorylase B, 97.4 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 69 kDa; ovalbumin, 46 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 30 kDa; lysozyme, 14.4 kDa. Labeled polypeptides were detected by fluorography. Radioactivity of SAP proteins was quantified by densitometry of the fluorograms or by use of a PhosphorImager (Fuji/Raytest BAS 1000). Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled for 10 min in 60 μl of gel electrophoresis sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The supernatants were divided into three aliquots. Two aliquots were adjusted to 200 μl with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol. 2000 New England Biolabs units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were added only to one aliquot, the other serving as a control sample. The third aliquot was adjusted to 200 μl with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 0.5% SDS and 1%β-mercaptoethanol and was incubated with 50 New England Biolabs units of β-endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H). After incubation for 20 h at 37°C the protein was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, washed two times with ice-cold acetone, and dried under air. The pellets were solubilized in gel electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. For treatment of [32P]PO4- and [35S]SO4-labeled immunocomplexes, the procedure was modified to prevent release of the inorganic residues by trichloroacetic acid. Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in 45 μl of denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol), divided into three aliquots. Two aliquots were adjusted with 60 μl of 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% octylglucoside with or without PNGase F. The third aliquot was supplemented with buffer and Endo H as described above. After incubation at 37°C for 20 h, the samples were supplemented with 20 μl of 5-fold concentrated gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Confluent human skin fibroblasts or I-cell disease skin fibroblasts (75-cm2 flask) were labeled for 24 h with 0.5-1.0 mCi of [35S]methionine in 4 ml of methionine-deficient DMEM, containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 mM NH4Cl or 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. The medium was removed, dialyzed against 1 liter of DMEM overnight, supplemented with 5 mM nonradioactive methionine and 5% fetal calf serum, and added to fresh cells in the absence or presence of various reagents as indicated in Fig. 8, A and B. After the times indicated the cells were harvested, and cells and media were processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. Human fibroblasts cultured on glass coverslips were washed with PBS at 4°C and fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized by incubation for 7 min with 0.05% saponin (ICN Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) at room temperature. Then the cells were treated for 60 min at 37°C with 3% BSA (Serva Biochemicals, Heidelberg, Germany) in PBS, washed with 0.1% BSA, PBS, and incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in the same buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Dilutions used were anti-lamp-1 monoclonal antibody, 1:100; all other antibodies, 1:200. After intensive washing with 0.1% BSA, PBS, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated sheep-anti-(mouse IgG) secondary antibody (1:1000), a rhodamine-conjugated mouse-anti-(goat IgG) (1:700) or a fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-(rabbit IgG) (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. For double immunofluorescence labeling, primary antibodies were applied simultaneously, whereas secondary antibodies were applied successively with intermediate washing steps (first cyanorhodamine-conjugated antibody, then fluorescein-conjugated antibody). The cells were washed again, fixed on the slides with 50% glycerol, and analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope. Biosynthesis and processing of the SAP precursor in cultured human skin fibroblasts were analyzed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation techniques using an anti-SAP-C antibody (if not otherwise indicated). In order to study the intracellular sites of processing of SAP precursor, the maturation of SAP precursor was followed by applying temperatures known to block protein transport selectively (27Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). At 15°C the exit of proteins from the ER is inhibited. As shown by Fig. 1, a 65-kDa SAP precursor is formed which is not further processed under these conditions. Incubation at 20°C, a temperature at which proteins accumulate in the TGN, allows conversion into a polypeptide of an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa. Generation of mature SAP-C as well as secretion of a 73-kDa SAP precursor into the culture medium (about 30% of the newly synthesized protein) occurs only in the cells incubated at 37°C. Additional proof of the above processing data was obtained from metabolic labeling experiments with [35S]methionine in the absence or presence of brefeldin A (BFA). BFA, a fungal metabolite, causes the fusion of the ER and the Golgi apparatus and inhibits vesicular transport from that fusion compartment to the TGN (28Misumi Y. Miki A. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacio J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Analysis of anti-SAP-C cross-reactive material of BFA-treated cells by SDS-PAGE and fluorography shows an accumulation of 65-kDa SAP precursor and 30-51-kDa intermediate forms (Fig. 2). Since the intermediates were generated under BFA treatment even in an almost complete absence of the 73-kDa precursor, they could be well derived from proteolytic cleavage of the 65-kDa form. In the presence of BFA, processing of the 65-kDa form into the 73-kDa form was considerably slowed, but not completely abolished. These findings are consistent with previous observations that Golgi enzymes, which are redistributed to the ER in the presence of BFA, remain active (29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacio J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). As expected, the secretion of the 73-kDa precursor into the culture medium and the proteolysis of the precursor into mature SAP-C was completely blocked by BFA. These observations indicate that SAP precursor is synthesized as a 65-kDa polypeptide within the ER and that conversion into 73-kDa SAP precursor occurs in the Golgi apparatus. In accordance with previous findings (11Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), cleavage into mature SAPs has to take place in a compartment distal to the TGN, i.e. within endosomes or lysosomes. The pH-dependent sorting of lysosomal proteins to lysosomes is affected by weak bases. Indeed, NH4Cl strongly stimulated the secretion of SAP precursor, whereas only 10-20% of SAP precursor were processed into mature SAP-C (Fig. 3). However, weak bases are rather nonspecific reagents that may effect parameters other than pH, that are important for vesicular protein transport. A specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases (30Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) is the macrolide antibiotic bafilomycin A1 (BA1), which is known to neutralize the pH of endosomes and to block the transport from endosomes to lysosomes (31Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the presence of BA1, formation of mature SAP-C was completely blocked, whereas secretion of SAP precursor was further enhanced compared to the cells incubated with NH4Cl. In addition, there are 44-50-kDa intermediate forms appearing in the culture medium in the presence of NH4Cl and BA1. These polypeptides presumably derive from extracellular limited proteolysis of SAP precursor. In order to exclude the possibility that the effect of BA1 was caused by an inhibition of acidic proteases by the neutral environment in the endosome, we studied the processing of SAP precursor in the presence of 3-methyladenine. This agent blocks the transport from late endosomes to lysosomes by a yet unknown mechanism without affecting the pH of intracellular organelles (33Punnonen E.-L. Marjomäki V.S. Reunanen H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 14-25PubMed Google Scholar). Under 3-methyladenine treatment, nearly normal amounts of SAP-C were formed (Fig. 3). Thus, processing of SAP precursor presumably begins in late endosomes. The higher molecular mass (14 kDa) of the mature protein under 3-methyladenine compared to the normal mature SAP-C (9-11 kDa) possibly reflects the lack of further processing events taking place within the lysosomes. Our attempts to block proteolytic cleavage of SAP precursor in vivo by 100 μM leupeptin alone or together with pepstatin (100 μM each) during metabolic labeling led to a slowed, but still efficient proteolysis (data not shown), suggesting that there is no specific serine, aspartyl, or cysteinyl protease solely responsible for cleavage of SAP precursor. PNGase F digestion of immunoprecipitates from normal fibroblasts leads to conversion of 73- and 65-kDa SAP precursors to a 53-kDa polypeptide, whereas the apparent molecular mass of mature SAP-C is reduced from 9-11 kDa to about 7 kDa (10Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to distinguish between complex and high mannose or hybrid carbohydrate structures, we performed Endo H digestion of anti-SAP-C cross-reactive material from normal fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Endo H treatment resulted in conversion of all of the 65-kDa SAP precursor and a minor part of the intracellular 73-kDa form into a 53-kDa polypeptide, whereas the 73-kDa precursor precipitated from medium remained unaltered. Consequently the 73-kDa form possesses predominantly complex carbohydrate chains, whereas the 65-kDa form contains only high mannose or hybrid sugars. Only 20-30% of mature 9-13-kDa SAP-C was converted by Endo H into the unglycosylated 7-kDa form. In contrast, SAP-C from ICD fibroblasts showed a higher molecular mass (14 kDa) and Endo H-resistant carbohydrate chains. In fibroblasts, the targeting to lysosomes of most soluble lysosomal proteins is mediated by Man-6-P residues. In order to investigate whether there are phosphate residues present on SAP polypeptides, we metabolically labeled human fibroblasts with Na2H[32P]PO4 for 5 h. Both 65- and 73-kDa SAP precursor forms bear phosphate residues on N-linked oligosaccharide chains linked to both the SAP-C (Fig. 5) and the SAP-D domain (data not shown). Only a faint band of 73-kDa SAP precursor was detectable in the culture medium, whereas in the presence of NH4Cl, increased amounts of [32P]PO4-labeled 73-kDa SAP precursor were secreted into the culture medium (not shown). There was no evidence for protein-bound phosphate, since all radioactivity was lost after PNGase F-digestion of immunoprecipitates (the same result was obtained by Endo H treatment, data not shown). In contrast, no carbohydrate-linked phosphate residues could be detected on SAP-A and -B. Compared to the amounts of SAP precursor labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 5), phosphate labeling of the secreted precusor protein appeared to be up to 10-fold weaker than that of the intracellular SAP precursor. In addition, the 73-kDa SAP precursor, SAP-C (Fig. 5), and SAP-A (data not shown), could be labeled efficiently with Na2[35S]SO4 after a 5-h pulse, whereas no evidence was found for a sulfate residue on SAP-B. Sulfate labeling of SAP-D was strong in ICD cells, but only barely or not detectable in several experiments with normal fibroblasts (not shown). The inorganic residue on SAP-A and -C is bound to complex N-linked sugar chains, since PNGase F, but not Endo H, released all detectable radioactivity from these proteins. Incorporation of the SO4 radiolabel was abolished in the presence of tunicamycin (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, ICD fibroblasts synthesized a 65-kDa form o"

These receptor-associated kinases then activate STAT transcription factors through phosphorylation. We found that the 78-kDa erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), a highly modified form of the 66-kDa receptor which is abundant in HCD57 cells, was phosphorylated on serine residues without EPO stimulation. Coprecipitation experiments showed the 78-kDa EPOR but not the more abundant 66-kDa EPOR was associated with JAK2, a Janus protein kinase, in both the presence and absence of EPO. Solubilized 78-kDa EPOR bound to purified, genetically engineered JAK2 better than the 62-76-kDa receptor proteins, and additional phosphorylation of tyrosine residues further increased the binding of the 78-kDa EPOR to JAK2-agarose beads. STAT5 DNA binding was activated by 10-100-fold lower concentrations of EPO in HCD57 cells than in primary erythroid cells, and STAT5 associated with the EPOR in an EPO-dependent manner. These data suggest that phosphorylation of either serine or tyrosine residues of the EPOR can enhance the association of the receptor with JAK2, possibly increasing the sensitivity to EPO.

Miura and co-workers showed that JAK2 interacted with the EPOR only after EPO binding (7Miura O. Makamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N.

We have investigated possible explanations for these disparate findings, and report here that the constitutive phosphorylation of the EPOR on serine residues appeared to enhance the association of JAK2 with the EPOR in erythroid cells. In addition, EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPOR appeared to additionally increase the affinity for JAK2. We report more extensive processing of the EPOR in erythroid cells compared to other cells (26Yoshimura A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell.

In this study we demonstrate that in HCD57 erythroleukemia cells, STAT5 is activated to bind DNA at EPO concentrations 100-fold less than previously reported for primary erythroid cells and that STAT5 binds to the activated EPOR. HCD57 cells, obtained from Sandra Ruscetti at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, MD (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Ruscetti S.K. Janesch N. Chakraborti A. Sawyer S.T. Hankins H.D. J. Virol. 1990; 63: 1057-1062Crossref Google Scholar), were cultured in the presence of 1.0 unit of EPO/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and 25% fetal calf serum for several days. In most experiments, the cells were further cultured overnight in the same medium devoid of EPO. As previously reported (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this deprivation of EPO increased cell surface EPOR. The 62-78-kDa forms of the EPOR were visualized after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-receptor, affinity-purified IgG raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 15-terminal amino acids of the receptor (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The EPOR was detected on x-ray film by a light generating reaction catalyzed by peroxidase linked to a secondary antibody (ECL from Amersham). Tyr(P)-containing proteins were detected by the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting method described before (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except monoclonal antibodies against Tyr(P) from either Transduction Laboratories (RC20H) or UBI (4G10) were also used. Polyclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibodies from Zymed were used to immunoprecipitate and concentrate the Tyr(P)-containing proteins before they were analyzed by Western blot. In many experiments, the blots were stripped of bound antibody and reprobed one or two more times with other antisera. The blot was stripped as described by the Amersham literature with the ECL kit. Briefly, the bound antibody was released in the presence of 2% SDS and reducing agents at 50°C for 30 min. N-Linked carbohydrate from the immunoprecipitated EPOR was digested away with either 50 or 500 units of N-glycanase/ml for 20 h as described previously (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Phosphate on all residues of the EPOR and Tyr(P)-containing proteins was eliminated by digestion of immunoprecipitates with 50 units of alkaline phosphatase/ml for 6 h at 37°C in a pH 9.0 buffer as described previously (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Yoshimura A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the experiment where deglycosylation and dephosphorylation were both done, alkaline phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitated EPOR was followed by dialysis, concentration in a SpeedVac, and then N-glycanase treatment. Undigested controls were treated similarly without enzymes. HCD57 cells were labeled with 10 mCi of 32Pi for 1 h in phosphate-free medium and dialyzed serum. The EPOR was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blotting with anti-EPOR IgG. Afterwards, the radioactive bands comigrating with the 78-kDa EPOR were cut out of the nitrocellulose blot and placed directly in 6 N HCl and heated for 1.5 h at 100°C under nitrogen. Products of this acid hydrolysis were analyzed on two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis, first at pH 1.9, and then at pH 3.5, on thin layer plates as described by others (31Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography and compared to standards visualized by staining with ninhydrin. These studies were carried out in detergent extracts of HCD57 cells made in 1% digitonin lysis solution as described in the report by Miura and co-workers (7Miura O. Makamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HCD57 cultured without EPO were pretreated with 0.5 mM NaVa3O4, and either not treated or treated with 10 units of EPO for 10 min at 37°C in the culture medium containing 25% fetal calf serum. The cells were diluted with an excess volume of ice-cold culture medium and washed one time. The pellets were suspended in the ice-cold digitonin lysis buffer for 5 min and insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was divided into equal aliquots and incubated with anti-EPOR IgG, anti-JAK2 antiserum (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), or anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting the blot was probed with either anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody, anti-JAK2 antiserum, anti-STAT5 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), or the anti-EPOR IgG. For a control, nuclear proteins were extracted from parallel cells, by the method described previously (17Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31282-31287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were also run on the same SDS-PAGE gel and blot and were probed with anti-STAT5 antiserum to indicate the position of activated STAT5 that was translocated to the nucleus in EPO-treated cells. These same techniques were used to measure the effect of EPO concentration on STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. STAT5 binding to radiolabeled DNA (prolactin inducible element) was done as described previously (17Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31282-31287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Purified JAK2 protein expressed in the Sf9 cells-baculovirus system that was conjugated to agarose beads was obtained commercially from UBI. HCD57 cells that were deprived of EPO overnight were pretreated with 0.5 mM NaVa3O4 for 50 min, and the cells were either treated with nothing or 10 units of EPO/ml for 10 min at 37°C. Following this incubation, the cells were then lysed at 4°C in a 1% Triton X-100 solution used previously as the binding buffer to demonstrate the interaction of JAK2 with fusion proteins containing domains of the EPOR (9Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvenoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The unsolublized material was removed by centrifuging at 25,000 × g for 60 min and the extracts were incubated with 33 μl of the JAK2 beads for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed 5 times with ice-cold binding solution to remove any soluble EPOR trapped in the pellet. The JAK2 resin and associated EPOR proteins were then exposed to SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100°C to release bound protein, and the forms of EPOR bound were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-EPOR IgG. We previously demonstrated the 78-kDa form of the EPOR and an unidentified 95-kDa protein were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following treatment of HCD57 erythroid cells with EPO (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This experiment was repeated with monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibodies instead of the polyclonal antiserum. Fig. 1 shows an experiment comparing the effects of increasing EPO concentration on Tyr(P) proteins in HCD57 cells determined with a monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 1, upper panel) and the polyclonal antiserum used previously (25Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (lower panel). The polyclonal anti-Tyr(P) was effective in recognizing a phosphorylated 95-kDa protein and weakly detecting the 78-kDa EPOR, but the monoclonal antiserum strongly recognized the EPOR and number of proteins ranging from 47 to 200 kDa. We have determined that the predominant band at 78 kDa in EPO-treated cells is the phosphorylated EPOR as previously reported (Fig. 2). This was shown by the appearance of the 78-kDa band in the anti-EPOR immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2, lane D) and the corresponding anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitate when reprobed with anti-EPOR IgG (lane G). However, prolonged exposure to film revealed another Tyr(P)-containing band of 72 kDa in the anti-EPOR immunoprecipitate. Reprobing this blot with anti-EPOR IgG revealed that the 72-kDa band, immunoprecipitated by anti-Tyr(P), was also a form of the EPOR. This 72-kDa band reacted with both anti-COOH and anti-NH2 anti-EPOR IgG, indicating that it was not a truncated form of receptor. Therefore, both a major 78-kDa EPOR and less abundant 72-kDa EPOR were phosphorylated in a EPO-dependent manner.Fig. 2Two discrete forms of the erythropoietin receptor (72 and 78 kDa) were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following the binding of EPO to HCD57 cells. HCD57 cells were deprived of EPO overnight, pretreated with 0.5 mM NaVa3O4 for 50 min, and then either treated with 10 units of EPO/ml for 10 min (lanes B, D, E, and G) or were untreated (lanes A, C, F, and H). The cells were then lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, the extract was divided into two aliquots, and either Tyr(P)-containing proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) antiserum (lanes A, B, G, and H) or the EPOR and associated proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-EPOR IgG (lanes C-F). Following SDS-PAGE and blotting, the blot was probed with anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody (A-D) or stripped of bound antibody and reprobed with anti-EPOR antiserum (E-H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies showed that the Tyr(P)-containing 72-kDa form of the EPOR resulted from the shift of a 66-kDa EPOR to 72 kDa because of phosphate interference in SDS-PAGE (7Miura O. Makamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yoshimura A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell.

D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the 78-kDa EPOR was present before EPO treatment. Fig. 3 shows that the Tyr(P)-containing 78-kDa EPOR was shifted to 72 kDa by enzymatic dephosphorylation. Control experiments in which the alkaline phosphatase activity was inhibited with vanadate (not shown) verified that the 6-kDa shift of the EPOR in apparent molecular mass was due to phosphate on the protein and was not the result of contaminating proteinase activity. Because the 78-kDa EPOR was also present in cells not treated with EPO, the possibility that the 78-kDa EPOR was phosphorylated before EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was tested. Fig. 4, lane 7, shows that sequential deglycosylation and dephosphorylation completely converted all the forms of EPOR (62-78 kDa) found in HCD57 cells in the absence of EPO into the 62-kDa unprocessed peptide (lane 7). This indicates that both N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation is contributed to the larger molecular weight forms of the receptor because deglycosylation alone generated a subset of receptors with a molecular mass of 68 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 6) and dephosphorylation alone shifted the total receptors from 78 to 72 kDa. These data are consistent with the 78-kDa EPOR shifted in migration on SDS-PAGE both due to extensive glycosylation (10-kDa shift) and phosphorylation in the absence of EPO (6-kDa shift) such that EPO-induced phosphorylation on tyrosine residues did not additionally retard the migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE. As a control in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, HCD57 cells were exposed to EPO for 24 h or longer such that the 70-78-kDa EPOR were down-regulated through destruction of the cell surface receptors (Fig. 4, lane 1). The remaining 64-69-kDa receptors in these cells were completely converted to the 62-kDa unprocessed protein by N-glycanase, which demonstrated that the digestion with N-glycanase was complete (lanes 1 and 3). As a further control, 10-fold more N-glycanase did not diminish the 68-kDa material that remained after enzymatic deglycosylation (compare lane 6 with lanes 3 and 4). The combined digestion with alkaline phosphatase and N-glycanase did not generate fragments of EPOR that would be expected if a contaminating proteinase had cleaved 6 kDa from the receptor in Fig. 3, indicating the absence of proteolytic artifacts. To examine the nature of non-tyrosine phosphorylation on the EPOR in the unstimulated state more directly, the EPOR was immunoprecipitated from 32Pi-labeled HCD57 cells untreated or treated with EPO. As illustrated in Fig. 5, radioactive bands comigrating with the 78-kDa EPOR were seen in cells treated with both EPO and untreated cells (lanes Aand B). The radioactivity was increased after EPO treatment by 2-3-fold compared to untreated cells, but the band was not shifted on SDS-PAGE. A control Western blot with anti-Tyr(P) antiserum showed that no Tyr(P) was detected in the 78-kDa band in the absence of EPO (Fig. 5, lane F). These radioactive bands were cut out of the blot, the proteins were hydrolyzed, and radioactive phosphoamino acids were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 6. The band corresponding to the EPOR from untreated cells contained radioactive phosphoserine and no radioactivity was detected in Tyr(P). Treatment of the HCD57 cells with EPO resulted in the appearance of 32P in Tyr(P) in the band at 78 kDa. EPO treatment also appeared to increase the 32P incorporated into phosphoserine residues of the EPOR in this experiment. These studies indicate that the 78-kDa EPOR was shifted in molecular mass by the constitutive serine phosphorylation as well as N-linked carbohydrate, such that additional phosphorylation on tyrosine residues do not retard the protein on SDS-PAGE.Fig. 6The 78-kDa EPOR protein was phosphorylated on serine residues in the absence of EPO and became additionally phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after the cells were treated with EPO. The bands from lanes A and B of Fig. 5 were cut out of the blot and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel A shows the position of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and Tyr(P) standards run on the thin layer plate show in panel B and visualized after staining with ninhydrin. Panel B is an autoradiogram of the hydrolyzed 78-kDa EPOR band from EPO-treated cells, and panel C is the phosphoamino acid analysis of the 78-kDa band from untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteins coprecipitating with the EPOR were examined in HCD57 cells lysed in 1% digitonin, as shown in Fig. 7. Proteins coprecipitating with JAK2 were also analyzed. The anti-Tyr(P) blot (lanes A-D) showed that the tyrosine-phosphorylated 78-kDa EPOR was immunoprecipitated from EPO-treated cells by anti-EPOR IgG and JAK2 (135 kDa) was coprecipitated with EPOR (lane B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from EPO-treated cells with anti-JAK2 antiserum and the 78-kDa EPOR was coprecipitated with JAK2 (lane D). In addition, a 95-kDa Tyr(P)-containing band was present in both immunoprecipitates from EPO-treated cells but was severalfold more abundant in the anti-EPOR immunoprecipitate. This blot was stripped of bound anti-Tyr(P) antibody and reprobed with anti-JAK2 antiserum (lanes E-H). JAK2 was associated with the EPOR in both the absence and presence of EPO (lanes E and F). Furthermore, approximately half of the JAK2 protein in the cell appeared to be associated with the EPOR. The blot was then stripped of bound JAK2 antibody and reprobed with anti-STAT5 monoclonal antibody. The 95-kDa Tyr(P)-containing protein coprecipitated with the EPOR in EPO-treated cells appeared to be STAT5 because a 95-kDa band was seen in anti-EPOR immunoprecipitates when probed with anti-STAT5, but only in immunoprecipitates from EPO-treated cells (lane J). A many fold weaker 95-kDa band was also seen in the anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates from EPO-treated cells, but this is likely STAT5 bound to the coprecipitated EPOR in these immune complexes. For comparison, nuclear extracts from parallel HCD57 cells not treated or treated with EPO (Fig. 7, lanes M and N, respectively) were run on the same gel and probed with anti-STAT5 antibody. STAT5 was translocated to the nucleus in an EPO-dependent fashion as we have demonstrated previously in other erythroid cells (17Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31282-31287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This authentic STAT5 comigrated with the 95-kDa Tyr(P)-containing band and STAT5 coprecipitated with the EPOR. It was estimated that approximately 2% of the STAT5 activated, as quantified by the amount translocated to the nucleus in EPO-treated cells, was bound to the EPOR in this experiment. The forms of EPOR that coprecipitated with JAK2 were examined. The blot used in Fig. 7 did not give a clean result when stripped and reprobed with anti-EPOR IgG. Therefore, a new blot was prepared from the same cell extracts, and this blot was probed with anti-EPOR IgG as show in Fig. 8. In addition to immunoprecipitates using anti-EPOR (Fig. 8, C and D) and anti-JAK2 antibodies (E and F), anti-Tyr(P) antibodies recovered Tyr(P)-containing EPOR (A and B). All these immunoprecipitates were Western blotted and probed for EPOR proteins. Confirming the data from Fig. 2, the 78-kDa form of the EPOR was phosphorylated on the tyrosine residues in EPO-treated cells (Fig. 8, lanes A and B), a minor 72-kDa form was seen with longer film exposures, and there was no apparent shift in molecular mass of the EPOR forms ranging from 62 to 78 kDa with EPO treatment (lanes C and D). Interestingly, only the 78-kDa form of the EPOR was detected associated with JAK2 as shown in Fig. 8, lanes E and F. As expected from the data in Fig. 7, the 78-kDa EPOR was coprecipitated with JAK2 in both untreated and EPO-treated cells. To rule out the possibly that the unique association of JAK2 with the 78-kDa EPOR resulted from circumstances other than the direct interaction of these proteins, solubilized HCD57 cellular extracts, 1% Triton X-100, were incubated with purified JAK2 conjugated to agarose beads. The forms of EPOR in the detergent extract that associated with these JAK2 beads were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-EPOR IgG. As shown in Fig. 9, in untreated HCD57 cells, the 78-kDa EPOR was the predominant receptor form that bound to the JAK2 beads while the most abundant 66-kDa from of EPOR was bound to a lesser extent. In contrast to the earlier coprecipitation experiments showing equal association of JAK2 with the EPOR in the presence and absence of EPO, the binding of the 78-kDa EPOR to the JAK2 beads was increased 10-fold in extracts from EPO-treated cells compared to untreated cells. This experiment was carried out in a stringent 1% Triton X-100 detergent solution rather than mild digitonin lysis buffer such that JAK2, STAT5, and probably other associated proteins would be dissociated from the EPOR (shown by the experiment in Fig. 2). This reduced the possibility that JAK2 or other proteins binding the EPOR facilitated or interfered with the binding of the receptor to the JAK2 beads. We greatly reduced the possibility that the increased affinity of the 78-kDa EPOR from EPO-treated cells resulted from a conformational change of the EPOR induced by EPO binding rather than EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation by determining that virtually all the EPO bound to EPOR was released during thi"

https://openalex.org/W2020369029,"Sterol 12α-hydroxylase is an important enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, responsible for the balance between formation of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. The enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rabbit liver (Ishida, H., Noshiro, M., Okuda, K., and Coon, M. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem.267, 21319-21323), and we here describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA coding for this enzyme. After tryptic digestion of purified protein in a polyacrylamide gel, eight different peptides were isolated and sequenced. Using oligonucleotides deduced from the amino acid sequences, clones were isolated from a rabbit liver cDNA library. In addition to several overlapping clones, one full-length clone was obtained that coded for a polypeptide of 500 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 57 kDa. All of the eight peptides and the reported NH2-terminal amino acid sequence were matched against the sequence. The peptide sequence showed a 39% similarity with human prostacyclin synthase (CYP8) and 31% similarity with the rate-limiting enzyme in over-all synthesis of bile acids, the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7) of the rabbit. The similarity with most other sterol cytochrome P-450 hydroxylases was less. Thus, this species of cytochrome P-450 should belong to a group of its own, here denoted CYP12. Transfection of COS cells with the coding part of the cDNA resulted in a significant expression of sterol 12α-hydroxylase activity toward 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one.Northern blotting showed that the enzyme was exclusively expressed in the liver. The major mRNA fraction in rabbit liver had a size of approximately 2.9 kilobases, and those found in rat and human liver were about 2.5 and 4.5 kilobases, respectively. Fasting of rats and mice led to a severalfold increase in both enzyme activity and mRNA levels. In contrast, starvation of rabbits had little or no stimulatory effect on enzyme activity and mRNA levels.

In contrast, starvation of rabbits had little or no stimulatory effect on enzyme activity and mRNA levels. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase is one of the key enzymes in bile acid biosynthesis, being responsible for the balance between formation of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (for a general review, see 1Björkhem I. Danielsson H. Sjövall J. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 231-278Google Scholar). This balance may be of importance for development of gallstones since such stones are less likely to develop when there is a low ratio between cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in bile. Suppression of sterol 12α-hydroxylase by competitive inhibitors has, therefore, been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy for dissolution of gallstones (2Shaw R. Elliott W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since chenodeoxycholic acid is a more potent suppressor than cholic acid of the rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol and bile acid synthesis (1Björkhem I. Danielsson H. Sjövall J. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 231-278Google Scholar), sterol 12α-hydroxylase activity may also be of general importance for over-all cholesterol homeostasis. In 1973, Björkhem and coworkers (3Bernhardsson C. Björkhem I. Danielsson H. Wikvall H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) solubilized sterol 12α-hydroxylase from rat liver microsomes and demonstrated that the activity could be reconstituted from a crude fraction containing cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The relatively low degree of inhibition of the enzyme by carbon monoxide, observed also by other groups (4Einarsson K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki M. Mitropoulos K.A. Myant N.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), made it difficult to completely exclude the possibility that an enzyme other than cytochrome P-450 might be responsible for the reaction. In fact, one group suggested that a cytochrome P-450 is not the terminal oxidase in 12α-hydroxylation (5Suzuki M. Mitropoulos K.A. Myant N.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sterol 12α-hydroxylase resisted purification for a long time, and for the first time in 1992, two of these authors (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained a homogenous preparation allowing determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. A characteristic feature of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 isolated from rabbit liver was that in addition to NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5 was required for full activity. A characteristic feature of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase is that the enzyme activity is increased severalfold in rats by starvation or administration of streptozotocin (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Johansson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 17: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Hansson R. Wikvall K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has also been reported from rat studies that the enzyme activity is decreased by treatment with thyroid hormone (9Björkhem I. Danielsson H. Gustafsson J. FEBS Lett. 1973; 31: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and phenobarbital (4Einarsson K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we reported that the sterol 12α-hydroxylase in human liver seems to be regulated to some extent by the flux of bile acids, similar to the mechanism for regulation of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (10Einarsson K. Åkerlund J.-E. Reihner E. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1591-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of 12α-hydroxylation has also been studied with respect to the nature of the rate-limiting step in the hydroxylation, utilizing 12-2H2-labeled 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as substrate (11Björkhem I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present work, we report on the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA coding for sterol 12α-hydroxylase in rabbit liver. Transfection of COS cells with this cDNA resulted in significant 12α-hydroxylase activity. In addition, we show that the increase in sterol 12α-hydroxylase enzyme activity in rat liver after starvation is associated with increased mRNA levels. The following materials were purchased: restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany); Hybond N nylon membranes, Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Life Science, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK); [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, 5′[α-35S]thio-ATP (DuPont NEN); oligo labeling kit, Taq polymerase, Sureclon ligation kit, Ready-to-go T4 DNA ligase kit, pUC18 (Pharmacia Biotechnology, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden); pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); Fuji RX-L x-ray films (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). Male and female New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2-3 kg were fed standard rabbit chow and fasted for 24 or 48 h. In the experiments evaluating the effects of starvation on enzyme activity and organ distribution, only male rabbits were used. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male 129/SVJ Bom mice were likewise kept on normal chow or fasted for 24 or 48 h, after which liver slices were collected. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase was prepared from rabbit liver microsomes as described previously (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 20 μg of the above protein preparation was concentrated (12Wessel D. Flugge U. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), and the dried sample was dissolved in 20 μl of sample buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol. After boiling for 3 min, the reduced sample was alkylated by incubation at room temperature for 20 min with l μl of 4-vinylpyridine and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on a 12% gel using a Minigel device (Bio-Rad). After Coomassie Blue staining and destaining, the band containing the sterol 12α-hydroxylase was excised and tryptic digestion was performed as described by Hellman et al. (14Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Conez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The peptides were fractionated by narrow bore reversed phase liquid chromatography on a μRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/l0 column operated in a Smart System (Pharmacia). An Applied Biosystems model 470A sequencer was used. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems), using the β-cyanoethylphosphoamidite chemistry. A cDNA library made from New Zealand White rabbit liver in the phage λgt10 was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The library (5′-stretch plus cDNA library) was constructed with oligo(dT) and random priming, utilizing EcoRI linkers, and was found to contain 2.5 × l010 pfu/ml. 1The abbreviations used are: pfuplaque-forming unitskbkilobasesHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographybpbase pairsPCRpolymerase chain reaction. The library was propagated in Escherichia coli C600 Hfl. Screening of the library was performed with oligonucleotide probes, end-labeled with 32P. Positive clones were isolated, and the λ DNA purified with Wizard λ Preps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserts were excised from the vector by digestion with EcoRI, extracted from the agarose gel (GenecleanII kit, Bio 101, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and subcloned into pBluescript II or pUC18. Plasmid DNA was purified with the Jetstar plasmid purification system (Genomed). Sequencing of the inserts were either done manually by the dideoxy sequencing method according to established procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or automatically on a 373 DNA sequencer stretch (Applied Biosystems), using the dye terminator cycle sequencing kit with FS-AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). plaque-forming units kilobases high pressure liquid chromatography base pairs polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was prepared from frozen tissue slices of various organs using the Ultraspec or Ultraspec II RNA method (Biotec Lab. Inc., Houston, TX). Northern blotting and hybridization of the blots with 32P-labeled cDNA probes were carried out as described (16Björkhem I. Andersson U. Sudjana-Sugiaman E. Eggertsen G. Hylemon P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1497-1503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of the radioactive signals were done by densitometry, using either murine β-actin or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard. Stock cultures of the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/tetracycline. Transfection was carried out by electroporation in 0.4-cm cuvettes (Gene Pulser II without the pulse controller unit, Bio-Rad), using a single pulse of 0.40 kV and 25 μfarad. After transfection, the cells were grown for 48 h, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and homogenized in the incubation medium (cf. below). Enzyme activity was routinely assayed as described previously (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as substrate. In incubations with transfected cells, the incubations were performed as above with use of homogenates of 2 × 106 cells. In addition to assay by HPLC as above, the extracts of these incubations were also assayed with a more specific technique utilizing combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (17Björkhem I. Skrede S. Buchmann M.S. East C. Grundy S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ion at m/z 380 (M − 2 × 90) was used for quantitation of the silylated product 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and the ion at m/z 382 (M − 90) was used for quantitation of the silylated substrate 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (see Fig. 8). Amplification of various regions by PCR of the λgt10 clones were performed with primers deduced both from the vector arms (5′- and 3′-insert screening amplimer as suggested by Clontech) and from the insert sequence. Approximately l03-104 pfu were added to the reaction mixture of 50 μl, and the process was initiated with a hotstart at 98°C for 8 min, after which the enzyme was added. Fractionation of the tryptic peptides by HPLC generated a large number of peaks (Fig. 1). Of these, nine were subjected to sequence analysis and found to represent nine peptides, containing between 5-20 amino acids. Two of the peptides were identical except for an NH2-terminal arginine (peptides 5 and 6). The sequence of peptides 6 and 9 were used for designing two oligonucleotides intended for screening (12α-1 and 12α-2 as shown in Fig. 2). The most prevailing codons for the amino acids found in the rabbit genome were used (18Wada K. Wada Y. Doi H. Ishibashi F. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 19: 1980-1981Google Scholar), and in positions with a high degree of degeneracy, inosine was inserted (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Amino acid sequence of two of the peptides obtained after tryptic digestion of rabbit sterol 12α-hydroxylase and the sequence of the corresponding oligonucleotides used for screening.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Approximately 500,000 pfu were screened with the two oligonucleotides (12α-1 and 12α-2). The procedure was carried out with low stringency (rinsing in 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50°C for 5-25 min). In this way, one positive clone (p9) was isolated with the probe 12α-2 while the probe 12α-1 did not pick up any clones. The clone obtained numbered approximately 1,000 bp and coded for an open reading frame of 45 amino acid residues localized in the 5′-end. Within this part, two of the peptide sequences were recognized, one corresponding to the cloning probe. The other peptide (peptide 1) contained only five amino acids, and the C-terminal residue was immediately followed by a stop codon (TGA), suggesting that this represented the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. A new screening oligonucleotide consisting of 40 bases was synthesized (12α-4), exactly matching one segment located in the 5′-region of clone p9 (corresponding to positions 1513-1552 in the complete sequence). Screening of another 500,000 pfu from the library was performed with both the probes 12α-4 and 12α-2, using separate plaque-lifts and higher stringency for the hybridization with 12α-4 (rinsing in 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 63°C for 10-15 min). Approximately 40-50 clones were obtained that hybridized with both oligonucleotides. One of these clones (p41B), with a size of 2,129 bp, was sequenced to completion and was found to contain an open reading frame of 1500 bp, coding for a peptide sequence of 500 amino acids, in which all of the eight peptides and the reported amino-terminal sequence (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be identified. Immediately preceding the codon for the amino-terminal valine was the triplet ATG, the codon for a methionine residue. The 5′-part proximal to this numbered 98 bp, in which no triplets coding for methionine were seen. In the 3′-part, the nontranslated region contained 531 bp. The latter part overlapped with another, shorter clone (p12A, also sequenced to completion), in which only 52.9% of the coding sequence was found (Fig. 3). This clone contained an additional 337 nucleotides in its 3′-untranslated part, totaling the number of aligned nucleotides to 2,466. The complete nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acids of the full-length cDNA are shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Rabbit sterol 12α-hydroxylase cDNA and the sequence of the encoded polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence and translation product (bottom) are derived from the compilation of the above overlapping clones and the full-length clone. The sequences of the eight peptides (peptides 1-4 and 6-9) obtained after tryptic cleavage of the purified sterol 12α-hydroxylase and the NH2-terminal sequence previously reported (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Restriction mapping demonstrated the presence of an EcoRI site in position 262 (see Fig. 3). Thus, when the insert of clone p41B was excised from the vector by digestion with EcoRI, it was cleaved in two fragments (262 and 1867 bp), which were subcloned and sequenced separately. To verify the sequence around the EcoRI site, PCR was utilized to generate a fragment of 693 bp, using a primer deduced from the vector arm upstream (3′-insert screening amplimer) and a primer complementary to the plus strand downstream (positions 554-537). The fragment obtained bridged the EcoRI restriction site (see Fig. 3). Sequence analyses of this fragment exactly matched the sequence obtained when the two EcoRI fragments of clone 41B were joined together. Utilizing the Kyte-Doolittle plot shows that the N terminus of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase polypeptide is hydrophobic, similar to the case in other microsomal CYPs. It is thought that this part of the polypeptide is inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Following the hydrophobic segment is a hydrophilic region (from residue 25). In accordance with other microsomal CYPs, the amino terminus lacks basic amino acids prior to the hydrophobic cores. The over-all nucleotide sequence homology of the rabbit sterol 12α-hydroxylase was highest with prostacyclin synthase (CYP8) (19Miyata A. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Tanabe T. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 200: 1728-1734Google Scholar) (43.2% homology over the coding region). At the polypeptide level, the corresponding homology was 39.1% (Fig. 5A). The similarity with rabbit 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7) (20Kai M. Eto T. Kondo K. Setoguchi Y. Higashi S. Maeda Y. Setoguchi T. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, was 30.5%. Most other cytochrome P-450 species investigated had a lower degree of homology than that of rabbit CYP7, less than 16%. An exception occurred with a peptide sequence, deduced from a cDNA isolated from mouse brain hippocampus (hct-1) (21Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G.M. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), that showed 25.9% homology. Many CYP polypeptides are characterized by some highly conserved regions corresponding to the heme binding site, a steroidogenic domain, and an O2-binding pocket (22Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6038-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme binding site has an arrangement of amino acids around a cysteine residue postulated to preserve the three-dimensional structure of this region for ligand binding. This motive was found to be highly conserved in the sterol 12α-hydroxylase (positions 432-445, Fig. 5B). Also, the steroidogenic domain (positions 337-351, Fig. 5C) were relatively conserved. The region corresponding to the O2-binding pocket (positions 279-295, Fig. 5D) showed a rather high degree of homology with the corresponding section in rabbit CYP7, human CYP8, and hct-1, but these four displayed less homology with the other aligned cytochrome p-450s. Furthermore, the threonine residue, shown to be of fundamental importance for the structural integrity of the O2-binding pocket (23Imai Y. Nakamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is replaced with aspartic acid (position 288 in 12α-hydroxylase) in the former group of peptide sequences. Fig. 6 shows a phylogenetic tree showing that CYP7, CYP8, and the cytochrome P-450 responsible for 12α-hydroxylation, here denoted CYP12, are more related than other displayed CYPs. CYP8 and CYP12 seem to have a similar evolutionary age, emerging later during evolution than CYP7. To visualize the mRNA for 12α-hydroxylase on Northern blots, a probe of 653 bp was made by PCR amplification of the clone p12A, corresponding to positions 926-1578 of the coding cDNA sequence. A strong signal was obtained with rabbit liver total RNA, producing one major band of about 2.9 kb and a weaker fraction of 3.9 kb (Fig. 7). Total RNA from other organs of the rabbit (kidney, lung, adrenal, testis, and thigh muscle) did not generate any signal (not shown). Total liver RNA from rat and mouse generated one band with a size of approximately 2.5 and 2.4 kb, respectively, but the signal was much weaker than with the rabbit RNA. With human liver total RNA, one rather strong band was obtained with a migration velocity corresponding to 4.5 kb (Fig. 7). As shown in Table I, starvation of rats and mice led to a severalfold increase in both sterol 12α-hydroxylase activity and mRNA levels. To the contrary, starvation had little or no effect on these parameters concerning rabbit liver.Table IEnzyme activity and CYP12 mRNA levels in untreated and starved ratsEnzyme activityCyp12 mRNACYP12/ActinCyp12/GAPpmol/min/mgRat experiment 1Control90.1124-h starvation411.948-h starvation1021.4Rat experiment 2Control120.1224-h starvation621.748-h starvation1001.2Rat experiment 3Control110.0924-h starvation611.048-h starvation611.3RabbitControl110.6124-h starvation140.7048-h starvation111.4MouseControl231.524-h starvation381.348-h starvation1013.2 Open table in a new tab To express the sterol 12α-hydroxylase in eucaryotic cells, we utilized the vector pCAGGS, a plasmid vector carrying a modified chicken β-actin promotor (24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 1193-2100Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment including the coding sequence of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase was prepared by PCR from the clone p41B. The primers contained a restriction site for XbaI, and the fragment obtained numbered 1557 bp, corresponding to positions 70-1626. The fragment was ligated into the XbaI site of the expression vector pCAGGS, and the construct was propagated in E. coli DH5a. DNA from the clones obtained was purified on Jetstar plasmid purification system. The insert could be cleaved out of the vector by digestion with XbaI, and the orientation was established by DNA sequencing. An estimated quantity of 10-15 μg of plasmid DNA, with the cDNA inserted in the correct way, was used to transfect approximately 2 × l06 cells. In a control experiment, a similar quantity of plasmid DNA with the cDNA inserted in the opposite direction was allowed to transfect the same number of cells. When incubating a homogenate of the transfected cells as described under “Experimental Procedures,” a significant sterol 12α-hydroxylase activity toward 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one could be demonstrated (Fig. 8). The degree of conversion was about 3% when assayed with a highly specific assay based on combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and utilization of specific ions (m/z 380 and m/z 382). In contrast, homogenates of mock transfected cells (using a construct with the coding region inversely inserted) (Fig. 8) or nontransfected cells had no significant enzymatic activity (below 0.2%). The sterol 12α-hydroxylase has long resisted purification, probably in part due to the low level of this cytochrome in the liver of species other than the rabbit and its unusual behavior on anion-exchange chromatography. The previously reported method of purification from rabbit liver (6Ishida H. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21319-21323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was repeated here and resulted in a homogenous preparation of the enzyme. Several attempts to clone the sterol 12α-hydroxylase from a rabbit liver library with use of antibodies directed toward the homogenous enzyme failed. The strategy that proved to be successful involved tryptic digestion in a polyacrylamide gel, followed by HPLC isolation of peptides that were sequenced and used for synthesis of oligonucleotides. The latter were used for screening of a rabbit liver library with a low degree of stringency. Several overlapping clones were obtained and sequenced prior to the finding of one that contained the whole coding sequence. The results of the present work confirm our previous finding that sterol 12α-hydroxylase is a species of cytochrome P-450. The similarity with other known CYPs was relatively small. It has been recommended that a CYP with a sequence identity with other CYPs of less than 40%, should be regarded as a family of its own (25Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Gunegerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, sterol 12α-hydroxylase should be regarded as a new family of cytochrome P-450, here denoted CYP12. It is surprising that CYP8, responsible for synthesis of prostacyclin (26Hara S. Miyata A. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Brugger R. Lottspeich F. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19897-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was the enzyme found to be most similar to CYP12. CYP7, responsible for the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, showed a homology with CYP12 lower than that of CYP8 but higher than that of any other cytochrome with known structure. The normal substrate for prostacyclin synthase is prostaglandin H2, which is converted into prostaglandin I2. In view of this, it is surprising that prostacyclin synthase has a domain with a structure believed to be “steroidogenic” in other CYPs. This domain had a similarity of 73.3% with the corresponding domain in CYP12. From an evolutionary point of view, sterol 12α-hydroxylase seems to have appeared at a similar time as prostacyclin synthase but later than cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase has a very high substrate specificity, and only cholesterol and the close substrate analogue cholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β-ol) are hydroxylated by the enzyme. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase has a rather broad substrate specificity including a number of 7α-hydroxylated C27 steroids (4Einarsson K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The substrate most efficiently 12α-hydroxylated seems to be 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (4Einarsson K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this connection, it is interesting to compare the steroidogenic region of the sterol 12α-hydroxylase with the corresponding region of other species of cytochrome P-450 (Fig. 4C). The homology was rather high with some CYPs that utilize C27-substrates (rabbit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (20Kai M. Eto T. Kondo K. Setoguchi Y. Higashi S. Maeda Y. Setoguchi T. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human cholesterol monooxygenase alternatively denoted “side-chain cleaving enzyme” (27Morohashi K. Sogawa K. Omura T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and human steroid 27-hydroxylase (28Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with CYPs that utilize C19- or C21-steroids as substrates (human steroid 17α-hydroxylase (29Picado-Leonard J. Miller W.L. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and steroid 21-hydroxylase (30Higashi Y. Yoshioka H. Yamane M. Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2841-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar)). However, a fairly marked homology was also found with niphedipine oxidase (CYP3A4 (31Beaune P.H. Umbenhauer D.R. Bork R.W. Lloyd R.S. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8064-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) and steroid 11β-hydroxylase (32Mornet E. Dupont J. Vitek A. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20961-20967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the enzyme was found to be expressed in relatively large amounts in rabbit and human liver, which is in accordance with the fact that cholic acid and its 7α-dehydroxylated product, deoxycholic acid, are the dominating bile acids in these species. The expression in rat and mouse liver appeared to be considerably less, possibly explaining previous difficulties to purify the enzyme from rat liver. Starvation of rats and mice, however, greatly increased both enzyme activity and mRNA levels, suggesting that the enzyme is regulated at a pretranslatory level in these cases. Availability of a cDNA for the sterol 12α-hydroxylase should pave the way for further studies on the mechanism of regulation of the enzyme under different conditions. The structural knowledge is also a prerequisite for designing synthetic competitors of the enzyme. Attempts are now being made in our laboratory to characterize the promoter region of the gene. In particular, it is of interest to see if there are structural similarities with the corresponding region of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.

Superantigen activated T-cells proliferate vigorously, and subsequently T-cell and monocyte derived cytokines are produced in large amounts. The released cytokines contribute to the development of toxin-induced disease processes (for a review see 1Scherer M.T. Ignatowicz L. Winslow G.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The best characterized superantigens are the staphylococcal enterotoxins. Based on sequence similarity, these may be divided into two subgroups: the first consists of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, D, E, and H (SEA SED, SEE, and SEH) and the second of staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C1-C3 (SEB, SEC1, SEC2, and SEC3) (reviewed in 2Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1990; 248: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The sequence identity of SEA to other staphylococcal enterotoxins ranges from 25 (SEC1) to 83% (SEE). In addition, SEA, SED, and SEE are all dependent on Zn2+ for high affinity binding to MHC class II molecules in contrast to SEB and SEC1-3 that bind MHC class II molecules independently of metal ions (3Fraser J.D.

Stauffacher C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), have created an understanding for the structural constraints by which superantigens interact with their target receptors. The structure of SEB, bound to a MHC class II molecule, confirmed that the superantigen binds to the α-chain of the MHC class II molecule, outside the peptide antigen-binding groove. The more distantly related superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, binds in a fashion similar to that of SEB, although it covers a larger area on the receptor and in addition utilizes a bound peptide antigen in the interactions (10Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Site-directed mutagenesis of SEA confirmed that co-ordination of Zn2+ is required for high affinity binding to MHC class II molecules. It was also shown that SEA most likely binds bivalently to both the α- and the β-chain, of two separate MHC class II molecules, utilizing a surface corresponding to the site previously defined in SEB in the first case and the Zn2+ binding site in the latter (11Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segren S. Bjork P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). SEB in contrast, binds monovalently to only the α-chain.The recently determined crystal structures of the free forms of SEA co-crystallized with Cd2+ (SEA-Cd2+), and SEC2 revealed a metal binding site in each protein. An octahedrally co-ordinated Cd2+ ion in SEA was located on the surface of the β-sheet of the C-terminal domain, whereas a tetrahedral co-ordination of a Zn2+ ion in SEC2 is observed at the interface between the N- and the C-terminal domains.In this study, the crystal structure of SEA, co-crystallized with its native “co-factor” Zn2+ at 2.7 Å resolution is presented and compared with the previously described SEA-Cd2+ structure. Further, the Zn2+ binding is analyzed using titration microcalorimetry. The biological implications of the mode of Zn2+ co-ordination in SEA are discussed with emphasis on metal ion assisted SEA-MHC class II interactions.DISCUSSIONZinc ions are essential for the activity of many enzymes and a structural component in many protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. A requirement of Zn2+ to obtain the strong affinity between the SEA and MHC class II molecules was first shown by Fraser and co-workers (3Fraser J.D. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Robinson H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5507-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues involved in the co-ordination of a Zn2+ ion on the SEA surface were identified by site-directed mutagenesis (11Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segren S. Bjork P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Fraser J.D. Lowe S. Irwin M.J. Gascoigne N.R.J. Hudson K.R. Huber B.T. Palmer E. Superantigens: A Pathogens View of the Immune System. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 7-29Google Scholar). When the residues Phe47, Asn128, His187, His225, or Asp227 are substituted for alanines the ability to induce MHC class II-dependent T-cell proliferation is markedly reduced (11Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segren S. Bjork P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because histidines and aspartates are preferred zinc ligands, it was speculated that the lowered bioactivity was due to impaired zinc binding and metal ion-dependent SEA-MHC class II interactions for His187, His225, and Asp227 (and possibly also for Asn128). A disruption of a SEB-like interaction with the MHC class II molecule α-chain was expected for the Phe47 to alanine substitution. As shown in the SEA-Cd2+ structure (4Schad E.M. Zaitseva I.

His187, His225, and Asp227 were shown to be direct high affinity zinc ligands, and Asn128 was shown to stabilize the conformation of Asp227 via a strong hydrogen bond. However, a comparison between the SEA-Cd2+ structure and the SEA-Zn2+ structure presented here reveals that the two refined structures are virtually identical, but with one important exception: the co-ordination of the bound metal ion.In the present structure the metal ion is co-ordinated without involvement of the N-terminal serine. We clearly observe a tetrahedral Zn2+ co-ordination in both molecules of the asymmetric unit. The two independent molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit have their respective metal binding site in different environments. In both molecules the three high affinity Zn2+ ligands are His187, His225, and Asp227. The fourth ligand, however, is His61 of the neighboring molecule in one case and a water molecule in the second. Thus, none of the molecules of the asymmetric unit utilizes the N terminus in Zn2+ co-ordination as observed for SEA co-crystallized with Cd2+. In fact, the N terminus (residues 1-9) is unordered in each of the molecules.If a Zn2+ ion could be octahedrally co-ordinated as the Cd2+ ion in the SEA-Cd2+ structure, one would expect this situation also in this SEA-Zn2+ structure, at least in the second molecule where no symmetry molecule interactions are observed, instead a water molecule is used as the fourth ligand in tetrahedral co-ordination. However, one possible explanation to this contradiction could be due to different crystallization conditions. Although both Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions could adopt tetrahedral as well as octahedral co-ordination in nonprotein environments, the norm for protein bound Zn2+ ions is tetrahedral (reviewed in 13Valleé B.L. Auld D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).The thermodynamic properties for the SEA-Zn2+ 1:1 complex are dominated by the large and positive entropy, ΔSo = 146 J (K mol)−1. The possibility to perform a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the process in terms of dissecting the different contributions to the thermodynamic properties is dependent on heat capacity data, which at the moment are not available. However, the most likely dominating contribution to positive entropy change are ΔShydr-prot, which is the change in hydration of the protein when Zn2+ is bound, and ΔShydr-Zn, which is the change in entropy for transferring the fully hydrated Zn2+ ion to the protein binding site. In addition, either positive or negative contributions from ΔSion, the entropy change upon proton exchange when binding a ligand to a protein, can occur. The sign of this latter contribution depends on whether there is a positive or a negative proton linkage in the reaction.One possible interpretation of these thermodynamic properties is that a reduction in conformational degrees of freedom occurs upon metal binding, subsequently dehydrating hydrophobic surface residues. An ordering of the N terminus upon Zn2+ binding could possibly explain the thermodynamic properties discussed above, although not observed in any of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the present crystal structure. In this context it should be stressed that the form of SEA used here is the product from predicted signal peptide processing, whereas SEA purified from its native host Staphylococcus aureus is a mixture of this and of two truncated forms lacking three or five N-terminal residues, with the latter two as the major forms.2 Thus, none of the shorter forms could co-ordinate the metal ion as observed in the SEA-Cd2+ structure. A thermodynamic analysis of such truncated variants of SEA would be invaluable to the interpretation of the biological significance of the differential metal ion binding modes observed in the SEA-Cd2+ and the present structure.The crystal structure of SEC2 revealed a bound zinc ion in the domain interface region, a metal binding site distinct from the one observed in SEA. The Zn2+ co-ordinating residues were Asp83, His118, and His122 from one molecule and Asp9 from a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice (6Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to SEA, SED and SEE, SEB/SEC-MHC class II molecule interactions do not require zinc ions. Thus, the most likely explanation for the function of the zinc ion bound to SEC2 is that it serves a structural function, possibly by stabilizing the domain-domain interactions. However, from a crystallographical point of view, this situation resembles the case for SEA-Zn2+ observed in this study. As described above, one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit utilizes His61 of the neighboring molecule as the fourth Zn2+ ligand. Thus the loop 59-63, that normally is highly mobile, becomes ordered due to the zinc-mediated protein-protein interaction.Interestingly, in the formation of the SEA-MHC class II complex, three Zn2+ ligands are postulated to be derived from the superantigen and the fourth from the receptor (11Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segren S. Bjork P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The postulated co-ordinating residue in the MHC class II β-chain is an exposed histidine residue, His81 (14Herman A. Labrecque N. Thibodeau J. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. Sekaly R.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9954-9958Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the N terminus as oriented in the SEA-Cd2+ structure would have to disengage from the metal ion in order to allow the ligand function of the MHC class II residue. The ligand function of His61 from the neighboring SEA molecule in the asymmetric unit observed in the current structure may thus mimic the SEA-MHC class II β-chain Zn2+-dependent interaction. Judged from the previous SEA-Cd2+ and the present SEA-Zn2+ co-crystal structure, a model for this interaction could be regarded in which the N terminus of SEA can be utilized in the co-ordination of zinc but is released upon MHC class II molecule interactions. A second option would be that the N terminus is not at all involved in zinc binding. The latter case will most surely exist in vivo where naturally occurring SEA can have three or five residues removed in the N terminus compared with the material used in this study and by Schad and co-workers (4Schad E.M. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V.N. Dohlsten M. Kalland T. Schlievert P.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Svensson L.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3292-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, a full understanding of the interactions in the SEA-MHC class II molecule complex will have to await the crystal structure of such a protein complex.

Superantigen activated T-cells proliferate vigorously, and subsequently T-cell and monocyte derived cytokines are produced in large amounts. The released cytokines contribute to the development of toxin-induced disease processes (for a review see 1Scherer M.T. Ignatowicz L. Winslow G.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The best characterized superantigens are the staphylococcal enterotoxins. Based on sequence similarity, these may be divided into two subgroups: the first consists of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, D, E, and H (SEA SED, SEE, and SEH) and the second of staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C1-C3 (SEB, SEC1, SEC2, and SEC3) (reviewed in 2Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1990; 248: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The sequence identity of SEA to other staphylococcal enterotoxins ranges from 25 (SEC1) to 83% (SEE). In addition, SEA, SED, and SEE are all dependent on Zn2+ for high affinity binding to MHC class II molecules in contrast to SEB and SEC1-3 that bind MHC class II molecules independently of metal ions (3Fraser J.D.

Stauffacher C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), have created an understanding for the structural constraints by which superantigens interact with their target receptors. The structure of SEB, bound to a MHC class II molecule, confirmed that the superantigen binds to the α-chain of the MHC class II molecule, outside the peptide antigen-binding groove. The more distantly related superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, binds in a fashion similar to that of SEB, although it covers a larger area on the receptor and in addition utilizes a bound peptide antigen in the interactions (10Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Site-directed mutagenesis of SEA confirmed that co-ordination of Zn2+ is required for high affinity binding to MHC class II molecules. It was also shown that SEA most likely binds bivalently to both the α- and the β-chain, of two separate MHC class II molecules, utilizing a surface corresponding to the site previously defined in SEB in the first case and the Zn2+ binding site in the latter (11Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segren S. Bjork P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). SEB in contrast, binds monovalently to only the α-chain.The recently determined crystal structures of the free forms of SEA co-crystallized with Cd2+ (SEA-Cd2+), and SEC2 revealed a metal binding site in each protein. An octahedrally co-ordinated Cd2+ ion in SEA was located on the surface of the β-sheet of the C-terminal domain, whereas a tetrahedral co-ordination of a Zn2+ ion in SEC2 is observed at the interface between the N- and the C-terminal domains.In this study, the crystal structure of SEA, co-crystallized with its native “co-factor” Zn2+ at 2.7 Å resolution is presented and compared with the previously described SEA-Cd2+ structure. Further, the Zn2+ binding is analyzed using titration microcalorimetry. The biological implications of the mode of Zn2+ co-ordination in SEA are discussed with emphasis on metal ion assisted SEA-MHC class II interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2039835979,"Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade has been widely associated with cell proliferation; previous studies have shown that angiotensin II (AII), acting on 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, stimulates the MAPK pathway. In this report we investigate whether the MAPK pathway is required for the mitogenic response to AII stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from the hypertensive rat (SHR-VSM). AII stimulates the phosphorylation of MAPK, as determined by Western blot specific for the tyrosine 204 phosphorylated form of the protein. This MAPK phosphorylation was inhibited by the presence of the inhibitor of MAPK kinase activation, PD 098059. Using a peptide kinase assay shown to measure the p42 and p44 isoforms of MAPK, the stimulated response to AII was inhibited by PD 098059 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15.6 ± 1.6 μM. The AII stimulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited by PD 098059 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 17.8 ± 3.1 μM. PD 098059 had no effect on AII-stimulated phospholipase C or phospholipase D (PLD) activity. When the SHR-VSM cells were stimulated with phorbol ester, there was an activation of MAPK similar in size and duration to the response to AII, but there was no significant enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation. There was also no activation of PLD by phorbol ester, while AII produced a robust PLD response. Diversion of the product of the PLD reaction by 1-butanol caused a partial loss of the [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine response; this did not occur with tertiary butanol, which did not interfere with the PLD reaction. These results show that in these cells the MAPK cascade is required but not sufficient for the mitogenic response to AII, and suggest that the full mitogenic response requires both MAPK in conjunction with other signaling components, one of which is PLD."

The interaction trap assay revealed weak interactions between Mor and both α and σ70; consistent with a key role of α-D258, the D258A substitution abolished interaction, whereas the R265A substitution did not.

This unwinding was enhanced or abolished in Up or Down spacer-region mutants, respectively, indicating that it may play a role in the activation of transcription.

Restriction enzymes, Taq polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were from Boehringer Mannheim; DNase I was obtained from Worthington, and nucleotide triphosphates were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Additional reagents were from Sigma. All enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mor was purified as described previously (10Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant α subunits were overexpressed and purified as described previously (27Igarashi K. Ishihama A.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); and the holoenzymes were reconstituted by mixing the core enzymes with a 4-fold molar excess of σ70 subunit. The C-terminal truncated σ70 subunit was purified as described previously (17Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Wild-type RNAP used in DNase I footprinting was a gift from M. T. Record, Jr. Plasmids pEG202, pJG4-5, and pSH18-34 (28Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) were used for the interaction trap assay. Plasmids pHT f1α265A and pHT f1α258A (29Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Fenyo D. Chait B. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3058-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were used as templates for PCR amplification of the αCTD mutants. The “extended −10” promoter (13Kumar A. Malloch R.A. Fujita N. Smillie D.A. Ishihama A. Hayward R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) construct pIA51 was made as follows. Oligonucleotides IRI68 (CCGAAGCTTTCGTTGCGTTTGTTTGCACGAGCTCTATG) and IRI69 (GCCGGATCCTTAGGAAATTATAACATAGAGCTCGTGCA) were annealed to each other, filled in with Taq polymerase, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and cloned into HindIII and BamHI sites of the pUC19-spf' vector (30Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Plasmid pIA54 is a derivative of pKM90 (7Mathee K. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5314-5323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a XhoI site inserted immediately downstream of the BamHI site. Plasmid pIA89 contains the NdeI-XhoI mor gene fragment from pIA54, which was cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pJG4-5, along with an EcoRI-NdeI linker (top strand, AATTGGCTGGTGGTGCTGGAGC; bottom strand, TAGCTCCAGCACCACCAGCC) designed to retain the reading frame of the B42-Mor fusion. Plasmid pIA91 contains sequence encoding the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNAP (amino acid residues 236-329), which was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of strain MH5385 (11Kahmeyer-Gabbe M.L. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides IRI104 (CTAGAATTCGATGTACGTCAGCCTGAA) and IRI105 (AGTCTCGAGCGGTTACTCGTCAGCGAT) in a standard amplification (25 cycles of 40 s at 94°C, 40 s at 55°C, 40 s at 72°C; then followed by 7 min at 72°C); PCR product was purified using a Qia spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned into similarly digested pEG202. Plasmid pIA93 contains sequence encoding the C-terminal part of the σ70 subunit of RNAP (amino acid residues 530-613), which was amplified as above with oligonucleotides IRI106 (TACGAATTCCTGCCGCTGGATTCTGCGA) and IRI107 (ATCCTCGAGCGATTAATCGTCCAGGAA) and cloned into pEG202 using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The mutant αCTDs containing Ala substitutions at positions 265 and 258 were PCR-amplified using pHTf1α265A and pHTf1α258A plasmids as templates and cloned into pEG202 as described above, resulting in pIA121 and pIA123, respectively. The sequences of amplified fragments were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing analysis of the plasmid clones. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (28Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) was transformed by standard methods (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) with plasmids expressing LexA-fusions and B42-fusions, together with the reporter plasmid pSH18-34; cells were grown on CM (complete minimal) triple dropout plates (Ura− His− Trp−) supplemented with 2% glucose (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Liquid cultures for β-galactosidase assays were grown in CM triple dropout media supplemented with 2% total sugar (2% glucose or 1.5% raffinose + 0.5% galactose) to A600 of 0.5-1.0. Samples of 10 ml were added to 200 μl of 1% cycloheximide on ice, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer Z (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Cells were made permeable by the addition of 50 μl each of 0.1% SDS and chloroform and vortexing for 20s; then cells were diluted 10-fold with buffer Z. Samples (1 ml) were preequilibrated at 30°C; assays were initiated by the addition of 200 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in H2O) and terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 1 M Na2CO3. Activities were determined using the standard procedure (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Linear templates for in vitro transcription were generated by PCR amplification of either pIA51 (PRE#) or pKM43 (Pm)(7) using primers annealing upstream of the HindIII site (IRI78; TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG) and downstream of the EcoRI site (IRI13; ATTGTGAGCGGATAACAA) of pUC19-spf'. The resulting constructs should generate transcripts of 120 nucleotides (PRE#) and 163 nucleotides (Pm), respectively. DNA template (∼75 fmol), Mor (10 pmol), and reconstituted RNA polymerase holoenzyme (1 pmol) were preincubated in 20 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 30°C. Single-round reactions were initiated by the addition of unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates (ATP, UTP, and GTP to 200 μM; CTP to 20 μM), heparin (100 μg/ml), and 5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), then incubated 15 min at 37°C, and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (98% formamide, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). Portions (2-3 μl) were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed overnight at −80°C with screens to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Linear DNA fragments containing Pm sequences from −115 to +71 were PCR-amplified from pMK100 (11Kahmeyer-Gabbe M.L. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a standard reaction (10Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a combination of one unlabeled primer (either top: MLK12, −115 to −96; or bottom: MLK16, +71 to +52) and the second primer end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Fragments containing Pm sequences from −62 to +10 were made analogously from pIA14 (10Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primers IRI21 and IRI22 (10Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes were formed for 30 min at 30°C using purified Mor (1 μg), RNAP (8 μg), and linear DNA fragment (20 ng) in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, and 10 ng/μl of carrier calf thymus DNA in a 50-μl volume. Then 10 ng of DNase I in 50 μl of 5 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2 were added, followed by incubation for 45 s at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution (200 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml tRNA), extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, dissolved in loading buffer, and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Markers were generated by Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of the same DNA fragments. To determine whether the C-terminal regions of the α and σ70 subunits of RNAP are involved in middle promoter function, we assayed the ability of reconstituted holoenzymes containing C-terminal deletions in the α or σ70 subunits (truncated at amino acids 235 and 529, respectively) to direct transcription from linear templates containing Pm or the control promoter PRE#. Because the PRE# promoter contains the “extended −10” region (13Kumar A. Malloch R.A. Fujita N. Smillie D.A. Ishihama A. Hayward R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), rendering it active in the absence of the C terminus of σ70, and lacks an UP element, making it insensitive to deletions of the αCTD, this promoter was used to determine the activity of the mutant enzymes and for normalization of activity at Pm. The σ70 deletion resulted in a dramatic reduction of Pm activity relative to PRE# (Fig. 2); in fact, there was no transcript detectable. Deletion of the αCTD led to a less dramatic but still substantial (∼20-fold) loss of Pm transcription. Because the C-terminal regions of α and σ70 contain not only activator contact sites but also the DNA-binding regions (17Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A.

Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), this experiment did not distinguish whether the reduced ability of mutant holoenzymes to support transcriptional activation at Pm was due to the loss of DNA binding or contact with Mor. To determine the relative positions of Mor and RNAP bound at Pm, we used DNase I footprinting with purified wild-type E. coli holoenzyme and purified Mor. Consistent with previous findings (11Kahmeyer-Gabbe M.L. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Mor protected positions −56 to −33 from digestion by DNase I (Fig. 3). The addition of RNAP resulted in extension of the protected region downstream to position +14, a protection pattern characteristic of open and intermediate complexes (33Ozoline O.N. Tsyganov M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4533-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the top strand, position −25 remained sensitive to cleavage; the hypersensitive sites detected previously from −29 to −31, using crude extracts of a Mor-overproducing strain (11Kahmeyer-Gabbe M.L. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were not observed here, raising the possibility that subtle differences in the proteins, the footprinting conditions, or the presence of host factors caused their appearance. The addition of RNAP also resulted in extended protection of positions −59 to −62 on the top strand upstream of bound Mor, while the intervening positions −57 and −58 remained accessible to cleavage. This pattern of upstream protection remained the same when both short (Fig. 3A) and long (Fig. 3, B and C) promoter fragments were used, suggesting that it does not result from binding of polymerase to the ends of the linear template. On the bottom strand, the effect of RNAP addition on cleavage in the −59 to −62 region was more subtle and appeared to be an enhancement rather than reduction in cleavage. This polymerase-dependent upstream protection could be most easily explained by binding of the αCTD, which is known to interact with DNA in this region in some promoters, especially those containing UP elements (16Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Although single-point mutations in this region of Pm do not confer a “down” phenotype in vivo (10Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the region is AT-rich, as are UP-like elements (24Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and might allow specific or nonspecific binding of the αCTD. When binding of RNAP to Pm was assayed in the absence of Mor, it did not result in a completely clear footprint, but there was weak protection in the region from −62 to −6, and several positions (−53, −51, −15, −12, +11 on the top strand, and −47 on the bottom strand) were notably hypersensitive (Fig. 3). We are inclined to believe that this pattern results from specific rather than nonspecific binding of RNAP because we used an excess of competitor DNA and the same amount of RNAP as used for footprinting with Mor, and there was no binding to flanking sequences in the template. Comparison of the footprints with RNAP alone to those with RNAP and Mor reveals that RNAP interacts with the region to be bound by Mor as well as several bases upstream. The addition of Mor causes dramatic changes in the footprint, clearly altering the association of RNAP with the DNA. Furthermore, the addition of Mor appears to shift polymerase-dependent upstream protection, perhaps by displacing the αCTD to a position farther upstream. A similar displacement has been seen at galP1 and shown to require the αCTD (16Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The αCTD is known to comprise an independently folded protein domain containing two groups of amino acid residues implicated in UP element utilization and, therefore, DNA binding: 262-269 and 296-299 (34Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 35Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4358-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the role of the αCTD at Pm involves α-DNA interaction, α-Mor interaction, or both, we assayed Pm transcription using reconstituted holoenzymes containing single Ala substitutions at positions 258 through 275 and positions 297 and 298. Because the activities of the reconstituted holoenzymes could vary, we determined the specific effect of substitutions in the αCTD on Pm activation by comparison of the Pm activity to that observed with the control promoter PRE#. The transcripts produced are shown in Fig. 4A, with the ratio of Pm to PRE# promoter activity in Fig. 4B. Among the mutant enzymes tested, there were four that had a significant effect on Pm activation, reducing transcription to less than one-half of that observed with wild-type enzyme; they contained substitutions D258A, L262A, R265A, and N268A. The D258A substitution had the greatest effect, resulting in a decrease in promoter activity almost as large as that occurring with the enzyme deleted for the entire αCTD. In previous experiments, the three other substitutions (L262A, R265A, and N268A) decreased transcription stimulation by the rrnBP1 UP element, suggesting that they may reduce α-DNA binding, but the D258A change did not (34Gaal T.

As a control, we tested our reconstituted holoenzymes with D258A, L262A, and R265A substitutions for transcription from an UP element-dependent but activator-independent form of rrnBP1,"

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). Through its multifaceted effects, TGF-β2 plays important regulatory roles in a host of biological events, from embryogenesis through repair processes, to regulation of the immune system. Hence, the regulation of TGF-β2 gene in various systems warrants detailed investigation. The studies presented here focus on the transcriptional regulation of the TGF-β2 gene in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and their differentiated counterparts, which represent a model system of early embryonic development (reviewed in 3Rizzino A. Rosenblum I.Y. Heyner S. Growth Factors in Mammalian Development. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 113-134Google Scholar). Given the importance of TGF-β2 production in implantation and in tumor malignancy (4Clark D.A. Lea R.G. Podor T. Daya S. Banwatt D. Harley C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Previous work demonstrated the presence of a critical positive regulatory region in the TGF-β2 gene promoter, localized between −77 and +63, where +1 is the transcription start site (7O'Reilly M.A. Geiser A.G.

This region contains a functional CRE/ATF motif, which is indispensable for the positive effect of this promoter region in different cell types and capable of binding activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) in vitro. Recently, computerized sequence analysis demonstrated that the human TGF-β2 promoter also contains a CACGTG motif between −50 and −45, which conforms to the consensus sequence of an E-box motif, CANNTG (10Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this E-box motif appears to be evolutionarily conserved, since the same CACGTG sequence is present in the chicken TGF-β2 promoter, and it is located in the same position relative to the similarly conserved CRE/ATF site and the TATA box of the chicken promoter (11Burt D.W. Paton I.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the putative E-box motif localizes to the previously identified positive regulatory region, which has been shown to be inactive in undifferentiated EC cells, but becomes active when EC cells are induced to differentiate, and, consequently, express TGF-β2 both at the RNA and protein levels. E-box motifs in other gene promoters have been shown to bind members of the bHLH-LZ family of transcription factors, including c-myc (12Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

Therefore, we examined whether the putative E-box motif in the TGF-β2 gene promoter is involved in negative and/or positive regulation of the gene in several cell types. Our results demonstrate that the −50/−45 E-box motif is critical for the positive effect of the −77/+63 regulatory region of the TGF-β2 gene promoter in differentiated cells derived from both murine and human EC cells. We also demonstrate that the transcription factors USF1 and USF2 are able to bind to this site in vitro before and after differentiation of EC cells. Importantly, similar observations were made in JAR and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Finally, a dominant-negative USF2-expression vector was used to demonstrate that USF transcription factors are utilized as positive transactivators of the TGF-β2 gene in differentiated cells derived from EC cells. transforming growth factor-β2 cAMP response element activating transcription factor 1 embryonal carcinoma double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide leucine zipper polymerase chain reaction. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). All-trans-retinoic acid was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. All cell lines were maintained and induced to differentiate as described previously, unless indicated otherwise (1Rizzino A. Dev.

Dev. 1995; 40: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with slight modifications of the original method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors: pepstatin A, antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml), benzamidine (2.5 mM), aprotinin (2.5 KIU/ml). Nuclear extracts of F9 EC cells and F9differentiated cells also contained protein phosphatase inhibitors: (NH4)2MoO4 (1 mM) and NaF (5 mM). The dialysis buffer contained the same protease inhibitors at a 10-fold lower final concentration. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Gel mobility shift assays were based on the method of Fried and Crothers (26Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The protocol and reaction conditions used in this report were the same as described previously (24Kelly D. Scholtz B. Orten D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the exception that all binding reactions contained MgCl2 at a final concentration of 3 mM. In addition, binding reactions with JAR, JEG-3, and MCF-7 cell nuclear extracts were supplemented with 1.5 μl of 1 M NaCl and 1 μl of 0.25 M NaH2PO4 per 20-μl reaction mixture to promote binding of nuclear proteins. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with F9 EC cell and F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts, and for 40 min at room temperature with JAR, JEG-3, and MCF-7 cell nuclear extracts. The double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) probes containing the wild type or mutant E-box motif were as follows (the putative transcription factor binding site is underlined): wild type E-box probe: 5′-ggcAGACACGTGGTT-3′, and its complement, 5′-ctgAACCACGTGTCT-3′; mutant E-box dsODN: 5′-ggcAGACGAGTGGTT-3′, and its complement, 5′-ctgAACCACTCGTCT-3′ (the mutations are double-underlined). When annealed, the probes had 5′ overhangs (shown in lowercase), which permitted radioactive labeling by Klenow fill-in reaction. The nonspecific DNA competitor used in the gel mobility shift assays was 0.05 μg/μl poly(dI)·;poly(dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For supershift analyses, the binding reactions were incubated overnight at 4°C with the antibodies and the blocking peptides indicated, prior to the addition of the labeled probe. The USF1- and USF2-specific antibodies (catalog nos. sc-229 and sc-862, respectively) and their respective blocking peptides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels were run at 4°C in high ionic strength buffer (50 mM Tris base, 380 mM glycine, 2 mM EDTA). Site-directed mutagenesis of the −50/−45 E-box motif (numbering is according to Noma et al. (27Noma T. Glick A.B. Geiser A.G. O'Reilly M.A. Miller J. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) was carried out using a slight modification of the PCR-based “megaprimer” method for mutagenesis, using the same cycle conditions as described previously (23Kingsley-Kallesen M. Johnson L. Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1996; Google Scholar). Primers for the first PCR were: Primer 1: 5′- CGCGCGTTGGCCGATTCA-3′, and the mutagenic primer annealing to the E-box motif (the mutated bases are in lower case): 5′-TCTCTCTGAACCACtcGTCTGCCTTC-3′. Primers for the second PCR were: the “megaprimer,” which is the product of the first PCR, and Primer 2: 5′-GCCATTGGGATATATCAACGGTGGTA-3′. The mutant promoter fragment produced by the second PCR was cloned into the pGEM4-SVOCAT plasmid digested with PstI and KpnI. The entire promoter insert of the mutant clones was sequenced to verify the presence of the desired point mutations in the E-box motif, and to ensure that the Pfu polymerase did not introduce additional point mutations during PCR. F9-differentiated cells (day 3), JAR cells, and MCF-7 cells were transfected in monolayer by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier, New York1986: 286-289Crossref Google Scholar) as described previously (23Kingsley-Kallesen M. Johnson L. Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A.

The normalization plasmid pCH110 (Pharmacia) contains the β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the SV-40 promoter. In some experiments (as indicated in the figure legends) the pCMVβg-normalizing plasmid was used, which contains the β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the CMV promoter (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA). TGF-β2/CAT chimeric gene constructs were prepared as described previously (8Kelly D. O'Reilly M. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Kingsley-Kallesen M. Johnson L. Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1996; Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression plasmid producing a dominant-negative USF2 protein was obtained from Dr. Michéle Sawadogo (University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (29Meier J.L. Luo X. Sawadogo M. Straus S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6896-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified by tip-500 columns (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). To determine the role of the −50/−45 putative E-box motif in TGF-β2 promoter activity, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to introduce point mutations in the E-box motif in our promoter/reporter gene constructs. The wild type E-box motif was changed to CGAGTG in the mutant constructs, since mutations in the CACGTG core E-box sequence have been shown to significantly inhibit binding of members of the bHLH-LZ family of transcription factors (30Kerkhoff E.

One of the constructs that was selected for mutagenesis, pβ2-77, contains the −77/+63 fragment of the human TGF-β2 promoter. This region acts as a positive regulatory region of the TGF-β2 promoter in all cell types studied (7O'Reilly M.A. Geiser A.G. Kim S.-J. Bruggeman L.A. Luu A.X. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19938-19943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kelly D. O'Reilly M. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We also introduced the same point mutations in the pβ2-528 construct, which contains 528 base pairs of the promoter region upstream from the transcription start site. This allowed us to test the function of the E-box in the context of a larger promoter region (Fig. 1; the point mutations are in lowercase). To test the effects of these changes, differentiated cells derived from the murine EC cell line, F9, or the human EC cell line, NT2/D1, were transiently transfected with the wild type or the mutant promoter/reporter gene constructs (Fig. 2, A and B). Activity of the pβ2-40 construct served as the base line, since this construct does not contain the E-box or the CRE/ATF site, and has a very low basal activity in all cell lines studied (7O'Reilly M.A. Geiser A.G.

Biol. 1992; 153: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results show clearly that mutations in the E-box motif significantly reduce TGF-β2 promoter activity in both cell lines, not only in the shorter construct, pβ2-77E, but also in the context of a larger promoter region, in the pβ2-528E construct. Similar results were obtained when the function of the E-box motif was studied in JAR choriocarcinoma cells (Fig. 2C), MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D), and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (data not shown). In NT2/D1-differentiated cells, mutation of the E-box motif consistently resulted in slightly lower reduction of promoter activity than what was observed with the mutated CRE/ATF site, suggesting that cell-type specific differences may exist in utilization of these cis-regulatory elements. Nevertheless, the average reduction in promoter activity by the E-box mutation was in a similar range (60-80%) to that observed with mutations in the CRE/ATF motif in both constructs (9Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Kingsley-Kallesen M. Johnson L. Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1996; Google Scholar), indicating that both cis-regulatory elements are functional and critical for the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter in the different cell types.Fig. 2Functional analysis of the TGF-β2 E-box motif. F9-differentiated cells (A), NT2/D1-differentiated cells (B), JAR choriocarcinoma cells (C), and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (D) were transfected in monolayer with the wild type and mutant TGF-β2 promoter/CAT plasmids together with the β-galactosidase normalizing plasmids. The normalizing plasmid was pCH110 in A and B, and pCMVβg in C and D. Plasmids pβ2-77M and pβ2-528M contain two point mutations within the CRE/ATF site of the promoter insert, whereas plasmids pβ2-77E and pβ2-528E contain two point mutations within the E-box motif. Bars, CAT activities of the plasmids relative to the activity of the pβ2-40 construct. CAT activities of pβ2-40 in F9-differentiated, NT2/D1-differentiated, JAR, and MCF-7 cells were 6702, 802, 372, and 1423 cpm, respectively. All experiments in this figure were repeated at least three times with similar results, using duplicate plates for each plasmid in A and B, and triplicate plates in C and D. Standard deviations (S.D.) are shown for these experiments; similar S.D. values were observed in parallel experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gel mobility shift analysis was employed to identify the transcription factors that bind to the TGF-β2 E-box motif in vitro. First, E-box-binding activities in nuclear extracts of EC cells and their differentiated counterparts were compared, since the promoter is inactive in the undifferentiated cells, but becomes active when the cells are induced to differentiate. F9 EC cell nuclear extracts formed one major and two minor DNA-protein complexes with the wild type E-box dsODN probe in the binding assays (Fig. 3, A and B). The minor complexes can be observed more readily in Fig. 3B. The intensities of the minor complexes varied between experiments and never approached the intensity of the major complex. F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts also formed one major DNA-protein complex with the wild type E-box probe, plus a minor DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3, A and B). Both DNA-protein complexes formed with nuclear extracts of F9-differentiated cells co-migrated with two of the complexes formed by F9 EC cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 3, A and B). These complexes bound specifically to the E-box motif in the dsODN probe, since they were competed effectively with a 25-fold molar excess of the same, unlabeled dsODN containing the wild type E-box motif, but not with the same excess of the mutant dsODN harboring two critical point mutations in the E-box motif. Importantly, nuclear extracts prepared from PYS-2 cells, NT2/D1 EC cells, or NT2/D1-differentiated cells formed very similar DNA-protein complexes when incubated with the wild type E-box probe, with the exception that the minor complex migrating just above the major complex could be observed only with nuclear extracts prepared from F9 EC cells (data not shown). PYS-2 cells were included in this study, because these EC-derived differentiated cells also express TGF-β2. Finally, no DNA-protein complexes formed when nuclear extracts prepared from F9 EC cells or their differentiated cells were incubated with the labeled mutant dsODN as the probe (data not shown). Interestingly, DNA binding by the major E-box binding protein was abolished by treatment with diamide, a commonly used oxidizing agent, but was unaffected by boiling the nuclear extracts for 10 min (data not shown). Since it has been shown that of the E-box binding bHLH-LZ transcription factors, USF proteins are both thermostable (33Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitive to oxidation (34Pognonec P. Kato H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24563-24567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether USF1- and USF2-specific polyclonal antibodies could recognize the DNA-protein complexes formed between nuclear extracts and the E-box probe. A USF2-specific polyclonal antibody caused the formation of a supershifted DNA-protein complex both in F9 EC cell and F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, addition of USF1-specific antibody to the binding reaction resulted in the formation of two supershifted complexes both in F9 EC and F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 3B). Neither antibodies recognized the minor DNA-protein complexes, since no change in their migration or intensities was observed. Although the supershift of the major complex by USF2-specific antibody appears to be incomplete (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 9), this is not due to inadequate amounts of the antibody, since dilution of the nuclear extracts did not result in a more complete supershift. Rather, it appears that the remaining E-box binding complex is likely to be formed by a homodimer of USF1, since the USF1-specific antibody caused a nearly complete supershift of the major E-box binding complexes (Fig. 3B). It should also be noted, that the supershifted USF1 complex, which is the faster migrating of the two supershifted complexes in Fig. 3B, is clearly distinct from the minor complex observed in either F9 EC or F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts, as demonstrated by their different mobilities in 8% polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). Furthermore, the slower migrating supershifted complex formed with USF1-specific antibody co-migrates with the single supershifted complex formed with USF2-specific antibody; thus, these complexes are likely to contain a heterodimer of USF1 and USF2. Both antibodies caused a decrease in the binding of the supershifted complexes, which is a frequently observed phenomenon in gel supershift reactions with mono- or polyclonal antibodies resulting from the recognition of epitopes in the DNA binding domain of transcription factors. Overall, our data suggest that both a heterodimer of USF1/USF2 and a homodimer of USF1 can bind to this E-box motif in vitro, but we cannot exclude the possibility that a small amount of USF2 homodimer binds to this site. We also examined the E-box binding transcription factors produced by JAR cells and MCF-7 cells, because the E-box motif is critical for TGF-β2 promoter activity in these cell lines. Gel mobility shift analyses demonstrated that nuclear extracts prepared from MCF-7 cells form a very intense DNA-protein complex with the dsODN probe (Fig. 4A). Although in some experiments a minor complex appears to migrate just below the intense complex, the presence of this minor complex was quite variable, and, thus, does not appear to be significant. Nuclear extracts from JAR and JEG-3 cells also form an intense band, which appears to consist of two DNA-protein complexes that migrate very close to one another (Fig. 4A). The presence of the two complexes is readily apparent at shorter exposures of the autoradiogram (data not shown). In addition, both JAR and JEG-3 nuclear extracts form a second less intense complex that migrates faster than the main complex. The formation of this complex, like the one observed with extracts prepared from MCF-7 cells is variable. Importantly, each of the complexes observed with nuclear extracts from these three cell lines bound specifically to the E-box motif, as determined by competition analyses with the wild type and mutant E-box dsODNs. It is noteworthy that, although equal amounts of nuclear extracts (micrograms of protein) were used in the gel mobility shift assays, JEG-3 cell nuclear extracts appear to contain significantly less TGF-β2 E-box binding activity than the other two cell lines (Fig. 4A). Supershift analyses using USF1- and USF2-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of both USF1 and USF2 in the DNA-protein complexes, although significantly more USF1 homodimer appears to bind to the E-box motif in JAR cell nuclear extracts, than in other cell nuclear extracts tested (Fig. 4B). In this regard, increasing the amount of the USF1 antibody in other experiments caused a nearly complete supershift of the DNA-protein complexes bound to the E-box motif; whereas addition of the USF2 antibody along with the USF1 antibody did not cause a supershift of the residual DNA-protein complexes (data not shown). It should also be noted that, despite the similarity of the USF proteins, the USF1- and USF2-specific antibodies do not crossreact. This is demonstrated by the fact that the supershift by USF2-specific antibody can be blocked only with a peptide fragment derived from USF2, but not with the blocking peptide derived from USF1 and vice versa (Fig. 4B). In this regard, the blocking peptides used in our gel shift studies are the same USF1 or USF2 peptides used to generate the respective antibodies. Despite the binding of USF proteins to the TGF-β2 E-box motif in vitro, the possibility still remained that other bHLH-LZ proteins are responsible for the E-box-dependent promoter activity in vivo. Therefore, we employed a eukaryotic expression plasmid in transient transfection assays (psvUSF2ΔB) that expresses a murine USF2 mutant protein, which lacks the region required for DNA binding (amino acids 228-247) (29Meier J.L. Luo X. Sawadogo M. Straus S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6896-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since specific DNA binding by hetero- or homodimers of USF proteins requires the presence of both proteins' DNA binding domains (14Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 35Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H. Sawadogo M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the ectopically expressed mutant USF2 protein would effectively sequester wild type, endogenous USF1 and USF2 proteins in complexes that are unable to bind to E-box motifs. Cotransfection of plasmid psvUSF2ΔB (expressing mutant USF2) with the pβ2-77 promoter/reporter construct reduced promoter activity by approximately 60% in F9-differentiated cells (Fig. 5). This effect appears to be conveyed specifically through the E-box motif of the promoter, since at the same time no change was observed in the activities of two different normalizing plasmids, pCH110 or pCMVβg (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), which are under the control of the SV-40 promoter and the CMV promoter, respectively. This observation argues that USF transcription factors contribute directly to the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter in F9-differentiated cells. It should be noted that we observed an average differential of 7-fold between the CAT activity expressed by the pβ2-77 construct and the activity of the pβ2-40 construct when transfected into F9-differentiated cells (Fig. 5). However, in some experiments a smaller differential was observed (Fig. 2A). This variability is likely to result from several experimental conditions, particularly the extent of differentiation exhibited by the population of F9 EC cells treated with all-trans-retinoic acid. Nevertheless, the differences observed between the activities of the unmodified promoter/reporter gene constructs and their mutated counterparts were consistently larger (approximately 70%) than the standard deviations (<10%) observed between experiments. Our studies identify a critical cis-regulatory element in the human TGF-β2 gene promoter, which conforms to the consensus binding site of the bHLH-LZ family of transcription factors. The intact E-box motif is required for TGF-β2 promoter activity in several cell types, including differentiated cells derived from murine and human EC cells (F9 EC and NT2/D1 EC, respectively), as well as two choriocarcinoma cell lines (JAR and JEG-3) and a breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7). These observations, together with the fact that the E-box motif is conserved in a comparable region of the chicken TGF-β2 gene promoter, suggest that transcription factors binding to the E-box motif, in conjunction with other factors binding to a similarly conserved CRE/ATF motif nearby, play an important role in TGF-β2 gene expression in various systems. In this regard, our gel mobility shift analyses demonstrated that protein complexes containing USF1 and USF2 transcription factors are capable of binding to the TGF-β2 E-box motif in nuclear extracts of all cell types studied. Moreover, using a dominant-negative mutant of USF2 protein in F9-differentiated cells, we determined that binding of USF proteins to the E-box motif appears to be critical for the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter in cells. Interestingly, overexpression of USF1 or USF2 in the transfected F9-differentiated cells induced a general increase in transcription without a preferential increase in the expression of the TGF-β2 promoter/reporter gene constructs (data not shown). This suggests that USF1 and USF2 are not limiting for the expression of the TGF-β2 gene in F9-differentiated cells. The data presented here also suggest that TGF-β2 E-box binding activities, comprised of USF1/USF2 heterodimers and USF1 homodimers, do not change dramatically upon differentiation of EC cells, similarly to CRE/ATF binding activities (9Scholtz B. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The same observation was made with a murine (F9) and a human (NT2/D1) EC cell line and their differentiated cells and with the parietal endoderm-like PYS-2 cell line, which shares many characteristics with F9-differentiated cells. This was surprising, since the region of the TGF-β2 promoter containing these cis-regulatory elements is inactive in undifferentiated EC cells. One possible explanation is that, although DNA-binding ability of the USF complexes is unaffected by the differentiation status of the cells, they are unable to transactivate in the undifferentiated cells, perhaps due to their different state of phosphorylation. In this regard, it has been suggested that the transactivator domain of USF1 could be converted into an acidic activation domain upon phosphorylation of the multiple serine and threonine residues found in this region (37Kirschbaum B.J. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, treatment of F9 EC or F9-differentiated cell nuclear extracts with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase does not appear to affect DNA binding, migration, or the supershift pattern of the USF complexes (data not shown). Nevertheless, without thorough analysis of the phosphorylation pattern of USF proteins, it cannot be excluded that TGF-β2 E-box binding USF-complexes have different transactivator abilities before and after differentiation of EC cells resulting from differential phosphorylation. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that USF complexes may not bind effectively to the TGF-β2 E-box motif before differentiation of EC cells due to chromatin structure, or methylation of the binding site. Alternatively, transcription factors that bind to other cis-regulatory elements in the TGF-β2 gene may interfere with the function of transcription factors that bind to the CRE/ATF motif and/or the E-box. Last, it is important to note that the E-box motif is positioned between an upstream CRE/ATF site and the downstream TATA box motif, and, based on the distance between them, all three motifs are positioned to face the same side of the DNA helix. This raises the possibility of direct or indirect interactions between the transcription factors binding to these cis-regulatory elements and the basal transcription machinery, which are necessary for the formation of an active preinitiation complex. In this regard, the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of several members of the bLZ and bHLH-LZ families of transcription factors have been shown to participate in various interactions with viral proteins or with other transcription factors (38Liu F.

In addition, USF proteins have been shown to interact with TFIID binding to the TATA box motif (43Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter is regulated through modulation of these essential protein-protein interactions. We thank Michéle Sawadogo for the generous gift of the dominant-negative USF2 plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W1992111340,"We have identified a previously unreported DNA-binding protein, HS2NF5, which interacts with a conserved sequence within hypersensitive site II (HS2) of the human β-globin locus control region. A minimal DNA recognition sequence of TGTTCTCA was defined. The binding site for HS2NF5 overlaps an E box, which is a preferred recognition site in vitro for the erythroid-specific transcription factor TAL1 (SCL). No evidence for TAL1 (SCL) binding was found using nuclear extracts from K562 and MEL erythroleukemia cells. Mutations that prevent HS2NF5 binding reduce the enhancer activity of HS2 by 40 and 38% in transient and stable transfection assays, respectively. Analytical gel filtration and velocity centrifugation studies revealed a Stokes' radius of 23.0 A and an s20,w of 3.45 for HS2NF5. Based on these parameters, a native molecular mass of 34,679 Da was calculated. An ultraviolet light cross-linking assay was used to cross-link HS2NF5 to a minimal oligonucleotide. The cross-linking results are consistent with a protein of 33,396-38,309 Da. We propose that HS2NF5 is a novel DNA-binding protein that modulates the transcriptional activation property of the β-globin locus control region."

These analyses also identified (i) Arg-546 as the major site of proteolytic activation, (ii) the protease resistance of the C-terminal extension beyond the catalytic domain, and (iii) in vivo stoichiometric phosphorylation of Thr-778 in the mature enzyme. Homology modeling of the catalytic domain indicated that phosphothreonine 778 functions as an anchoring site similar to Thr-197 in cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which stabilizes an active site compatible with preferred substrate sequences of PAK-1/PKN. Sigmoidal autophosphorylation kinetics and increased S6-(229-239) peptide kinase activity following preincubation with ATP suggested phosphorylation-dependent activation of PAK-1/PKN. The onset of activation corresponded with phosphorylation of the regulatory domain site Ser-377 (located within a spectrin homology region), followed by Thr-504 (within a limited protein kinase C homology region), and, to a lesser extent, Thr-64 (in the RhoA-binding region). Several additional sites in the hinge region adjacent to a PEST protein degradation signal were selectively autophosphorylated following cardiolipin activation. Overall, these observations suggest that the regulation of this class of protein kinase involves complex interactions among phosphorylation-, lipid-, and other ligand-dependent activation events.

The protease prefers substrates that contain glutamic acid or glutamine at the P2′ position. The catalytic role of these residues has been studied by using a highly specific fluorogen substrate, 2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(NO2)-Gln-Arg (substrate QR), and its counterpart (substrate ER) containing Glu in place of Gln. The newly designed substrate ER that contains a pair of charged residues at P2′ and P3′ sites is the most specific substrate described so far for HIV-1 protease. The specificity rate constant (kcat/Km = 2.1 × 107 M−1 s−1) approaches, but does not reach, the diffusion limit. This follows from the appreciable solvent kinetic deuterium isotope effects on the rate constants, indicating that, independent of the salt concentration, the rate-limiting step of the catalysis is a chemical process rather than a physical one. The reaction also has positive entropy of activation. On the other hand, the rate-limiting step for substrate QR changes with increasing salt concentration from a physical to chemical step, while the negative activation entropy becomes positive. The rate increase with substrate ER is 50-fold with respect to substrate QR in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and diminishes to 3.5-fold at 2.0 M NaCl concentration, as a consequence of a considerable rate increase at high salt concentration with substrate QR but not with substrate ER. The Km value is much lower for the substrate ER (0.8 μM) than for substrate QR (15 μM), indicating a more effective binding for substrate ER at 0.1 M NaCl. Unexpectedly, the strong binding appears to be achieved by the unionized form of Glu in P2′, as follows from the remarkably different pH-rate profiles for substrates QR and ER.

A long cleft formed at the interface of the dimer harbors the catalytically competent aspartyl residues, Asp-25 and Asp-25′ (the prime refers to the second subunit), contributed by each subunit. The cleft also contains eight subsites that accommodate P4, P3, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, P3′, and P4′ residues of an octapeptide substrate. The substrate is cleaved between the P1 and P1′ residues.In a previous study (3Polgár L. Szeltner Z. Boros I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9351-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have shown that a substrate of moderate specificity, Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Leu-Phe(NO2)-Gln-Ala-Nle (substrate Q) is hydrolyzed at the Leu-Phe(NO2) bond about 40 times faster by HIV-1 protease when Glu is substituted for the Gln in P2′. To establish the catalytic role of Glu in P2′, in this work the fluorogen 2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(NO2)-Gln-Arg (4Toth M.V. Marshall G.R. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1990; 36: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) has been chosen which is one of the most effective substrates of HIV-1 protease. Upon binding, a salt-bridge is formed between the P3′ Arg and the enzymic carboxy group of Asp29′ (5Miller M. Schneider J. Sathyanarayana G.K. Toth M.V. Marshall G.R. Clawson L. Selk L. Kent S.B.H. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 246: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and thus it will be called substrate QR. Its counterpart peptide containing Glu in P2′ named as substrate ER was synthesized and analyzed kinetically. The new substrate ER turned to be the most specific substrate of HIV-1 protease and differed in several respects from substrate QR, showing kinetic isotope effects, positive activation entropy, and a much narrower pH optimum which indicated that the protonated Glu in P2′ is the catalytically competent form of substrate ER.RESULTSThe pH dependence of the reaction of substrate QR with HIV-1 protease has been measured at varying NaCl concentrations. As reported in Fig. 1, the kcat/Km values conform to bell-shaped pH-rate profiles and increase markedly with the ionic strength. Fig. 2 shows that the rate increase exhibits a concave up fashion. The pKa values do not change very much with the ionic strength, with the exception of pK1 at 2.0 M NaCl (Table I). The increase of kcat/Km with NaCl concentration is the consequence of both an increase in kcat and a decrease in Km (Table II).Fig. 2Effect of NaCl concentration on the limiting value of the specificity rate constant for substrate QR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters of HIV protease catalysisSubstrate[NaCl]kcat/Km (limit)pK1pK2mmM−1s−1QR0.1414 ± 123.30 ± 0.066.32 ± 0.07QR0.5737 ± 223.53 ± 0.056.14 ± 0.06QR1.01,317 ± 413.56 ± 0.056.17 ± 0.06QR2.04,492 ± 1594.01 ± 0.086.26 ± 0.08ER0.121,032 ± 83274.21 ± 0.114.76 ± 0.11ER2.015,645 ± 40204.72 ± 0.115.44 ± 0.11ER/QR0.150.8ER/QR2.03.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIEffects of ionic strength on kinetic parametersSubstrate[NaCl]pHkcatKmkcat/Kmms−1μmμm−1·s−1QR0.14.805.8015.20.38QR1.04.909.258.731.06QR2.05.0019.485.983.25ER0.14.525.460.846.5ER2.05.154.140.696.0 Open table in a new tab Compared with substrate QR, substrate ER reacts at a much higher rate, kcat/Km being of about 50-fold at 0.1 M NaCl but only of 3.5-fold at 2.0 M salt concentration (Fig. 3 and Table I). Furthermore, the rate constant for substrate ER does not increase with the NaCl concentration, and the active pH range is narrower. The effects of NaCl concentration on kcat, Km, and kcat/Km are reported in Table II. A slight decrease with increasing ionic strength can be observed for both kcat and Km, which results in a virtually unchanged specificity rate constant. It may be noticed that kcat decreases with the salt concentration for substrate ER, while for substrate QR it increases.Fig. 3pH dependence of kcat/Km (a) and 1/Km (b) for the reactions of substrate QR.

Solvent kinetic deuterium isotope effects characteristic of general base catalysis were found with substrate ER (Table III) in the presence of both 0.1 M and 2.0 M NaCl. The ratios of the rate constants were calculated at the maximum activities, where small changes in pH did not significantly interfere with the results. Surprisingly, with substrate QR an isotope effect characteristic of general base catalysis was only observed at high ionic strength, whereas at low salt concentration a significant isotope effect was not found (Table III).Table III.Kinetic deuterium isotope effectsSubstratepH[NaCl]kcat/Km (H2O/2H2O)mQRaMeasured under first order conditions.5.000.11.02QRaMeasured under first order conditions.4.492.01.93QRbMeasured under Michaelis-Menten conditions.5.002.02.32ERbMeasured under Michaelis-Menten conditions.4.520.12.21ERbMeasured under Michaelis-Menten conditions.5.152.01.88ERcCalculated from limiting values extracted from pH dependence curves.2.02.29a Measured under first order conditions.b Measured under Michaelis-Menten conditions.c Calculated from limiting values extracted from pH dependence curves.

The temperature dependence and the related parameters of the pH-rate profile for substrate E are shown in Fig. 4 and Table IV, respectively. It is seen that pK1 does not virtually change with temperature, while pK2 decreases slightly. Table V shows that the substrates containing Glu at P2′ display positive ΔS*, whereas those having Gln exhibit negative ΔS*. The difference between the two types of substrate is also illustrated by the Eyring plots of Fig. 5, showing much steeper slopes with substrate ER than with substrate QR. The two least square lines for substrate ER (0.1 M and 2.0 M NaCl) are seen to cross one another near 25°C. In the case of substrate QR, the activation parameters are significantly dependent on the ionic strength (Fig. 5 and Table V). While ΔS* values concerning substrates E and ER are positive with respect to kcat/Km, they are negative for kcat.Fig. 4Temperature and pH dependences of the reaction of HIV-1 protease with substrate E.

In vitro studies using phorbol esters have implicated the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway as being involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell, a role for PKC in regulating IRS-1 expression was examined. In an MCF-7 cell line (MCF-7-PKC-α) that exhibits multiple alterations in PKC isoform expression, IRS-1 content was reduced to negligible levels relative to parental MCF-7 cells. This decrease in IRS-1 content was associated with a 30-fold reduction in IRS-1 transcription. In parental MCF-7 cells, PKC inhibitors (GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) and staurosporine) reduced IRS-1 content. Chronic exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; >8 h) reduced IRS-1 content and down-regulated the novel PKC-δ isoform. Bryostatin 1 inhibited TPA-induced depletion of both IRS-1 and PKC-δ expression in MCF-7 cells. Associated with TPA-induced reduction in IRS-1 content was a reduction in IRS-1 transcription.

Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Each globular region is composed of a pair of EF hand Ca2+-binding domains, which include all amino acid residues in CaM apart from residues 1-8 at the N terminus and 76-81 in the central helix (2Persechini A. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We shall refer to these regions as the N-terminal leader and the central helix linker, respectively. CaM appears to recognize in its enzyme targets basic amphiphilic helix-forming segments that are generally termed CaM-binding domains; there is no consensus amino acid sequence for these regions (3Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 4James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

The simplest model for CaM-dependent enzyme activation is one in which the CaM-binding domain also functions as an intrasteric inhibitor whose influence is relieved when it is bound by CaM. In a more complex model, occupancy of the CaM-binding domain is insufficient for enzyme activation and further, secondary, CaM-target interactions are required. Data for CaM-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase activity suggest that this latter model may apply, while much of the available data for CaM-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities are consistent with the former (6VanBerkum M.F.A.

Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified engineered CaMs were determined from their optical absorbances in the presence of 50 μM CaCl2 using extinction coefficients derived from quantitative amino acid composition data: E2760.1% = 0.31 for both CaMN32 and CaMN14, E2570.1% = 0.26 for CaM14C, and E2570.1% = 0.20 for CaM32C. Previously published extinction coefficients were used for native CaM, CaMCC, and CaMNN (8Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J.

For Ca2+-binding studies, it was necessary to determine extinction coefficients for engineered CaMs decalcified as described previously (8Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These all are within 10% of the values determined in the presence of 50 μM CaCl2, except the E2570.1% values for CaMN32 and CaMN14, which are 0.15 and 0.14, respectively.Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK) was expressed in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus and purified as described by Fitzsimons et al.

Stull.Data for activation and inhibition of CaM-dependent enzyme activities were measured at 25°C in the presence of 200 μM CaCl2. These data were analyzed according to single-site activation or competitive inhibition models as described previously (8Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All enzyme activities are expressed relative to the maximal enzyme activities measured in the presence of 100 nM CaM, which are ∼300 nmol/min/mg protein for nNOS and ∼20 μmol/min/mg protein for skMLCK or smMLCK.Ca2+ binding by native and engineered CaMs was measured at 25°C using the flow dialysis technique as described in detail by Stemmer and Klee (16Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The buffer used for these experiments contained 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, with variable amounts of added Ca2+. The concentration of engineered or native CaM in each experiment was 20 μM. Data were corrected for loss of Ca2+ ion from the dialysis chamber during the experiment (16Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe structures of the four engineered CaMs used in this study are schematically represented in Fig. 1. As shown in the figure, junctions in the interconnecting loops between the EF hand pairs and between the EF hands and the leader and linker sequences in CaM were utilized in constructing intramolecular substitutions between the EF hand pairs. Two additional engineered proteins constructed for this study are CaMP1, in which the changes L116P and E139P have been made, and CaMP2, in which the changes are P43L and P66E.In the CaM-nNOS complex, the C-terminal EF hand pair in CaM can be functionally replaced by the N-terminal EF hand pair, so it is not surprising to find that Kact and Fact values for activation of nNOS activity by CaMN32 and CaMN14 are not significantly different from the values determined with native CaM (Fig. 2; Table I). In contrast, the N-terminal EF hand pair cannot be replaced by the C-terminal pair in the CaM-nNOS complex (Table I). Data for activation of nNOS activity by CaM32C and CaM14C indicate that EF hand domain I contains the major unique determinants for activation of this enzyme activity by CaM, although domain II appears to contain additional minor unique determinants (Fig. 3; Table I). Since CaMCC activates skMLCK activity nearly as well as native CaM, it is not surprising to find that CaM32C and CaM14C are good activators of this enzyme activity (Fig. 3; Table I). CaMN14 is also a good activator of skMLCK activity, suggesting that there are no significant unique determinants for activation of this kinase activity in EF hand domain III (Table I). The poor activation of skMLCK activity seen with CaMN32 suggests that EF hand domain IV contains the major unique determinants for activation of skMLCK activity (Fig. 2; Table I). The dependences of skMLCK and smMLCK upon unique determinants in the C-terminal lobe are qualitatively similar (Table I). However, CaM14C and CaM32C both fail to activate smMLCK activity, indicating a marked dependence upon unique determinants in both N-terminal EF hand domains. This contrasts sharply with skMLCK activity, which is essentially fully activated by CaM14C or CaM32C (Table I). Furthermore, EF hand domain IV contains significant unique determinants for smMLCK binding; none of the EF hands contains unique determinants having a major effect on binding of nNOS or skMLCK to CaM (Table I). Although CaMNN is an extremely poor activator of both smMLCK and skMLCK activities, they are significantly activated by both CaMN14 and CaMN32 (Table I). Similarly, CaMCC fails to activate nNOS activity, but both CaM14C and CaM32C significantly activate this enzyme activity. To a good approximation these observations can be explained by additivity in the effects of single EF hand replacements, although when the properties of CaMs containing single and double EF hand replacements are compared, a significant degree of synergy is also indicated (Table I).Fig. 2Activation of enzyme activities by CaMN14 or CaMN32.

We have found that neither these prolines nor the corresponding residues, Leu-116 and Glu-139, in EF hand IV are unique determinants for CaM-dependent activation of skMLCK activity (Table I). Based on the properties of CaMP2, we find the EF hand II prolines to be minor unique determinants for activation of both smMLCK and nNOS activities (Table I). The properties of CaMP1 indicate that Leu-116 and/or Glu-139 are major unique determinants for activation of smMLCK activity (Table I). Either or both of these residues also appear to be minor determinants for activation of nNOS activity, insofar as our data suggest that CaMP1 is a better activator of this enzyme activity than native CaM (Table I).The Ca2+-binding properties of CaMN32, CaM32C, CaM14C, CaMN14, CaMNN, and CaMCC were determined; the enzyme activation properties of the latter two of these proteins have been previously described and are summarized in Table I (8Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All these engineered proteins were found to bind four Ca2+ ions with high affinity, indicating the presence of four functional EF hands (Table II). Ca2+-binding values for CaMNN and CaMCC are fit well by Equation 2 with K1 = K2 and α = β (Fig. 4). The fits obtained using this simple two-parameter model and those using Equation 1, a four-parameter model, are not significantly different (Fig. 4). The “effective” binding constant, α(K1)2, for each I-II EF hand pair in CaMNN is ∼10-fold greater than the corresponding value for each III-IV EF hand pair in CaMCC. Values for the interaction factor, α, are <1 for both proteins, indicating positive cooperativity between the EF hands in each pair, and the α value for CaMCC is 2-3-fold less than the value for CaMNN, suggesting a greater degree of cooperativity within the CaMCC EF hand pairs. Values for Ca2+ binding to native CaM can be adequately fit using Equation 2 with K1 and α fixed to the values obtained for CaMCC (Table II). The values for K2 and β thus obtained are similar to the corresponding values for CaMNN (Table II). It is also evident from an inspection of the Ca2+-binding profiles for CaMCC, CaMNN and CaM that the CaM profile is a composite of the CaMCC and CaMNN profiles (Fig. 4). Values for Ca2+ binding to CaM14C and CaMN14 are similar to values for Ca2+ binding to CaM and CaMNN, respectively (Fig. 5; Table II). It is striking that the parameter values obtained for Ca2+ binding to the I-IV EF hand pair in CaM14C and CaMN14 are quite similar to those obtained for the native I-II EF hand pair in either CaM or CaMNN (Table II). In contrast, Ca2+-binding values for CaMN32 or CaM32C cannot be satisfactorily fit to Equation 2 if parameters for the native EF hand pair in each of these proteins are fixed to the values determined with CaMNN or CaMCC (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the best fits thus obtained produced substantially different fitting parameters for the III-II EF hand pair in each protein (Table II). Values for Ca2+ binding to these proteins can be fit well using equation 1 (Fig. 6).Table II.Parameters for Ca2+ binding data to native and engineered CaMsCaMCaMNNaTwo identical pairs of sites assumed; see “Materials and Methods.”CaMN14CaMN32CaMCCaTwo identical pairs of sites assumed; see “Materials and Methods.”CaM14CCaM32CN4.104.004.074.003.994.144.24K18.9621.4721.4721.478.968.968.96α0.120.290.290.290.120.120.12K226.3221.066.2026.497.68β0.410.360.950.573.53a Two identical pairs of sites assumed; see “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Comparison of Ca2+ binding to bovine CaM, CaMNN, and CaMCC.

The power of this approach is that it can be used to identify and study those structural features or determinants in a protein that are responsible for its unique functional properties. This method has been applied in investigations of CaM by constructing and evaluating chimeras between CaM and either cardiac troponin C or a yeast calmodulin homolog (7George S.E. Su Z. Fan D.

CaM also contains internal homology between the two EF hand pairs, which have quite distinct properties with respect to both activation of target enzyme activities and binding of Ca2+ ion (8Persechini A.

Although all four EF hands bind Ca2+ and share significant sequence similarity, EF hands I and III or II and IV share the greatest degree of sequence similarity and occupy structurally analogous positions in the EF hand pairs (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The structural analogy between EF hands I and III and between EF hands II and IV is also evident in the structures of the CaM-peptide complexes that have been determined, where these EF hands are related by an approximate two-fold axis (12Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 13Ikura M. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Thus, a comparison only of EF hands I and III or II and IV is relevant to our goal in this study, which was to further define the functional specialization of the CaM lobes. Put another way, it is the differences between EF hands I and III or II and IV, not I and IV or II and III, that define the two EF hand pairs in CaM.Fig. 7Models for native and engineered EF hand pairs. α-Carbon traces of the main-chain atoms in the native N- and C-terminal CaM lobes are colored red and blue, respectively. α-Carbon traces of the engineered protein are two-toned, reflecting their chimeric structure.

https://openalex.org/W2096855131,"Rapamycin and FK506 have unique cellular effects despite the fact that they bind to the same set of immunophilins, the FK506 binding proteins (FKBP). We have previously reported that rapamycin (RAP) stimulates sodium transport in A6 cells. FK506 did not stimulate sodium transport but did inhibit the stimulation seen in RAP-treated cells. Since FKBP12 has been shown to have sequence homology with an endogenous inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC inhibition has been shown to increase Na+ channel activity in A6 cells, studies to determine the effect of RAP on PKC activity and its relationship to sodium transport were performed. Here we report that RAP stimulates sodium transport, and the effect is not additive to that seen with a cell-permeant inhibitor of PKCα and -β subtypes. RAP significantly inhibits endogenous PKC activity in A6 cells both in membrane and cytosolic preparations. There is a strong correlation between the degree of inhibition of PKC activity and the stimulation of sodium transport by RAP. RAP has no effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activity over this time course. Purified recombinant FKBP12 with or without FK506 has no effect on PKC activity when incubated with a rat brain-derived PKC preparation of known activity. By contrast, RAP plus FKBP12 significantly inhibits PKC activity. RAP plus FKBP12 inhibits the PKCα and not the -β subtype. The results demonstrate inhibition of PKC activity by RAP and not FK506 through its binding to FKBP12. The inhibition of PKC activity by RAP stimulates sodium transport in A6. The results therefore imply the existence of an endogenous RAP-like ligand which when bound to FKBP12 could regulate Na+ channel activity through this mechanism. Rapamycin and FK506 have unique cellular effects despite the fact that they bind to the same set of immunophilins, the FK506 binding proteins (FKBP). We have previously reported that rapamycin (RAP) stimulates sodium transport in A6 cells. FK506 did not stimulate sodium transport but did inhibit the stimulation seen in RAP-treated cells. Since FKBP12 has been shown to have sequence homology with an endogenous inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC inhibition has been shown to increase Na+ channel activity in A6 cells, studies to determine the effect of RAP on PKC activity and its relationship to sodium transport were performed. Here we report that RAP stimulates sodium transport, and the effect is not additive to that seen with a cell-permeant inhibitor of PKCα and -β subtypes. RAP significantly inhibits endogenous PKC activity in A6 cells both in membrane and cytosolic preparations. There is a strong correlation between the degree of inhibition of PKC activity and the stimulation of sodium transport by RAP. RAP has no effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activity over this time course. Purified recombinant FKBP12 with or without FK506 has no effect on PKC activity when incubated with a rat brain-derived PKC preparation of known activity. By contrast, RAP plus FKBP12 significantly inhibits PKC activity. RAP plus FKBP12 inhibits the PKCα and not the -β subtype. The results demonstrate inhibition of PKC activity by RAP and not FK506 through its binding to FKBP12. The inhibition of PKC activity by RAP stimulates sodium transport in A6. The results therefore imply the existence of an endogenous RAP-like ligand which when bound to FKBP12 could regulate Na+ channel activity through this mechanism. Tacrolimus (FK506), cyclosporin, and rapamycin (RAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RAPrapamycinFKBPFK506 binding proteinsPKCprotein kinase CDTTdithiothreitolPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatecPKCclassical PKCPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are known to have effects on T-cell activation and proliferation. These effects are mediated through the interaction of the drug with its binding protein or immunophilin. The immunophilins are divided into two broad classes, the FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and the cyclophilins, both of which are characterized by peptidyl-prolyl cis-isomerase (rotamase) activity. The FK506 binding proteins bind both FK506 and RAP and are named for their molecular weights (FKBP12, FKBP56, FKBP25). The cyclophilins bind the structurally distinct macrocyclic peptide cyclosporin. The immunosuppressive effects of these agents are not mediated solely by the drug themselves or by the immunophilin to which they bind. Rather the binding of drug to the immunophilin exposes an effector region on the drug which then inhibits downstream pathways (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At present it is know that two distinct drugs that bind to the same immunophilin can have drastically different effects. For example, although FK506 and RAP both bind with high affinity to FKBP12 only FK506 inhibits calcineurin (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RAP·FKBP complex has been found to inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting p70S6 kinase activation (22Calvo V. Crew C.M. Vik T.A. Bierier B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). rapamycin FK506 binding proteins protein kinase C dithiothreitol phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate classical PKC polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F506-F511PubMed Google Scholar), each acting through unique pathways. In addition, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity has been shown to increase sodium channel activity in cell-attached patches of A6 (3Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that RAP stimulates transepithelial sodium transport in A6 (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect is seen within 15 min of addition and persists for 4 h. An excess of FK506 had no effect on basal transport but completely inhibited the RAP-induced effect. This suggested that the effect was mediated through a RAP-immunophilin complex (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since both drugs bind to the same set of immunophilins. In this regard, FKBP12 is known to have sequence homology to an endogenous PKC inhibitor I-2 (11Goebel M.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 1051-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggested that RAP might inhibit PKC activity through its interaction with this immunophilin. RAP has been found to block a classical PKC (cPKC)-dependent and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent stimulation of p70S6kinase activity (12Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 22Calvo V. Crew C.M. Vik T.A. Bierier B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While RAP has no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (12Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), the effect of RAP on cPKC activity has not been reported. The effect might be peculiar to the RAP·FKBP12 complex since it has been clearly demonstrated that FK506 does not have an effect on PKC activity (13Ruff V. McGee J.E. Yem A.W. Deibel M.R. Leach K.L. Immunol. Invest. 1992; 21: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Studies were therefore performed to determine the effect of RAP on PKC activity and its relationship to sodium transport in A6. A6 cells were grown as described previously in amphibian media in 10% fetal calf serum on millicell inserts (Millipore Corp.) and studied when they exhibited stable electrical resistance (10-14 days) (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) was measured in a sterile in-hood modified Ussing chamber as described previously (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nystatin was added to the apical solution (100 units/ml) to permeabilize the apical membrane while the cells were in the short-circuited state. The peak of the subsequent increase in Isc was recorded (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a measure of maximal Na+/K+-ATPase activity. A6 cells were exposed to drug or diluent for the appropriate time and then washed three times with ice-cold calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped from the filters using a rubber policeman into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), sodium vanadate (0.1 mM), okadaic acid (0.5 μM), and 10% glycerol. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant represents the crude cytosolic fraction, and the pellet represents the crude membrane fraction. Alternatively, crude cytosolic and membrane fractions were made as described above but from cells not exposed to drug in vivo. Samples were protein-matched and then exposed in homogenization buffer to a final concentration of RAP (1 μM), N-myristoylated PKC inhibitor (50 μM), phorbol myristic acid (PMA) or RAP (10 nM) and FK506 (1 μM), and PKC activity was measured. PKC activity was measured using a Spinzyme assay kit (Pierce, catalog number 29510) using fluorescent dye labeled n-acetylated peptide sequence (4Shaeffer J. Hawk A.

This is a specific substrate of α, β, and γ isoforms of PKC and a poor substrate for PKA (14Farrar Y.J. Vanaman T.C. Slevin J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude cytosolic or membrane fractions containing 10 μg of protein were mixed with reaction buffer to a final concentration of 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.002% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.2 mM phosphatidyl L-serine, pH 7.4, and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 30°C. Bound phosphorylated substrate was eluted using 0.1 M ammonium HCO3− and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 8, and detected by measuring absorbance at 570 nM. To generate a standard curve, absorbance was measured in samples containing a range of known activity (0-0.020 units per reaction) of protein kinase C from rat brain. 1 unit of specific activity is defined as the amount that will transfer 1 nmol of phosphate to histone H1 per min at 30°C. To determine if RAP or FK506 affected exogenous PKC activity in the presence of exogenous FKBP12, PKC activity from rat brain of known activity (10 microunits) was incubated in the presence of 7 μg of purified human recombinant FKBP12 from Escherichia coli (15Sierkierka J.J. Wiederrecht G. Greulich H. Boulton D. Hung S.H.Y. Cryan J. Hodges P.J. Sigal N.H. J. Biol.

Reaction buffer to a final concentration of 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.002% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.2 mM phosphatidyl L-serine, pH 7.4, was then added and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 30°C, and PKC activity was determined. In parallel experiments, FKBP12 was incubated with PKCα or PKCβ subtypes in the presence or absence of RAP, and PKC activity was determined as described above. This was performed as described previously (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase activity is determined from the difference between Pi released in control tubes and that released in identical samples containing 1 mM ouabain (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was performed as described previously (23Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E.

Crude cytosolic and crude membrane fractions were protein-matched and solubilized in sample buffer containing 5% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. Samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 5% stacking gels and 15% separating gels. Rainbow colored molecular weight standards (Sigma) were run in adjacent lanes. For FKBP12 detection, samples were solubilized in sample buffer containing 10 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) and were heated overnight at 37°C, and then for 20 min at 95°C. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (23Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and transfers were overlaid with 1:1000 dilutions of specific primary antibody in 1% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (1% Blotto). Reactive proteins were detected with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody in 1% Blotto and signal-detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). N-myristoylated Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg-Gln, representing the pseudo-substrate sequence from cPKCα and -β, was obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). This is a highly specific inhibitor which is N-terminally myristoylated to allow membrane permeability (16Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A.

RAP was obtained from BIOMOL and stored as a 2 mM solution in ethanol at −70°C and diluted into serum-free media on the day of the experiment. Human recombinant FKBP12 expressed in E. coli and rat brain PKC and PKCα and -β subtypes from rat brain were obtained from Sigma. Protein kinase C assay materials were from Pierce. FKBP12 antibody directed against amino acids 3-16 of the FKBP12 was the kind gift of Dr. Andrew Marks and Dr. Thottala Jayaraman of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine (27Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.-M.

Monoclonal antibody against the PKCα subtype (catolog number P16520) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance on Number Cruncher statistical software (NCSS, Hintze, Kaysville, UT). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. We have previously shown that 1 and 10 nM RAP stimulates transepithelial sodium transport in A6 cells and that this effect is blocked by a 100-fold excess of FK506 (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the dose-response relationship of this effect, cells were exposed to dilutions of RAP, and the short circuit current at 1 h was measured and expressed as the % increase relative to control Isc. These data are shown in Fig. 1. The Kd is approximately 10 nM. Sodium channel activity in A6 cells is known to be modulated by several hormones each acting through unique pathways (4Shaeffer J. Hawk A. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Vasopressin activates sodium channels through a PKA-associated phosphorylation (4Shaeffer J. Hawk A.

Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C246-C250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the stimulation of sodium transport by insulin or vasopressin was similar to the time course seen with RAP, we considered the possibility that RAP might be acting through a common pathway. As shown in Fig. 2, the simultaneous addition of insulin and RAP resulted in an additive effect on sodium transport compared with when RAP was added alone. Cells exposed to vasopressin had a significant increase in sodium transport, and when RAP was added after 60 min to these cells, there was a further stimulation of transport. These data suggest that RAP stimulates sodium transport via an independent mechanism.Fig. 2The stimulation of sodium transport by rapamycin is additive to stimulatory effects of insulin or vasopressin.

Invest. 1992; 21: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the effect of RAP on stimulating sodium transport might be through the inhibition of PKC. To determine the effect of PKC inhibition on sodium transport, we exposed A6 cells to an N-myristoylated cell-permeant peptide pseudosubstrate sequence of the PKCα and -β isoforms and measured the effect of Isc. As shown in Fig. 3, the PKC inhibitor stimulated sodium transport. When the PKC inhibitor and RAP were added simultaneously to A6 cells, no additional stimulation of Isc was noted. This suggested that the mechanism of action of RAP on stimulation of sodium transport was via inhibition of PKC activity. PKC activity was measured in crude cytosolic and membrane fractions that were exposed to either PKC inhibitor, RAP, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in vitro. PMA is known to stimulate PKC activity and inhibit sodium transport in these cells (18Yanase M. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C517-C522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailove I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, PKC activity was significantly inhibited by both the PKC inhibitor and RAP in the membrane fractions. PKC activity in the cytosol was significantly inhibited by RAP, although not by the PKC inhibitor. PMA stimulated PKC activity in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions. We next measured PKC activity in the crude cytosolic and crude membrane fractions from cells that were exposed for 1 h to either 50 nM PKC inhibitor, 1.2 μM RAP, 1.2 μM FK506, or 0.1 μM PMA. As shown in Table II, PKC activity is greatest in the membrane fractions of control cells. As expected, PKC activity was stimulated in the membrane fractions of PMA-treated cells and decreased in the cytosol (25Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). The PKC activity was significantly inhibited in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions of cell treated with the N-myristoylated PKC inhibitor. RAP inhibited PKC activity to the same degree as the PKC inhibitor in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. FK506 had no effect on PKC activity in either the cytosol or the membrane fraction. (Cytosol: control, 8.8 ± 0.4; FK506, 8.9 ± 0.4 units; Membrane: control, 13.8 ± 0.30; FK506, 13.9 ± 0.4 units. n = 4). To determine if the effect of the agents on activity was due to changes in the association of the PKCα isoenzyme with the membrane and cytosolic fractions, the experiment shown in Fig. 4 was performed. PMA treatment resulted in a decrease in the amount of PKCα isoenzyme in the cytosolic fraction and an increase in the membrane fraction relative to control as has been described previously (35). Although RAP inhibits PKC activity in the membrane fraction (Table II), RAP did not inhibit the association of the PKCα isoenzyme with the membrane fraction (Fig. 4).Table I.Rapamycin inhibits PKC activity in crude cell preparations of A6 exposed to drug in vitroCytosolMembraneCON11.43 ± 0.23313.86 ± 0.04RAP9.02 ± 0.17ap < 0.001 versus control.9.24 ± 0.34ap < 0.001 versus control.PKC inhibitor9.69 ± 0.4129.31 ± 0.34ap < 0.001 versus control.PMA12.83 ± 0.57814.77 ± 0.32a p < 0.001 versus control.

FK506 prevented the RAP-associated inhibition of PKC activity (Table II). This implied the presence of FKBP12 in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Immunoblots of membrane and cytosolic fractions with an antibody directed against FKBP12 are shown in Fig. 5. FKBP12 was detected in both fractions (Fig. 5, lanes A and C). Detection of the protein in the membrane fractions required treatment with sample buffer containing 10 mM DTT and overnight incubation at 37°C and then heating for 20 min at 100°C before SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, lane C). To determine the relationship of the inhibition of PKC activity with the stimulation of sodium transport by RAP, the dose-response curves for the inhibition of PKC activity and the stimulation of sodium transport by RAP were compared as follows. A6 cells were exposed to serial dilutions of RAP or diluent (1 × 10−5-1 × 10−10 M), Isc was measured at 1 h and recorded as relative to control Isc at 1 h. Cells were then scraped and PKC activity measured in the membrane fraction. As shown in Fig. 6, there is a strong linear relationship between the inhibition of PKC activity and the stimulation of sodium transport by RAP. Since it has been shown that inhibition of PKC is associated with activation of Na+/K+-ATPase in certain kidney cell lines (20Middleton J.P. Khan W.A. Collinsworth G. Hannun Y.A. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15958-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we measured the effect of this agent on Na+/K+-ATPase activity by two methods. When the apical membrane is permeabilized to cations with nystatin while in the short-circuited state, the peak of the increase in Isc reflects maximal Na+/K+-ATPase activity (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 7, cells exposed to 1 μM RAP for 1 h demonstrate a peak nystatin-associated current that is not different than control. Next, A6 cells were exposed to 1 μM RAP or diluent for 1 h, and enzymatic Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured in whole cell lysates. RAP had no effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activity in A6. To determine if RAP inhibits PKC activity through its interaction with FKBP12, the following experiment was performed. Purified FKBP12 was incubated in the presence of either diluent, 10 μM RAP, 10 μM RAP, and 100 μM FK506 at room temperature for 10 min in the presence of 10 microunits of PKC activity from rat brain. As shown in Table III, FKBP12 had no effect on PKC activity. By contrast, RAP, when incubated in the presence of FKBP12, significantly inhibited PKC activity. When RAP was incubated with a 10-fold excess of FK506 in the presence of FKBP12, PKC activity was increased toward control values. By contrast, FK506 + FKBP12 had no effect on PKC activity (control: 9.98 ± 0.33; FKBP12: 10.25 ± 0.33 microunits, n = 4). We next measured the effect of drugs and FKBP12 on the activity of PKCα and -β isoenzymes. Purified FKBP12 was incubated in the presence of drugs and 8 microunits of PKCα or PKC β isoenzyme (one unit of PKCα or -β will transfer 1 nmol of phosphate to histone I per min at pH 7.4 at 30° C). RAP significantly inhibited the PKCα isoenzyme but not the PKC β isoenzyme (PKCα activity: FKBP12 alone 7.77 ± 0.7; FKBP + RAP: 4.76 ± 0.8 microunits, p < 0.02, n = 4. PKCβ activity: FKBP12 alone 7.3 ± 0.6; FKBP12 + RAP 6.9 ± 0.6 microunits, p = not significantly different than FKBP12 alone; n = 4).Table III.RAP-FKBP12 inhibits PKC activityPKCControl (no FKBP12)11.93 ± 0.2FKBP12 alone12.04 ± 0.25RAP + FKBP129.38 ± 0.48ap < 0.05 versus control.RAP/FK + FKBP1210.44 ± 0.24bNo significant difference when compared with control.

Open table in a new tab RAP is a fungal macrolide which has recently been introduced as an immunosuppressant for use in solid organ transplantation (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although RAP and FK506 are structurally similar and bind to a common set of immunophilins, the FK506 binding proteins, their mechanism of action and effects on T-cell function are remarkably dissimilar. It has been shown that it is the ligand-immunophilin complex and not the immunophilin or the ligand itself that determines the specific downstream effect peculiar to each drug (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whereas the FK506·FKBP12 complex inhibits calcineurin-dependent lymphokine gene transcription and T-cell activation (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), the RAP-immunophilin complex inhibits cytokine-stimulated T-cell proliferation in part through the inhibition of both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent p70S6kinase serine phosphorylations (22Calvo V. Crew C.M. Vik T.A. Bierier B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A6 cells conduct sodium in a vectorial fashion through apically localized Na+ channels and basolaterally localized Na+/K+-ATPase pumps. Sodium channel activity is known to be affected by several hormones including vasopressin (4Shaeffer J. Hawk A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), each acting through different mechanisms. It has previously been shown that PKC stimulation inhibits Na+ transport (18Yanase M. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C517-C522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailove I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and inhibition stimulates Na+ channel activity (5Matsumoto P.S. Ohara A. Duchatelle P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C246-C250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Windhager E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F371-F376PubMed Google Scholar). Since RAP stimulates sodium transport in A6 and FKBP12 has sequence homology to an endogenous PKC inhibitor (11Goebel M.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 1051-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that the effect of RAP on sodium transport was occurring through inhibition of PKC by its interaction with FKBP12. Previous studies have failed to demonstrate an effect of FK506 on PKC activity (13Ruff V. McGee J.E. Yem A.W. Deibel M.R. Leach K.L. Immunol. Invest. 1992; 21: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); however, the effect of RAP on PKC activity has not been reported. Here we demonstrate that RAP stimulates sodium transport in A6 with a Kd of 10 nM (Fig. 1). This is similar to the dissociation constant for RAP binding to FKBP12 in human T-cells (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effect is blocked by a 100-fold excess of FK506 (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that the effect is mediated through a common FK binding protein. The effect was additive to that induced by either insulin or vasopressin. By contrast, a cell-permeant inhibitor of cPKCα and -β subtypes stimulates sodium transport in this cell line, and the simultaneous addition of RAP plus this inhibitor resulted in no additional increase in Na+ transport (Fig. 3). These results suggested that RAP was stimulating sodium transport via inhibition of PKC activity. PKC activity was measured in crude cytosolic and membrane fractions. As shown in Table I., Table II., phorbol stimulates PKC activity in the membrane fractions. RAP and the cell-permeant PKC inhibitor inhibit PKC activity in membranes to the same extent. The PKC inhibitor inhibited PKC activity in the membrane fractions only. When intact A6 cells were exposed to these agents (Table II), the bulk of PKC activity was membrane-associated, and as expected PMA treatment resulted in the translocation of PKC activity from the cytosol to the membrane (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). This can be attributed in part to translocation of the PKCα isoenzyme to the membrane fraction as shown in Fig. 4. RAP resulted in inhibition in PKC activity in both the cytosol and membrane fractions, similar to that seen with the PKC inhibitor (Table II). This inhibition cannot be accounted for by a decrease in the amount of PKCα isoenzyme in either the membrane or cytosolic fraction in RAP-treated cells (Fig. 4). FK506 prevented the inhibition of PKC activity by RAP in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions (Table II). FK506 itself has no effect on PKC activity, just as it had no effect on basal Na+ transport (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus FK506 prevents the inhibition of PKC activity by RAP just as it was found to inhibit the stimulation of Na+ transport by RAP (10Rokaw M.D. West M.E. Palevsky P.M. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C194-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of FKBP12 in the membrane fractions (Fig. 5) provides further support for this being an immunophilin-mediated effect. Previous studies have shown a typical distribution of the FKBP's to the nucleus and cytoplasm or attached to the cell cytoskeleton (33Ruff V.A. Yem A.W. Morris P.L. Adams L.D. Reardon I.M. Deibel M.R. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21285-21288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of FKBP12 in the crude membrane described here is not inconsistent with its association with the cytoskeletal elements. The requirement for stringent reducing conditions to resolve this protein in the membrane fractions supports the notion that it might be associated with other cellular proteins. There is evidence that the regulation of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel is in part dependent upon its association with the actin cytoskeleton (34Pratt A.G. Holtzman E.J. Brown D. Cunningham C.C. Reisin I.L. Kleyman T.R. Mclaughlin M. Jackson G.R. Lydon J. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18045-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whether FKBP12 is associated with and has actions on the cytoskeleton will be the subject of future study. The finding that the degree of PKC inhibition is strongly correlated with the degree of stimulation of transepithelial sodium transport by RAP (Fig. 6) strongly suggests that RAP stimulates sodium transport via inhibition of PKC. The time course of stimulation of sodium transport by RAP strongly suggests that this effect is a channel phenomenon rather than an effect on basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Nevertheless, since PKC stimulation has been shown to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase activity in different renal cell lines (20Middleton J.P. Khan W.A. Collinsworth G. Hannun Y.A. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15958-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we measured Na+/K+-ATPase activity by two methods in cells exposed to RAP at the peak of the sodium transport response. There was no effect of RAP on either nystatin-stimulated sodium transport or enzymatic Na+/K+-ATPase activity. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that the effect of the PKC inhibition induced by RAP is through a sodium channel effect. Finally, to determine if RAP inhibits PKC through interaction with FKBP12, we examined the effect of this protein on PKC activity (Table III). FKBP12 alone has no effect on PKC activity, but in the presence of RAP, PKC activity is significantly inhibited. This effect is partially reversed in the presence of a 10-fold excess of FK506 (Table III). The effect seems to be specific for the α isoenzyme of PKC since there is no effect on the activity of the β isoenzyme of PKC. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAP inhibits PKC activity in A6 cells through its interaction with FKBP12 and that inhibition of PKC is the mechanism by which RAP stimulates sodium transport. It thus seems likely that PKC exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on sodium channel activity as has been previously suggested (3Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oh Y.H. Smith P.R. Bradford A. Keeton D. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C85-C91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that FK506 has no effect on sodium transport or PKC activity, although it binds tightly to FKBP12, represents another example of the peculiar effects determined by the immunophilin-immunophilin ligand complex. The ability of a single immunophilin to present two immunosuppressive ligands to effectors associated with two distinct pathways raises the possibility that the immunophilins may function as general presenting molecules, by analogy to the way that major histocompatibility complex molecules present a large number of peptides to the polymorphic T-cell receptors (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). This concept implies the existence of endogenous immunophilin ligands which, through their binding to the same immunophilin, would either activate or inhibit some downstream pathway depending on the cellular need (1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PMA has been shown to stimulate phosphorylation of the 150- and 50-kDa subunits of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (26Oh Y.H. Smith P.R. Bradford A. Keeton D. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C85-C91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of PKC activity results in an increase in the open probability of the sodium channel in cell-attached patches (3Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar, 24Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Windhager E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F371-F376PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that dephosphorylation of the channel itself or some channel regulatory protein results in an increase in channel opening. It is therefore interesting to postulate the existence of an endogenous RAP-like ligand that might ultimately regulate basal sodium channel activity through inhibition of PKC-associated phosphorylations. Identification of the relevant proteins that are regulated in this fashion will be the subject of future studies. Moreover, FKBP12 is associated with the ryanodine calcium channel (27Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.-M. Timmerman A.P. Flesicher S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempts P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9474-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Collins J.H. Biochem.

Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and is associated with calcium transients in human neutrophils (30Bang H. Muller W. Hans M. Brune K. Swandulla D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since transepithelial sodium transport is dependent upon Na+/Ca2+ exchange (3Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar, 31Taylor A. Windhager E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: F505-F512PubMed Google Scholar) and cPKC is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ concentration (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar), this suggests that RAP and perhaps an endogenous Rap-like ligand might affect intracellular calcium as another means of altering sodium channel activity.

Rat ASGP-R contains three subunits, designated rat hepatic lectins (RHL) 1, 2, and 3; human ASGP-R contains two subunits, HHL1 and HHL2. Both receptors are covalently modified by fatty acylation (Zeng, F.-Y., Kaphalia, B. S., Ansari, G. A. S., and Weigel, P. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 21382-21387; Zeng, F.-Y., Oka, J.

The degree of acylation is ≥90% per subunit. Deacylation of affinity-purified ASGP-Rs with hydroxylamine results in the spontaneous formation of dimers through reversible disulfide bonds, indicating that deacylation concomitantly generates free thiol groups. Reaction of hydroxylamine-treated ASGP-R with [14C]iodoacetamide resulted in the specific incorporation of radioactivity into all RHL and HHL subunits, verifying that fatty acids are attached via thioester linkages. To identify the Cys residue involved in the thioester linkages, 14C-carboxyamidomethylated RHL subunits were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and digested in-gel with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence of radioactive peptides revealed that Cys35 in RHL1 and Cys54 in RHL2 and RHL3 were radiolabeled and, therefore, are fatty acylation sites. Fatty acylation of HHL subunits was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. Metabolic labeling of Cos7 cells transfected with wild type HHL1 cDNA resulted in substantial incorporation of [3H]palmitate into purified HHL1. Incorporation of [3H]palmitate into a C36S mutant of HHL1 was negligible (∼1%) compared with wild type. This result also shows that Cys57 within the transmembrane domain of HHL1 is not normally palmitoylated. We conclude that Cys35 in RHL1, Cys54 in RHL2 and RHL3, and Cys36 in HHL1 are fatty acylated.
