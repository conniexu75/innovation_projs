https://openalex.org/W2009856824,"The ubiquitin-related SUMO-1 molecule has been shown recently to modify covalently a number of cellular proteins including IκBα. SUMO-1 modification was found to antagonize IκBα ubiquitination and protect it from degradation. Here we identify the transcription factors c-Jun and p53, two well known targets of ubiquitin, as new substrates for SUMO-1 both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to ubiquitin, SUMO-1 preferentially targets a single lysine residue in c-Jun (Lys-229), and the abrogation of SUMO-1 modification does not compromise its ubiquitination. Activation of Jun NH2-terminal kinases, which induces a reduction in c-Jun ubiquitination, similarly decreases SUMO-1 modification. Accordingly, loss of the two major Jun NH2-terminal kinase phosphorylation sites in c-Jun, Ser-63 and Ser-73, greatly enhances conjugation by SUMO-1. A SUMO-1- deficient c-JunK229R mutant shows an increased transactivation potential on an AP-1-containing promoter compared with wild-type c-Jun, suggesting that SUMO-1 negatively regulates c-Jun activity. As with c-Jun, SUMO-1 modification of p53 is abrogated by phosphorylation but remains unaltered upon chemical damage to DNA or Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination. The SUMO-1 attachment site in p53 (Lys-386) resides within a region known to regulate the DNA binding activity of the protein. A p53 mutant, defective for SUMO-1 conjugation, shows unaltered ubiquitination but has a slightly impaired apoptotic activity, indicating that modification by SUMO-1 might be important for the full biological activity of p53. Taken together, these data provide a first link between the SUMO-1 conjugation pathway and the regulation of transcription factors.

Ubiquitination represents a particular case where ubiquitin (Ub),1 itself a small polypeptide, is linked to lysine residues in a protein to target it for proteasomal degradation (for review, see Ref. 1.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins that share similarity with Ub have been identified. One member of this ubiquitin-like protein family is SUMO-1, a polypeptide of 101 amino acids which can be attached covalently to proteins in a process that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination (for review, see Refs. 2.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 3.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To date, the known substrates of SUMO-1 are RanGAP1 (4.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The observation that RanGAP1 and PML are targeted to distinct subcellular structures upon conjugation to SUMO-1 suggested that modification by SUMO-1 might play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of proteins. A strikingly different aspect of SUMO-1 modification was revealed more recently by Desterro et al. (9.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). They identified the NFκB inhibitor, IκBα, as a substrate for SUMO-1 and could show that SUMO-1 and Ub target the same lysine 21 in IκBα. Whereas ubiquitination of Lys-21 in IκBα requires phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser-32 and Ser-36 residues, SUMO-1 preferentially targets the stable, unphosphorylated form of IκBα, indicating that it acts antagonistically to Ub to protect IκBα from degradation. Like IκBα, the transcription factors c-Jun and p53 are regulated by the Ub-proteasome pathway. c-Jun belongs to the AP-1 family of proteins whose members can form heterodimeric transcription complexes and are characterized structurally by the basic region-leucine zipper motif (for review, see Ref. 10.Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Mitogens or various forms of stress regulate either the transcriptional activity of c-Jun directly or the abundance of the protein by modulation of its stability. The p53 tumor suppressor acts mainly as a transcription factor on a number of genes whose products regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (for review, see Ref.11.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 is subjected to multiple post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which regulate p53 stability, sequence-specific DNA binding, and biological activity (for review, see Refs. 12.Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar and 13.Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In normal cells, p53 is kept labile by Mdm2, which promotes its degradation through the Ub-proteasome pathway (14.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 15.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Upon stress, such as DNA damage, the half-life of p53 is increased dramatically, leading to transcriptional activation of its target genes. Intriguingly, both c-Jun and p53 have been reported to interact physically with the Ubc9 protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay (16.Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17.Gottlicher M. Heck S. Doucas V. Wade E. Kullmann M. Cato A.C. Evans R.M. Herrlich P. Steroids. 1996; 61: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ubc9 is a SUMO-1-specific conjugating enzyme showing homology to E2-type Ub-conjugating enzymes. Ubc9 physically interacts with the known SUMO-1 substrates and seems to mediate the transfer of SUMO-1 to these proteins (2.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that c-Jun and p53 undergo SUMO-1 modification. The modification sites have been mapped, and the effect of SUMO-1 modification on the ubiquitination and activities of these proteins has been studied. HeLa and HT1299 cells were grown under standard conditions and were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Saos-2 cells were grown in RMPI and were transfected with calcium phosphate. Calyculin A (Sigma) was prepared as a 10 μm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide; the final concentration for cell treatment was 0.1 μm. For reporter assays, 3-cm Petri dishes were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct consisting of an adenovirus E3 promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion (18.Kornuc M. Altman R. Harrich D. Garcia J. Chao J. Kayne P. Gaynor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3717-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and 200 ng of the indicated effector plasmids. CAT assays were performed as described (19.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (ImageQuant) of thin-layer chromatograms, and normalized for transfection efficiency by using pCH110 and measuring β-galactosidase activity. The apoptotic assay was carried out by flow cytometry as described previously (20.Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-SUMO-1 antibody (19C7) was described previously (4.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma, the monoclonal anti c-Jun antibody (clone 3) from Transduction Laboratories, and the monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (Pab 1801) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The plasmid used for expression and in vitro translation of human p53 was pRC/CMV wild-type p53 (20.Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). COOH-terminally Flag-tagged mouse c-Jun or JunB was cloned in pCG for mammalian expression or in pGEM (Promega) for in vitrotranslation (provided by D. Lallemand, L. Bakiri, and M. Yaniv). The His-tagged c-Jun expression vector as well as the vectors expressing hemagglutinin-tagged Ub (HA-Ub) and histidine-tagged Ub (His-Ub) were provided by M. Treier and D. Bohmann. NH2-terminally His-tagged SUMO-1 was cloned in pSG5 (Stratagene). All site-directed mutagenesis were carried out using the quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutant plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing. The in vitro modification assay was carried out as described recently (9.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslation reactions were done with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mmNaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)). After sonication, 90% of the lysate was incubated with 25 μl of Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Quiagen). The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (pH 7.8) containing 8 m urea, followed by washing with a buffer (pH 6.3) containing 8 m urea. After a final wash with phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were treated in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. 1/10th of the lysate was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and used as a whole cell extract (WCE). The proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the appropriate antibodies as described recently (7.Müller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that Ubc9 binds to c-Jun in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we hypothesized that c-Jun could be a target for SUMO-1 modification. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used an assay initially developed by Treier et al. (21.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) to detect ubiquitination of c-Jun. In this assay, coexpression of c-Jun with His-Ub allows the purification of the ubiquitinated c-Jun forms by chromatography on nickel-charged agarose beads (NTA beads). In the modified system, His-Ub is replaced by a vector expressing a His-tagged SUMO-1 (His-SUMO-1) protein that, by analogy, should allow the NTA precipitation of putative c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugates. HeLa cells were cotransfected with a vector expressing either His-SUMO-1 or His-Ub together with a vector expressing a Flag-tagged mouse c-Jun (Flag-c-Jun) protein. Both the unprecipitated WCE and NTA precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. In crude extracts, a prominent 48-kDa band, corresponding to the unmodified c-Jun form, was detected (Fig.1 A, lanes 2–5). As observed previously in the NTA precipitates from cells expressing Flag-c-Jun together with His-Ub, a smear of bands representing the ubiquitinated forms of c-Jun was detected due to the enrichment of these forms on the NTA beads (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). Strikingly, in the precipitates from cells expressing His-SUMO-1 together with Flag-c-Jun, a major anti-Flag reactive band migrating at 65 kDa was detected (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). This band was not seen in cells expressing His-SUMO-1 alone (Fig. 1 A,lane 6) demonstrating that it corresponds to a SUMO-1-modified form of c-Jun. After longer exposure, this c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugate could also be detected as a very faint anti-Flag reactive band in the corresponding WCE (data not shown). The difference in the eletrophoretic mobility between the unmodified 48-kDa form and the 65-kDa c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugate is consistent with the covalent attachment of one SUMO-1 molecule/molecule of c-Jun. To exclude any artifact that might be caused by unspecific binding of proteins to the agarose beads, we performed an analogous experiment replacing His-SUMO-1 or His-Ub by an HA-tagged version of SUMO-1 (HA-SUMO-1) or Ub (HA-Ub). Using this combination of vectors, c-Jun-Flag was detected in WCE (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5), but, because of the absence of the His tag, no c-Jun-Ub or c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugates were retained on NTA beads (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and 10). It is noteworthy that overexpression of SUMO-1 in this assay does not induce a general nonspecific SUMO-1 modification of proteins that are otherwise ubiquitinated. For example, the well characterized ubiquitin substrate β-catenin did not become SUMO-1-modified under these conditions (data not shown). To see whether c-Jun can be modified by endogenous SUMO-1, we transfected HeLa cells with a vector expressing a His-tagged c-Jun. NTA precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with either a monoclonal anti-c-Jun antibody (Fig. 1 B, left panel) or a monoclonal anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Fig. 1 B,right panel). The anti-c-Jun antibody detected the major 48-kDa unmodified c-Jun protein as well as a series of protein bands ranging from 50 to 65 kDa. The slowly migrating 65-kDa band was strongly anti-SUMO-1 reactive, indicating that c-Jun is a substrate for endogenous SUMO-1. To determine whether other members of the Jun family can undergo SUMO-1 modification, we tested JunB in the in vivo conjugation assay as described above by coexpressing a Flag-tagged JunB with His-SUMO-1. Similar to what observed for c-Jun, a SUMO-1-JunB conjugate migrating about 15 kDa above the 45-kDa unmodified form was retained on NTA beads (Fig. 1 C). In addition, a second anti-Flag-reactive band at 75 kDa could be detected in the NTA precipitates. These two bands were detected equally after reprobing the membrane with an anti-SUMO-1 antibody (data not shown), indicating that two SUMO-1 molecules are linked covalently to JunBin vivo. With respect to the observed competition of SUMO-1 and Ub on a specific lysine residue of IκBα, we wished to identify the lysine(s) serving as the SUMO-1 attachment site(s) in c-Jun. Recently a short consensus sequence consisting of the L/IK XE motif has been identified as the SUMO-1 acceptor site in the known SUMO-1 substrates RanGAP1, PML, Sp100, and IκBα (22.Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the 18 lysines in the mouse c-Jun protein, we concentrated on lysines 229 (LKEE) and 257 (IKAE) because they reside in a region that matches this consensus motif. Lysines 229 and 257 were mutated independently to arginine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the ability of the mutants to be modified by Ub or SUMO-1 was tested in the NTA precipitation assay. Ubiquitination of either the K229R or the K257R mutant was equal to that of the wild-type c-Jun (Fig.2 A, lanes 4–6). This is consistent with the observation of Treier et al.(21.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) that mutation of Lys-226 or Lys-254 in human c-Jun, which correspond to Lys-229 and Lys-257 in mouse c-Jun, does not alter the ubiquitination of the human c-Jun protein. By contrast, Lys-229 mutation abrogated c-Jun modification by SUMO-1, whereas Lys-257 mutation had no effect (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and6). These findings identify Lys-229 as the major SUMO-1 attachment site in c-Jun and indicate that loss of SUMO-1 modification does not significantly alter the ubiquitination of c-Jun. After having established the SUMO-1 modification of c-Junin vivo, we wished to see whether we could reconstitute this modification in an in vitro system recently described by Desterro et al. (9.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In this system, 35S-labeled c-Jun generated by in vitro translation is used as a substrate in the presence of recombinant SUMO-1, recombinant Ubc9, and a fraction from HeLa cells providing the SUMO-1-activating E1 activity. The modification by SUMO-1 of the PML protein was used as a positive control (22.Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the addition of E1, Ubc9, and SUMO-1 to the in vitrotranslated 75-kDa PML protein induces the formation of one major SUMO-1-PML conjugate visible by the appearance of a new 90-kDa PML form. Accordingly, the addition of the assay mix to in vitrotranslated wild-type c-Jun or K257R mutant induces the formation of a 65-kDa c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugate. Consistent with the in vivodata, the c-Jun K229R mutant is no longer able to undergo SUMO-1 modification. The β-catenin protein, used as a negative control, remained unmodified in this system, demonstrating the specificity of this in vitro assay. Overall these data provide further evidence that c-Jun is a natural substrate for SUMO-1 modification on a specific lysine residue. Stress signals, such as UV irradiation or heat shock, trigger the stabilization of the c-Jun protein by protecting it from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (for review, see Ref. 23.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). To see whether SUMO-1 modification of c-Jun is altered upon heat shock, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding either His-SUMO-1 or His-Ub together with the Flag-c-Jun construct and subjected to heat shock before preparation of the extracts and NTA precipitation. The results are shown in Fig.4 A. As can be seen in WCE, c-Jun is expressed equally in control cells and in cells that had been exposed to heat shock (compare lane 2 with 1 andlane 6 with 5). In agreement with published results, the amount of ubiquitinated c-Jun in the NTA precipitates was reduced after heat shock (compare lane 4 with 3). Strikingly, heat shock triggered a similar down-regulation of SUMO-1 modification as demonstrated by the lower amount of c-Jun-SUMO-1 conjugates retained on the NTA beads compared with untreated controls (compare lane 8 with 7). Because ubiquitination of c-Jun is down-regulated by NH2-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun at serines 63 and 73 after stress-induced activation of JNKs, we assessed the role of these residues in the regulation of SUMO-1 modification (24.Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Both serines were changed to alanines, and SUMO-1 modification of this constitutively nonphosphorylated S63A,S73A mutant was compared with that of the wild-type protein in the in vivo modification assay. As can be seen in WCE, the two proteins were expressed at a similar level (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 2,5, and 6). Consistent with previous findings (25.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar,26.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), mutation of the two serines resulted in a sharp increase in c-Jun ubiquitination (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 4 with3). Remarkably, the S63A,S73A mutant of c-Jun was modified more efficiently by SUMO-1 than the wild-type c-Jun protein (Fig.4 B, compare lane 8 with 7), and the 65-kDa SUMO-1-modified species could even be seen in crude extracts in the absence of NTA precipitates (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Taken together, these results indicate that SUMO-1 modification of c-Jun is, like ubiquitination, down-regulated by stress signals, presumably because of the JNK-mediated phosphorylation of residues Ser-63 and Ser-73. To get further insight into the functional role of SUMO-1 modification on c-Jun, we studied the impact of SUMO-1 modification on the transactivation potential of c-Jun. To this aim, we performed reporter gene assays on an adenovirus early region 3 (E3) promoter CAT reporter construct that harbors an AP-1 site (27.Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cotransfected with the reporter together with empty vector, wild-type c-Jun, the SUMO-1-deficient c-JunK229R mutant or the phosphorylation deficient c-Jun S63A,S73A mutant. The results are summarized in Fig. 5; the data represent the mean (±S.E.) of five independent transfections. Whereas wild-type c-Jun activates transcription 3.1-fold (±0.07) compared with empty vector, the promoter activity was stimulated 4.2-fold (±0.19) by the SUMO-1-deficient c-JunK229R, representing an increase of about 35% compared with wild-type c-Jun. By contrast, loss of the NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites Ser-63 and Ser-73 impairs the transcriptional activity by about 35% (2.0-fold, ±0.11) compared with wild-type c-Jun, which is consistent with the established role of NH2-terminal phosphorylation in c-Jun activation. All c-Jun proteins were expressed at equal levels as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that SUMO-1 modification negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of c-Jun. Similar to what has been described for c-Jun, the p53 protein has been reported to interact with Ubc9 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (16.Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This prompted us to test p53 for its capacity to undergo SUMO-1 modification. The ubiquitination was monitored in parallel. To this purpose, HeLa cells were cotransfected with human p53 together with either His-SUMO-1 or His-Ub and both WCE and NTA precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. In HeLa cells, exogenously expressed p53 is ubiquitinated efficiently because of the presence of the papillomavirus E6 and the cellular E3 ligase E6AP. In WCE from cells expressing p53, the protein was detected as a major 50-kDa band (Fig.6 A, lanes 1–4). After purification on NTA beads, a ladder of ubiquitinated p53 forms ranging from 60 to 90 kDa was detected in extracts coexpressing His-Ub and p53 (Fig. 6 A, lane 6). Remarkably, a p53-SUMO-1 conjugate migrating at 65 kDa was recovered on NTA beads from extracts expressing His-SUMO-1 together with p53 (Fig.6 A, lane 5), indicating that SUMO-1 can be covalently attached to p53 in vivo. When high transfection efficiency was achieved, the 65-kDa p53-SUMO-1 conjugate was readily detectable in WCE (see Fig. 6 B, lane 1). When the HA tag was substituted for the His tag (Fig. 6 A, lanes 7 and 8), although a residual binding of the unmodified p53 form was visible, the modified p53 species were not retained on the beads thus demonstrating the specificity of the conjugates. Among the 20 lysines in human p53, lysine 386 (FKTE) resides in a region closely matching the consensus motif for SUMO-1 modification. This residue was thus mutated to arginine and the mutant tested for its capacity to be SUMO-1-modified in vivo. The expression level of K386R was similar to that of the wild-type p53 protein (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–4). Although ubiquitination of K386R was unaltered compared with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 6 B, compare lane 8 with6) the mutant protein could no longer undergo SUMO-1 modification as demonstrated by the absence of the p53-SUMO-1 conjugate in both WCE and NTA precipitates (Fig. 6 B, comparelane 3 with 1 and lane 7 with5). To confirm further the absence of SUMO-1 modification of K386R, we used the more sensitive in vitro assay as described above. Incubation of in vitro translated p53 with the assay mix containing SUMO-1, Ubc9, and the E1 activity triggered the formation of a 65-kDa p53-SUMO-1 conjugate (Fig. 6 C), demonstrating that p53 is modified efficiently in vitro by the attachment of a single molecule of SUMO-1. Consistent with the results obtainedin vivo, the K386R mutant was completely deficient in SUMO-1 modification. Altogether, these experiments show that lysine 386 is required for SUMO-1 modification of p53 in vivo and in vitro and that this residue is unlikely to serve as a major ubiquitination site in p53. With regard to a possible role of SUMO-1 in counteracting ubiquitination, we wished to examine whether SUMO-1 modification of p53 was altered upon induction of p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2. To this aim, p53-negative H1299 cells were cotransfected with a p53 expression vector in combination with His-Ub, His-SUMO-1, and/or Mdm2 expression plasmids (Fig.7 A). Both the NTA precipitates and the WCE were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-p53 antibody. Although the steady-state level of p53 ubiquitination in H1299 cells was relatively low (Fig. 7 A, lane 6), a dramatic increase was noted upon expression of Mdm2 (Fig.7 A, lane 8), which is consistent with the function of Mdm2 as an E3 Ub ligase (28.Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). By contrast, the amount of p53-SUMO-1 conjugates was unaffected by Mdm2 expression (Fig.7 A, compare lane 5 with 7), indicating that the induced ubiquitination is not associated with reduced SUMO-1 modification. In addition, exposure of H1299 cells to DNA damage by adriamycin or actinomycin D did not affect the extent of SUMO-1 modification, although it reduced p53 ubiquitination and elevated its stability (data not shown). Overall, these data argue against a role of SUMO-1 in regulating the ubiquitination of p53. Because the ubiquitination of p53 can be regulated by phosphorylation, we wished to investigate whether SUMO-1 modification was subjected to a similar type of regulation. HeLa cells cotransfected with either His-SUMO-1 or His-Ub and p53 vectors were treated with calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A. As can be seen in Fig. 7 B, calyculin A dramatically reduced the ability of p53 to be both ubiquitinated (compare lane 8 with6) and SUMO-1-modified (compare lane 7 with5). These data indicate that hyperphosphorylation prevents the formation of p53-SUMO-1 conjugates. To study the possible effect of SUMO-1 modification on p53 biological activity, we compared the apoptotic potential of wild-type p53 with that of mutant K386R, which is deficient in SUMO-1 modification, using a transient transfection assay we described recently (29.Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Berger M. Kazaz A. Gerlitz O. Ben-Neriah Y. Oren M. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8371-8374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, Saos-2 cells (p53-negative) were transfected with either a vector expressing wild-type p53 or K386R; 72 h post-transfection, cells were collected, stained for p53, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The result of one representative experiment is shown in Fig.8. Transfected and nontransfected cells can be distinguished easily by their level of fluorescent intensity (Fig. 8 A). The cell cycle distribution of both the nontransfected (Fig. 8 B) and transfected subpopulation (Fig.8, C and D) of cells was analyzed separately, and cells with a DNA content of less than 2N (Sub-G1 in Fig.8 B) were considered apoptotic. Wild-type p53 induces apoptotic cell death in 31% of cells (Fig. 8 C), whereas the fraction of apoptotic cells is slightly reduced to 25% in cells expressing K386R (Fig. 8 D). As shown in Fig. 8 E, this difference cannot be attributed to variations in the expression levels of wild-type p53 and K386R under the experimental conditions used. Although this difference was rather modest, it was consistent over a number of independent experiments. With cumulated data from seven samples (for each wild-type p53 and p53K386R) of three independent experiments we obtained a mean of 31.7% (S.E. ± 1.32) apoptotic cells for wild-type p53 and a mean of 25.4% (S.E. ± 0.3) of apoptotic cells for p53K386R. Thus, compared with the wild-type p53 protein, the apoptotic potential of K386 was impaired by about 20%, suggesting that SUMO-1 modification of p53 may be necessary for exerting its full apoptotic activity. In this report, we show that the transcription factors c-Jun and p53 can be covalently modified by SUMO-1 both in vitro andin vivo. The activity of c-Jun and p53 is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, and, similarly to what has been shown for IκBα, the interplay between phosphorylation and ubiquitination plays a pivotal role in the control of their stability. Intriguingly, Desterro et al. (9.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) could show that the unphosphorylated, stable IκBα protein is SUMO-1-modified, whereas upon phosphorylation, this residue becomes ubiquitinated to induce degradation of IκBα. Our data provide compelling evidence that this kind of antagonism between Ub and SUMO-1 is not seen on c-Jun. First, in contrast to Ub, SUMO-1 preferentially targets a single lysine in c-Jun, and mutation of this site does not alter ubiquitination. Second, for both Ub and SUMO-1, the unphosphorylated c-Jun is a better substrate than the phosphorylated form. Third, induction of Ser-63, Ser-73 phosphorylation by heat shock down-regulates both ubiquitination and SUMO-1 modification of c-Jun. Taken together, these data strongly argue against a role of SUMO-1 in protecting c-Jun from degradation. Consistent with this idea, the half-life of c-Jun was found to be unaltered upon loss of SUMO-1 modification in pulse-chase experiments. 2S. Müller and A. Dejean, unpublished results. The observed down-regulation of SUMO-1 modification upon c-Jun activation suggests that SUMO-1 has an inhibiting role on c-Jun activity. Accordingly, the SUMO-1-deficient c-JunK229R mutant is transcriptionally more active on an AP-1-containing promoter than the SUMO-1 modified wild-type c-Jun protein. The modulation of c-Jun activity by SUMO-1 linkage by about 35% is quantitatively similar to the well established regulatory effect of NH2-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation, indicating that similarly to phosphorylation, SUMO-1 modification plays an important role in regulating c-Jun activity. It remains to be determined whether SUMO-1 modification directly modulates the affinity of c-Jun for specific DNA binding or regulates its capacity to interact with transcriptional cofactors. Similar to c-Jun, p53 undergoes distinct post-translational modifications at various sites. Subsequent to DNA damage, Ser-15 and/or Ser-20 are phosphorylated, which attenuates the p53/Mdm2 interaction and induces the accumulation of p53 (20.Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 30.Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In addition to causing p53 accumulation, post-translational modifications activate p53 as a transcription factor. Phosphorylation or acetylation of residues in the extreme COOH-terminal region seems to activate sequence specific DNA binding of p53. According to a recently proposed model (31.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar, 32.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), the positively charged COOH-terminal tail interacts with the core DNA binding domain and locks it into an inactive conformation. Loss of basic charges upon acetylation would disrupt this interaction and allow the DNA binding domain to adopt an active conformation. Intriguingly, the SUMO-1 attachment site is localized in this COOH-terminal region and, like acetate, SUMO-1 neutralizes the basic charge of a lysine, raising the possibility that it may induce the conformational change in p53 necessary for its full activation. This is supported by the observation that the K386R mutant, which is no longer conjugated by SUMO-1, has a slightly impaired apoptotic potential. The rather slight difference in the biological activities of K386R mutant compared with wild-type p53 might reflect the fact that in transient transfections, the proportion of SUMO-1-modified p53 remains low. In addition to the impaired apoptotic potential, we observed a modest impairment in the transactivation potential of p53 on a p21 promoter upon replacement of Lys-386 by arginine (data not shown). In agreement with that, two very recent publications provided strong evidence that SUMO-1 stimulates the transcriptional activation of p53 (33.Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34.Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the biological role of the SUMO-1 modification of p53, it will be necessary to determine the signals that regulate the equilibrium between the modified and unmodified form. Although no alteration was observed upon treatment of cells with the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin, other forms of genotoxic stress might be able to induce SUMO-1 modification as there is evidence that different types of DNA damage are relayed through discrete pathways to p53. Our observation that a phosphatase inhibitor triggers a decrease in SUMO-1 modification supports the idea that this process is regulated negatively by phosphorylation of p53 at one or more serine/threonine residues. Similar to what is noticed for c-Jun, our present data make it unlikely that SUMO-1 can compete directly with Ub on p53. In accordance to previous reports (35.Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36.Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Lys-386 did not seem to serve as a major ubiquitination site in p53, and no alteration of SUMO-1 modification of p53 was seen in situations where the ubiquitination of p53 is either induced, following Mdm2 expression, or suppressed, following DNA damage. Taken together, our data indicate that transcription factors can undergo modification by SUMO-1, and, in analogy to ubiquitination or acetylation, SUMO-1 modification seems to be tightly regulated by phosphorylation. Our data provide evidence that conjugation by SUMO-1 modulates the biological activity of c-Jun and p53. Although the exact mechanism of how SUMO-1 regulates p53 and c-Jun activity remains to be elucidated, the identification of this modification adds further complexity to the post-translational regulation of these proteins and will open up new perspectives in their study.

Several classes of voltage-dependent K+ channels have been cloned, and probably all form oligomeric proteins through the assembly of four α-protein subunits. The tetrameric pore complex can further interact with auxiliary subunits to enhance and/or modify currents mediated by the pore-forming α-subunits. The KCNQ family of voltage-dependent K+channels was originally established by positional cloning of theKCNQ1 gene (1.Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholla J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J.

The biophysical and pharmacological profiles of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents expressed inXenopus oocytes are very similar to that of the native neuronal M-type K+ current (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W.

Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), which is thought to be a prominent regulator of neuronal excitability. Similar to the native M-current, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channel activity is strongly reduced by muscarinic acetylcholine agonists (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E.

KCNQ4, another member of this gene family, is expressed in sensory outer hair cells of the cochlea and is mutated in one form of nonsyndromic autosomal dominant deafness (DFNA2) (26.Kubisch C.

Interestingly, coexpression of KCNQ3 with KCNQ4 in Xenopusoocytes also increases current amplitudes (26.Kubisch C. Schröder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C.

This raises the possibility that different KCNQ channel subunits can combine to produce variants of M-currents in different parts of the nervous system. In the present work, we have cloned and characterized a novel member of the KCNQ extended gene family. When functionally expressed inXenopus oocytes KCNQ5 produced K+ channels activated by depolarization, with kinetic properties similar to other KCNQ channels. KCNQ5 was expressed in skeletal muscle and in the brain, where its expression pattern overlaps with those of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, which underlie the native M-current. Similar to KCNQ2, KCNQ5 formed functional heteromers with KCNQ3 that produced larger current amplitudes and were sensitive to block by linopirdine, an M-channel-specific inhibitor, suggesting that neuronal M-channels may possibly include heteromeric variants composed of KCNQ3, combined with KCNQ2, KCNQ5, or other members of the KCNQ gene family. TheKCNQ5 gene was initially identified as a genomic survey sequence (bacterial artificial chromosome clone) in a homology search of GenBankTM (accession number AQ344243). Using this sequence, a human brain cDNA library (Edge BioSystems) was screened. A composite full-length cDNA construct was assembled from two overlapping cDNA clones and subcloned into theXenopus expression vector pSGEM (28.Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA was fully sequenced on both strands using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 310). For Xenopus oocyte expression, capped cRNA was synthesized using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). For Northern blot analysis, a DIG1-labeled riboprobe of 1.6 kb in length (containing mainly C-terminal sequences) was generated with the DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions and hybridized to a series of human RNA blots (CLONTECH). Membranes were exposed for 4 min on a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Chromosomal Localization of KCNQ5—Fluorescence in situ hybridization (Genome Systems) analysis was performed to determine the chromosomal localization of KCNQ5. Briefly, purified DNA from the bacterial artificial chromosome clone (AQ344243) was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation, and the labeled probe was hybridized to human metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. KCNQ5-specific signals were detected on the long arm of chromosome 6 using fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained from tricaine-anesthetized animals. Ovaries were collagenase-treated (1 mg/ ml; Worthington, type II) in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 120 min and subsequently stored in recording solution ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with additional sodium pyruvate (275 mg/liter), theophylline (90 mg/liter), and gentamycin (50 mg/liter) at 18 °C. Oocytes were individually injected with 10 ng of cRNA encoding hKCNQ5, rKCNQ3, hKCNQ2, and hKCNQ1 or coinjected with 10 ng of hKCNQ5 plus 5 ng of hIsk (KCNE1), hMiRP1 (KCNE2), hMiRP2 (KCNE3), or mMiRP3 (KCNE4), respectively. rKCNQ3 was cloned from a λZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) using a DIG-labeled (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM accession number AA019129) as a probe. hMiRP1 and hMiRP2 were cloned from human genomic DNA, and mMiRP3 was cloned from murine brain cDNA using primers derived from the published sequences (13.Abbott G.W.

Standard two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature with a Turbo Tec 10CD (NPI) amplifier, an ITC-16 interface combined with Pulse software (Heka) and Origin version 5.0 (Microcal Software) for data acquisition on a Pentium II PC. Macroscopic currents were recorded 2–4 days after injection. The pipette solution contained 3 m KCl. All fitting procedures were based on the simplex algorithm. Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance, which was assumed ifp < 0.05 and indicated by an asterisk. GenBankTM accession numbers for sequences used are as follows: hKCNQ1, AJ006345; hKCNQ2, NM004518; rKCNQ3, AF087454; KCNE1/hIsk, M26685; KCNE2/hMiRP1, AF071002; KCNE3/hMiRP2, AF076531; KCNE4/mMiRP3, AF076533. A search of the GenBankTM data base revealed a human bacterial artificial chromosome end sequence (AQ344243) with significant homology to the KCNQ potassium channel family. The sequence information was used to isolate overlapping cDNA clones from a human brain cDNA library (Edge BioSystems), and two cDNA clones were assembled to generate a full-length cDNA clone. The initiator methionine of the cDNA was assigned to the first ATG in frame and is preceded by a stop codon in the same frame. The full-length KCNQ5 cDNA encodes a protein of 932 amino acids (Fig. 1) with a predicted molecular mass of ∼102 kDa. Hydropathy analysis supported a topological model with six transmembrane domains. KCNQ5 shows significant homology to other KCNQ predicted proteins, with KCNQ4 being the closest relative (65% identity). KCNQ5 is about 50% identical to KCNQ3 and KCNQ2 but only 40% to KCNQ1. Homology is observed, in particular, throughout the membrane-spanning regions and the conserved pore region between transmembrane segments S5 and S6. Predicted KCNQ proteins are characterized by long C-terminal tails. Among the known KCNQ proteins, KCNQ5 has the longest C terminus, followed by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. A distinct region of high sequence conservation was found in the KCNQ5 C-terminal tail, shared with the other KCNQ proteins. This region is frequently the site of clinical mutations of other KCNQ proteins associated with hereditary diseases (8.Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that deletion of the conserved C-terminal domain of KCNQ1 found in a Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome pedigree disrupts homotypic subunit assembly (29.Schmitt N. Schwarz M. Peretz A. Abitbol I. Attali B. Pongs O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, in a benign familial neonatal convulsions pedigree, a 56-amino acid extension in the length of the KCNQ2 C-terminal tail caused by a frameshift mutation at the 3′-end of the open reading frame, lowers current amplitudes drastically when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, truncation of the last seven natural amino acids increases channel activity 2-fold (30.Lerche H. Biervert C. Alekov A.K. Schleithoff L. Lindner M. Klinger W. Bretschneider F. Mitrovic N. Jurkat-Rott K. Bode H. Lehmann-Horn F. Steinlein O.K. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Together, these results stress the functional importance of the C-terminal region in the KCNQ proteins. The KCNQ5 protein contains numerous potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C but lacks an N-terminal consensus site for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation that is present in KCNQ1 and KCNQ2. KCNQ1 and I Ks currents are stimulated by protein kinase A (6.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 31.Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. Scott A. Siegl P.K.S. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas conflicting data have been reported concerning the effect of protein kinase A on KCNQ2 currents (17.Schröder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar,20.Tinel N. Lauritzen I. Chouabe C. Lazdunski M. Borsotto M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses (Fig. 2) detected a 7.5-kb KCNQ5 transcript in human adult skeletal muscle and brain. In the brain, KCNQ5 transcripts are widely distributed with strongest expression in cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. Lower levels of expression were detected in hippocampus and putamen. The expression pattern of KCNQ5 in the brain is very similar to that previously described for KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (16.Biervert C.

Notably, in contrast to KCNQ2, KCNQ5 is greatly reduced or absent in cerebellum. KCNQ5 probably is the only KCNQ channel subunit strongly expressed in skeletal muscle. However, the presence of N-terminal splice variants of KCNQ1 (6.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) has been reported in skeletal muscle as well. In contrast to the presence of transcripts, KCNQ-like currents have not been observed in skeletal muscle. Whether KCNQ5 and related KCNQ channels contribute to electrical signaling in skeletal muscle, therefore, remains unknown. The possible function of KCNQ5 as a potassium channel was addressed by electrophysiological analysis of Xenopus oocytes injected with KCNQ5 cRNA transcribed in vitro. Two to four days after injection, novel currents were detected that were not observed in water-injected control oocytes. Currents activated very slowly (Fig.3 A) and were not fully activated even after 3-s test pulses. At lower step potentials, KCNQ5 currents showed a delay in activation, similar to KCNQ1 currents (32.Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In most cells (in 23 out of 28 oocytes) activation traces above +20 mV displayed a “crossover” phenomenon, which was observed independently of current amplitudes. Activation of KCNQ5 currents was generally slower than that of other KCNQ currents and could be well described by a second order exponential function, with time constants of 119 ± 7 and 929 ± 51 ms at +40 mV (TableI). Current-voltage relationships of KCNQ5 currents are shown in Fig. 3 B. Currents were activated at depolarizing potentials positive to −60 mV and displayed marked inward rectification at potentials greater than 0 mV (Fig. 3,A and B). Strong inward rectification only has been demonstrated for the related KCNQ3 channel (18.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). KCNQ5 deactivation was fitted to a second order exponential function. Two components of deactivation, with time constants of 51 ± 2 and 281 ± 24 ms, were observed at a repolarizing voltage of −100 mV, following a 3-s depolarizing step to +40 mV (Table I). KCNQ1 tail currents display a characteristic “hook” indicative of recovery from inactivation (32.Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33.Tristani-Firouzi M Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We did not observe such a feature for KCNQ5 currents at voltages between −100 and +40 mV. Additionally, double-pulse protocols commonly used to reveal inactivation (33.Tristani-Firouzi M Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) also failed to reveal inactivation (not shown).Table IActivation and deactivation time constants of homomeric and heteromeric KCNQ channelsConstantsKCNQ5KCNQ5/KCNQ3KCNQ2KCNQ2/KCNQ3msActivation, τfast119 ± 7 (22)167 ± 14* (14)40 ± 6 (10)73 ± 6* (10)Activation, τslow929 ± 51 (22)857 ± 32 (13)291 ± 71 (10)490 ± 31* (9)Deactivation, τfast51 ± 2 (10)45 ± 2 (13)29 ± 5 (9)47 ± 3* (6)Deactivation, τslow281 ± 24 (14)349 ± 81 (13)241 ± 64 (8)226 ± 29 (6)Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of either KCNQ5 or KCNQ2 cRNA or with a mixture of 10 ng each of KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 or of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cRNA.

To examine the K+ selectivity of KCNQ5, tail current reversal potentials were determined in bath solutions containing 5.4, 9.6, 20, 54, and 96 mm K+. A 10-fold reduction in external K+ shifted the reversal potential by about 58 mV (Fig. 3 C), indicating nearly perfect selectivity for K+. Next we investigated the pharmacological properties of KCNQ5 (protocols as described in the legend to Fig.4 D; data not shown). KCNQ5 currents were only weakly sensitive to the nonselective K+channel blocker TEA. The IC50 value of TEA was ≫30 mm and similar to results obtained with KCNQ3 (18.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C.

Brown D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistently, both channel proteins contain threonine residues within the pore region at a position that mainly determines sensitivity to external blockade by TEA. While in KCNQ2 a tyrosine residue at this position confers high TEA sensitivity (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 35.MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), other residues may be responsible for the intermediate TEA sensitivity of KCNQ1 and KCNQ4 (6.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C.

Another nonspecific potassium channel blocker, quinidine, at 300 μm blocked KCNQ5 currents by 50%. Specific inhibitors of KCNQ1 and I Ks were tested at concentrations that nearly completely block these currents. The chromanol 293B (36.Suessbrich H. Bleich M. Ecke D. Rizzo M. Waldegger S. Lang F. Szabo I. Lang H.-J. Kunzelmann K. Greger R. Busch A.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) at 100 μm blocked KCNQ5 currents by 45%. In comparison, KCNQ1 is 80% blocked, and I Ks is completely blocked at this concentration (37.Busch A.E. Busch G.L. Ford E. Suessbrich H. Lang H.-J. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Attali B. Stühmer W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The class III antiarrhythmic agent clofilium blocks KCNQ1 with an IC50 of <10 μm (6.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At 30 μm, clofilium reduced KCNQ5 current by 40%, similar to its inhibitory effect on KCNQ3 (30% inhibition at 10 μm). Clofilium produces little inhibition of KCNQ2 at 10 μm (18.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, the general pharmacological properties of KCNQ5 are distinct from KCNQ1 and more similar to those of KCNQ3 than to KCNQ2. Most importantly, linopirdine, a specific blocker of the neuronal M-channel very effectively inhibited KCNQ5 with a K d value of 16 ± 1 μm. All members of the KCNQ family form functional heteromeric complexes with homologous or structurally different K+ channel subunits. To investigate the possibility that KCNQ5 might also form heteromeric channels, we coexpressed KCNQ5 with other KCNQ proteins and with cDNAs encoding different KCNE proteins. After coexpression with either KCNQ1 or KCNQ2, or with any of the four known KCNE proteins (KCNE1 through KCNE4), we failed to detect evidence for functional interaction of any of these proteins with KCNQ5. However, coexpression of KCNQ5 with KCNQ3 (Fig. 4 A) produced currents strikingly different from those produced by either KNCQ5 or KCNQ3 alone. Whereas KCNQ3 expressed very small amplitude currents almost indistinguishable from background level, in agreement with previous findings (17.Schröder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), coinjection with KCNQ5 yielded 4–5 times larger currents than KCNQ5 alone (Fig. 4, A andC). There was no significant shift in the voltage dependence of the currents (Fig. 4 B), but the I-V relationship indicated that KCNQ5/KCNQ3 currents were less inwardly rectifying at positive membrane potentials. The increase in current amplitude was accompanied by slight changes in activation kinetics, as shown in Table I. Coexpression of KCNQ5 with KCNQ3 significantly slowed the fast component of activation (KCNQ5/KCNQ3 τfast = 167 ± 14 ms; KCNQ5 τfast = 119 ± 7 ms) without altering the slow activation component and the deactivation kinetics (see Table I). Compared with KCNQ2/KCNQ3, heteromeric KCNQ5/KCNQ3 channels exhibited slower activation, whereas deactivation kinetics of both heteromers were very similar (see Table I). The large increase in current amplitudes, the differences in gating kinetics observed after coexpression, and the colocalization of KCNQ5 with KCNQ3 in distinct subregions of the brain all indicate that KCNQ5 can associate with KCNQ3 to form functional heteromeric channels. The functional interaction between KCNQ5 and KCNQ3, a molecular component of the neuronal M-current, and the sensitivity of KCNQ5 to the M-channel blocker linopirdine suggest that KCNQ5 may also contribute to the molecular diversity of this physiologically important current. For better comparison of the kinetic properties of KCNQ3/KCNQ5 heteromers with those of the native M-current and with KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we used a classical M-current protocol. Starting from a holding potential of −30 mV, we stepped to −50 mV and determined deactivation kinetics as described by Wang et al. (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The data obtained for KCNQ3/KCNQ5 (τfast = 199 ± 10 ms; τslow = 985 ± 60 ms; n = 6) and KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (τfast = 209 ± 11 ms; τslow = 766 ± 37 ms; n = 6), respectively, correspond well to the time constants reported for the native M-current (τfast = 103 ms; τslow = 1041 ms) (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In addition, similar to homomeric KCNQ5 currents, also heteromeric KCNQ3/KCNQ5 channels were strongly inhibited by linopirdine. As shown in Fig. 4 D, sensitivity to block by linopirdine of KCNQ3/KCNQ5 was very similar to that obtained for KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (IC50 values of 15 ± 2 μmand 10 ± 1 μm, respectively), further corroborating the M-like nature of the KCNQ3/KCNQ5 current. M-currents are found in peripheral and central neurons but have not been described in cerebellum (19.Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Interestingly, KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 transcripts are only weakly or not expressed in cerebellum (17.Schröder B.C. Kubisch C.

Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) to yield M-like currents, raising the possibility that heterogeneous populations of M-channels exist within the peripheral and central nervous system, varying in kinetic and pharmacological properties. Heterogeneity in the molecular composition of M-like channels may possibly be further increased by contributions of K+ channels from other potassium channel gene families (38.Meves H. Schwarz J.R. Wulfsen I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39.Selyanko A.A. Hadley J.K. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Delmas P. Buckley N.J. London B. Brown D.A. J.

The possibility that the KCNQ5 protein may contribute to M-currents within the brain renders the KCNQ5 gene a candidate genetic locus for epileptic disease. By fluorescence in situhybridization analysis, we mapped the KCNQ5 gene to chromosome 6q14. There are two known loci on chromosome 6 linked to epileptic diseases, a cloned gene at 6q24 (EPM2A), which is defective in progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 2 (40.Minassian B.A. Lee J.R.

Although our mapping results probably exclude involvement of KCNQ5 in JME, the identification of KCNQ5 makes it now possible to investigate possible associations with other forms of epilepsy or inherited neurological diseases.

However, these studies did not determine whether this length varied in cells whose telomeres shortened at different rates. Variable rates of telomere loss could be due to processing events that affected both C- and G-rich strands, and that did not change the size of this overhang, to different rates of sustaining oxidative damage that caused the loss of large segments of telomeric DNA (21.von Zglinicki T.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the length of the single-stranded telomeric 3′-overhang in human fibroblast, breast epithelial, and vascular endothelial cell strains. We show that the size of the overhang is directly proportional to the rate of telomere shortening, varying from about 300 nt in cells that lose 100 bp per division to a telomeric 3′-overhang of 150 nt in cells that lose 50 bp per division. The size of the overhang is thus an important correlate of the rate of telomere shortening (e.g.cells with long overhangs lose more telomeric repeats with each cell division). Possible mechanisms regulating overhang length are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA from cultured cells was prepared using modifications that permit the rapid processing of large numbers of samples (23.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), digested with a mixture of six different restriction enzymes with 4-base recognition sites, and analyzed on agarose gels. The size of the telomere restriction fragments was determined from PhosphorImager scans (Molecular Dynamics), using weighted mean calculations that normalize the signal intensity relative to the size of each digestion product (2.Harley C.B. Fletcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4564) Google Scholar).Telomeres were purified by annealing a biotinylated C-rich oligonucleotide to the G-rich telomeric overhangs (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The overhangs were coated with T4 gp32 single-stranded binding protein, and the length of the overhang measured as described previously (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The measured lengths were converted to nt by reference to the measured length of decorated plasmid DNAs containing single-stranded gaps or overhangs of known lengths.RESULTSNormal diploid human cells were cultured, and throughout their proliferative lifespan multiple DNA samples were analyzed. Fig.1 shows the progressive decrease in telomere restriction fragment length that occurred as a function of the number of population doublings. The rate of telomere shortening varied from 49 ± 5 to 101 ± 8 bp per division. Telomeres were then purified from these four cell types early in their lifespan, and the G-rich, single-stranded overhangs were coated with T4 gene-32 single-stranded binding protein (gp32). The length of the overhang can be determined by comparing the measured length of the protein-coated region to a series of standards of known sizes using electron microscopy (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of overhang lengths observed for these cells. Fig.3 demonstrates a very strong linear relationship between the rate of telomere shortening and the average size of the telomeric overhang, with a slope of 0.31 ± 0.03.Figure 2Size distribution of telomeric overhangs for four normal human diploid cell strains. Telomeres purified from the four cell strains described in Fig. 1 were examined by electron microscopy to determine the size of the single-stranded G-rich 3′-overhang.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar from PD 87 cells (approximately three to five doublings prior to senescence) was eliminated from the present analysis because of the possibility that the size of the overhang might be different in slowly dividing near-senescent cells. Only the second analysis of 109 molecules from PD 21 BJ fibroblasts is presented here, to have data comparable with that from the other cell types.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3The rate of telomere shortening is directly proportional to the size of the 3′-overhang. The data from Figs. 1and 2 are compared with determine whether or not there is a significant relationship between the rate of telomere shortening and the size of the telomeric G-rich single-stranded 3′-overhang. The fact that the S.E. of the slope is only 10% of the value indicates the presence of a highly significant relationship.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThese observations show that cell strains in which telomeres shorten twice as fast (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells lose 101 ± 8 bp per division, whereas BJ fibroblasts lose 49 ± 5 bp per division: Fig. 1) have overhangs that are twice as long (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells have 322 ± 14-nt overhangs whereas BJ fibroblasts have 156 ± 7-nt overhangs: Fig.2). This suggests that the size of the overhang may be important in determining the rate of shortening. These results imply that alternate hypotheses for telomere shortening that would not affect the length of the overhang, such as oxidative damage to telomeric DNA producing single and double-strand breaks (21.von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), are unlikely to contribute significantly to the rate of telomere shortening, at least in human cells cultured under normal conditions.The demonstration that the size of the overhang is directly proportional to the rate of shortening and that the size of the overhang is not a fixed value but subject to modification in different cells greatly increases the need to understand the detailed mechanisms regulating this process. An explanation of these mechanisms will require knowledge of the size of the overhang generated by the end-replication problem on the lagging strand, nuclease processing events that might occur on G- and C-rich strands in both daughter duplexes, and DNA repair or other pathways that might fill in gaps left by processing events. None of these factors has yet been characterized for vertebrate telomeres. Fig. 4 presents one model to facilitate the interpretation of our results. We favor the interpretation that nuclease processing of the telomere produced by leading strand synthesis results in a relatively small G-rich 3′-overhang, the inability of lagging strand synthesis to position the final RNA primer near the 3′ terminus results in a much larger 3′-overhang, and it is the size of this larger overhang that is the primary determinant of the rate of telomere shortening. An understanding of the underlying mechanism could lead to methods that increase the rate of shortening as an adjunct to anti-telomerase therapies for the treatment of cancer. In addition, methods that slow the rate of shortening could be used to increase the replicative lifespan of cells both in vitro and in vivo.Figure 4Model for telomere shortening. The quantitative relationship between the size of the overhang and rates of shortening are shown for one possible model of the factors that might produce single-stranded overhangs. The model is shown for telomerase negative normal human cells, so the addition of telomeric sequences by telomerase is not considered. X represents the final size of the overhang on the daughter molecule produced by lagging strand synthesis. As drawn, it represents the distance between the last RNA priming event of lagging-strand synthesis and the end of the chromosome, but it could also be produced by nuclease digestion without altering the calculations. Y represents the size of the overhang produced by nuclease processing (6.Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 7.Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A.

Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) of the parental C-rich strand that templated leading strand synthesis. We have not included possible contributions of nuclease digestion of the G-rich 3′-overhang in this model. If G-strand-specific nuclease activity were a prominent factor, it would result in the failure of the rate of shortening to be proportional to the size of the overhang. The formula for the rate of shortening from the above model is 0.25(X + Y). The average overhang length is the average of the overhang in both daughter strands, which is (X + Y) ÷ 2. Since 0.25(X + Y) = 0.5[(X +Y) ÷ 2], the rate of shortening should be one-half the average overhang length. The slope of the line in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the observed rate of shortening is one-third of the size of the average measured overhang. Within the context of this model, this implies that the average measured overhang does not reflect the true average of all X and Y overhangs. The average measured overhang length may differ from the true average for the following reasons. 1) Telomeres were purified by annealing a biotinylated (CCCTAA)4–6 to restriction-digested double-stranded DNA and then retrieving telomeres in which the G-rich 3′-overhang had hybridized to the probe. Only 20–50% of the telomeres are recovered using this procedure (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Telomeres with very short overhangs, overhangs annealed within T-loop structures (25.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar) and overhangs inaccessible to hybridization due to non-canonical structures such as G-quartets might all contribute to the failure to retrieve all of the telomeres. 2)Bromodeoxyuridine labeling experiments following a single round of replication indicate that the overhangs on the daughter DNA molecules are not identical; telomeres with labeled C-rich strands are recovered two to three times more efficiently than telomeres with labeled G-rich strands (23.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This suggests that the telomere with the newly synthesized C-rich strand generated by lagging-strand synthesis has a longer overhang than the telomere that is the product of leading strand synthesis (overhang X is thus drawn as being longer than overhang Y). Since our method for purifying telomeres enriches for the products of lagging-strand synthesis (telomeres withX overhangs), our measured average overhang will not correspond to the true average of all X and Yoverhangs. However, calculations attempting to explain the slope of 0.31 based on unequal recovery of X andY overhangs yield unreasonable values (10–20-fold enrichment for the products of lagging strand synthesis rather than the 2–3-fold enrichment that we obtained in previous experiments (23.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) for the relative recovery of these ends (see “” for detailed calculations). 3) Although we can purify 5-kilo base molecules containing telomeric overhangs as small as 12 nt (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), we estimate the limits of detection of T4 gp32-decorated overhangs by electron microscopy to be about 50 nt using our procedure. One possibility is that the slope of 0.31 is obtained because most of the X overhangs are near or below the 50 nt limit of T4 gp 32 coated single-stranded regions that we are able to detect. Most of these ends may thus be excluded from the calculation of the measured average overhang. This is roughly consistent with our ability to observe overhangs on only about 70% of the purified telomeres (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W.

The size of the telomere restriction fragments was determined from PhosphorImager scans (Molecular Dynamics), using weighted mean calculations that normalize the signal intensity relative to the size of each digestion product (2.Harley C.B. Fletcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4564) Google Scholar).Telomeres were purified by annealing a biotinylated C-rich oligonucleotide to the G-rich telomeric overhangs (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The overhangs were coated with T4 gp32 single-stranded binding protein, and the length of the overhang measured as described previously (19.Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W.

RESULTSNormal diploid human cells were cultured, and throughout their proliferative lifespan multiple DNA samples were analyzed. Fig.1 shows the progressive decrease in telomere restriction fragment length that occurred as a function of the number of population doublings. The rate of telomere shortening varied from 49 ± 5 to 101 ± 8 bp per division. Telomeres were then purified from these four cell types early in their lifespan, and the G-rich, single-stranded overhangs were coated with T4 gene-32 single-stranded binding protein (gp32). The length of the overhang can be determined by comparing the measured length of the protein-coated region to a series of standards of known sizes using electron microscopy (19.Wright W.E.

The data from Figs. 1and 2 are compared with determine whether or not there is a significant relationship between the rate of telomere shortening and the size of the telomeric G-rich single-stranded 3′-overhang. The fact that the S.E. of the slope is only 10% of the value indicates the presence of a highly significant relationship.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Normal diploid human cells were cultured, and throughout their proliferative lifespan multiple DNA samples were analyzed.

Fig.3 demonstrates a very strong linear relationship between the rate of telomere shortening and the average size of the telomeric overhang, with a slope of 0.31 ± 0.03. DISCUSSIONThese observations show that cell strains in which telomeres shorten twice as fast (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells lose 101 ± 8 bp per division, whereas BJ fibroblasts lose 49 ± 5 bp per division: Fig. 1) have overhangs that are twice as long (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells have 322 ± 14-nt overhangs whereas BJ fibroblasts have 156 ± 7-nt overhangs: Fig.2). This suggests that the size of the overhang may be important in determining the rate of shortening. These results imply that alternate hypotheses for telomere shortening that would not affect the length of the overhang, such as oxidative damage to telomeric DNA producing single and double-strand breaks (21.von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), are unlikely to contribute significantly to the rate of telomere shortening, at least in human cells cultured under normal conditions.The demonstration that the size of the overhang is directly proportional to the rate of shortening and that the size of the overhang is not a fixed value but subject to modification in different cells greatly increases the need to understand the detailed mechanisms regulating this process. An explanation of these mechanisms will require knowledge of the size of the overhang generated by the end-replication problem on the lagging strand, nuclease processing events that might occur on G- and C-rich strands in both daughter duplexes, and DNA repair or other pathways that might fill in gaps left by processing events. None of these factors has yet been characterized for vertebrate telomeres. Fig. 4 presents one model to facilitate the interpretation of our results. We favor the interpretation that nuclease processing of the telomere produced by leading strand synthesis results in a relatively small G-rich 3′-overhang, the inability of lagging strand synthesis to position the final RNA primer near the 3′ terminus results in a much larger 3′-overhang, and it is the size of this larger overhang that is the primary determinant of the rate of telomere shortening. An understanding of the underlying mechanism could lead to methods that increase the rate of shortening as an adjunct to anti-telomerase therapies for the treatment of cancer. In addition, methods that slow the rate of shortening could be used to increase the replicative lifespan of cells both in vitro and in vivo. These observations show that cell strains in which telomeres shorten twice as fast (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells lose 101 ± 8 bp per division, whereas BJ fibroblasts lose 49 ± 5 bp per division: Fig. 1) have overhangs that are twice as long (e.g. umbilical vein endothelial cells have 322 ± 14-nt overhangs whereas BJ fibroblasts have 156 ± 7-nt overhangs: Fig.2).

APPENDIXThe following is an explanation of why the measured overhang is likely to be a result of the failure to detect overhangs that are less than 50 nt in size.Let X and Y be the lengths of lagging- and leading-strand overhangs, respectively (Fig. 4). The rate of shortening, r, is given as as follows (Equation 1). r=X+Y4Equation 1 We find from the linear relationship between the observed rate of shortening and the measured overhang length,L app, that r ≈ L app/3 (Fig. 3).If the measured overhang length is correct, then the average measured overhang length will be weighted by the proportion of lagging- and leading-strand overhangs recovered. Let the ratio of lagging- to leading-strand overhangs be denoted by a. L appis then given as follows (Equation 2). Lapp=Y+aX1+aEquation 2 Combining Equations 1 and 2, we obtain the following (Equation3). X+Y4=Y+aX3(1+a)Equation 3 Solving for a gives the following (Equation 4). a=3X−YX−3YEquation 4 Since a is a positive quantity, a value 3Y < X is consistent with the observation that longer overhangs are recovered more efficiently than very short overhangs.Larger values of Y require stronger biases for the recovery of lagging-strand over leading-strand overhangs than those we observe. For example, taking Y = X/4 gives a value of 11 for a, which is significantly greater than the ratio of 2 to 3 that we have observed by using bromodeoxyuridine labeling (12.Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).Relative sizes of X and Y that are roughly compatible with the 2–3-fold enrichment of lagging- over leading-strand overhangs are inconsistent with the observed distributions of overhang lengths. For example, Y =X/10 gives a = 4.1, but creates other problems. From Fig. 4, r = 0.25 (X +Y) and if Y = X/10, thenr = 0.28X. In BJ cells, r is 49 bp per division, thus X = 175 nt and Y is 18 nt. However, no overhangs this short were detected (see Fig. 2), because we believe the limits of detection using T4 gp32 coating are about 50 nt.Using the value Y = X/4 gave an unreasonable value fora as described above. However, if this value is used to calculate X for BJ cells, we obtain r = 1.25X, and hence X = 39.2 nt. This size is still below our estimated limit of detection. Thus, we conclude that the reason the apparent average overhang length is not equivalent to actual average is that Y is likely to be below the limits of detection.

https://openalex.org/W2074860444,"The second messenger ceramide (N-alkylsphingosine) has been implicated in a host of cellular processes including growth arrest and apoptosis. Ceramide has been reported to have effects on both protein kinases and phosphatases and may constitute an important component of stress response in various tissues. We have examined in detail the relationship between ceramide signaling and the activation of an important signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream target, protein kinase B (PKB). PKB activation was observed following stimulation of cells with the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs, C2- or C6-ceramide, caused a partial loss (50–60%) of PKB activation. This reduction was not a result of decreased PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2 generation by PI 3-kinase. Two residues of PKB (threonine 308 and serine 473) require phosphorylation for maximal PKB activation. Serine 473 phosphorylation was consistently reduced by treatment with ceramide, whereas threonine 308 phosphorylation remained unaffected. In further experiments, ceramide appeared to accelerate serine 473 dephosphorylation, suggesting the activation of a phosphatase. Consistent with this, the reduction in serine 473 phosphorylation was inhibited by the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. Surprisingly, threonine 308 phosphorylation was abolished in cells treated with these inhibitors, revealing a novel mechanism of regulation of threonine 308 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase 2-catalyzed phosphorylation of serine 473 is the principal target of a ceramide-activated phosphatase.

These include activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor, ultraviolet radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and hyperosmolarity (1.Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 2.Saba J. Obeid L. Hannun Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for acidic sphingomyelinase display resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis (3.Santana P. Pena L. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Patients with Niemann-Pick syndrome also lack acidic sphingomyelinase, and cell lines derived from these patients display resistance to apoptotic stimuli including ultraviolet radiation (3.Santana P. Pena L. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of anti-apoptotic and oncogenic pathways has been reported to decrease sphingomyelinase activity (4.Laurenz J. Gunn J. Jolly C. Chapkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, ceramide accumulation may function as both a primary and secondary initiator of apoptosis by interfacing with the apoptosis machinery directly and by potentiating the apoptotic response. Relatively little is known about the way in which ceramide acts upon signaling pathways. Ceramide can activate both protein kinase (5.Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X. Basu S. McGinley M.

Ceramide has also been demonstrated to inactivate certain members of the protein kinase C family (10.Lee J. Hannun Y. Obeid L. J. Biol.

Moreover, one of the mechanisms of growth arrest caused by ceramide-activated protein phosphatase may be through retinoblastoma protein dephosphorylation (14.Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S.

Recent work suggests that ceramide may induce apoptosis by activating pro-death pathways, possibly through activation of the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK (15.Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), and by promoting dephosphorylation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 (16.Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the pro-apoptotic protein Bad1 (17.Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 is proposed to be mediated by ceramide-activated protein phosphatase activity, whereas dephosphorylation of Bad by ceramide may be through activation of thekinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) and subsequent activation of MEK1 and MAPK, leading to decreased PKB activation (17.Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Ceramide may also augment the execution of apoptosis by the inactivation of pro-survival pathways. Recently, several reports have supported this notion by demonstrating negative regulation of ceramide on the PI3K signaling pathway. Zundel and Giaccia (18.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported that ceramide specifically inhibits PI3K, which in turn results in the loss of PKB activation, a regulatory target of PI3K activity. Three other reports also demonstrated the negative effects of ceramide on PKB activation (17.Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19.Zhou H.L. Summers S.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol.

Because none of these reports actually measured the de novo synthesis of 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, the relationship between ceramide and PI3K remains unresolved. Downstream targets of the PI3K-PKB pathway proposed to be involved in survival include GSK-3 (21.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

Activation of PI3K-dependent pathways other than PKB may include serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (or SGK) (28.Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), PKC isoforms, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and members of the Rho/Rac family of small G proteins, involved in cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking (for review, see Ref. 29.Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The pleckstrin homology domain has been found in an increasing number of signaling proteins and likely functions as a recruitment module for binding of proteins to the lipid products of PI3K (30.Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, PI3K may be key to many cellular processes, only one of which is the protection of cells from apoptosis. PI3K is activated by several mechanisms. In resting cells, class 1 PI3K, which is composed of an SH2 domain-containing p85 subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit, is cytosolic but is thought to redistribute rapidly to the plasma membrane after receptor-activated tyrosine phosphorylation. Once at the membrane, PI3K has access to its substrate, PI(4,5)P2, which it phosphorylates to generate PI(3,4,5)P3. The PI(3,4,5)P3 product is a substrate for SHIP and other 5′-phosphatases (31.Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and the 3′-phosphatase PTEN (32.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar), which promote the formation of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4,5)P2, respectively. The loss of PTEN results in elevated PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, leading to higher PKB activity, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (33.Stambolic V. Suzuki A. Delapompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). PI3K is also activated by interaction with the small G protein Ras (34.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). The contribution of Ras toward PI3K activation has become the focus of much attention, as the oncogenic potential for activated forms of Ras, and oncogenes that lead to its activation, appear to be mediated to some extent through PI3K activation. Thus, if ceramide generation leads directly to inhibition of PI3K, the effects may be widespread and significant. Here we provide biochemical evidence that ceramide regulates PKB activity not through PI3K modulation, but rather by accelerating the dephosphorylation of PKB selectively at Ser-473, a residue critical for maximal activation. This reduction in phosphorylation could be restored by pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid or calyculin A, two potent phosphatase inhibitors. This study suggests that PI3K-dependent kinase (PDK)2-targeted phosphorylation of PKB may be regulated by ceramide-activated phosphatases. Recombinant human GM-CSF was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis). C2-, C2-dihydro-, and C6-ceramides and LY-294002 were from Calbiochem. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-phospho-Thr-308 PKB (9271), rabbit anti-phospho-Ser-473 PKB (9270), and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-MAPK (9106), all from New England Biolabs. Sheep anti-PKB (06-558) and Crosstide were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Okadaic acid and calyculin A were from Sigma Chemical Co. U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). TF-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2in a humidified incubator, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% conditioned medium containing recombinant human GM-CSF. Cells were starved of cytokine by overnight incubation in medium without GM-CSF. Alternatively, cells were washed three times and incubated in GM-CSF-free medium for at least 4 h prior to use in the experiment. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered RPMI immediately prior to assay. Cells were generally treated with ceramides or vehicle for 20 min prior to the addition of 50 ng/ml GM-CSF for various times, which was found previously to induce maximal tyrosine phosphorylation. In experiments involving okadaic acid or calyculin A, compounds were added at least 20 min prior to the addition of ceramide. To stop reactions, cells were pelleted and solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa3MoO4, 1 μg/ml microcystin-LR, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. To visualize phosphorylated and total PKB or MAPK, 50 μg of total protein was fractionated on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of the appropriate antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibody was detected using the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To measure PKB activity, immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described previously (42.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKB was immunoprecipitated from nuclear-free cell extracts using 2 μg of sheep anti-PKB coupled to protein-G Sepharose beads. Beads were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 300 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 75 mmMgCl2, and 60 μm Crosstide and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. 32P-Labeled Crosstide was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were starved of cytokine overnight, washed, and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-free RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mCi/ml32Pi (carrier free, ICN) for 90 min at 37 °C. Cytokines and/or ceramide or other inhibitors were added as indicated, reactions were stopped, and phosphatidylinositide levels were determined by HPLC analysis of glycerophosphoinositides, derived by deacylation of the lipids as described (36.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18134-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ATP, [3H]inositol (1,4,5)P3 (ICN), and [3H]inositol(1,3,4,5)P4 (ICN) were used to calibrate the column and eluted at 75, 84, and 106 min, respectively. PI(4,5)P2, which did not change significantly with stimulation, was used as a reference standard to monitor loading onto the HPLC column. To investigate the effects of ceramide on PKB activation by cytokines, we began by measuring PKB activity in vitro following exposure of cells to GM-CSF, ceramide, or the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002. In human erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, stimulation with GM-CSF resulted in a large increase in PKB activity after a 1- or 3-min treatment (Fig.1 A). At both times, treatment of cells with C6-ceramide reduced the activation of PKB. Identical results were obtained when another short chain analog of ceramide, C2-ceramide, was used (data not shown). Inhibition of PI3K by treatment of cells with LY-294002 blocked almost entirely the activation of PKB. In other experiments, treatment of cells with dihydroceramide, an inactive ceramide analog, had no effect (data not shown), consistent with the findings of others (19.Zhou H.L. Summers S.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 20.Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). C6-ceramide was not reducing the signaling capacity of the GM-CSF receptor nonspecifically because phosphorylation of MAPK was unaffected by ceramide treatment (Fig. 1 B). A potent MEK inhibitor, U0126 (35.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar), completely abolished the phosphorylation of MAPK in this experiment, whereas LY-294002 had no effect, as we have shown previously (36.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18134-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, C6-ceramide specifically reduces the maximal activity of PKB achieved by stimulation of cells with GM-CSF without affecting the parallel MEK-MAPK pathway. We next examined the effects of ceramide on PI3K activity in whole cells. TF-1 cells were metabolically labeled with 32P and then stimulated with GM-CSF in the presence or absence of C6-ceramide. Lipids were extracted, deacylated, and separated by anion exchange HPLC (36.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18134-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the elution profiles corresponding to both PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Stimulation with GM-CSF caused an increase in the amounts of both of these lipids above unstimulated cells. Pretreatment of cells with C6-ceramide did not affect the increase of either lipid species caused by GM-CSF. However, pretreatment of cells with LY-294002 abolished the generation of both lipid species. The total radioactivity loaded onto the column was very similar between samples, indicating that the differences in radioactivity were caused by changes in mass for each lipid. Thus, C6-ceramide does not affect the generation of PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2 caused by GM-CSF stimulation. Therefore, the effects of C6-ceramide on PKB are not because of reduced levels of PI3K-generated lipids. PKB activation occurs by multiple phosphorylations on several residues (37.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Thr-308 is located in the activation loop of the kinase domain, and phosphorylation by PDK1 is required for activation. Ser-473 phosphorylation near the carboxyl-terminal region of PKB further potentiates activity. We monitored these phosphorylation events separately using phospho-specific antibodies. In the first experiment, cells were pretreated with C6-ceramide or vehicle alone and then stimulated for 1, 3, or 5 min with GM-CSF. Phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473 was observed by 1 min, maximal by 3 min, and began to decline by 5 min (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of ceramide, the extent of Ser-473 phosphorylation was reduced greatly (Fig. 3 A). Thr-308 phosphorylation was also examined. In contrast to Ser-473, Thr-308 phosphorylation was not altered by ceramide treatment (Fig. 3 A). In a separate experiment, we wanted to confirm that Thr-308 phosphorylation was occurring by a PI3K-controlled pathway. Cells were treated with either C6-ceramide or LY-294002, and the lysates were probed with anti-phospho-Thr-308 (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with Fig.3 A, ceramide treatment had no effect. In contrast, LY-294002 abolished Thr-308 phosphorylation completely. This confirmed that Thr-308 phosphorylation was occurring by a PI3K-activated pathway. Finally, we asked whether ceramide could accelerate PKB Ser-473 dephosphorylation, if added after GM-CSF stimulation (Fig.3 C). In this experiment, cells were stimulated with GM-CSF for 1 min, washed, and then ceramide or vehicle was added. In this way, we could distinguish whether ceramide was blocking Ser-473 phosphorylation or if it was accelerating its dephosphorylation. Ceramide significantly reduced Ser-473 phosphorylation in this set of experiments, most consistent with an acceleration in Ser-473 dephosphorylation. This result suggested that the mechanism of Ser-473 dephosphorylation by ceramide most likely involved a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase. The results of Fig. 3 suggest a mechanism involving a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in the regulation of PKB dephosphorylation. We then performed experiments to examine this possibility further. Cells were cotreated with ceramide and okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor reported previously to inhibit ceramide-activated phosphatases (7.Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by stimulation with GM-CSF. Fig. 4 A shows the activity of PKB in each of these conditions. Okadaic acid was ineffective in restoring the decrease in activity caused by ceramide. This was consistent with previous reports (19.Zhou H.L. Summers S.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 20.Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and at first suggested that ceramide was not affecting PKB through dephosphorylation. However, we noticed that cells treated only with okadaic acid and GM-CSF also had reduced PKB activity. This suggested that okadaic acid may interfere with the normal activation of PKB, which may be independent of the inhibitory actions of ceramide. Immunoblotting for Ser-473 phosphorylation demonstrated that okadaic acid fully restored the decreased phosphorylation of this residue caused by ceramide back to stimulated levels (Fig. 4 B). Because okadaic acid was restoring Ser-473 phosphorylation but could not restore kinase activity, we monitored the phosphorylation state of the other regulatory site, Thr-308. Surprisingly, okadaic acid, either in the presence or absence of ceramide, blocked Thr-308 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). We then performed additional experiments to examine the effects of okadaic acid on PKB phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5, okadaic acid did not affect the kinetics or extent of Ser-473 phosphorylation induced by GM-CSF. However, at all times examined Thr-308 phosphorylation was reduced significantly.Figure 5Okadaic acid inhibits Thr-308 phosphorylation. Cells were treated with 1 μmokadaic acid (O.A.) or vehicle (Control) for 20 min followed by GM-CSF for the indicated times. PKB was immunoprecipitated, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and probed for Ser-473 phosphorylation, Thr-308 phosphorylation, or total PKB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the involvement of a serine phosphatase in these processes, additional experiments were performed with a functionally distinct phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A. Fig.6A shows that cells pretreated with ceramide and calyculin A have restored Ser-473 phosphorylation. In another experiment, calyculin A was compared with okadaic acid. Both inhibitors restored Ser-473 phosphorylation equally during ceramide treatment (Fig. 6 B). Also, both are shown here to inhibit Thr-308 phosphorylation, demonstrating that this effect is not unique to okadaic acid. As a control to show that these phosphatase inhibitors were not disrupting the generation of PI(3,4,5)P3 following GM-CSF stimulation, lipid analysis was also performed. GM-CSF-stimulated generation of PI(3,4,5)P3 remained unaffected (unstimulated: 190 cpm ± 34, GM-CSF: 738 ± 121, GM-CSF + calyculin A: 698 ± 90, GM-CSF + okadaic acid: 711 ± 88). Together, these results indicate that (i) the effects of ceramide on Ser-473 phosphorylation were through the activation of a phosphatase, and (ii) okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibit an activity necessary for Thr-308 phosphorylation. Recently, three groups have studied the effects of ceramide on PI3K and PKB activation (18.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19.Zhou H.L.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Zundel and Giaccia (18.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) provided evidence that PI3K is a direct target of ceramide, with its inhibition leading to decreased PKB activation. In contrast, Zhou and co-workers (19.Zhou H.L. Summers S.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and Summers and co-workers (20.Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) provided evidence that ceramide does not affect PI3K activation, but rather inhibits PKB directly. In these three reports, PI3K activity was determined by immunoprecipitating PI3K (either directly or associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins) followed by in vitrokinase assays using PI as a substrate. Because this method does not examine the de novo accumulation of the PI3K reaction products, we felt this issue required further examination, given the importance of PI3K in many different signaling pathways. Therefore, we measured the de novo 3′-phosphoinositide production in the presence of ceramide following stimulation with GM-CSF. In contrast to LY-294002, which completely abolished PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 generation, ceramide had no effect on the generation of these lipid species. Thus, we conclude that ceramide does not regulate the activation of PI3K, nor does it inhibit PI3K"

This increase was blocked by the chemical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and a flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium. NGF responses of PC12 cells, including neurite outgrowth, tyrosine phosphorylation, and AP-1 activation, was inhibited when ROS production was prevented byN-acetylcysteine and diphenylene iodonium. The expression of dominant negative Rac1N17 blocked induction of both ROS generation and morphological differentiation by NGF. The ROS produced appears to be H2O2, because the introduction of catalase into the cells abolished NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, ROS production, and tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that the ROS, perhaps H2O2, acts as an intracellular signal mediator for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation and that NGF-stimulated ROS production is regulated by Rac1 and a flavoprotein-binding protein similar to the phagocytic NADPH oxidase.

Although the role of ROS has been extensively studied in mitogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis (1.Schreck R. Baeurle P.A.

The differentiation process in the nervous system is regulated by the action of differentiation and growth factors including NGF. NGF induces the growth arrest of PC12 cells and promotes their differentiation into sympathetic neuron-like cells (13.Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). NGF binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, initiates various molecular interactions including tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and the action of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway (14.Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). NGF induces the production of reactive nitric oxide (NO), and NO is required for NGF-induced cytostasis and differentiation (16.Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), suggesting that free radical molecules such as NO and ROS may exert a regulatory role in certain types of cellular differentiation. In the current study, we focused on the role of ROS and a small GTP-binding protein, Rac1, in the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were plated in a poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well plate (Corning Glass) and serum-starved in 0.5% horse serum and 0.25% fetal bovine serum for 12–15 h. After rinsing with DMEM lacking phenol red, cells were loaded with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA; 5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 °C and then the indicated amounts of NGF (Upstate Biologicals) were added. The DCF fluorescence intensity was measured by a CytoFluor plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems) (excitation wavelength, 485 nm; emission wavelength, 530 nm). PC12 cells were pretreated with indicated amounts of NAC (Sigma) or DPI (Molecular Probes) for 2 h, and NGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the cells for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and cell morphology was observed. Serum-starved 6–24 cells (PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA) were pretreated with NAC or DPI for 2 h and then unstimulated or stimulated with NGF for 5 min. Cells were disrupted in the buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). PC12 cells were transfected with pcDNA-wt Rac1, pcDNA-Rac1N17, pcDNA-Rac1V12, and empty pcDNA vector together with LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE PLUS solution (Life Technologies). Cells were serum-starved 36 h after transfection and loaded with DCFHDA for 10 min before assessing the DCF fluorescence level. The expression levels of transfected wt Rac1 and Rac1 mutant proteins were detected by immunoblotting with monocronal anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biologicals). PC12 cells were transfected with pcDNA-Rac1N17 or empty vector pcDNA and cultured in growth medium for 30 h, and NGF was added for 30 h. Cells were serum-starved in the presence of NGF for 12 h and with the medium containing NBT (5 mg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and NGF for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with anti-Rac1 antibody, reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Preparation of nuclear extracts and the binding reaction were performed as described (17.Diagnam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The AP-1 binding sequence AGCTTTGATGACTCAG was annealed by the TCGACTGAGTCATCAA and labeled with Klenow fragments and [32P]dCTP. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Cells were transfected with either PS3CAT carrying human catalase or a control vector, PS3. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with NGF for 2 days, and the neurite extending cells were scored. Alternatively, 36 h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 12 h and loaded with DCFHDA and NGF prior to determining the DCF fluorescence intensity. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-catalase antibody (Calbiochem). 6–24 cells were transfected with PS3CAT or an empty vector, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting. We first examined whether ROS production is detectable in PC12 cells upon NGF treatment. To detect ROS production, PC12 cells were preincubated with the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore DCF prior to NGF treatment. NGF stimulated ROS production in a dose-dependent manner, and the amount of ROS rapidly increased to its maximum level 10 min after NGF addition and thereafter decreased toward its basal level (Fig.1 A). By using confocal microscopy, we also confirmed that NGF induced an increase in DCF fluorescence in cells loaded with the fluorophore, DCF (data not shown). It was essential that PC12 cells were serum-starved before the NGF addition to avoid the serum effect on ROS production. We tested whether a chemical antioxidant scavenger can abolish the NGF-induced ROS. When cells were treated with NAC, NGF-stimulated DCF fluorescence was significantly reduced (83.9 ± 4% inhibition at 20 mm of NAC; the formula is in the legend to Fig.1 B). In phagocytic cells, synthesis of ROS in response to agonists was catalyzed by the NADPH oxidase (3.Bokoch G.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 212-218Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Several growth factors and Ras-mediated mitogenic signals also activate the production of superoxide by the NADPH oxidase-like enzyme in fibroblast cells (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

To determine whether an enzyme functionally similar to the NADPH oxidase is involved in NGF-induced ROS generation in PC12 cells, we treated PC12 cells with DPI, a specific inhibitor for flavoprotein that is a constituent of the NADPH oxidase complex. DPI addition abolished the rise in DCF fluorescence by NGF treatment (87.1 ± 2% inhibition at 20 μm of DPI; Fig.1 B). We next assessed the effect of NAC and DPI on NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. The increasing amount of NAC exerted an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth, which is a major hallmark of the differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1 C). This was also observed previously (20.Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Hirata H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33018-33025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Likewise, DPI treatment blocked this morphological differentiation induced by NGF (Fig. 1 C). The cell viability was not affected by either NAC or DPI in the range of concentration used, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. These data suggest that ROS generated by NGF is required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation and that activation of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase-like enzyme system mediates NGF-induced ROS synthesis. Rotenone (50 μm), a mitochondrial oxidase inhibitor, had no appreciable effect on NGF-induced ROS production, which indicates that the mitochondrial oxidase is not involved in this event (data not shown). Because the NADPH oxidase is regulated by Rac1 in phagocytic cells and similarly super oxide generation appears to be modulated by Rac1 in fibroblast cells (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of Rac1 in NGF-induced ROS generation in PC12 cells. The level of NGF-induced ROS in wt Rac1-transfected cells was slightly higher than that observed in control cells (Fig. 2 A). Rac1N17, a dominant negative Rac1 significantly decreased the level of NGF-induced ROS (Fig. 2 A). The constitutively active Rac1V12 markedly elevated DCF fluorescence without NGF treatment (Fig.2 A). The increase in the ROS level was reduced when Rac1V12-transfected cells were treated with 20 μm DPI (DPI-treated, DCF fluorescence 7.0 ± 2.6; DPI-untreated, DCF fluorescence 27.5 ± 8.0, n = 3). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the similar amount of wt Rac1, Rac1N17, and Rac1V12 proteins were expressed. These data suggest that induction of ROS generation by NGF was mediated by Rac1 and that Rac1 could regulate the DPI-sensitive oxidase system similar to the NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was abrogated by transient expression of the dominant negative Rac1N17 (39 ± 5% neurite extending cells,n = 3), whereas vector control had no suppressive effect on the morphological differentiation (93 ± 2% neurite extending cells, n = 3). Rac1N17 expressing cells with the undifferentiated phenotype reduced ROS production, as assessed by NBT reduction assay, which has been used to detect superoxide production by the NADPH oxidase (21.Maly F.E. Nakamura M. Gauchat J.F. Urwyler A. Walker C. Dahinden C.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T. de Weck A.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1260-1267PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Normally differentiated cells lacking Rac1N17 expression exhibited strong NBT staining (Fig. 2 B). The correlation between Rac1N17 expression and inhibition of both ROS production and neurite outgrowth strongly suggests that NGF-induced ROS-dependent neuronal differentiation is mediated by Rac1. One of the well characterized intracellular signaling events induced by NGF is NGF receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (14.Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), and ROS is known to modulate the redox state of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (22.Duhe R.J. Evans G.A. Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Cox G.W. Farrar W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of antioxidants on the level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. 6–24 cells were analyzed because the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in parental PC12 cells was not high enough to be detected by the antibody used. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was increased upon NGF stimulation, and some of them could be downstream targets of TrkA (Fig.3). Consistent with the reduction in ROS production and neurite outgrowth, NGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was inhibited by NAC or DPI treatment. The data indicate that NGF-induced ROS may affect the steady state of tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. DPI inhibition of phosphorylation indicates that the phagocytic NADPH oxidase-like enzyme participates in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Because AP-1 or NF-κB is known to be activated by ROS in some biological systems, we examined whether NGF induces ROS-mediated activation of these transcription factors. Gel shift assay demonstrated that nuclear extracts from NGF-treated cells activated the AP-1 activity and that NAC suppressed this activation (Fig.4). The inhibitory effect on the AP-1 activity was also observed with DPI treatment (data not shown). This indicates the mediating role of ROS in the NGF-dependent activation of AP-1. No stimulation of the NF-κB activity by NGF was detected until at least 24 h after NGF treatment, suggesting that NF-κB is not involved in NGF signaling (data not shown).Figure 4NAC inhibits NGF-induced stimulation of AP-1 activity. Cells were pretreated with 20 mm NAC for 2 h, and NGF (50 ng/ml) was added for 60 min. As a positive control, cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (200 nm) alone. 10-μg nuclear extracts were reacted with32P-labeled probes of the AP-1 binding site. A 40-fold excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleotides (comp AP-1) was added where indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the nature of ROS mediating NGF action, we transfected PC12 cells with a catalase expression plasmid. Catalase scavenges H2O2 by catalyzing the dismutation of H2O2 to H2O and O2. Catalase prevented NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (80% decrease), abolished NGF-induced DCF oxidation (Fig.5, A and B), and inhibited NGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.5 C). We observed that whereas NGF rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA, the overexpression of exogenous catalase in the cells suppressed this phosphorylation. Therefore, a 140-kDa prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated band detected in the experiments (Figs. 3 and 5 C) is most likely TrkA. The amount of transduced catalase into the cells was 10 times that of the endogeneous enzyme (data not shown). NGF action was inhibited when a recombinant adenovirus carrying human catalase was infected into the cells (data not shown). These data implicate H2O2, a product of superoxide, as a potential mediator for NGF signaling. Our data provide evidence that NGF stimulates generation of an oxygen radical, perhaps H2O2, which is required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. Considering that PDGF-stimulated cell DNA synthesis is mediated by H2O2 (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar), ROS could serve as an essential regulator in differentiation and mitogenesis. Unlike the conventional view that an increased level of ROS is the possible cause of neurodegenerative diseases (23.Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentaine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and oxidative stress induces cell death (24.Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Hirata H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 212: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we identified that ROS at a narrow concentration range may function as a vital mediator for NGF receptor signaling. A recent study reported that the rise in NO, another radical following NGF stimulation, causes NGF-induced cytostasis, which is a critical event preceding neurite extension (16.Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). ROS and NO could contribute in concert to the neurotrophic factor-promoted differentiation. In response to NGF, Rac1 is most likely to activate the NADPH oxidase-like enzyme system similar to that in phagocytic cells. Presumably, the NGF signaling pathway, downstream of Ras, involves Rac1-mediated generation of ROS leading to AP-1 activation and the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK-dependent pathway. Our observation suggests that the NGF-induced H2O2 may be responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including the TrkA receptor. Likewise, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK was blocked by inhibition of the PDGF-induced increase in H2O2(10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar) and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor was blocked by depletion of EGF-induced H2O2 (25.Lee S-R. Kwon K-S. Kim S-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Because H2O2 inactivates certain types of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in vitro (26.Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the inactivation of PTPase might aid the maintenance of the maximal tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells stimulated by the growth factors including NGF.

In this study, using rat primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), we demonstrate that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent promoter of angiogenesis, up-regulates the expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) through a novel pathway that includes phosphatidylinositol 3 OH-kinase (PI3K), AKT, and nitric oxide (NO), resulting in the migration of BMEC. Upon VEGF treatment, AKT is phosphorylated in a PI3K-dependent manner. AKT activation leads to NO production and release and activation-deficient AKT attenuates NO production stimulated by VEGF. Transfection of the constitutive myr-AKT construct significantly increased basal NO release in BMEC. In these cells, VEGF and the endothelium-derived NO synergistically up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1, which was mediated by the PI3K pathway. This activity was blocked by the PI3K-specific inhibitor, wortmannin. Furthermore, VEGF and NO significantly increased BMEC migration, which was mediated by the up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression and was dependent on the integrity of the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway. This effect was abolished by wortmannin, by the specific ICAM-1 antibody, by the specific inhibitor of NO synthase,N G-l-monomethyl-arginine (l-NMMA) or by a combination of wortmannin, ICAM-1 antibody, and l-NMMA. These findings demonstrate that the angiogenic factor VEGF up-regulates ICAM-1 expression and signals to ICAM-1 as an effector molecule through the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway, which leads to brain microvessel endothelial cell migration.

The BBB system consists of endothelial cells, pericytes, perivascular microglia, astrocytes, and basal lamina. Whereas the endothelial cell microvascular monolayer forms the barrier proper, the interaction between these various cell types seems to be necessary for the induction or maintenance of the specialized function of the BBB (1.Risau W. Wolburg H. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 174-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The permeability of the BBB is important for its normal functioning, and changes in this permeability may lead to brain infection (2.Komatsu T. Ireland D.D. Chung N. Dore A. Yoder M.

VEGF functions as a survival factor for newly formed vessels during developmental neovascularization but is not required for the maintenance of mature vessels (8.Benjamin L.E. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Formation of blood vessels occurs via two distinct processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis involves the differentiation of endothelial cells from mesodermal precursors, whereas angiogenesis or neovascularization involves the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels (10.Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration are critical events for angiogenesis and are regulated by VEGF (9.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). In the brain, glial cells express elevated levels of VEGF protein, which correlate with hypoxia-derived angiogenesis (11.Ogunshola O.O. Stewart W.B. Mihalcik V. Solli T. Madri J.A. Ment L.R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 119: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-kinase signaling receptors for VEGF have been identified as Flt-1, Flk-1/KDR, and Flt-4 (12.Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of VEGF to its receptors, its signaling cascade is activated. This results in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, leading to increases in intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and elevation of intracellular calcium (4.He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The increase in intracellular calcium activates nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) to produce NO. The effects of VEGF in stimulating angiogenesis and increasing vascular permeability require NOS activity (13.Mayhan W.G. Am. J.

Cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α regulate cancer cell adherence to BMEC, leading to metastases of a number of human cancers to the brain (16.Bereta M. Bereta J. Cohen S. Zaifert K. Cohen M.C. Cell Immunol. 1991; 136: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BMEC play a significant role in determining the pattern of metastasis of tumors which have spread to the brain (17.Auerbach R. Lu W.C. Pardon E. Gumkowski F. Kaminska G. Kaminski M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1492-1496PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocyte extravasation into the brain is mediated largely by ICAM-1 (18.Adamson P. Etienne S. Couraud P.O. Calder V. Greenwood J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2964-2973PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocyte migration through BMEC involves signaling through endothelial ICAM-1 via a Rho-dependent pathway (18.Adamson P. Etienne S. Couraud P.O.

Elevated levels of soluble ICAM-1 have been found in several human malignancies associated with angiogenesis (20.Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 21.Edelman A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), andin vitro and in vivo angiogenic activity of soluble ICAM-1 have been observed (22.Gho Y.S. Kleinman H.K. Sosne G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5128-5132PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that are mediated by VEGF and their effects on adhesion molecules have not been defined in BMEC. Furthermore, the role of VEGF in BMEC migration has not been elucidated. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to determine the involvement of ICAM-1 in the VEGF signaling pathway underlying VEGF-induced production of NO and to examine its effect on the migration of BMEC. These studies provide new insights into the mechanisms by which VEGF mediates its effects on BMEC as well as its function as a major component of the BBB. The recombinant human VEGF165 was a gift from Genentech, Inc. l-Arginine hydrochloride crystalline,N G-l-monomethyl-arginine (l-NMMA) was from Sigma, and wortmannin was purchased from Calbiochem. AKT antibodies and phosphorylated AKT antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Boston, MA). ICAM-1 polyclonal antibodies for Western blotting, as well as monoclonal ICAM-1 antibody for the neutralization studies of ICAM-1 function, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (23.Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The measurements of NO production in BMEC were performed using the Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The full-length AKT cDNA was amplified from the total RNA of HeLa cells by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and was then subcloned into the Bluescript plasmid (24.Altiok S.

To create the pLNCX-HA-AKT construct, AKT cDNA lacking an ATG start codon was reamplified from the Bluescript plasmid by using a T3 primer and an AKT primer containing a Kozak and the HA sequence as well asBglII site. The amplified fragment was inserted into theClaI and BglII sites of the modified pLNCX plasmid. The kinase active mutant HA-AKT-K179M was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (21.Edelman A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis converted lysine 179 to methionine and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. BMEC were isolated from rat cerebral cortex capillaries by enzymatic digestion at 37 °C and separated by 25% bovine serum albumin at 1000 × gfor 15 min and then separated from red blood cells with 5% horse serum in a 50% percoll gradient. BMEC were purified by αThy 1.1 and rabbit complement. BMEC were maintained in F-10 medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% heparin, 0.7% endothelial mitogen, and 15% horse serum. Primary BMEC were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (25.Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol.

BMEC were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein-pcDNA3 vector plus AKT cDNA constructs using the LipofectAMINE method following the protocol provided by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc). After 24 h, the positive green fluorescent protein-stained cells were corrected as an indication of the transfection efficiency (∼55–60%). Cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting for AKT expression and AKT phosphorylation as well as for NO production. Brain endothelial cell migration was evaluated by modified invasion assay using transwells (Fisher) coated with 2.5 μg/well of Matrigel, as described previously (2.Komatsu T. Ireland D.D. Chung N. Dore A. Yoder M. Shoshkes Reiss C. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were washed with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in F-10 medium, prepared in a concentration of 106 cells/ml, plated at a concentration of 105 cells/well, and/or treated with VEGF (100 ng/ml), the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm), as well as with the monoclonal antibody ICAM-1 (1:25). Cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transwells were swabbed with a Q-tip in 1 × PBS and then treated for 10 min with 600 μl of methanol followed by 600 μl of 0.02% Crystal Violet stain in 2% ethanol. Cells were counted by light microscopy. Primary BMEC were starved for 6 h with 0.1% FBS in F-10 medium. Cells were then stimulated with VEGF165 (100 ng/ml), l-arginine (100 μm), l-NMMA (100 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm) in the presence of 0.1% FBS in 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning, NY). Cells were next washed with 1× PBS, and BMEC were lysed with SDS-sample buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.4% dithiothreitol, 1 mm orthovanadate with bromphenol blue), analyzed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% 1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 overnight, immunoblottings were performed with primary antibodies for 2 h (1:1000). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated for 1 h (1:20,000) and washed with 1× PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, and then enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Enhanced Luminal Reagent, NEN Life Science Products). The NO assay was performed as described previously (26.Radisavljevic Z. George M. Dries D.J. Gamelli R.L. J. Liq. Chromatogr. Relat. Technol. 1996; 19: 1061-1079Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 6 h with 0.1% FBS in F-10 medium and then stimulated by VEGF in 1× PBS with 0.1% FBS for 30 min. After starvation, transfected cells were also incubated in 1× PBS with 0.1% FBS for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, and detection of NO2 + NO3 anions was performed with the Colorimetric Assay kit using the Griess reaction, and spectrophotometric analysis was performed with the Wsoftmax computer program. To elucidate the effect of VEGF on ICAM-1 expression, BMEC were stimulated with VEGF for up to 3 h. VEGF enhanced ICAM-1 expression, and maximal expression of ICAM-1 was reached by 2 h (Fig.1 A). In the presence of VEGF and l-arginine (NO substrate), ICAM-1 expression was observed by the earlier time point of 30 min (Fig. 1 B).l-Arginine alone had no effect on ICAM-1 expression (Fig.1 B). No change in the level of AKT expression (the internal control) was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). These results demonstrate that VEGF and NO regulate ICAM-1 expression. To delineate the signaling pathway by which VEGF up-regulates ICAM-1 expression, we determined the effects of VEGF and NO on AKT phosphorylation. We found that AKT was highly phosphorylated at 15 and 30 min and that NO enhanced this phosphorylation of AKT (Fig.2). Phosphorylation of AKT occurred 15 min earlier than the expression of ICAM-1 during this synergistic stimulation with VEGF and NO (compare Fig. 1 B with Fig. 2). These results suggest that up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression by VEGF is mediated via AKT. To test the involvement of PI3K in VEGF signaling to ICAM-1, we used the PI3K-specific inhibitor, wortmannin (100 nm). We found that wortmannin completely abolished the effects of VEGF and NO on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3). l-Arginine alone had no effect on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3). To delineate the role of AKT in NO secretion in BMEC, we transfected primary BMEC with either the pLNCX vector alone as a control, the full-length AKT-cDNA (wt-AKT), mutant AKT (mt-AKT), or the pLNCX-HA-myr-AKT (myr-AKT) construct. The constitutively active myr-AKT-HA cDNA construct significantly increased production of NO (p < 0.0005), whereas the mutant dominant-negative myr-AKT (mt-AKT) did not affect NO production (Fig.4, A and B). Efficiency of transfection was about 55–60%, as confirmed by co-transfection of the pGFP and AKT cDNA constructs in primary BMEC. These data indicate the involvement of AKT in NO signaling. To elucidate the effect of VEGF on BMEC migration and determine whether this migration is mediated via ICAM-1, we analyzed the migration of BMEC upon VEGF and l-arginine treatment using the migration assay as described previously (2.Komatsu T. Ireland D.D. Chung N. Dore A. Yoder M. Shoshkes Reiss C. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that BMEC migrated in response to VEGF. We demonstrated that VEGF (V) as well as NO (A) significantly increased (Fig. 5, p < 0.01) BMEC migration, and the combination of VEGF with NO (V+A) resulted in an even larger increase (Fig. 5, p < 0.0001) in migration. The effect of VEGF on BMEC migration was significantly (Fig. 5, p < 0.001) reduced in the presence of either the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (V+W), the monoclonal ICAM-1 blocking antibody (V+I), the specific NOS inhibitor l-NMMA (V+N), or by the combination of wortmannin and monoclonal ICAM-1 antibody (V+WI), which specifically neutralized ICAM-1 function. In addition, increased endothelial cell migration induced by VEGF plus l-arginine was significantly (Fig. 5, p < 0.0001) blocked by wortmannin (VA+W), the monoclonal ICAM-1 antibodies (VA+I) (Fig. 5, p < 0.0005), the specific NOS inhibitor l-NMMA (VA+N) (Fig. 5,p < 0.001), or by both wortmannin and the monoclonal ICAM-1 antibodies (VA+WI) (Fig. 5, p < 0.0001). These data demonstrate that VEGF modulates BMEC migration and that ICAM-1 is an important component of BMEC migration. In this study, we have demonstrated that ICAM-1 expression is up-regulated by VEGF, via the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway, leading to BMEC migration (see Fig. 6 for illustration and Ref. 4.He H. Venema V.J.

The BBB consists mainly of one layer of endothelial cells lining the brain microvessels, supported by astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, and basal lamina (27.Bradbury M.W. Exp. Physiol. 1993; 78: 453-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The BBB is characterized by a complexly arranged tight junction, a very low rate of transcytotic vesicular transport, and highly selective permeability (28.Janzer C.R. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using rat primary BMEC, we observed that VEGF plays an important role in the signaling and up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression and the modulation of migration through the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway in BMEC. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, completely blocked the AKT phosphorylation induced by VEGF. Upon treatment of BMEC with VEGF, AKT is phosphorylated via PI3K leading to increased NO production and secretion and resulting in the up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. This newly identified signaling pathway in BMEC is important for BMEC function and migration as well as for maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Our findings are supported by studies in other endothelial systems such as bovine aortic endothelial cells, where VEGF is a potent inducer of bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation and migration (3.Nicolson G.L.

Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cell migration is crucial for angiogenesis, embryonic development, wound repair, tumor formation, cancer metastasis, and inflammatory immune response (6.Murohara T. Witzenbichler B. Spyridopoulos I.

Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF has been reported to increase the permeability of pial microcirculation in rats via a NOS/cGMP-dependent pathway (12.Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF plays an important role in the migration and permeability of BMEC, which effect BBB integrity. BMEC are actively involved in facilitating T lymphocyte migration through the BBB via ICAM-1 (18.Adamson P. Etienne S. Couraud P.O. Calder V. Greenwood J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2964-2973PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present findings that link the components VEGF, AKT, NO, and ICAM-1 into one integrated pathway. Specifically, we demonstrate that VEGF induces NO release leading to enhanced ICAM-1 expression and migration in BMEC and that this signaling occurs via the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway (Fig. 6). ICAM-1 activation in BMEC has been shown to transduce signals in these cells, which leads to cytoskeleton changes and the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes into the brain (25.Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1, a potent member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is present on resting endothelial cells. The expression of ICAM-1 on activated endothelial cells and on various other cell types is markedly induced during inflammation (29.Zhang R.L. Chopp M. Zaloga C. Zhang Z.G. Jiang N. Gautam S.C.

Adamson P. Greenwood J. Strosberg A.D. Cazaubon S. Couraud P.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5755-5761PubMed Google Scholar), although its pathological significance has yet to be determined. The Flk-1/KDR receptor and PI3K/AKT signal transduction were shown to be crucial elements in the process leading to survival of human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by VEGF (32.Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). PI3K activity is also necessary for the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in response to angiopoietin-1 (33.Fujikawa K. Scherpenseel I.A. Jain S.K. Presman E. Varticovski L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). VEGF is a potent stimulator of NO and prostacyclin-prostaglandin I2 production. NO formation activates guanylate cyclase within vascular smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells, causing cGMP production. This NO-cGMP cascade is thought to have an important role in the vasoactive effect of VEGF (1.Risau W. Wolburg H. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 174-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), as well as in intracellular NO generation and oxidation (26.Radisavljevic Z. George M. Dries D.J.

A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In our study, we were able to demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of NO production in BMEC via PI3K/AKT (Fig. 3). NO is downstream of AKT in VEGF signaling, as shown in our studies in BMEC (Figs. 1 and 2), as well as in other studies in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (36.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrate that NO has an important role in VEGF signaling and in BMEC migration (5.Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37.Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). NOS was reported to be downstream of AKT in the survival pathway (38.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that phosphorylated AKT has an effect on the production of NO in BMEC and that transfection of the constitutively active myr-AKT-HA construct caused a significant increase in NO production (Fig. 4 B). The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT/PKB mediates activation of eNOS in endothelial cells and is dependent on AKT phosphorylation, which leads to increased NO production (36.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). AKT phosphorylates eNOS on serine 1177 and activates the enzyme leading to NO production, whereas mutant eNOS (S1179A) is resistant to phosphorylation. Stimuli that promote NO release act through a PI3K-dependent mechanism (39.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). However, increases in intracellular calcium, insulin, and shear stress acting through PI3K-independent mechanisms have no effect on NO release (40.Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 41.Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Ayajiki K. Kindermann M.

Res. 1998; 83: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway or mutation of the AKT site on the eNOS protein (at serine 1177) attenuates serine phosphorylation and prevents the activation of eNOS (36.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Based on our results, AKT mediates cytoprotection of BMEC in response to VEGF (44.Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and NO directly up-regulates ICAM-1 expression and induces significant BMEC migration. These results are in agreement with the findings of other reports demonstrating that AKT directly influences the production of NO in COS-7 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (36.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar,39.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K.

Taken together, our study demonstrates a role for VEGF signaling and migration in BMEC, through the PI3K/AKT/NO pathway resulting in the up-regulation of ICAM-1. These studies provide integrated insight into the role of this pathway in the function of BMEC and in the maintenance of BBB integrity.

The mammalian multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP1) and its yeast homologue, YCF1, which belong to the ABC transporter family are able to transport glutathione out of the cytoplasm.

Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). HGT1 was cloned by PCR.1 The following primers were used for amplifying HGT1 from chromosomal DNA of a wild type strain (YPH499); YJL-Bam, 5′-CCGCGAATTCATGATTACCACCATTTATCATAACC-3′ and YJL-Eco, 5′-CACAGGATCCATGAGTACCATTTATAGGGAGAGC-3′. The 2.4-kilobase PCR product obtained was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into a single copy, URA3-based yeast expression vector downstream of the TEF promoter (20.Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). To check the viability ofgsh1Δ and hgt1Δ double deletes, a diploid heterozygous for both markers was constructed by crossing ABC869 (gsh1Δ::LEU2) with ABC822 (hgt1Δ::LEU2). The diploid was sporulated on minimal sporulation plates (19.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) and tetrads were dissected. The spores were dropped on either YPD or YPD supplemented with excess glutathione (1 mm). After initial patching on YPD plates, spores were replica plated on SD minus uracile, minus GSH, minus leucine, and minus tryptophane plates. Diploids heterozygous for ptr2Δ and gsh1Δ, and diploids heterozygous for ypr194Δ andgsh1Δ were constructed in a similar way. The diploids were sporulated and dissected as described above. The disruption at theGSH1 locus was followed by glutathione auxotrophy, while disruption at either the YPR194c locus or thePTR2 locus was followed either by uracile prototrophy or resistance to G418, respectively. The genotypes of the strains used in all the experiments are listed in TableI and their construction is described below. YPH 499 was used as wild type strain in all these experiments. Disruption of the different genes was carried out by one-step PCR-mediated gene disruption (21.Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Strains triply disrupted in the different peptide and putative peptide transporters were constructed by using the KanMX2 marker for PTR2 disruption, theURA3 marker for YPR194c disruption, and theLEU2 marker for HGT1 disruption. These disruptions were to be eventually constructed in YPH 499. However, as this strain is not completely disrupted in either the URA3allele or the LEU2 allele, PCR-mediated gene disruption using the URA3/LEU2 alleles would not occur efficiently. Therefore, YPR194c and HGT1 were first disrupted through PCR-mediated gene disruption in the strain BY 4741 which carries null alleles of both URA3 andLEU2 (22.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.C. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). The hgt1 Δ::LEU2 and theypr194cΔ::URA3 disruptions in BY 4741 were then PCR amplified to yield larger flanking regions and introduced into YPH 499. The disruptions were confirmed by PCR. The primers used for the disruption of YPR194c were: 194-URA-F, 5′-AGTCAAAGATAAAGTTATAATTGATGAGAAGGTATCCACAGCTTTTCAATTCAAT-3′ and 194-URA-R, 5′-GGGCTCATATTAAGCATTCCACCTACAAATAACATTGGGTAATAACTGATATAATTA-3′. The primers used to confirm YPR194c disruption were: 194-FOR, 5′-ATTAGAAATTATGAGTGAAAC-3′ and 194-REV, 5′-GTTCTAGTCATGGATAGTGTC-3′. The primers used to disrupt HGT1 were: 212-LEU-F, 5′-CCATTTATAGGGAGAGCGACTCGTTGGAGTCGGAGCCCTCGACTACGTC GTAAGGCCG-3, and 212-LEU-R, 5′-CAAGCCTTGTCTCATGACAATAAATCCGTATAGCTTGAATGGAATCCCAACAATTACA-3′. The primers used for the confirmation of HGT1 disruptions were: 212-FOR, 5′-GATTACCACCATTTATCATAACC-3′ and 212-REV, 5′-CGTCACAGAACACATGAGTACC-3′. For the disruption of PTR2, the KanMX2 selection marker was used and the transformants were selected on G418 containing plates (23.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The primers used for PTR2 disruption were: PTR-DEL1, 5′-ATCCCAGCCAAGGCTCAGATGCTCAGGACGAAAAGCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and PTR-DEL2, 5′-CTGGTCGGCAATCAACACGGAAAGGTTAGCTTTAATCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′. The primers used to confirm PTR2 disruption were: PTR2-FOR, 5′-ATAAACGGATCCAATGCTCAACCATCCCAGCC-3′ and PTR2-REV, 5′-ATGCACAAAAGCTTGCAGAACCAAAGGCGTCGTTAGTC-3′. Each of the disruptions was made in an YPH 499 background. The double and triple disruptions were carried out sequentially. Disruptions in GSH1 were constructed using a GSH1::LEU2 plasmid (24.Liskowsky T. Curr. Gen. 1993; 23: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on minimal liquid medium YNB complemented with ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose. When several strains differing in auxotrophy were compared, the substances required by the most deleted yeast were added to the growth medium of all strains. Cells were incubated at 28 °C for growth for 12 h, rotary shaken at 200 rpm. The cells were harvested atA 600 0.6, washed with a large volume of sterile water (4 °C), and 20 mm MES/KOH, 5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2% glucose (pH 5.5) (unless otherwise stated). They were finally resuspended in the buffered medium (culture medium volume/25), aliquoted in 100-μl samples, and kept on ice. After a 10-min incubation of the cells at 28 °C, [3H]GSH (1657.6 GBq mmol−1) was added to the buffered medium to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (final specific activity 12.33 Mbq mmol−1). At selected times, uptake was stopped by diluting the medium with a 20-fold volume of water (4 °C) and filtering the cells through a glass fiber filter (Sartorius AG, 37070 Goettingen, Germany). The cells trapped on the filter were washed twice with the same volume of cold water. The filter was dried and placed in a scintillation vial containing 4 ml of Ecolite (ICN, Orsay, France). The radioactivity was counted after correction for background and quenching (Packard Instruments, Les Ulis, France). The N-ethylmaleimideS-conjugate of glutathione was synthesized by mixing NEM dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl with the same amount of GSH dissolved in the same buffer. After 1 h a room temperature, dithiothreitol was added to neutralize NEM in excess (25.Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The purity of the conjugate was checked by mass spectrometry. Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a control. S. cerevisiae has been reported to have a single peptide transporter, Ptr2p, that can transport dipeptides and tripeptides (27.Perry J.R. Basrai M.A. Steiner H-Y. Naider F. Becker H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Due to the wide substrate specificity reported for this transporter, the possibility that Ptr2p might be the transporter for the tripeptide glutathione was initially examined. Yeast strains defective in glutathione biosynthesis (gsh1Δ) depend on exogenous glutathione for growth (28.Chaudhuri B. Ingavale S. Bachhawat A.K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29.Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Should Ptr2p be the transporter mediating glutathione uptake, thenptr2Δgsh1Δ spores would not be viable. Tetrad dissections of diploids heterozygous for ptr2Δ andgsh1Δ were carried out. However, among the several tetrads that were dissected, all 4 spores were viable and several ptr2Δ gsh1Δ spores were isolated that did not appear to have any visible growth defect. This suggested that even if Ptr2p mediated glutathione transport, it was not the sole transporter. Potential glutathione transport activity of Ptr2p was determined by comparing glutathione uptake in a wild type and ptr2Δ strains. The data clearly indicate that Ptr2p does not mediate GSH transport (data not shown). Studies with the yeast Candida albicansearlier have revealed a new peptide transporter family that was able to transport tetra- and pentapeptides (30.Lubkowitz M.A. Hauser L. Breslav M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The gene OPT1 has homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Isp4+) and S. cerevisiae (open reading frame YJL212c and YPR194c). Disruption of YPR194c in S. cerevisiae did not cause any difference in sensitivity to toxic oligopeptides. Overexpression revealed a very mild phenotype. However, no phenotype was found after either disruption or overexpression of YJL212c (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A possible role of these proteins in glutathione transport was tested. Strains disrupted in both YJL212c and YPR194c genes were constructed. When the double disrupted strains were examined for transport activity, virtually no GSH transport could be observed (Fig.1). Examination of the transport capacity of single disruptants showed a total lack of transport in the yjl212Δ strain, whereas the ypr194Δ strain took up GSH at the same rate as the wild type (Fig. 1). The transport activity of the triple disruptant ofyjl212Δ ypr194Δ ptr2Δ was comparable to the transport activity of yjl212Δ single disruptants (Fig. 1). Altogether, the data strongly suggest that the protein encoded by YJL212c (from now on referred to as HGT1, high affinity glutathione transporter 1) is probably the glutathione transporter in the plasma membrane of these cells. To further confirm the function of HGT1, the transport activity of hgt1Δ disruptants complemented by the HGT1 gene was studied. The HGT1 gene was cloned and expressed in a single copy expression vector downstream of the TEF promoter. Transformation of the hgt1Δ disruptants with this construct restored GSH transport (data not shown), which definitively established that Hgt1p is a glutathione transporter. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that HGT1 gene encodes a 799-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 91627 Da and a pI of 9.00. Analysis of the hydropathy profile (32.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of 12–14 putative transmembrane domains (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which is typical for many transporter proteins. The N and C termini are hydrophilic, and the N terminus is particularly long, with a stretch of about 100 amino acids (Fig. 2).Figure 2Hydropathy plot of Hgt1p. The peptide sequence derived from HGT1 was plotted according to Kyte and Doolittle with a window of 9 amino acids. Hydrophobic regions are given a positive hydropathy index.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transport activity ofHGT1 was further characterized with the wild type as well as with the hgt1Δ/TEF-HGT1 strain. pH dependence studies indicated that the initial rate of GSH uptake into the wild type and hgt1Δ/TEF-HGT1 strain was maximal between pH 5.0 and 5.5 (data not shown). Further studies were run at pH 5.5. Hardly any transport activity was detected at 4 °C, indicating that uptake was an active process (Fig.3). The transport of GSH was also significantly inhibited by the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 3), suggesting that transport activity depended on the transmembrane pH gradient. Kinetic studies yielded a K m of 53.9 ± 5.5 μm (mean of four measurements) and aV max of 10.0 ± 0.6 nmol of GSH·mg protein−1 min−1 (Fig.4). Substrate specificity was studied by measuring uptake of labeled GSH in the presence of a 100-fold excess of various unlabeled potential competitors. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled GSH was used as a control to compare the different potential competitors. Amino acids like l-Pro, Gly, andl-Glu had little effect on GSH transport (Fig. 3). In addition, the hgt1Δ strain was able to transportl-Pro at rates similar to the wild type strain (data not shown), which suggests that amino acid transport is not the primary function of Hgt1p. Marginal inhibition was observed with bothl- and d-Cys, as well as with glutamine. However, various di- or tripeptides such as Gly-Gly, Gly-Gly-Gly, and Gly-Glu as well as the dipeptides γ-Glu-Cys and Cys-Gly were poor inhibitors (Fig. 3). In contrast, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the glutathione conjugate GS-NEM were almost as inhibitory as GSH itself. Because the synthesis of the GS-NEM conjugate requires the use of small amounts of DTT to neutralize excess NEM, additional controls were run to test the effects of DTT on the uptake of GSH in the presence and absence of GS-NEM. These controls showed that DTT does not affect the results, and therefore that GS-NEM does indeed inhibit GSH uptake (Fig.3). That glutathione S-conjugates may be transported by Hgt1p was further checked by uptake studies with labeled GS-NEM (Fig.5). Labeled GS-NEM could indeed be taken up by the hgt1Δ/TEF-HGT1 strain, but not by thehgt1Δ mutant, which clearly shows that Hgt1p transports both GSH as well as GS conjugates.Figure 4Double reciprocal plots of GSH uptake kinetics in in hgt1Δ strains transformed with TEF-HGT1. Initial rates of uptake were measured at GSH concentrations ranging from 10 μm to 1 mm, between 1 and 3 min. Data are representative from three experiments (4 replicates per experiment).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Hgt1p-mediated uptake of [3H]glutathione-N-ethylmaleimide conjugate (GS-NEM). hgt1Δ, (○), hgt1Δ, TEF (▵), and hgt1Δ, TEF-HGT1 (■) strains were incubated in 0.1 mm [3H]GS-NEM for various times. To ensure the total elimination of GSH in the GS-NEM solution, NEM was added in excess before conjugation and afterward neutralized with DTT (final concentration of 5 μm). Competitive inhibition of GS-NEM uptake was carried out with added GSH at a final concentration of 1 mm (▾). For comparison, GSH uptake was also measured in hgt1Δ, TEF-HGT1 (●) yeasts from a 0.1 mm solution. Each point is the mean ± S.E. of four samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although virtually no GSH transport was observed in strains disrupted solely in HGT1, the gene has been predicted to belong to an oligopeptide permease transporter family (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The presence of other glutathione transporters that would be induced under some conditions, therefore, could not be ruled out. This possibility was also suggested by an earlier report characterizing glutathione transport in S. cerevisiae, which concerned strains defective in sulfur metabolism (10.Miyake T. Hazu T. Yoshida S. Kanayama M. Tomochika K. Shinoda S. Ono B. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This report indicated the existence of two saturable glutathione uptake systems withK m values of 0.45 μm and 2 mm, respectively. The low affinity system was due to the activity of a constitutive transporter, and the high affinity system corresponded to a sulfur repressible transporter. The high affinity transport activity was inducible and maximally induced by the absence of sulfur in the medium. The transport activity of the wild type and ofhgt1Δ strains cultivated in the presence or absence of sulfur, as well as in the presence or absence of glutathione was studied. The data (Fig. 6) clearly indicated that the absence of glutathione was a strong inducer (or derepressor) of GSH transport activity in the wild type strain, whereas sulfur deficiency per se had no effect. The specific repression of the transport activity by glutathione argues strongly for Hgt1p being primarily a glutathione transporter. The possible existence of other glutathione transporters was also examined by a genetic approach. A diploid heterozygous forhgt1Δ and gsh1Δ was constructed. Thehgt1Δ/HGT1 gsh1Δ/GSH1 diploid was sporulated and dissected. Among 15 analyzed tetrads, one was 4-spore, 8 were 3-spore, and 6 were 2-spore. The presence of a wild type or of a disruptedHGT1 gene was confirmed by PCR. All the gsh1Δspores were subsequently analyzed to see if any of thegsh1Δ spores carried the hgt1Δ disrupted gene. This analysis was done by PCR since both gsh1Δ and the hgt1Δ deletions were marked by the LEU2marker. All the gsh1Δ spores were analyzed and none of thegsh1Δ spores were found to carry the hgt1Δdisrupted gene. Furthermore, the missing spores in the 2-spore and 3-spore tetrad corresponded to the gsh1Δ hgt1Δ double deletes. No spore appeared even after prolonged incubation of the plates. Tetrad dissections were also carried out by dropping the spores on media containing higher (1 mm) concentrations of glutathione to determine if there may still be a low affinity transporter. Again, no gsh1Δ hgt1Δ spore could be isolated under these conditions. The non-viability of the gsh1Δ hgt1Δ spores further confirmed that the HGT1 gene encoded the primary glutathione transporter in the plasma membrane of this yeast. Yeast strains bearing a deletion in the MET15(MET17) gene are unable to utilize inorganic sources of sulfur for growth but can use organic sulfur sources such as methionine, cysteine, and glutathione (10.Miyake T. Hazu T. Yoshida S. Kanayama M. Tomochika K. Shinoda S. Ono B. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33.Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed a met15Δ hgt1Δ double deletion and examined its growth on different sources of organic sulfur. These strains could grow on methionine as a source of organic sulfur but were specifically unable to utilize glutathione as a source of organic sulfur (Fig.7). The results are in agreement with the function of Hgt1p being described as a glutathione transporter, and are also in agreement with Hgt1p being the primary glutathione transporter in the plasma membrane of this yeast. Data base searches for Hgt1p homologues in other organisms using different BLAST/BLAST-PSI programs (34.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar, 35.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) yielded several homologues in yeasts and plants. The proteins displayed between 38 and 51% identity and between 57 and 68% similarity over the entire stretch to Hgt1p. The genome of the yeastC. albicans contains a single homologue identified so far, Opt1p, while three homologues were found in S. pombe (Isp4p and accession numbers AL023590.1 and Z99164.1) (Fig.8). The Isp4p and Opt1p proteins have been putatively identified as oligopeptide permeases in these yeasts (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but in the light of our findings and the close homology to Hgt1p, it is possible that their primary function may be as glutathione transporters. The genome of S. cerevisiae also contains an homologue to Hgt1p (Ypr194cp). Although the function of Ypr194cp is unclear, studies with strains carrying a deletion inYPR194c did not contribute in any way to plasma membrane glutathione transport (Fig. 1). One possibility is that it might be localized to a different organelle. Several homologues were also found in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) and ESTs in cotton and inNeurospora crassa. Surprisingly, no homologue was found in either E. coli or any other prokaryote or in any other multicellular eukaryotes other than plants. A BLAST search using different domains of this protein also failed to pick up any homologue in systems apart from plants and yeasts. The present paper describes the cloning and characterization of Hgt1p, a high affinity plasma membrane glutathione transporter from the yeast S. cerevisiae. Hgt1p is the first high affinity glutathione transporter described from any system so far. The strategy employed involved the identification of candidate glutathione transporters from the yeast genome sequence, followed by a combination of genetic and physiological (growth properties, uptake studies) approaches. Evidence that HGT1 encodes a glutathione transporter was obtained by loss of GSH transport activity upon gene disruption, and by restoration of transport activity by complementation of a hgt1Δ mutant with a plasmid bearing theHGT1 gene. Several lines of evidence suggest that glutathione uptake is the primary function of the protein encoded byHGT1. The HGT1 product mediates a specific uptake of GSH, GSSG, and GS-NEM. Neither an excess of l-amino acids nor various di- and tripeptides affects this uptake to any significant extent, and the hgt1Δ strain takes up amino acids such as proline at a normal rate. Derepression of GSH transport activity by glutathione deficiency is a further indication that Hgt1p is primarily a glutathione transporter and not a nonspecific oligopeptide permease as it was thought previously (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although Hgt1p clearly functions at the plasma membrane, the possibility that it might also be localized to a different membrane has not been examined. The 40% inhibition by CCCP was similar to the CCCP inhibition levels seen in proton-coupled glutathione transport observed in plant protoplasts (11.Jamai A. Tommasini R. Martinoia E. Delrot S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inhibition by CCCP is never complete in proton-coupled systems, because there is a residual passive electrical component of the proton-motive force, even if the pH gradient would be completely collapsed. Hgt1p represents a novel class of transporter proteins. Sequence analysis revealed virtually no homology of the Hgt1p with the glutathione-conjugate pumps, YCF1 or MRP, that are able to mediate transport of glutathione with low affinity (17.Rappa G. Lorico A. Flavell R.A. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5232-5237PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hgt1p also appeared to be distinct from the yeast peptide transporters, Ptr2p, as well as other amino acid, dicarboxylic acid, and tricarboxylic transporters. Our attempts to identify other secondary plasma membrane glutathione transporters in S. cerevisiae were unsuccessful. Thehgt1Δ strain did not display any detectable glutathione uptake activity, and transport activity in this strain could not be induced by deficiency of glutathione or other sulfur compounds. Furthermore, double mutants in hgt1Δ andgsh1Δ were non-viable and could not be rescued even in the presence of high glutathione concentrations. Ptr2p which displays a wide substrate specificity to number of di- and tripeptides was also completely unable to mediate uptake of external glutathione. Even if a second glutathione transporter exists, its contribution to glutathione uptake must, for these reasons, be considered very minimal. The S. cerevisiae genome contains a close homologue of Hgt1p, Ypr194cp, but disruption of this gene did not affect glutathione uptake to any discernable extent. In addition, the lethality of thehgt1Δ gsh1Δ spores and the inability of hgt1Δ met15Δ spores to grow on glutathione further suggest that Ypr194cp makes no significant contribution to plasma membrane glutathione uptake. Overexpression of Ypr194cp, but not Hgt1p, results in mild toxicity of certain tetra- and pentapeptides (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, either YPR194c indeed encodes an oligopeptide transporter protein that is very closely related to HGT1, or, more likely, it encodes a glutathione transporter localized into a different organelle. The S. pombe Isp4p gene is a close homologue of Hgt1p (38% identity and 57% similarity over the entire stretch). This gene was initially identified as a gene induced during sporulation (37.Sato S. Suzuki H. Widyastuti U. Hotta Y. Tabata S. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and its product displays oligopeptide transport activity for tetra- and pentapeptides (31.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). S. pombe diploids homozygous for defects in glutathione biosynthesis fail to sporulate, indicating an increased glutathione requirement during the sporulation process (28.Chaudhuri B. Ingavale S. Bachhawat A.K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made earlier with S. cerevisiaediploids homozygous for gsh1Δ (38.Ohtake Y. Satou A. Yabuuchi S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3145-3150Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that genes such as isp4 + are induced during sporulation to meet the increased requirement for glutathione. The strong homology to HGT1 does indeed suggest that the primary function of the protein encoded by isp4 +is glutathione uptake, but this remains to be demonstrated. Two other homologues of S. pombe as well as five homologues from theA. thaliana genome have been revealed. The functional characterization of each of these putative glutathione transporters needs further investigations. It is surprising that HGT1 did not display any homologues in eukaryotes other than yeasts and plants. This includesCaenorhabditis elegans for which the complete genome sequence is now available. However, extensive studies have been carried out on glutathione transport in mammalian liver cells, where glutathione plays a particularly important role. In these cells, the transporters have a much lower affinity for glutathione (K m = 0.3 mm; Ref. 8.Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than that measured for Hgt1p. However, other studies with human small intestinal epithelial cells (12.Iantomasi T. Favilli F. Marriani P. Magaldi T. Bruni P. Vincenzini M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have indicated the presence of high affinity glutathione transporters (K m = 90 μm), an affinity comparable to that of Hgt1p. Therefore, high affinity glutathione transporters for glutathione also probably exist in mammalian systems, but they have yet to be identified. It is also possible that there may be a second class of glutathione transporters in these systems. If indeed glutathione uptake is mediated by different proteins in plants and animals, then the plant protein, easily accessible from the free space, and absent in animals would be a good target for herbicides not toxic to animals. The description ofHGT1 and the existence of several yeast and plant homologues should greatly facilitate the cloning, analysis, and our understanding of these transporters. We thank Dr. J. M.Berjault (University of Poitiers) for help in mass spectrometry analysis."

The corresponding proteins are co-expressed in broad regions of the brain and associate to heteromeric K+ channels. These channels mediate M-type currents that regulate neuronal excitability. We investigated the basis for the increase in currents seen after co-expressing these subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Noise analysis and single channel recordings revealed a conductance of ≈ 18 pS for KCNQ2 and ≈7 pS for KCNQ3. Different conductance levels (ranging from 8 to 22 pS) were seen upon co-expression. Their weighted average is close to that obtained by noise analysis (16 pS). The open probability of heteromeric channels was not increased significantly. Co-expression of both subunits increased the surface expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 by factors of 5 and >10, respectively. A KCNQ2 mutant associated with BFNC that has a truncated cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus did not reach the surface and failed to stimulate KCNQ3 surface expression. By contrast, several BFNC-associated missense mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 did not alter their surface expression. Thus, the increase in currents seen upon co-expressing KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 is predominantly due to an increase in surface expression, which is dependent on an intact carboxyl terminus.

Dominant negative mutations in KCNQ1 (also known as KvLQT1) lead to the long QT syndrome, which is characterized by potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias (1.Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C.

When mutated on both alleles as in the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, patients suffer additionally from congenital deafness (2.Neyroud N. Tesson F. Denjoy I. Leibovici M. Donger C. Barhanin J.

Finally, mutations in either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 lead to benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC),1 a dominantly inherited epilepsy of the newborn (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F.

KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are expressed nearly exclusively in the central nervous system (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may form heteromeric potassium channels. This could explain the fact that mutations in either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 lead to the same clinical phenotype. Indeed, when KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, currents were much larger than those obtained from KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 alone (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Additionally, a mutant of KCNQ3 that was constructed in analogy to a dominant negative KCNQ1 mutant suppressed KCNQ2 currents (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), and heteromeric channels showed a decreased sensitivity to the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The pharmacological profile, the voltage dependence, and kinetics of currents suggest that these channels may be a molecular correlate of M-type currents (10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). M-type currents, which are exquisitely regulated by several receptor systems (11.Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), are active at the threshold of action potential firing. This renders M-type currents an important regulator of neuronal excitability. All BFNC mutations that have been identified do not exert dominant negative effects, and consequently the reduction of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents in patients was predicted to be small (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, the magnitude of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents is probably close to a critical, pathogenic level during early life (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers have typical properties of M-type channels, it seems unlikely that there is just a single M channel. There may be other KCNQ subunits that increase the molecular diversity of M-type currents. For instance, KCNQ4 can form heteromeric channels with KCNQ3. These heteromers display several properties of M-type currents, including a sensitivity to linopirdine (3.Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Additionally,eag(ether-a-gogo)-related channels share some properties with M-type currents (12.Selyanko A.A. Hadley J.K. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Delmas P. Buckley N.J. London B. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7742-7756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Meves H. Schwarz J.R. Wulfsen I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the basis for the increase in currents observed upon co-expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). This increase may be due to an increased single channel conductance or open probability, to a larger number of active channels at the cell surface, or to a combination of these factors. We determined the single channel conductances of homo- and heteromeric channels by noise analysis and single channel recordings. Additionally, we determined the surface expression of epitope-tagged channels using a detection system based on luminescence (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We conclude that the increase in current cannot be explained by an increase in single channel conductance or in open probability but is primarily due to an increased surface expression of active channels. In addition, we identify differential effects on surface expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations that were found in neonatal epilepsy. These results show that the carboxyl terminus is required for an efficient transport to the surface. cRNA synthesis, oocyte injection, and incubation were performed as described (3.Kubisch C.

Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). cRNA was derived from human KCNQ2 (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) and KCNQ3 (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) cDNAs (or mutants) that had been inserted into the oocyte expression vector pTLN (15.Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution. Approximately 5 ng of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 cRNA or 5 ng of a 1:1 mixture of both were injected per oocyte. For patch clamping, the vitelline layer was removed manually, and the oocytes were then bathed in a solution containing 10 mm KCl, 90 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The resting potential of the oocyte in this solution will be close to 0 mV. 2–7 days after injection, recordings were made at 19 ± 1 °C from cell-attached patches. Patch pipettes were made from alumino-silicate glass and were filled with a solution containing 10 mm KCl, 90 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded with a List EPC-7 amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany) and the Pulse program (Heka, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). For noise analysis, data were recorded at 5–10 kHz and low pass filtered at 2–5 kHz. Data were analyzed using self-written software (written in Visual C++, Microsoft) and the SigmaPlot program (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera). Voltage clamp protocols are described in the figure legends. Leak currents were estimated by assuming that channels are closed completely during a long pulse to −100 mV. Capacity transients were measured from the response to a step to 0 mV (i.e.close to the reversal potential) and subtracted off-line. Nonstationary noise analysis was performed as described (16.Pusch M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 437: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Pusch M. Steinmeyer K. Jentsch T.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Statistical errors are given as standard deviations. Two electrode voltage clamping of oocytes was performed using a Turbotec amplifier (npi Instruments, Tamm, Germany) and pCLAMP software (Axon, Foster City, state). To measure surface expression of KCNQ proteins, we used the method recently described by Zerangue et al. (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). KCNQ channel subunits were tagged with an HA epitope in the extracellular loop that connects transmembrane domains S1 and S2. To increase the accessibility of the HA epitope by the cognate antibody, we enlarged this short loop (≈9 amino acids) by flanking the epitope with fragments from the extracellular D1-D2 loop of the ClC-5 chloride channel (18.Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (a similar HA-tagged construct in ClC-5 shows normal channel activity and can be used to measure surface expression). 2M. Schwake and T. J. Jentsch, unpublished results. These insertions change the sequence between transmembrane domains S1 and S2 to115KEYEKSSEGSEH YPYDVPDYA VTFEERDKCPEWNA126in KCNQ2 and to145KEYETVSGDNSEH YPYDVPDYA VTFEERDKCPEWNW156in KCNQ3 (HA epitope shown in bold type, and residues derived from ClC-5 are in italics). These mutants were constructed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction and verified by sequencing. Unless otherwise noted, oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA of KCNQ2-HA or KCNQ3-HA or 10 ng of a 1:1 mixture of (a) KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (control), (b) KCNQ2-HA and KCNQ3, (c) KCNQ3-HA and KCNQ2, or (d) combinations with mutants found in epilepsy. After 3 days at 17 °C, oocytes were placed for 30 min in ND96 with 1% BSA at 4 °C to block unspecific binding, incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1% BSA/ND96), washed at 4 °C, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat FAB fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch, in 1% BSA for 30–60 min at 4 °C). Oocytes were washed thoroughly (1% BSA at 4 °C for 60 min) and transferred to frog Ringer solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of Power Signal ELISA solution (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA). The oocytes used to measure the surface expression of channel subunits were subsequently pooled and stored at −20 °C. After homogenization of the pooled oocytes in an ice-cold solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and a protease inhibitor mix (CompleteR; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the yolk platelets were removed by three low speed centrifugations. The resulting supernatant was mixed with SDS-Laemmli sample buffer, and the protein equivalent to one oocyte was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% polyacrylamide). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Primary (rat anti-HA monoclonal 3F10, 200 ng/ml) and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, 1:10000) antibodies were diluted in TBS blocking solution. Washes were in TBS with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Reacting proteins were detected by using the Renaissance reagent (NEN Life Science Products) and photographic film (Kodak). Two methods were used to measure single channel conductances of homomeric and heteromeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels. Using noise analysis on macro patches, estimates for single channel conductances were obtained from large ensembles of channels. These values were then corroborated by single channel analysis. This dual approach avoids the problem that single channel recordings may represent channels that do not mediate the bulk of the current. For nonstationary noise analysis, currents of injected oocytes were measured in the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Because of a high potassium concentration in the bath, the resting voltage of the oocytes is expected to be close to 0 mV. The patch pipette also contained a high potassium concentration to increase the inward tail K+ currents during test pulses to negative voltages. Tail currents were measured after activating the channels by prepulses to positive voltages (+60 mV). Most patches contained several channels, and currents obtained from KCNQ2 and KCNQ2/KCNQ3 expressing oocytes were relatively large (Fig.1). Smaller currents were obtained for KCNQ3 (not shown). Noise analysis was performed by repeatedly applying a depolarizing prepulse followed by the test pulse to −100 mV. At these negative voltages, the channels close, reflecting changes in the open probability (P open). This change in open probability is a prerequisite for performing nonstationary noise analysis. Examples are shown in Fig.2 for KCNQ2 (Fig. 2 A), KCNQ3 (Fig. 2 B), and KCNQ2/KCNQ3 co-expression (Fig.2 C). Assuming a reversal potential of 0 mV, the single channel current was converted to conductance by dividing by −100 mV. The average single channel conductances of homomeric KCNQ2 and heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels were practically identical (KCNQ2, 17.8 ± 3.1 pS (n = 8 patches; ± S.D.); KCNQ2/KCNQ3, 16.3 ± 2.5 pS (n = 21)), whereas the conductance of KCNQ3 was about half that value (7.3 ± 0.7 pS (n = 7)) (all values determined at −100 mV). Thus, the large stimulation of macroscopic currents in oocytes co-expressing KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) cannot be explained by an increase in single channel conductance of heteromeric channels. Another possibility is that the maximum open probability of heteromeric channels is increased. From the variance mean plots (Fig. 2), this maximum open probability can be estimated as P max =I max/N/i, whereI max is the peak inward current immediately after the voltage step and N and i are the number of channels and the single channel current, respectively. Again the values for homomeric KCNQ2 and heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 were not significantly different from each other (KCNQ2, 0.61 ± 0.1 (n = 8); KCNQ2/KCNQ3, 0.72 ± 0.1 (n = 21)). The maximal open probability of KCNQ3 was slightly smaller (0.42 ± 0.1 (n = 7)).Figure 2Noise analysis of KCNQ2 (A), KCNQ3 (B), and co-expressed KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (C) channels. The traces on theleft side of each panel represent the mean current (upper trace) and the variance around the mean (lower trace) obtained after repeated voltage steps to +60 mV, followed by the test pulse to −100 mV. These tail currents at −100 mV were used for noise analysis (the interval that was analyzed is indicated by the bars above the registrations). On theright side of each panel, the corresponding variance-mean plots for the test-pulse current are shown, together with fits to the equation ς2 = i*I− I 2/N (where I is the mean current, i is the single channel current, andN is the number of channels (solid lines)). For clarity, the current in the variance-mean plot has been scaled by −1. The maximal current corresponds to the start of the deactivating pulse, and thus the initial, maximal open probability that corresponds to the open probability at the end of the depolarizing pre-pulse can be estimated by P max =I max/N/i.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To corroborate the results from our noise analysis, amplitude histograms of single channel events were constructed. Single channels could be observed in patches containing only a few active channels following deactivation of the majority of channels at late time points of the hyperpolarizing test pulse. Examples are shown in Fig. 3. For homomeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels single channel amplitudes (measured at −100 mV) were quite homogeneous and agreed well with the results from the noise analysis. For KCNQ2, we obtained 18.4 ± 1.5 pS (range, 16.1–20.8 pS; n = 12 patches) (Fig.3 B), and for KCNQ3, we obtained 7.4 ± 0.7 pS (range, 6.3–8.6 pS; n = 13 patches) (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the current amplitudes of channels obtained from oocytes co-expressing KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 varied from 8 to 22 pS (n= 52 patches) (Fig. 3, D–F).This range includes several conductance levels that were not seen with homomeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels that are expected to be present (albeit with low frequencies) in these co-injection experiments. The weighted mean value of these single channel conductances (16.2 ± 3.7 pS) was similar to the one obtained by noise analysis. The large increase in current seen upon co-expressing both subunits in Xenopus oocytes (more than 10-fold when compared with homomeric KCNQ2 channels and more than 100-fold when compared with KCNQ3 currents) (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) cannot be explained by a higher single channel conductance or an increased open probability of the heteromeric channels. This leaves the number of active channels at the cell surface as a possible explanation for the increase in current. We therefore investigated whether the amount of KCNQ2 at the surface could be increased by KCNQ3 and vice versa. An extracellular HA epitope was inserted into KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (Fig.4 A). Because there are no large extracellular loops in these proteins, it was difficult to choose an insertion site. We opted for the loop between transmembrane domains S1 and S2 to exclude effects on gating or permeation that may result from insertions between S3 and S4 (a determinant of voltage-dependent gating) and between S5 and S6 (which contains the pore loop). However, the small size of the S1/S2 loop of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 could have impeded the access of the HA antibody (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). To avoid this problem, additional amino acids (16 or 17) were inserted on both sides of the epitope. These amino acids were taken from the large extracellular loop between D1 and D2 of the Cl−channel ClC-5 (18.Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This loop was used previously as an insertion site for the HA epitope, leading to functional ClC-5 channels whose surface expression could be monitored with the HA antibody.2Expression of these HA-tagged KCNQ constructs in Xenopusoocytes led to typical macroscopic currents whose amplitudes, however, were only 50–70% of WT. Thus, these insertions do not change the biophysical properties of the channels but slightly decrease their expression. The amount of HA epitope at the surface was quantified by incubating nonpermeabilized oocytes with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. This was followed by an enzymatic amplification procedure that uses chemiluminescence as the final step (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). KCNQ channels devoid of HA epitopes were used as negative controls, and overall protein expression was tested by Western blotting of membranes from the oocytes used for measuring the surface expression. These experiments showed that both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 reach the surface when injected alone (Fig.4 B). The surface expression of KCNQ3 was less than half of that observed for KCNQ2. This low surface expression, together with the lower single channel conductance (≈7 pS versus ≈18 pS for KCNQ2) and the lower open probability (≈0.4 versus≈0.6) of KCNQ3, explains that KCNQ3 currents were more than 10-fold lower than those from KCNQ2 (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Co-expressing KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 at a 1:1 ratio led to a large increase in surface expression of both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. The surface expression of KCNQ2 increased by about 4-fold upon co-expression with KCNQ3, likewise that of KCNQ3 increased by more than a factor of 10 (Fig.4 B). These findings suggest a major role of increased surface expression in the observed increase in currents upon the formation of heteromers. When KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were co-expressed, the surface expression of KCNQ2 equaled that of KCNQ3. This is compatible with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We next investigated the effect of BFNC-associated mutations on surface expression. KCNQ2(1600ins5bp) is a mutation found in an Australian family with BFNC (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). It truncates the KCNQ2 protein in a carboxyl-terminal, cytoplasmic region that is highly conserved between KCNQ channels (Fig. 4 A). Two other KCNQ2 mutations in BFNC also truncate the protein prior to or within this region (5.Singh N.A. Charlier C. Stauffer D. DuPont B.R. Leach R.J. Melis R. Ronen G.M. Bjerre I. Quattlebaum T. Murphy J.V. McHarg M.L. Gagnon D. Rosales T.O. Peiffer A. Anderson V.E. Leppert M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). When we expressed HA-tagged KCNQ2(1600ins5bp) in Xenopus oocytes, we could not detect any significant surface expression (Fig.4 C, Q2HA(TR)). Furthermore, this mutant did not enhance the surface expression of KCNQ3 in co-expression experiments. In contrast, KCNQ2 missense mutations in either the pore-forming P-loop (Y284C) or in transmembrane domain S6 (A306T) (5.Singh N.A. Charlier C. Stauffer D. DuPont B.R. Leach R.J. Melis R. Ronen G.M. Bjerre I. Quattlebaum T. Murphy J.V. McHarg M.L. Gagnon D. Rosales T.O. Peiffer A. Anderson V.E. Leppert M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A) only caused a slight decrease in surface expression, while up-regulating the surface expression of HA-tagged KCNQ3 nearly as much as WT KCNQ2 (Fig.4 D). The effects of KCNQ3(G310V), which again changes an amino acid in the P-loop (Fig. 4 A), did not differ from those of WT KCNQ3 (Fig. 4 E). G310V is the only KCNQ3 mutation identified so far in BFNC (6.Charlier C. Singh N.A. Ryan S.G. Lewis T.B. Reus B.E. Leach R.J. Leppert M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Western blotting demonstrated that the epitope-tagged mutant proteins were produced in similar quantities to the tagged wild-type proteins (Fig. 4, F andG). KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits assemble to form heteromeric channels that mediate M-type potassium currents (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9.Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined single channel conductances and open probabilities (P open) of homo- and heteromeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels. The mean single channel conductance and the open probability of heteromeric channels were not significantly different from those of homomeric KCNQ2 channels, indicating that the increase in currents observed upon co-expressing both subunits in Xenopus oocytes cannot be explained by an increase in these parameters. Single channel recordings of Xenopus oocytes co-injected with both subunits revealed various single channel conductances, which probably reflect homomeric channels and heteromeric channels with different subunit stoichiometries. However, the present experiments do not allow us to correlate single channels with heteromeric channels of defined composition. Measurements of surface expression of epitope-tagged homo- and heteromeric channels revealed that both subunits traffic much more efficiently to the surface when they are co-expressed. Thus an increased surface expression is the main factor leading to larger macroscopic currents upon co-expression. The roughly 4-fold increase in surface expression of KCNQ2HA upon co-expression with KCNQ3 suggests an 8-fold increase in channels at the surface, because homomeric KCNQ2HA channels have four tagged subunits, whereas on average heteromeric KCNQ2HA/KCNQ3 channels are likely to have only two tagged subunits. This assumption is supported by data suggesting that either KCNQ2HA or KCNQ3HA, upon expression with the respective untagged partner, display a similar degree of surface expression, which is compatible with an overall 2:2 stoichiometry of heteromeric channels (which almost certainly will form tetramers). The roughly 8-fold increase in the number of channels at the surface compares well with the observed (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) 10- to 15-fold increase in current observed upon co-expression under identical experimental conditions. Because the total amount of cRNA injected in all experiments remained constant, problems associated with a saturation of the expression machinery of oocytes were minimized. One factor that might account for the remaining difference between the increase in surface expression and the increase in current could be the insertion of the HA epitope, which decreased currents to 50–70% of wild type. M channels in native tissues have a reported single channel conductance of 7–11 pS in rat sympathetic neurons (19.Selyanko A.A. Stansfeld C.E. Brown D.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 250: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20.Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 472: 711-724Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21.Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and cultured CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons (22.Selyanko A.A. Sim J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 71-91Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These values agree well with our estimates for heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 and homomeric KCNQ2 if one considers that the native channels were recorded under asymmetric, low extracellular K conditions. In the asymmetric solutions the slope conductance is expected to be reduced by a factor of about 1.5 at 0 mV when compared with symmetrical solutions because of the Goldman rectification (23.Goldman D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 27: 37-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). In addition, the heterologously expressed channels displayed a slight instantaneous inward rectification even under symmetrical potassium concentrations. Our analysis shows that mutants with a truncated carboxyl terminus do not reach the surface. In contrast, we demonstrate that channels having missense mutations in the transmembrane block (S1–S6) can assemble to form homo- and heteromeric channels that are nearly as efficiently expressed at the plasma membrane as WT channels. These results agree with previous electrophysiological analyses. Currents from KCNQ2(Y284C) homomeric channels were 30–60% of WT currents (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the absence of a difference in surface expression, this suggested that the channel functions less efficiently. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant KCNQ2(1600ins5bp) did not yield detectable currents (4.Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). However, it is beyond the scope of the present work to investigate whether the reduced currents (7.Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) of these missense mutations identified in BFNC are due to a decrease inP open or in single channel conductance. The lack of surface expression of the truncated subunit is compatible with the notion that the carboxyl terminus is required for the association of these subunits to form homo- or heteromeric channels, which in turn is necessary for reaching the surface. Indeed, the carboxyl termini of all known KCNQ proteins contain a highly conserved domain (which we propose to name the “A domain”) (Fig.4 A). It is tempting to speculate that the A domain is involved in subunit interactions. This would also explain why a similar truncation in KCNQ1 found in the recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (2.Neyroud N. Tesson F. Denjoy I. Leibovici M. Donger C. Barhanin J. Faure S. Gary F. Coumel P. Petit C. Schwartz K. Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) does not lead to a dominant negative effect (24.Wollnik B. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Esperer H.D. Wieacker P. Jentsch T.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, additional experiments are required to test this hypothesis. Many ion channels are heteromers of homologous pore-forming subunits or other associated nonhomologous subunits. In many cases only the correctly assembled channels reach their target membranes. For instance, although the α-subunit of the epithelial Na+channel yields some currents (25.Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), these are greatly enhanced by co-expressing the homologous β and γ subunits (26.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). This is primarily due to an increase in surface expression (27.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The ATP-regulated potassium channel KATP is composed of four Kir6.1 (or Kir6.2) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor subunits. Both types of subunits are necessary for current expression. Again, co-expression of both subunits is necessary for trafficking to the surface (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). A novel endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (RKR) was identified in the carboxyl termini of each subunit and is apparently masked by the complementary subunit. This leads to an endoplasmic reticulum quality control mechanism that ensures that only correctly assembled channels reach their final destination (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Likewise, KCNQ proteins, including KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, have another cluster of positively charged amino acids (KRK) at the beginning of the A domain. However, extensive mutagenesis of the Kir6.2 retention signal (14.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) suggests that this tripeptide will not serve as an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Furthermore, the requirement for the complementary subunit is not as strict as with KATP. In summary, our data show that the increase in current seen upon co-expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cannot be explained by an increase in single channel conductance or in the open probability of heteromeric channels. Rather, it is due to a more efficient surface expression of heteromers. These heteromers may have different stoichiometries as suggested by our single channel analysis. Differing stoichiometries may increase further the molecular diversity of M-type currents and may have implications for those forms of epilepsy that are due to mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. We thank B. Schwappach for communicating the novel surface labeling procedure prior to publication, L. Bertorello for excellent technical assistance, and John E. Cuffe and Heather Ostendorff for critical reading of the manuscript."

Coughlan M.P. Molybdenum and Molybdenum-Containing Enzymes. Pergamon Press, Oxford1980: 243-272Google Scholar). SORs from these sources are located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria (2.Ono H. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They form a molybdoenzyme family with assimilatory nitrate reductases and are homodimers (molecular mass, 100–112 kDa) containing one heme b and one molybdopterin (MPT)-type pterin molybdenum cofactor/subunit (1.Rajagopalan K.V. Coughlan M.P. Molybdenum and Molybdenum-Containing Enzymes. Pergamon Press, Oxford1980: 243-272Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of the chicken liver enzyme revealed the presence of three functional domains: a heme b-coordinating domain, an MPT binding domain and a so-called “dimerization domain,” which has been assigned a major role in the formation of the homodimeric structure of these enzymes. SORs have also been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), resonance Raman, and electron spin echo-envelope modulation spectroscopies (3.Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 143-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4.Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C.

Soc. 1998; 120: 11263-11278Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and exhibit spectroscopic properties distinct from those of other families of molybdenum-containing enzymes. One particularly distinguishing feature in the spectroscopy of the eukaryotic SORs studied to date is the appearance of I = 1/2 superhyperfine splitting of the Mo(V) EPR signal at low pH. In addition to the eukaryotic sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductases, enzymes catalyzing the same reaction have been found in photo- and chemotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (6.Suzuki I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 447-454Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7.Brune D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 189-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8.Brune D.C. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht1995: 847-870Google Scholar). During oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds such as thiosulfate or sulfide by obligately or facultatively chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidizers (most of them formerly grouped asThiobacilli), sulfite is formed as a free or bound intermediate of the complex oxidation processes (9.Takakuwa S. Oae S. Okuyama T. Organic Sulfur Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-43Google Scholar, 10.Kelly D.P. Shergill J.K. Lu W.P. Wood A.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In these organisms sulfite can be oxidized to sulfate either directly by SOR (EC1.8.2.1), which can occur either as free enzymes or as part of thiosulfate-oxidizing multienzyme complexes (10.Kelly D.P. Shergill J.K. Lu W.P. Wood A.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11.Friedrich C.G. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 235-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or via the energy conserving adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase pathway. The presence of one or both of these enzymes has been established for variousThiobacilli, and multienzyme complex-independent sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductases have been enriched or partially purified from various chemotrophic sulfur oxidizers (6.Suzuki I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 447-454Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). None of these SORs, however, have been purified to homogeneity. Analysis of the available information on these enzymes shows that they form a very heterogeneous group; membrane-bound and soluble SORs can be found as well as enzymes that are inhibited by AMP or stimulated by its addition. SOR from Thiobacillus novellus, a member of the α-proteobacteria, has been described previously as a monomeric, heme, and molybdenum cofactor-containing enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (12.Toghrol F. Southerland W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6762-6766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that reacts with a cytochromec 550 from the same organism (13.Yamanaka T. Yoshioka T. Kimura K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 613-622Google Scholar). However, more extensive characterization of the type of pterin molybdenum cofactor contained in the enzyme, the exact nature of the heme group, and further properties of this or any other of the ThiobacillusSORs remained outstanding. On a molecular biological level, even less data are available: to date the only confirmed gene sequence for a bacterial SOR is the soxC gene (14.Wodara C. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5014-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from Paracoccus pantotrophus GB17 (15.Rainey F.A. Kelly D.P. Stackebrandt E. Burghardt J. Hiraishi A. Katayama Y. Wood A.P. Int. J.

The present work describes the first spectroscopic and enzymological characterization of a bacterial member of the sulfite oxidase family, the SOR from T. novellus. The relationship of T. novellus SOR with other SOR enzymes is discussed based on analysis of its properties and gene sequences. Chemicals were purchased from Merck, Sigma, and Fluka in per analisi or corresponding quality. Bacteria and plasmids used are listed in Table I. T. novellus was cultivated in modified DSMZ medium 69 containing 4.2 g/l Na2HPO4, 1.5 g/l KH2PO4, 0.3 g/l yeast extract, 0.3 g/l NH4Cl2, 0.1 g/l MgSO4, 10 g/l Na2SO3·5 H2O, 5 ml/l trace element solution, final pH 8.5. The trace element solution was prepared as specified for DSMZ medium 69. MgSO4 and thiosulfate were autoclaved separately. For solid medium, 1.5% agar were added. 200-ml cultures were aerated by vigorous shaking and incubated for 3–4 days at 30 °C; 10-liter cultures were grown in carboys with forced aeration over 6–7 days. Sterile 1 mNa2CO3 was used to maintain a pH of about 8.5. After 2–3 days, 500 ml of a thiosulfate feeding solution (200 g/l) were added to 10-liter cultures every second day. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −20 °C.Escherichia coli strains were grown in liquid or solidified Luria-Bertani, 2 × YT medium or, as required, NZY medium (17.Sambrook J.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (Sorvall RC-5B, 18 000 × g, 30 min), and the resultant crude extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Beckman L5–50; 2 h, 145,000 × g). This was followed by an ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% saturation), centrifugation, and heat treatment of the supernatant (50 °C, 30 min in the presence of 20 mm sodium sulfite). Following quick chilling of the extract and the removal of precipitate by centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to 70% saturation (cf. Ref. 12.Toghrol F. Southerland W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6762-6766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the resultant precipitate was then dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against 2 × 5 liters of the same buffer for ∼16 h. The dialyzed extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.6 × 15 cm), equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted using a linear sodium chloride gradient (400 ml, 0–500 mm NaCl). The sulfite-oxidizing activity eluted between 120 and 180 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against 2 × 5 liters of 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and subsequently applied to a hydroxyapatite column (HTP Biogel, Bio-Rad, 2.6 × 20 cm) buffered in 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. A 400-ml linear gradient of 1–50 mm phosphate was applied, and SOR activity eluted between 5 and 20 mm potassium phosphate. Enzyme-containing fractions were selected for pooling so that a maximum separation from a contaminating cytochromec 551 was achieved. Fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10, Amicon). The retentate was gel-filtered on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl, and fractions exhibiting SOR activity were desalted and subjected to strong anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8; gradient, 0–250 mm NaCl in 50 ml). Active fractions, which eluted at NaCl concentrations between 130–200 mm, were checked for purity using SDS-PAGE. SOR activity was determined spectrophotometrically using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 11 spectrophotometer. The standard reaction mixture contained 0.05 mm cytochrome c from horse heart (Sigma) and a known amount of SOR in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was carried out at 23 ± 1 °C and was started by the addition of sulfite (final concentration, 2.5 mm; stock solution, 200 mm in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mm EDTA). The rate of reaction was quantified by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 550 nm; 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of sulfite/min. Extinction coefficients for cytochrome c were as given by the manufacturer (cytochrome c from horse heart) or as determined by the method of Berry and Trumpower (18.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) (T. novellus cytochrome c 550). All activity determinations were taken as the mean of three measurements and were corrected for non-enzymatic sulfite oxidation. Measurements in which cytochrome c was supplied in non-saturating concentrations (determination of reaction mechanism) were carried out in the presence of 20 mm EDTA, i.e. under partly inhibiting conditions as described in Ref. 19.Kessler D.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar to overcome detection limits of measurements with a light path of 1 cm. The presence of EDTA in the reaction mix raises the affinity of the enzyme for cytochromec by ∼1 order of magnitude, while there is no obvious effect on the affinity for sulfite. Assays with non-saturating substrate concentrations and partial inhibition of the enzyme hence contained 20–100 μm cytochrome c and 2–16 μm sulfite; assays with only one substrate varied, and the second substrate at saturating concentrations contained 1–12 μm cytochrome c and 4 -100 μmsulfite. Catalytic constants were determined both from Hanes-Plots and by direct nonlinear fitting (least squares method) using the Scientist software (Micromath), both methods yielding similar results. Data for mixed type inhibition were fitted to the following equation (20.Tipton K.F. Engels P.C. Enzymology Labfax. Bios Scientific Publishing, Oxford1996: 115-174Google Scholar).ν=Vmax1+IKiu+1+KmS1+IKicEquation 1 The constants K ic andK iu refer to the competitive and the non-competitive component, respectively, of the inhibition pattern observed. Characterization of the mechanisms of reaction and inhibition was performed according to Cleland (21.Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Statistical errors are given as the standard deviation of the mean. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was carried out using essentially the same method but without the inclusion of SDS and denaturing agents. Gels were stained for protein using either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver (24.Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 26-32Google Scholar). The method of Cohen and Fridovich (25.Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed for SOR activity staining; heme-dependent peroxidase activity was identified on denaturing gels using 3′-3′-diaminobenzidine (26.McDonnel A. Staehelin L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and on native gels by enhanced chemiluminescence (27.Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Threec-type cytochromes were enriched or purified from T. novellus as a byproduct of the SOR purification procedure. They were separated from the SOR preparation either after DEAE anion exchange or after hydroxyapatite chromatography (cytochromec 551). Whereas cytochromec 550 was purified by subsequent cation exchange chromatography (28.Yamanaka T. Takenami S. Akiyama N. Okunuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 70: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cytochrome c 552 andc 551 were further enriched by strong anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amino acid sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequenator after Western blotting on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) or tryptic digest and HPLC separation of samples. Heme type and content were determined spectrophotometrically in alkaline pyridine solutions according to the method of Berry and Trumpower (18.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Molybdenum content was quantified colorimetrically as described previously (29.Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30.Allen S.H. Hamilton M.B. Anal. Chem. 1952; 7: 189-193Google Scholar).

The molybdenum cofactor was characterized by analytical reverse-phase (2 xHypersil C18, 126 × 4.6 mm; particle size, 5 μm) HPLC chromatography of oxidation products of the cofactor following liberation from SOR upon denaturation of the enzyme (33.Schwarz G.

Xanthine oxidase (Sigma) and Me2SO reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus (36.McEwan A.G. Ferguson S.J. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were used as reference sources of MPT and molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide forms of molybdenum cofactor. UV-visible absorption spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using either a Shimadzu UV-3000 double beam spectrophotometer or a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 11 spectrophotometer. EPR spectroscopy was carried out at the Center for Magnetic Resonance at the University of Queensland, using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a TE102 rectangular resonant cavity and a cold nitrogen flow cryostat. Temperature control was effected using a Eurotherm B-VT2000 variable temperature controller. A microwave power of 10 milliwatts, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 0.25 millitesla were employed; the temperature was kept constant at 130 K. Other signal acquisition parameters were selected so that the spectral resolution was limited by the modulation amplitude. Microwave frequencies between 9.460 and 9.465 GHz were monitored using an EIP 548B microwave counter, and field positions were recorded using a Bruker ER 035M NMR Gaussmeter. Samples for EPR contained 0.4 mg/200 μl of purified enzyme in either 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.8, or Hepes, pH 7.0. To generate the Mo(V) species of SOR, 20 mm sulfite were added. Computer simulations of Mo(V) EPR spectra were carried out as described in earlier work (37.Butler C.S. Charnock J.M. Bennett B. Sears H.J. Reilly A.J. Ferguson S.J. Garner C.D. Lowe D.J. Thomson A.J. Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9000-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SOR antiserum was prepared in rabbit by injection of 2 × 750 μg of purified SOR. Western blotting and immunodetection were carried out using standard procedures (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning - a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). SOR antiserum was diluted 1:2000. Standard molecular biological techniques were used throughout (17.Sambrook J.

Genomic DNA from T. novellus was isolated as described by Nano and Kaplan (39.Nano F.E. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 158: 1094-1103Crossref Google Scholar). A representative genomic library of partially Sau3AI-digested T. novellus DNA was constructed from fragments >6 kilobases in the lambda ZAP express vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was carried out by Sequiserve (Vaterstetten, Germany) using an automated sequencer and the chain-termination method (40.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from the amino acid sequence of N-terminal and tryptic fragments of SorA (TNSOR2, 5′-CG(C/G) CC(C/G) CT(C/G) GT(C/G) ATG TA-3′; TNSOR4, 5′- GC (C/G)AG (C/G)GG (T/C)TC (G/C)AC GAA-3′) were used to amplify a 300-bp polymerase chain reaction product (55 °C annealing, 30 cycles, 1 mm MgCl2), which was subsequently cloned into pGemT (Promega). SOR probes for use in hybridization experiments were labeled nonradioactively by polymerase chain reaction using digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Pharmaceuticals). Homologous hybridizations were carried out at 68 °C for 16–20 h. The gene sequence of the sor region fromT. novellus has been deposited with GenBankTMunder accession number AF154565. Analysis of the sor region DNA sequence was undertaken using the WebAngis Software package (ANGIS), and sequence similarity searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm (41.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase from T. novellus was purified using a modified and expanded protocol based on the procedure in Ref. 12.Toghrol F. Southerland W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6762-6766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; the results of the purification are summarized in Table II. The enzyme eluted from the final strong anion exchange column in two overlapping peaks containing the reduced and the oxidized form of SOR, as determined by the UV-visible absorption of the cytochrome component. Native PAGE of the purified SOR revealed the presence of only one protein band upon Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 A). This band also stained for SOR activity and cross-reacted with theT. novellus SOR antiserum (Fig. 1 A). SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme yielded two Coomassie-staining bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼40 and ∼8 kDa, respectively, identifying the enzyme as a heterodimer (Fig. 1 B). The overall molecular mass of the enzyme as determined after SDS-PAGE is in good agreement with a value of ∼46 kDa obtained after gel filtration on Superdex 75.Table IIPurification of sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase from 20 g of frozen T. novellus cell materialVolumeTotal activityActivityProtein contentSpecific activityPurification factorYieldmlunitsunits/mlmg/mlunits/mg-fold%Crude extract57.511903207.023.88.70100UC-supernatant53.010319194.716.811.61.387.0Supernatant 40% (NH4)2SO458.09805169.011.514.71.782.4Supernatant 50 °C heat step58.011187192.911.816.41.994.0Sediment 70% (NH4)2SO423.011318492.125.419.42.295.0DEAE-Sephacel-pool62.09137147.42.462.37.276.8HTP-pool, after ultrafiltration2.85219186.411.6160.418.443.9Superdex 75-pool13.64390322.81.3257.22936.9Mono Q-pool4.01311514.91.7327.937.711Cells were grown lithoautotrophically on thiosulfate.

Optical spectra of the purified enzyme clearly reveal the presence of a sulfite-reduciblec-type heme with the following absorption maxima in the reduced state (values in parentheses refer to maxima in the oxidized spectrum): α, 552 nm (−); β, 523 nm (−); γ, 416 nm (411 nm); δ, 317 nm (363 nm) (Fig. 2). Heme staining after native and denaturing PAGE identified the heme as an integral part of the enzyme (Fig. 1 A) with the heme group being covalently bound by the 8-kDa component of the holoenzyme (Fig.1 B). Absorption spectra of purified SOR in alkaline pyridine confirmed that the heme group contained in T. novellus SOR is a c-type heme (18.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). SOR contains 0.8 ± 0.15 heme groups/holoenzyme as estimated from the absorption spectrum. Redox titration at pH 8.0, the pH at which SOR exhibited maximum activity, suggested a midpoint potential for this heme group ofE m8.0 = +280 mV. Colorimetric determination of Mo content gave an average value of 1.2 ± 0.25 Mo atoms/holoenzyme. The analytical data then suggest a content of one molybdenum atom and one heme group/αβ-holoenzyme. The type of pterin molybdenum cofactor contained in SOR was elucidated by liberation and subsequent oxidation of the cofactor followed by reverse phase HPLC chromatographic analysis. As there are several known forms of the pterin molybdenum cofactor, xanthine oxidase (Sigma) and dimethyl-sulfoxide reductase from R. capsulatus (36.McEwan A.G. Ferguson S.J. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were used as reference sources of MPT and molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide-type cofactors, respectively. The dinucleotide form of the pterin molybdenum cofactor is often found in bacterial enzymes (3.Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 143-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The elution profile of the cofactor oxidation products from the reverse phase HPLC column clearly shows that SOR from T. novelluscontains an MPT-type cofactor (Fig. 3), as the oxidized cofactor extracted from this enzyme shows the same elution profile as that from xanthine oxidase but is distinct from that exhibited by Me2SO reductase. Although samples of the resting enzyme in Hepes, pH 7.0 (Fig. 4 A), and in Tricine, pH 8.8 (Fig. 4 A), did not give rise to a Mo(V) EPR signal, upon the addition of 20 mm sulfite to either sample a well defined Mo(V) EPR signal was observed (Fig.4 A). The g-values, anisotropy, narrow line widths, and particularly the weak features at 350 and 355 millitesla justify the assignment of the signal to Mo(V); the spacings and intensities of these latter features are consistent with their being due to the ∼25% natural abundance of I = 5/295/97 Mo nuclei. The spectra were simulated (Fig.4 A) assuming g 1, 1.9914;g2 , 1.9661; and g3 , 1.9541. A high resolution spectrum of the g1 -signal recorded at a lower modulation amplitude (0.1 millitesla; Fig. 4 B) clearly showed that the “wings” present on this feature are asymmetrically positioned about the main I = 0g1 -feature and are thus due to underlying95/97 Mo hyperfine lines rather than to either unresolved superhyperfine splitting or to Δm I = 11H “s"

Biol. 1999; 3: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and nickel-containing enzymes can account for several percent of the cellular protein in bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Free nickel ions can be toxic to cells by binding nonspecifically to biomolecules or by displacing other metals from their native binding sites. Clearly, molecular mechanisms must be present to preserve the balance between the level of nickel required for viability and the potentially lethal effects of excessive intracellular nickel. Nickel, present at nm to μm concentrations in the extracellular environment, is imported into E. coli via the ATP-dependent nickel permease encoded by the nikABCDE operon (4.Navarro C. Wu L.-F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). Transcription of this operon is highly regulated. It is activated by fumarate nitrate regulatory protein (Fnr), an oxygen-sensitive transcriptional factor, and repressed by NikR when intracellular nickel concentrations are high (5.Wu L.-F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6.de Pina K. Desjardin V. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 670-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the nik operon is maximally expressed under anaerobic growth conditions when intracellular nickel is scarce. Relatively little is currently known about NikR repressor or how it regulates gene expression. For example, the operator site to which NikR binds to control nik transcription has not been rigorously identified, and it is not clear whether NikR senses nickel directly or through mechanisms mediated by other proteins. We have recently shown that E. coli NikR is a member of the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This family includes the Arc and Mnt repressors of bacteriophage P22 (8.Burgering M.J.M. Boelens R. Gilbert D.E. Breg J.N.

Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The dimeric ribbon-helix-helix fold consists of an antiparallel β-sheet, formed by single β-strands from each subunit, and four α-helices. Crystallographic studies show that the β-sheets of MetJ, Arc, and CopG dimers bind in the major groove of operator DNA and make specific contacts with sequences of 4–6 base pairs (9.Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Phillips S.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7404-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The operators of these repressors contain two or more dimer recognition sequences, usually related by dyad symmetry, and stable DNA binding requires stabilizing interactions between dimers bound to adjacent operator subsites (9.Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Solà M. Acebo P. Pàrraga A. Guasch A. Eritja R. González A.

Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). All ribbon-helix-helix family members share homologous DNA-binding domains, but some also contain additional specialized domains or subdomains. For example, MetJ repressors contain a subdomain formed by the C-terminal 40 or so residues that helps form a binding site for the corepressor, S-adenosylmethionine (15.Phillips S.E.V. Manfield I. Parsons I. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mnt has a coiled coil domain of roughly 30 residues at its C terminus that mediates tetramerization (16.Nooren I.M. Kaptein R. Sauer R.T. Boelens R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17.Waldburger C.D. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13109-13116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Orthologs of NikR are present in some bacteria and many archaeal genomes (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 1Peter T. Chivers and Robert T. Sauer, unpublished observations. Each of these NikR proteins consists of an N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix domain of approximately 50 residues and a NikR-specific C-terminal domain of about 80 residues. The most striking feature of the C-terminal domain is a His-X 13-His-X 10-His-X-His-X 5-Cys sequence motif. Proteins rich in histidine and cysteine often bind divalent transition metals (18.Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar); in NikR, these residues may bind nickel ions (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of NikR as a transcriptional repressor, we have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal domain dimer binds weakly to two regions within the nikABCDE promoter (P nik) (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we show that full-length NikR is a Ni2+-binding protein and characterize its binding to operator DNA. We demonstrate that high affinity binding of NikR to the operator in vitro is Ni2+-dependent, identify the operator bases most important for NikR binding, and then show that NikR binding to this operator site is required for efficient Ni2+-dependent repression of thenikABCDE operon in vivo. These experiments support a model for NikR function in which the N-terminal domain binds DNA subsites and the C-terminal domain binds Ni2+ and regulates operator binding via specific interactions between adjacently bound NikR dimers. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and were purified by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (19.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). ThenikR gene was cloned by PCR2 from genomic DNA ofE. coli strain MC1061 largely as described previously (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but without a C-terminal His6 tag. The normal C terminus of NikR was included by using PC108 (5′-ATA ATA CTC GAG TCA ATC TTC CTT CGG CAA GCA-3′) as the 3′ PCR primer. The final plasmid construct (pNIK103) is a derivative of pET22-b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and encodes the wild-type NikR repressor under transcriptional control of a T7 promoter and an lac operator site. The sequence of the cloned nikR gene was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To construct a P nik -lacZ reporter fusion, a 500-base pair DNA fragment containing the nikABCDEpromoter was first subcloned from E. coli strain MC1061 by PCR using primers PC118 (5′-CTA TGG CCG GCC GGG CAA ACC TGC ATT TGC GCC GG-3′) and PC120 (5′-AAT CAT TGT CGA CAG CAT GGT AAC CCC AAT GGA TTA AAA-3′). The non-coding bases corresponding to the ATG start codon of nikA are shown in bold. The purified fragment was digested with EagI and SalI and ligated into pACYC184 (20.Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes. The lacZ gene was amplified from E. coli strain CA8224.1 (E. coli Genetic Stock Center) by PCR with primers PC14a (5′-TTT GGA AGG TCG ACA ATT CAG GGT GGT GAA TGT G-3′) and PC23a (5′-TTT TGC GGG ATC CGG GCA GAC ATG GCC TGC CC-3′). The resulting fragment was digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the pACYC184 backbone already containing the nik promoter. The resulting plasmid, designated pPC163, was sequenced to confirm that the wild-typenik promoter sequence was correct. Reporter constructs containing operator mutations were generated as follows. A purified oligonucleotide containing the desired operator mutations was used as a primer together with PC120 in a PCR reaction with plasmid pPC163 as template. The resulting PCR product of approximately 100 base pairs was purified by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel and then used as a megaprimer in a subsequent PCR reaction that contained primer PC118 and plasmid pPC163. Each resulting 500-base pair fragment was purified by non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, digested withEagI and SalI, and cloned into pPC163 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The promoter and operator regions of the mutant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the expected structure. E. colistrain BB101 (F′ lacI q lac′ pro′/araΔ(lac-pro) nal1 argE am rif r thi-1 slyD λDE3) transformed with pNIK103 was grown in LB broth to anA 600 of 0.7 to 0.8, and NikR expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction, resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl per liter of cell culture, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was retained. Nickel sulfate (10 mm stock solution in H2O) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50 μm followed by the addition of 1 mimidazole (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 10 mm. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni2+·NTA column (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) that had been preequilibrated with 10 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. Two ml of Ni2+·NTA resin were used per liter of initial cell culture. After loading, the column was washed with 50 volumes of the equilibration buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 5 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm Tris·HCl, and 250 mm imidazole (final pH 7.6). EDTA (0.5m stock (pH 8.0)) was added to the eluate to a final concentration of 10 mm to prevent aggregation, and the solution was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (4 liters per 5 ml of eluate) and stored at 4 °C. NikR samples were desalted on a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm glycine, and 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentration of full-length NikR was determined at pH 7 in 6m guanidine hydrochloride using an extinction coefficient of ε276 = 4495 m−1cm−1. The protein concentration of the N-terminal domain was determined at pH 12.0 using an extinction coefficient of ε295 = 2600m−1 cm−1. Purified proteins were more than 95% pure as determined by staining with Coomassie Blue following electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide Tricine/SDS gels (21.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were collected on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. CD spectra were collected as described (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nickel binding experiments were carried out by monitoring the UV-visible absorbance change at several wavelengths of a 17.5 μm sample of apoNikR (initial volume, 500 μl) after each addition of a 10-μl aliquot of a 300 μm stock solution of NiSO4. The absorbance in Fig. 2 c was corrected for dilution. DNase I footprinting was performed as described previously (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but in a binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm NiSO4. A DNA fragment extending from position −131 to +57 relative to the starting point ofP nik transcription was end-labeled with32P and incubated with NikR at 20 °C for 30 min. DNase I (Worthington) was then added to a final concentration of 200 ng/ml. EDTA was not included in any of the buffers for DNA binding assays. DNA methylation protection experiments were performed as described previously (22.Vershon A.K. Liao S-M. McClure W.R. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using 7% acrylamide gels and electrophoresis buffer containing 75 mmTris, 300 mm boric acid (final pH 7.5). The binding buffer was 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol. Ni2+ was added to the binding buffer, the electrophoresis buffers, and the gel solution before polymerization to final concentrations as described under “Results.” An end-labeled DNA fragment extending from position −43 to +57 relative to the starting point of P nik transcription was incubated with NikR at 20 °C for 15 min in a volume of 50 μl, and 20 μl was then loaded directly onto a running gel (300 V). No dyes were added to the binding reactions. After loading all samples, the electrophoresis voltage was reduced to 150 V. β-galactosidase assays were performed inE. coli strain MC1061 containing an F′ kan r lacI q episome (obtained from A. Grossman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), plasmid pNIK103 (which expresses NikR under control of a T7 promoter andlac operator), and wild-type or mutant variants of theP nik -lacZ reporter plasmid. This strain lacks a gene for T7 RNA polymerase, but sufficient NikR was still synthesized from the chromosomal and/or pNIK103 copies of thenikR gene to repressP nik -lacZ expression in the presence of nickel. The presence of the episomal lacI qallele, which encodes Lac repressor, was important for determining the dynamic range of the reporter assay. Without thelacI q gene,P nik -lacZ expression was low even in the absence of added nickel, suggesting that too much NikR was being synthesized. Cells freshly transformed with theP nik -lacZ reporter plasmids were grown anaerobically without shaking at 37 °C in screw-capped 1.5-ml microfuge tubes containing LB broth plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. NiSO4 was added to a final concentration of 250 μm when required. After overnight growth for 12–14 h (A 600 of 0.5 to 0.7), the culture tubes were opened, and cells were lysed immediately with chloroform and SDS. β-galactosidase assays were then performed as described (23.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). In a previous study (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we showed that the purified ribbon-helix-helix domain of NikR protected two regions of DNA within the nik promoter. These protected regions overlapped an extensive inverted repeat sequence in which 28 of 38 base pairs were related by an axis of 2-fold symmetry located near the −10 position ofP nik (Fig. 1). Such dyad-symmetric DNA sequences are typical of many operator sites for bacterial repressors. As described below, we first studied nickel binding by the intact NikR repressor, then assayed NikR binding to a DNA fragment containing the entire nik promoter region by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, and finally used footprinting and mutational studies to define the operator site and its functional role in greater detail. Intact NikR repressor was cloned, overexpressed, and purified by chromatography on a Ni2+·NTA column. In the absence of excess Ni2+ during column loading, NikR stripped nickel from the column and failed to bind efficiently (<10% bound). Because the Ni2+·NTA equilibrium dissociation constant is roughly 3 pm (24.Schwarzenbach G. Gut R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1956; 39: 1589-1599Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this result suggested that NikR contains at least one high affinity binding site for nickel ions. Addition of 50 μm Ni2+ to the loading buffer, however, resulted in > 95% binding of NikR to the resin and allowed efficient single step purification. Following desalting into nickel-free buffer, purified NikR had a UV-visible absorbance spectrum with maxima at 245, 262, 302, 362, 460, and 570 nm, suggestive of ligand-to-metal transitions at the shorter wavelengths (>302 nm) and nickel d → d transitions at the longer wavelengths (Fig.2 a). Circular dichroism spectroscopy also showed peaks at wavelengths corresponding to peaks in the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 2 b). In both the UV-visible and CD spectra, the peaks attributed to nickel binding required the presence of both the metal ion and NikR and were absent following incubation with 50 mm EDTA for 12 h at room temperature. Both the spectral properties and activity of apoNikR were restored upon addition of excess nickel, showing that nickel binding is reversible. The stoichiometry of high affinity nickel binding to NikR was determined by titration of a sample of 17.5 μm apoNikR with Ni2+ (Fig. 2 c) using purified protein that had been incubated with EDTA and desalted into buffer without chelating agents. The increase in absorbance at 302 nm was measured after the addition of each Ni2+ aliquot. The absorbance increase was initially linear, indicating a binding site of submicromolar affinity, and then saturated at a Ni2+ concentration of roughly 1 nickel ion for each NikR subunit, or 2 ions bound for each NikR dimer (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Assuming that nickel ions bind to the His-X 13-His-X 10-His-X-His-X 5-Cys sequences, this suggests the presence of a single high affinity Ni2+-binding site in each C-terminal domain of the dimer. After saturation of the high affinity site, no significant absorbance changes were observed up to a concentration of 50 μmNi2+. Addition of higher concentrations of Ni2+resulted in protein aggregation at the NikR concentrations used in this experiment. The small positive slope of the plateau region in Fig.2 c may result from a small amount of protein aggregation. In electrophoretic mobility shift experiments performed in the presence of 50 μmNi2+, purified NikR half-maximally bound to a 100-base pair DNA fragment containing the nik promoter-operator region at a protein concentration of roughly 15 pm (Fig.3, a and c). Nickel had to be present in the electrophoresis buffer and in the gel at a concentration of at least 20 μm for a mobility shift to be observed in these experiments. No mobility shift complexes were observed in the presence of 5 μm Ni2+ (data not shown) or in the absence of Ni2+ (Fig. 3 b). Moreover, NikR that had been quickly desalted and hence had nickel bound just to the high affinity site also did not produce a mobility shift complex. These observations suggest that the formation of a stable NikR-operator complex is dependent upon a rapidly exchanging and thus weakly bound nickel ion and show that nickel bound only to the high affinity site is not sufficient to produce a stable protein-DNA complex. In experiments using the purified N-terminal domain of NikR, no mobility shift complex was observed at protein concentrations as high as 10 μm, either in the presence or absence of nickel (data not shown), indicating that the C-terminal domain is required for the formation of a stable mobility shift complex. In DNase I footprinting experiments, the intact NikR protein protected approximately 40 contiguous base pairs centered near the −10 position of the P nik promoter (Fig.4 a). The outer flanks of the NikR footprint were similar to those of the isolated N-terminal domain footprint (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, unlike the N-terminal domain alone, full-length NikR also protected the central region of the operator site from DNase I digestion. To identify potential sites of close contact between NikR and the operator site, we performed dimethylsulfate protection experiments. The N7 positions of four guanines, two on each DNA strand, were protected from methylation by bound NikR (Fig. 4 b). Each protected G was located in a dyad-symmetric 5′-GTATG-3′ sequence located on opposite strands and on opposite sides of the −10 promoter hexamer. Moreover, these sequences were roughly centered within the two regions protected by the ribbon-helix-helix domain of NikR. No significant protection of guanines in other regions of the operator was observed. These results and the fact that other ribbon-helix-helix dimers recognize DNA subsites of 4–6 base pairs suggested that operator bases within or near these 5′-GTATG-3′ sequences were likely to comprise the principal base-specific determinants of NikR recognition. To define the operator determinants required for NikR binding in greater detail, base substitution mutations were constructed at each base in the 5′-GTATG-3′ sequences and at four flanking base pairs. Individual mutants contained two symmetric changes, one in each half of the operator, and were named according to the distance of the mutations from the dyad-symmetry axis. Binding of the mutant operators to NikR in the gel mobility shift assay revealed severe reductions in affinity (>1000-fold) for five of the mutants (−14/14, −13/13, −11/11, −10/10, and −9/9) and a modest reduction (5-fold) for another mutant (−12/12) (Fig. 5). At the three remaining positions (−15/15, −8/8, and −7/7), the mutations caused no change in apparent affinity. These experiments indicate that the 5′-GTATGA-3′ subsite sequences play critical roles in determining the affinity of NikR binding. We also constructed an operator mutant (C11−5/6) containing transversion mutations at each of the 11 base pairs from operator positions −6 to +5 (Fig. 5). This mutant bound NikR with wild-type affinity. This result makes it highly unlikely that NikR makes base-specific interactions with this central region of the operator. A mutant operator in which the entire right subsite was substituted (rhs7/15) showed no binding to NikR in the mobility shift assay. Moreover, no intermediate species indicative of a dimer-DNA complex was observed for this or any other operator variant, suggesting that complexes between single NikR dimers and the operator are too unstable to be detected in this assay. As a result, any NikR-operator complex that is observed in mobility shift experiments is likely to be stabilized by dimer-dimer interactions of some type. Because both Ni2+ ions and the C-terminal domain are also required for the observation of stable complexes, it seems likely that Ni2+-dependent interactions between the C-terminal domains of NikR mediate dimer-dimer contacts. Does binding of NikR to the operator site identified here regulatenikABCDE expression in vivo? To answer this question, we constructed P nik -lacZreporter fusions with wild-type operators and six of the mutant operators. In the context of the wild-type promoter and operator, very little β-galactosidase expression (<20 units) was detected during aerobic growth (data not shown), and expression under anaerobic growth was repressed approximately 5-fold in the presence of Ni2+(Fig. 6). Four of the operator mutants that severely reduced NikR binding in vitro were found to reduce Ni2+-dependent repression of β-galactosidase expression in vivo (Fig. 6). By contrast, two operator mutants that showed NikR binding levels within 5-fold of wild type still mediated Ni2+-dependent repression in the cell (Fig. 6). These results strongly support the premise that the operator site mediates NikR-dependent repression of the nikABCDE operon. Five of six operator mutants also resulted in increased levels of β-galactosidase expression in the absence of added Ni2+, suggesting that these mutations may increase intrinsic promoter strength and/or abolish repression by NikR that occurs in the absence of Ni2+ or in the presence of very low levels of Ni2+. The experiments reported here establish that NikR is a direct sensor of nickel ions and acts as a negative regulator ofnikABCDE expression by binding to an operator consisting of two 5′-GTATGA-3′ half-sites related by dyad symmetry and separated by 16 base pairs. A low affinity interaction between NikR and 20–50 μm Ni2+ results in tight binding of NikR to the operator. Under these conditions, NikR half-maximally bound to thenik operator at a concentration of roughly 15 pm. Binding was dramatically reduced if nickel was not present throughout the binding assay or if the NikR C-terminal domain was removed. For example, although the isolated N-terminal domain of NikR protects the operator in footprinting experiments (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), this binding is observed at concentrations 10,000-fold higher than those required for binding of intact NikR. In principle, the C-terminal domain might help mediate direct Ni2+-dependent contacts with operator DNA and/or mediate cooperative interactions between NikR molecules bound to each operator subsite. We note, however, that our results suggest that there are no sequence-specific interactions between NikR and the central or spacer region of the operator. Moreover, removal of one of the operator subsites also reduced NikR binding dramatically, suggesting that some specific interactions between adjacently bound NikR dimers are necessary for high affinity operator binding. Our results indicate that NikR contains two distinct types of nickel-binding sites. Purified NikR binds two nickel ions per dimer with high affinity in a manner that gives rise to distinctive changes in both the UV absorbance and circular dichroism spectra, although the function of nickel binding to this site is unknown. The ability of NikR to strip nickel from Ni2+·NTA resin suggests that theK d of this site may be in the pm range. Nickel binding just to the high affinity site, however, is not sufficient for strong NikR-operator binding, which requires 20–50 μm Ni2+. As a result, NikR must also contain a low affinity nickel-binding site that regulates DNA binding affinity. However, no evidence for low affinity nickel binding was obtained from UV-visible spectroscopic measurements, suggesting either that Ni2+ bound at this site has a small extinction coefficient or that occupancy also requires the presence of operator DNA. The NikR half-sites are similar in size to subsites recognized by other ribbon-helix-helix proteins, but the spacing between these sites is much greater than for other family members. For example, the center-to-center spacing of half-sites for NikR is 22 base pairs, roughly two full turns of the DNA helix, whereas the next largest subsite spacing is 11 base pairs for the Arc, Mnt, and CopG repressors. For Arc, Mnt, MetJ, and CopG, the operator subsites are close enough to allow cooperative contacts between adjacently bound ribbon-helix-helix domains (9.Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Phillips S.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 671-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Solà M. Acebo P. Pàrraga A. Guasch A. Eritja R. González A. Espinosa M. del Solar G. Coll M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7404-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For NikR, the subsite spacing suggests that adjacently bound DNA-binding domains would be roughly 34 Å apart, making cooperative contacts between these N-terminal domains highly improbable in the absence of extraordinary DNA bending. It seems likely, therefore, that contacts involving the C-terminal domain of NikR play some role in cooperative binding. Homology searches identified putative operator sequences for NikR inSalmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae,Helicobacter pylori, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum(Fig. 7). The Klebsiella site is in the promoter for NikA, whereas the Salmonella site is in the promoter for an Fnr-regulated operon encoding an ABC-type nickel/peptide transporter related to NikA (25.Wei Y. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6092-6097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheHelicobacter site is in the NikR promoter, suggesting that NikR may negatively regulate its own synthesis. Finally, theBradyrhizobium site is in the 5′ region of hupN, a gene encoding a transmembrane protein thought to be involved in high affinity nickel uptake in this organism (26.Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5099-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the E. colioperator, residues important for NikR binding account for fewer than half of the base pairs that are related by dyad symmetry. Is the extended inverted repeat sequence important for the function of NikR or an additional transcription factor? The answer to this question is unknown. It is interesting, however, that the other NikR operators also contain more extended inverted repeats, but ones that are largely unrelated to the E. coli repeat except in the hexameric NikR recognition subsites (Fig. 7). Obvious operator site sequences were not found in several bacteria and archaea containing NikR genes. As discussed below, the dimer recognition subsites may vary in these organisms. Alternatively, the spacing of subsites could be variable. Ribbon-helix-helix proteins use surface residues in the β-sheet to make specific operator DNA contacts (7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27.Brown B.M. Milla M.E. Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19644-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, NikR and CopG have the same Arg-X-Thr-X-Thr sequence in the β-sheet but recognize completely different subsite sequences (5′-GTATGA-3′ versus 5′-TTGCA-3′). Clearly, factors in addition to the surface β-sheet residues must determine how these ribbon-helix-helix proteins interact with operator half-sites. This suggests that it may not always be straightforward to predict the dimer recognition subsites for other NikR family members. The experiments presented here and elsewhere (6.de Pina K. Desjardin V. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 670-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) support the general model shown in Fig. 1. By binding to an operator withinP nik, NikR represses nikABCDEtranscription in the presence of Ni2+. When nickel concentrations in the cell fall below some critical level, the affinity of NikR for the operator decreases, and the operon is derepressed, allowing synthesis of NikABCDE, which can catalyze increased levels of nickel uptake. Based on the experiments presented here, it seems likely that the critical nickel threshold is in the 20 μm range. It remains to be determined what role, if any, is played by nickel binding to the high affinity site. Occupancy of this site may be required but not sufficient for strong operator binding and/or repression. Alternatively, high affinity nickel binding could play a role in other aspects of nickel homeostasis. The experiments presented here provide a foundation for future studies designed to test these possibilities.

These derivatives are required for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide precursors of RNA and DNA and also for metabolism of several amino acids. Since folate and its one-carbon derivatives are lipophobic bivalent anions, they do not traverse biological membranes by simple diffusion but have to be taken up into the cells by specific transport processes (1.Sirotnak F.M.

There are three isoforms of this receptor (α, β, and γ) among which only the α-isoform has been shown to participate in the cellular uptake of folates in normal cells. Although the FRα has a very high affinity for non-reduced folate (K d < 1 nm), it interacts also with reduced folates, although with much less affinity. The second transport process is mediated by the reduced-folate transporter (RFT-1) (1.Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2.Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. Sirotnak F.M. Ensiminger W.D. Burchall J.J. Montgomery J.A. Folate Antagonists as Therapeutic Agents. 1. Academic Press, New York1984: 173-214Google Scholar). This is a typical transporter protein with multiple membrane-spanning domains. It interacts with reduced folates much more efficiently than with non-reduced folate. FRα is expressed almost ubiquitously in mammalian cells. Since every cell requires folate for metabolism, FRα provides the mechanism for the cellular uptake of folate from the blood. The obligatory nature of this uptake mechanism for cell survival is evident from the findings that the targeted disruption of the FRα gene is lethal and that the knockout mice do not survive beyond the early embryonic stage (5.Piedrahita J.A. Oetama B. Bennett D.D. van Waes J. Kamen B.A. Richardson J. Lacey S.W. Anderson R.G.W. Finnell R.H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In contrast to FRα, the expression of RFT-1 is limited to those cells that are involved in vectorial transfer of folates from one side of the cell to the other (1.Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This includes the absorptive cells of the kidney and placenta and the hepatocytes in the liver. Since these cells are polarized and express FRα as well as RFT-1, it is believed that these proteins may be differentially polarized in these cells to mediate the vectorial transfer of folate. To date, however, there have been no studies reported in the literature relating to the differential polarized distribution of the FRα versus RFT-1 in any of the mammalian polarized cells. A tissue that has been largely ignored with respect to mechanisms of folate transport has been the retina, yet folate deficiencies have been implicated in the visual disorder nutritional amblyopia (6.Golnik K.C. Schaible E.R. J. Neurophthalmol. 1994; 14: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7.Knox D.L. Chen M.F. Guilarte T.R. Dang C.V. Burnette J. Retina. 1982; 2: 288-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Miller N.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This disease is characterized by reduced central vision, cecocentral scotoma, pallor of the optic disc, loss of papillomacular-bundle fibers, and optic atrophy (8.Miller N.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Folate deficiencies can also contribute to methanol-induced retinal toxicity. The metabolism of methanol results in the formation of formate, a compound toxic to the neural retina. The conversion of formate to carbon dioxide is a folate-dependent process (9.Jolin F.C. Swain E. Smith C. Tephly T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 35: 745-750Google Scholar, 10.Martinasevic M.K. Green M.D. Baron J. Tephly T.R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deficient folate levels would cause a decrease in formate metabolism and result in retinal toxicity. Methanol-induced retinal toxicity is characterized by photoreceptor cell dysfunction and damage as well as retinal edema (11.Seme M.T. Summerfelt P. Henry M.M. Neitz J. Eells J.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 361-370PubMed Google Scholar). Since the highly metabolically active photoreceptor cells are nourished by adjacent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, defects in the transport systems for folate in the RPE would be expected to cause retinal diseases in the presence of adequate folate nutrition. The RPE is a polarized epithelium characterized by two functionally and morphologically distinct regions of plasma membrane, the apical microvilli and the basolateral infoldings (12.Hewitt A.T. Adler R. Ogden T.E. Schachat A.P. Retina. 1. C. B. Mosby, St. Louis1997: 58-71Google Scholar, 16.Hughes B.A. Gallemore R.P. Miller S.S. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium: Function and Disease. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 103-134Google Scholar). The apical microvilli interdigitate with the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells, and the basolateral infoldings contact the choriocapillaris. In 1997, Huang et al. (13.Huang W. Prasad P.D. Kekuda R. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 1578-1587PubMed Google Scholar) reported the first functional analysis of folate transport in cultured human RPE and suggested that a system that transports reduced folates preferentially over the non-reduced folate was expressed on the apical surface of cultured cells. These investigators have also provided molecular evidence for the expression of RFT-1 in these cells. The activity of this transporter in the RPE was shown to be attenuated in the presence of nitric oxide (14.Smith S.B. Huang W. Chancy C. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subsequent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization experiments using intact mouse retina revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts encoding FRα in several cell types of the neural retina and also the RPE (15.Smith S.B. Kekuda R. Gu X. Chancy C. Conway S. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 840-848PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopic immunolocalization studies carried out as part of this analysis demonstrated that FRα was present on the basolateral RPE surface of intact mouse retinal tissue. Neither in situhybridization nor immunolocalization studies have been performed to determine the precise location of RFT-1 in retina or RPE. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the cell types in the retina that express RFT-1 and also to determine the localization of the transporter protein in RPE. The results of this investigation demonstrate that RPE is the only cell type in the retina that expresses FRα as well as RFT-1. All other retinal cells express only the receptor. This fits well with the known function of RPE in the vectorial transfer of folate from choroidal blood to neural retina (15.Smith S.B. Kekuda R. Gu X. Chancy C. Conway S. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 840-848PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these studies show for the first time the polarized distribution of FRα versus RFT-1 in RPE cells. FRα expression is restricted to the basolateral membrane, whereas the RFT-1 expression is restricted to the apical membrane. This constitutes the first report of the differential distribution of the two folate transport proteins in any mammalian polarized cell. The expression of RFT-1 in the RPE cell apical membrane is further supported by functional studies with purified apical membrane vesicles from bovine RPE. These studies show that the membrane vesicles do not possess FR activity but are able to transport folates in a pH-dependent manner, a unique characteristic of RFT-1.

The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Five- to six-week-old albino (ICR) mice were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN. Two-month-old New Zealand rabbits were obtained from Robinson's Bunny Farm (Clemmons, NC). Animals were maintained on a 12-h light:12-h dark lighting cycle and were fed the standard purina mouse chow diet and rabbit chow diet, respectively. Care and use of the animals adhered to the principles set forth in the DHEW Publication, NIH 80-23, “The Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals.” ARPE-19 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were passaged by dissociation in 0.05% (w/v) trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After trypsinization, cells were seeded on Nunc 8-well chamber slides coated with 5 μg/cm2 mouse laminin and maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum to promote differentiation of the cells. Cells were allowed to differentiate for at least 4 weeks prior to each experiment (17.Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 18.Dunn K.C. Marmorstein A.D. Bonilha V.L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Giordano F. Hjelmeland L.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2744-2749PubMed Google Scholar). BeWo cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For immunohistochemistry, subcultures of these cells were seeded on 8-well chamber slides and grown to confluency. After the cells were confluent, forskolin (100 μm) was added to the medium, and the growing cells were fed daily for 3 days prior to use in immunohistochemical analysis. In situ hybridization was performed on mouse eyes to localize the mRNA transcripts encoding RFT-1. To prepare the probes for these studies, total RNA from mouse placenta was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. The RNA was subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer 5′-CGTGTGCGTGTGGCTGTT-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TGTGGAGGCGGATCTAC-3′ corresponded to nucleotide positions 426–443 and 1036–1054, respectively, in the cloned mouse RFT-1 cDNA (19.Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using these primers, a 629-base pair sequence was amplified. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the orientation of the cDNA insert was determined by sequencing. The single-stranded antisense riboprobe specific for RFT-1 was prepared by linearizing the vector-cDNA construct with the restriction enzyme NcoI and then transcribing the cDNAin vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase. The single-strand sense (control) riboprobe was prepared using the restriction enzymeNotI for linearization and the T7 RNA polymerase for transcription. The synthesized riboprobes were labeled using a digoxigenin-labeling kit. Additional controls for the in situ hybridization included sense and antisense riboprobes specific for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). By using the upstream primer 5′-ACCGGATTTGGCCGTATT-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TCTGGGATGGAAATTGTGAG-3′, an 1100-base pair sequence was amplified and cloned into the vector, and synthesized riboprobes were digoxigenin-labeled as described above. Eyes from albino mice were enucleated, frozen immediately in Tissue-Tek OCT sectioned at 10-μm thickness, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following our published protocol (15.Smith S.B. Kekuda R. Gu X. Chancy C. Conway S. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 840-848PubMed Google Scholar), sections were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and treated with active 1% diethyl pyrocarbonate prepared in PBS to facilitate penetration of the labeled probes. Sections were permeabilized further with proteinase K (1 μg/ml) in PBS for 4 min. The proteinase K activity was stopped by rinsing the slides in glycine (2 mg/ml) in PBS. Sections were washed in PBS, equilibrated in 5× SSC, and were prehybridized for 2 h at 58 °C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 2% (w/v) blocking reagent (provided with the Digoxigenin Nucleic Acid Detection Kit), 0.1% (w/v)N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sections were hybridized with the probes (1 μg/ml) and were incubated overnight at 58 °C. They were washed twice in 2× SSC at room temperature, twice in 1× SSC at 55 °C, and twice in 0.1× SSC at 37 °C. For immunologic detection of the probe, sections were washed in a buffer containing 0.1 m maleic acid and 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.5, and were blocked with the same buffer containing 1% blocking reagent. The alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody was diluted 1:5000, and slides were incubated with this antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed in the preceding wash buffer containing levamisol (200 μg/ml) twice for 10 min and were equilibrated with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. The color reaction was developed in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Slides were washed in distilled water coverslipped, but not counterstained, so that the purplish red-colored precipitate indicative of a positive reaction could be visualized in the sections. In addition to the five antibodies purified in the laboratory of Dr. Sirotnak (20.Chiao J. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11165-11170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), an additional antipeptide antibody was raised against the peptide sequence RPKRSLFFNRDDRGRC which corresponds to residues 205–220 of human RFT-1. Following our published protocol (21.Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Prasad P.D. Kekuda R. Oblak T.G. Ganapathy V. Leibach F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the peptide (2 mg) was conjugated to 2 mg of Imject maleimide-activated mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin and purified by overnight dialysis. Approximately 300 μg of the peptide-conjugated hemocyanin in Freund's complete adjuvant was administered intradermally to New Zealand White rabbits (approximately 50 μl each). The initial injection was followed by two boosters. Antiserum was obtained 10 days after the second booster and purified using affinity chromatography. Immunohistochemical analyses were used to localize RFT-1 in cultured human ARPE-19 cells, human trophoblast BeWo cells, and in intact eyes from mice. The cells and 10-μm thick cryosections were fixed with ice-cold methanol and acetone, respectively, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum. Samples were incubated with one of several peptide antibodies against RFT-1 (20.Chiao J. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11165-11170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or with the additional affinity purified antibody against RFT-1 that was made in our laboratory. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:2000; tissue sections were incubated for 3 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:50 followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. In companion experiments, cells or cryosections were incubated with an antibody against FRα at a dilution of 1:50 or the antibody against Na+-K+-ATPase at a dilution of 1:50. As the FRα has been localized to the basolateral membrane of intact mouse RPE (15.Smith S.B. Kekuda R. Gu X. Chancy C. Conway S. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 840-848PubMed Google Scholar), it was used in the present study for comparison to RFT-1. The Na+-K+-ATPase was used as a marker for the apical membrane of the RPE (22.Ostwald T.J. Steinberg R.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 3: 351-360Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23.Gundersen D.

Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the basolateral membrane of BeWo cells. Incubation with 0.1% normal rabbit serum or with buffer only served as negative controls. After rinsing, all samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:100. Cells and cryosections were optically sectioned (z series) using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System. Analysis of images used the COMOS software package (Bio-Rad). Additional analyses of the cells were performed using a Nikon Diaphot 200 Laser-scanning Confocal Imaging System (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Images were analyzed using the Image Display 3.2 software package (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). Membrane vesicles were prepared following our published methods (25.Miyamoto Y. Kulanthaivel P. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 2542-2551PubMed Google Scholar). For each membrane preparation, 30 bovine eyes were obtained fresh from a local slaughterhouse. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cornea of each eye was removed and the eyecup inverted. Following removal of the neural retina, the RPE was collected and placed in ice-cold buffer (2.4 mm Tris/NaOH, 60 mm mannitol, 1 mmEGTA, pH 7.2). The RPE was homogenized for 1.5 min at high speed in a Waring blender (Waring Products Corp., New York). A stock solution of 1m MgCl2 was added to the homogenate to create a final concentration of 30 mm. The mixture was stirred for 1.5 min, incubated for an additional 10 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant, containing apical membranes, was collected by filtration through several layers of cheesecloth. It was then centrifuged at 46,000 × g for 35 min to pellet the membranes. The pellets were resuspended in a preloading buffer (20 mm Hepes/Tris, 300 mmmannitol, pH 8.0), and the centrifugation was repeated. The resulting pellets were resuspended in a small amount of the same preloading buffer, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml. The membranes were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The transport of [3′,5′,7,9-3H]N 5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([3H]MTF) and [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid was measured in membrane vesicles at room temperature by a rapid filtration method using Millipore filters (DAWP type, 0.65 μm pore size). Transport was initiated by mixing 40 μl of membrane vesicle preparation (400 μg of membrane protein) with 160 μl of uptake buffer containing 30 nm[3H]N 5-MTF or 20 nm[3H]folic acid. Transport was allowed to proceed for a desired time following which it was terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer. The mixture was filtered and washed with two changes of 10 ml each of ice-cold buffer. The filter was transferred to a counting vial, and the radioactivity associated with it was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The composition of the uptake buffer in most experiments was 20 mm Mes/Tris, 300 mm mannitol, pH 5.0. Under these conditions, there was an inwardly directed transmembrane H+ gradient (or outwardly directed transmembrane OH− gradient) due to the pH gradient across the membrane (intravesicular pH = 8.0; extravesicular pH = 5.0). For experiments dealing with the influence of Na+ and Cl− on the transport process, the uptake buffers consisted of 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mmNaCl, sodium gluconate, or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-chloride. For experiments dealing with the influence of pH, the uptake buffers of varying pH values (5.0–8.0) were prepared by appropriately mixing the following two buffers: 20 mmMes/Tris, 300 mm mannitol, pH 5.0, and 20 mmHepes/Tris, 300 mm mannitol, pH 8.0. The substrate specificity of the transport process was investigated by assessing the influence of unlabeled folate analogs (MTF, folate, and methotrexate) and other vitamins (ascorbate, thiamine, niacinamide, and pantothenate) on the transport of radiolabeled MTF or folate. To confirm that the folate transport measured in the apical RPE membrane vesicles was not due to the presence of FRα, a ligand binding assay was performed following a protocol published by Spinnela et al. (26.Spinnela M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7842-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ability of the membranes to bind [3H]folic acid in the absence and presence of unlabeled folic acid was measured. The binding of [3H]folic acid to apical membranes from human placenta, known to contain FRα, was also measured as a positive control. Membranes were resuspended in 25 ml of acidic buffer (10 mmNa+ acetate/acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.5) to release any endogenous bound folate. Membranes were immediately centrifuged at 46,000 × g for 35 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and the protein concentration was determined. Binding was initiated by adding 50 μl of the membrane suspension (final concentration, 30 μg of membrane protein) to 150 μl of binding buffer containing of 10 nm [3H]folic acid and, in some samples, 10 μm unlabeled folic acid. Binding was performed at 4 °C, which prevents transport but allows binding. Binding was allowed to continue for 90 min, after which the mixture was filtered through a glass fiber filter (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) using a rapid filtration technique. The filter was washed with two changes of 10 ml each of ice-cold binding buffer and was transferred to a counting vial. The radioactivity associated with the filter was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Uptake and transport measurements were made either in duplicate or triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two to three times. Results are given as means ± S.E. of these replicate values. We have recently analyzed the expression pattern of FRα in the retina by in situhybridization (15.Smith S.B. Kekuda R. Gu X. Chancy C. Conway S. Ganapathy V. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 840-848PubMed Google Scholar). FRα mRNA is expressed in every cell type in the retina. The expression pattern included ganglion cells, cells of the inner nuclear layer (amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, and Müller cells), photoreceptor cells, and the RPE. In the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of RFT-1 mRNA in the retina. In situ hybridization was performed on cryosections of mouse eyes (n = 6) to determine in which retinal tissues mRNA transcripts encoding RFT-1 were expressed. These studies were performed using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. Fig.1 A shows a hematoxylin and eosin-stained cryosection of the outer retina for comparison to the non-stained in situ hybridization data. As shown in Fig.1 B, RFT-1 mRNA was expressed only in the RPE cell layer of the retina as indicated by the dark blue staining in this cellular layer when an RFT-1-specific antisense riboprobe was used. All other retinal cell layers were negative. Hybridization of the tissue sections with the sense probe of RFT-1 showed no positive signal (Fig.1 C). Hybridizatio"

Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from control and iNOS-deficient mice, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was quantified after stimulation with γ-interferon and lipopolysaccharide to induce COX-2. Total nitrate and nitrite production was completely abolished in cells from iNOS-deficient animals compared with control cells. PGE2 formation by cells from iNOS-deficient animals was decreased compared with cells from control animals 80% at 12 h (0.85 ± 0.90 ng/106 cells versus15.4 ± 2.1 ng/106 cells, p < 0.01) and 74% at 24 h (9.4 ± 4.3 ng/106 cellsversus 36.8 ± 4.1 ng/106 cells,p < 0.01). COX-2 protein expression was not significantly different in cells from control or knockout animals.

In addition, the levels of urinary F2-isoprostanes, an index of endogenous oxidant stress, were significantly decreased in iNOS-deficient animals. In contrast, the levels of thromboxane B2 derived from platelets allowed to aggregate ex vivo were significantly increased in iNOS-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice.

Inhibitors of nitric oxide formation or depletion of the nitric oxide precursor arginine are also reported to stimulate or inhibit biosynthesis in cellular or intact animal experiments (10.Salvemini D.

These effects may be mediated by altered transcription of cyclooxygenase (COX)1 genes (14.Hughes F.J. Buttery L.D.K. Hukkanen M.V.J. O'Donnell A. Maclouf J. Polak J.M. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1996; 335: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,16.Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), or by inactivation of downstream metabolizing enzymes that convert prostaglandin endoperoxides to stable eicosanoid products (17.Zou M. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is likely that NO does not mediate all of these actions but that NO-derived species such as peroxynitrite or nitrosothiols may be responsible (17.Zou M. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For example, we have demonstrated that peroxynitrite activates the cyclooxygenase activity of COX-1 and COX-2 by acting as a substrate for the peroxidase activity of each enzyme (18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The complexity of possible interactions between NO or NO-derived species and expression or activation of enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism makes it difficult to extrapolate results from in vitro experiments to in vivo settings. Although inhibitors of NO biosynthesis and prostaglandin biosynthesis are available, specificity issues frequently complicate the interpretation of pharmacological investigations of complex metabolic interactions. Therefore, we have used a genetic approach to probe for linkage between NO biosynthesis and prostaglandin formation. We have determined the effect of targeted deletions of the inducible NO synthase gene on prostaglandin biosynthesis in vivo and ex vivo. Three different contexts in which prostaglandins are biosynthesized were probed. First, peritoneal macrophages from iNOS knockout animals were stimulated with LPS and γ-interferon to induce COX-2 activity, and the levels of PGE2 released were determined. Second, urine samples from iNOS knockout animals were analyzed for prostaglandin content as an indication of biosynthesis in the kidney. Third, blood samples from iNOS knockout animals were analyzed for levels of thromboxane, an indicator of COX-1 activity in the platelet. The results of these ex vivo and in vivoexperiments mirror the complexity of interactions established fromin vitro experiments but clearly establish a role for NO or NO-derived species in the control of prostaglandin biosynthesis. iNOS-deficient mice were generated as described (19.MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by John MacMicking and Carl Nathan (Cornell University School of Medicine) and John Mudgett (Merck Research Laboratories). Control mice were C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) × 129Sv/Ev (Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY). All mice used for studies were 5-week-old males. The mice were placed on a low nitrate diet of AIN-76 (Bio-Serve, Frenchtown, NJ) for 2 days prior to and during the urine collection. Peritoneal macrophages were elicited by intraperitoneal injection of 1–3 ml of 3% sterile thioglycolate medium (Sigma). After 3 days mice were sacrificed, and macrophages were harvested as described (20.Nunoshiba T. deRojas-Walker T. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9993-9997Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on tissue culture plates for 2 h, and then nonadherent cells were removed by washing with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were treated with γ-interferon (500 units/ml) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli O26:B6) (Sigma) in supplemented minimal essential medium for 12 or 24 h. Medium or cells were then utilized for subsequent analyses. Total nitrate and nitrite generation by peritoneal macrophages was quantified by colorimetric determination in medium aliquots using the Griess reagent as described (21.Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). PGE2 was quantified in medium from cell incubations by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (22.Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Frozen pellets of peritoneal macrophages (3 × 106) were thawed prior to addition of 125 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin) (Sigma). Each sample was passed through a 22-gauge needle to shear the DNA, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (5 μg of total protein) were heated with Laemmli reducing sample buffer for 3 min at 95 °C, run on a 7% Nu-Page Tris acetate polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) for 45 min at 160 V, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) for 2 h at 30 V. The blot was probed overnight with goat anti-COX-2 (C-20, 1:750, Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa Cruz, CA) and then for 1 h with rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3000, Pierce). Detection was carried out with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and quantification was by densitometry (18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). PGE2 and F2-isoprostanes (F2-isoPs) were measured in timed urine collections from either control or iNOS-deficient mice. F2-IsoPs were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (23.Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Results are expressed per mg of creatinine. Urinary creatinine concentration was measured by the sodium picrate method with an AutoAnalyzer II (Technicon, Tarrytown, NY). TxB2 was measured in mouse serum ex vivo after platelet activation by endogenous thrombin during whole blood clotting at 37 °C as described using gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (24.FitzGerald G.A. Oates J.A. Hawiger J. Maas R.L. Roberts L.J., II Lawson J.A. Brash A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 676-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Fig. 1demonstrates the generation of PGE2 in peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient and control mice after treatment with γ-interferon and LPS to induce COX-2. PGE2 is a major eicosanoid produced by these cells and was quantified in cell medium either 12 (Fig. 1 A) or 24 h (Fig. 1 B) after LPS. As is evident, unstimulated peritoneal macrophages from either WT or iNOS-deficient animals produced only small amounts of PGE2. In contrast, activation with γ-interferon and increasing concentrations of LPS significantly increased PGE2 production in peritoneal macrophages from WT cells in a concentration-dependent manner. After 12 h, the maximum increase in PGE2 formation was 84-fold, and after 24 h, it was 133-fold. Treatment of peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient animals also resulted in increases in PGE2production (11-fold at 12 h and 19-fold at 24 h) although these increases were significantly less (p < 0.05 for all times and concentrations of LPS) than those observed in WT cells. We then sought to determine whether the decrease in PGE2generation in peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient mice compared with WT animals was because of a reduction in cyclooxygenase protein expression. Thus, we analyzed COX-2 protein in peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient and WT animals. Fig.2 displays the results after 24 h of treatment with varying concentrations of LPS. As is apparent, there is no significant difference in COX-2 expression between iNOS-deficient and control animals despite a marked difference in PGE2generation. Previous studies have shown that LPS treatment of macrophages does not alter COX-1 expression (25.Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). We also quantified nitrate and nitrite production in peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient and WT mice. The ability of the cells from iNOS-deficient mice to secrete nitrate and nitrite into the medium was completely abolished relative to cells from WT mice. Medium alone contained approximately 8–14 μm nitrate/nitrite, and this was not increased in medium containing cells from iNOS-deficient mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that PGE2production is significantly decreased in activated peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient mice compared with macrophages from WT animals. Further, this decrease is not because of a reduction in COX protein expression. Because ex vivo formation of PGE2 is significantly decreased in peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient animals compared with WT mice, we undertook studies to determine whether eicosanoid formation was altered in vivo in these animals. Therefore, we quantified urinary PGE2 production in either iNOS-deficient or WT mice. The major source of PGE2 in the urine is the kidney (26.Frolich J.C. Wilson T.W. Sweetman B.J. Smigel M. Nies A.S. Carr K. Watson J.T. Oates J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The results are summarized in Fig. 3. Collections were timed, and PGE2 values were expressed based on creatinine clearance to account for any differences in renal function between individual animals. As is evident, iNOS-deficient mice excreted significantly lower amounts of PGE2 (mean decrease of 78%,p < 0.01) than did WT animals. In addition, we also quantified urinary excretion of F2-isoPs in iNOS-deficient and WT mice. We have previously shown that excessive peroxynitrite formation in vitro andin vivo is associated with increased F2-IsoP generation (27.Moore K.P. Darley-Usmar V. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28.Lynch S.M. Frei B. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Xu A. Jackson T. Reyna R. Klevay L.M. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). F2-IsoPs are PGF2-like compounds derived from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid independent of the cyclooxygenase (29.Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51 (L. J.): 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 30.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24441-24444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). They are highly accurate indices of oxidant stress in vivo in animals and humans. As shown in Fig. 4, urinary levels of F2-IsoPs are significantly decreased in iNOS-deficient mice compared with WT animals, although the decrease is less than that of PGE2 in the same mice. These data suggest that NO and/or peroxynitrite may regulate oxidant tone in particular tissues to a significant extent in vivo. We also measured the effect of iNOS deficiency on platelet TxB2 formation. TxB2 is the major PG produced by platelets and is derived entirely from COX-1 in this cell type (31.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that endogenous NO formation is important in vascular homeostasis, and indeed NO inhibits platelet aggregation (32.Furlong B. Henderson A.H. Lewis M.J. Smith J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33.De Caterina R. Giannessi D. Crea F. Chierchia S. Bernini W. Gazzetti P. L'Abbate A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1984; 53: 1683-1687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34.Anggard E. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1199-1206Abstract PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 35.Yoshimoto H. Suehiro A. Kakishita E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Excessive TxB2 formation is associated with platelet aggregation. Therefore, we assessed the formation of TxB2 in platelets from iNOS-deficient and WT mice allowed to aggregate ex vivo. The results are shown in Fig.5. Interestingly, unlike urinary excretion of PGE2, levels of TxB2 derived from platelet aggregation ex vivo are not decreased in iNOS-deficient animals but are significantly increased. These data suggest that NO may regulate platelet thromboxane formation but by a mechanism different from that observed in the kidney of mice in vivo. The current study provides strong genetic evidence for a functional link between NO biosynthesis and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Mice bearing targeted deletions in the iNOS gene demonstrated a dramatically reduced ability to synthesize prostaglandins in stimulated peritoneal macrophages and in kidney but a significantly enhanced ability to synthesize thromboxane in platelets. The decreases in PGE2 production by macrophages and kidney are consistent with previous reports 1) that administration of NO synthase inhibitors to rats reduces the production of prostaglandins in inflammatory lesions (4.Sautebin L. Ialenti A. Ianaro A. Di Rosa M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36.Salvemini D. Settle S.L. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G. Needleman P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), 2) that inflamed brain tissue from iNOS knockout mice displays reduced PGE2 synthesis relative to wild-type mice (12.Nogawa S. Forster C. Zhang F. Nagayama M. Ross E. Iadecola C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10966-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and 3) that arginine depletion decreases prostaglandin synthesis in mouse macrophages stimulated with LPS (3.Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7240-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 10.Salvemini D. Seibert K. Masferrer J.L. Misko T.P. Currie M.G. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1940-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These observations point to a stimulatory effect of NO or an NO-derived species on prostaglandin biosynthetic capacity in inflammatory cells and, with the present report, in the kidney. The biochemical mechanism by which NO stimulates prostaglandin synthesis has been the subject of much investigation. Despite evidence suggesting a direct effect of NO on COX enzymes (3.Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7240-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), incubation of purified protein with NO sources does not stimulate activity in most reported studies (9.Curtis J.F. Reddy N.G. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Eling T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16.Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NO alters the expression of COX genes in some cell types either at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level, but a consistent pattern of stimulation or inhibition is not observed (15.Habib A. Bernard C. Lebret M. Créminon C. Esposito B. Tedgui A. Maclouf J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3845-3851PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Perkins D.J. Kniss D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The effects of NO on COX transcription appear to be dependent on the cell type and the signal transduction pathway that NO modulates. In the present study, analysis of COX-2 protein levels in stimulated peritoneal macrophages suggests that no significant reduction in expression occurs in iNOS-deficient mice despite an approximate 80% reduction in PGE2 biosynthesis in the stimulated macrophages. We have demonstrated that peroxynitrite, the coupling product of NO and superoxide, is an efficient substrate for the peroxidase activity of COX enzymes and activates cyclooxygenase activity even in the presence of concentrations of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase that are high enough to completely prevent COX activation by fatty acid hydroperoxides and H2O2 (18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Activation can be achieved by bolus addition of peroxynitrite or by in situgeneration from NO and superoxide sources. Activation by NO and superoxide is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, membrane-permeant superoxide dismutase-mimetic agents reduce prostaglandin biosynthesis by 85% in mouse macrophages stimulated with LPS and γ-interferon (18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This extent of inhibition is comparable with the reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis observed in stimulated peritoneal macrophages from iNOS-deficient animals. Thus, it is conceivable that the reduction in PGE2 synthesis observed in iNOS knockout mice is because of a reduced ability to generate peroxynitrite in inflammatory cells. A similar explanation may account for the reduction of PGE2 secretion into urine, which presumably reflects a reduction in renal prostaglandin biosynthetic capacity. However, it is noteworthy that superoxide dismutase does not inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis in the carrageenan model of inflammation despite the fact that it exhibits antiinflammatory activity (38.Seibert K. Masferrer J.L. Needleman P. Salvemini D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The lack of inhibition of prostaglandin production by superoxide dismutase may reflect the latter's inabilty to penetrate cell membranes. In addition to a decrease in the urinary excretion of prostaglandins in iNOS knockout animals, we found a significant reduction in the levels of F2-IsoPs, products of the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Urinary IsoPs, like prostaglandins, may originate in the kidney, and previous studies by us have revealed that peroxynitrite is a potent inducer of IsoP formation both in vitro in low density lipoprotein or in vivo in the plasma of rats deficient in superoxide dismutase (27.Moore K.P. Darley-Usmar V. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28.Lynch S.M. Frei B. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Xu A. Jackson T. Reyna R. Klevay L.M. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39.Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36 (L. J.): 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that iNOS may regulate, to an extent, IsoP formation in the kidney. These findings contrast with a previous study in which we reported that feeding of aminoguanidine to aged rats did not significantly alter renal tissue IsoP levels (40.Reckelhoff J.F. Hennington B.S. Kanji V. Racusen L.C. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Salahudeen A.K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1999; 12: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the reduction of urinary nitrate/nitrite in that study was only ∼50%, compared with the complete inhibition of production of nitrate/nitrite in macrophages from iNOS-deficient mice in the present study. Thus, it may be the case that the decreases in NO/peroxynitrite formation in the kidney of iNOS-deficient mice result in a decreased excretion into the urine of F2-IsoPs. The stimulation of TxB2 production during ex vivo aggregation of platelets from iNOS-deficient animals relative to WT may appear paradoxical but is consistent with several reports demonstrating that NO inhibits platelet aggregation. In fact, administration of the NO source, isosorbide dinitrate, to humans inhibits platelet aggregation and the ability of platelets to generate TxB2. Likewise, S-nitrosocysteine reduces TxB2 biosynthesis by intact platelets in a cGMP-independent fashion. The precise locus of NO action is unknown but is unlikely to be platelet COX-1 because several studies indicate that NO does not inhibit this enzyme in vitro (9.Curtis J.F. Reddy N.G. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Eling T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16.Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18.Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that NO inhibits thromboxane synthase, a P450 type hemeprotein. P450 hemeproteins are quite sensitive to peroxide inactivation (41.Hrycay E. O'Brien P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 147: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42.Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Marnett L.J. Weller P.A. Battista J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450. Plenum Press, New York1986: 29-76Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, deletion of iNOS would lower the synthesis of an endogenous inhibitor of TxB2 synthesis, as is observed. The inability of platelets to synthesize new protein to replace inactivated thromboxane synthase would account for the fact that differences in the levels of TxB2 between WT and iNOS-deficient mice could be detected following ex vivoplatelet aggregation. The major determinant of TxB2 levels generated ex vivo is the amount of active thromboxane synthase in the platelet at the time of removal of blood from circulation, and this would be elevated in iNOS-deficient mice. In summary, our study provides evidence that a targeted deletion of iNOS with a resultant reduction in NO or an NO-derived molecular species, leads to significant alterations in prostaglandin and IsoP formation in vivo. This strengthens the tie between NO biosynthesis and eicosanoid biosynthesis but indicates that multiple pathways exist by which NO or NO derivatives interact with endoperoxide-generating or -metabolizing enzymes. This provides great flexibility for regulation of arachidonic acid-dependent signal transduction and multiple opportunities for pharmacologic manipulation of the NO-arachidonate interrelationship."
https://openalex.org/W1973515129,"We examined the in vivo expression of up to 16 genes encoding for components of both glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems and for members of the OxyR and SoxRS regulons. We demonstrated that grxA (Grx1) transcription is triggered in bacteria lacking Trx1 (trxA) and GSH (gshA) in an OxyR-dependent manner. We also indicated that, unlike OxyR, SoxR is not constitutively activated in the oxidizing environment of trxA gshA mutants. We discovered that the lack of Trx1 plus GSH increases the steady-state levels of Trx reductase (trxB) and Trx2 (trxC) transcripts. This increase and the trxB and trxC up-regulation caused by the constitutive oxyR2 allele indicate that OxyR also plays a role in the regulation of the thioredoxin pathway. On the contrary, no change in the expression of genes for Trx1, Grx2, and Grx3 was observed. Transcription of nrdAB (RRase) was not induced by oxidative stress yet was induced by hydroxyurea (RRase inhibitor). Induction level was as the enhanced nrdAB basal expression of trxA grxA mutants, indicating that RRase operation without Trx1 and Grx1 must lead to disturbances sensed as those caused by hydroxyurea. We also demonstrated an inverse relation between nrdAB expression and that of genes coding for components of both glutaredoxin (grxA, gorA) and thioredoxin (trxB, trxC) systems. We examined the in vivo expression of up to 16 genes encoding for components of both glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems and for members of the OxyR and SoxRS regulons. We demonstrated that grxA (Grx1) transcription is triggered in bacteria lacking Trx1 (trxA) and GSH (gshA) in an OxyR-dependent manner. We also indicated that, unlike OxyR, SoxR is not constitutively activated in the oxidizing environment of trxA gshA mutants. We discovered that the lack of Trx1 plus GSH increases the steady-state levels of Trx reductase (trxB) and Trx2 (trxC) transcripts. This increase and the trxB and trxC up-regulation caused by the constitutive oxyR2 allele indicate that OxyR also plays a role in the regulation of the thioredoxin pathway. On the contrary, no change in the expression of genes for Trx1, Grx2, and Grx3 was observed. Transcription of nrdAB (RRase) was not induced by oxidative stress yet was induced by hydroxyurea (RRase inhibitor). Induction level was as the enhanced nrdAB basal expression of trxA grxA mutants, indicating that RRase operation without Trx1 and Grx1 must lead to disturbances sensed as those caused by hydroxyurea. We also demonstrated an inverse relation between nrdAB expression and that of genes coding for components of both glutaredoxin (grxA, gorA) and thioredoxin (trxB, trxC) systems. thioredoxin glutaredoxin ribonucleotide reductase reverse transcription/multiplex polymerase chain reaction tetracycline kanamycin chloramphenicol thiol peroxidase formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase diethylmaleate polymerase chain reaction Thioredoxins (Trxs)1 and glutaredoxins (Grxs) are known hydrogen donors for ribonucleotide reductase (RRase), the essential key enzyme for deoxyribonucleotide and DNA biosynthesis. In the reduced form, both Trxs and Grxs contain two redox-active cysteine thiols, which by dithiol-disulfide interchange reduce an acceptor disulfide in the active center of RRase. Trxs and Grxs differ in the manner they are reduced in the cell, although ultimately reducing equivalents come from NADPH. Thus, the thioredoxin system is composed of NADPH, the flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase, and Trx; and the glutaredoxin system of NADPH consists of the flavoprotein glutathione reductase, the ubiquitous tripeptide glutathione (GSH), and Grx (1.Holmgren A.

Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The NrdAB (encoded by the nrdABoperon) is active during aerobiosis, NrdDG is strictly anaerobic and uses formate as electron donor, and NrdEF is a cryptic enzyme of unknown physiological role. At present, two thioredoxins (Trx1 and Trx2) and three glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3) have been discovered in the bacterial cytoplasm (1.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, Grx3 (grxC) is a very inefficient reductant (about 5% of the catalytic activity of Grx1), while Grx2 (grxB) lacks activity as hydrogen donor for RRase (3.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similar to Trx1, Trx2 (trxC) is a functional electron donor for NrdAB. However, compared with Trx1, Trx2 is a 5-fold less abundant protein and a 2.5-fold less efficient enzyme (4.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulus A.E. Gutafsson J.-A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A fifth potential reductant is the NrdH-redoxin, which has thioredoxin-like activity but a glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence (7.Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). NrdH is a functional hydrogen donor for RRase with higher specificity for the NrdEF than for the NrdAB enzyme. However, the physiological function of NrdH in E. coli is not well understood, since thenrdH gene is located in the same poorly transcribed operon as nrdEF (8.Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Different inducible responses are critical in protecting E. coli from the damage caused by oxidative stress (9.Jamieson D.J. Storz G. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 91-115Google Scholar). Key regulators of adaptive responses to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O⨪2) are the OxyR and SoxRS transcription factors, respectively (recently reviewed in Ref. 10.Storz G. Imlay J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Among the OxyR-regulated genes are those encoding for hydroperoxidase I (catalase, katG), glutathione reductase (gorA), Grx1 (grxA), and OxyS RNA (oxyS). Regulation of the soxRS regulon occurs by a two-stage process; the constitutively expressed SoxR protein is first converted to an active form, which stimulates soxStranscription, and the increased levels of SoxS in turn activate expression of the regulon. Among the SoxRS-regulated genes are those encoding for manganese superoxide dismutase (sodA) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf). The OxyR protein is directly sensitive to oxidation, and only the oxidized OxyR is capable of activating transcription (11.Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that oxidation of OxyR leads to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and that OxyR is reduced and deactivated by enzymatic reduction with Grx1 at the expense of glutathione (12.Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). SoxR is a homodimer containing two [2Fe-2S] centers essential for its transcriptional activity (13.Bradley T.M. Hidalgo E. Leautaud V. Ding H. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The univalent oxidation of the iron-sulfur clusters appears to be the mechanism for activating SoxR as a transcriptional factor (14.Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Gaudu P. Weiss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mechanism of SoxR reduction/deactivation has not been elucidated, except for an NADPH-dependent SoxR reductase that has recently been purified from E. coli (16.Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has recently been suggested that cellular monothiols, like GSH, and low molecular weight dithiols and dithiols proteins, such as Trx1, may contribute to SoxR regulation by promoting the disassembly (14.Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and reassembly (17.Ding H. Demple B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17280-17286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) of the [2Fe-2S] clusters. Recently, we reported that the in vivo transcription of thenrdAB operon and of the grxA and fpg(coding for formamidopyrimidine-DNAglycosylase; Ref. 18.Boiteux S Huisman O. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) genes is triggered in E. coli lacking both Trx1 and Grx1 (trxA grxA mutant) or Trx1 and GSH (trxA gshA mutant) (19.Gallardo-Madueño R.

The present study aimed to examine the role of OxyR and SoxRS in determining such increased basal levels of expression. To this end, trxA grxAand trxA gshA defective bacteria, additionally mutated in the oxyR or soxRS regulatory genes, have been isolated, and the in vivo expression of up to 16 different genes has been examined by reverse transcription/multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RT/MPCR). The genes studied include most components of both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems as well as known members of the OxyR and SoxRS regulons. Media and chemical reagents were prepared or purchased as described previously (19.Gallardo-Madueño R. Leal J.F.M. Dorado G. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18382-18388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and hydroxyurea were purchased from Sigma. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) nutrient broth or M9 minimal medium (20.Provence D.L. Curtiss III R. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Wood W.A. Krieg N.R. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 343-345Google Scholar). The media were supplemented (when necessary) with chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or tetracycline (20 μg/ml). The minimal medium contained arginine (40 μg/ml), d-biotin (5 μg/ml), thiamine (5 μg/ml), glucose (2 g/liter), and casamino acids (2 g/liter). Strains used are listed in TableI. All strains are E. coliK-12, UC5710 (21.Abril N. Roldán-Arjona T. Prieto-Álamo M.-J. van Zeeland A.A. Pueyo C. Environ. Mol.

Strains were constructed by P1 transduction (24.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The mutant alleles of the genes used to construct the strains are as follows: Δsox-8::cat (25.Tsaneva I.R. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4197-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), ΔoxyR::kan (26.Kullik I. Toledano M.B. Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. J.

Mannervik B. Functions of Glutathione: Biochemical, Physiological, Toxicological and Clinical Aspects. Raven Press, NY1983: 385-393Google Scholar). The Δsox-8::cat deletion covers the region encoding both the SoxR and SoxS proteins (25.Tsaneva I.R. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4197-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Strains with the Δsox-8::cat or ΔoxyR::kan allele did not induce glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (coded for by the zwfgene) or hydroperoxidase I catalase (coded for by the katGgene) activity upon exposure to 100 μm paraquat or 500 μm H2O2, respectively. Strains carrying the oxyR2 allele exhibited constitutive high levels of catalase activity. UC1351 was made because the generation of a tetracycline-sensitive clone leaves a genetic lesion at the original site of the insertion. TcS bacteria were selected as described (29.Bochner B.R. Huang H.C. Schieven G.L. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic lesion carried by UC1351 extended outward from the Tn10 insertion site into the grxA locus, making the bacteria additionally sensitive to kanamycin (KanS). UC1351 and its parental UC827 showed identical growth rates in LB broth and the same basal levels of gene expression, as measured by the set A of primers. Strains with either thegshA::Tn10kan (UC859, UC1336, and UC614) or the gshA (UC1358, UC1369, UC1363, and UC1395) mutant allele exhibited identical sensitive to diamide and undetectable levels of glutathione, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (23.Miranda-Vizuete A.

The second trxA gshA double mutant (UC1358) displayed a greater growth defect than the first construction (UC859) (doubling time in LB of 60 ± 1 and 37 ± 2 min, respectively). Nonetheless, suppressor mutations (no reversions of thegshA mutant allele) that allow UC1358 to grow faster arose at a high frequency (approximately 10−4). UC1369 was constructed by selecting for spontaneous reversion to utilization of sorbitol (Srl+). This precise eductant became sensitive to tetracycline.Table IBacterial strainsStrainGenotypeOrigin/ConstructionUC5710arg56 nad113 araD81 Δ(uvrB-bio) Δ(ogt-fnr)1Ref. 21.Abril N. Roldán-Arjona T.

At this stage, the bacteria were further grown in the absence or the presence of hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, hydroxyurea, or diethylmaleate for a fixed time period. The cells were then rapidly cooled to 0 °C for total RNA purification. Total RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method previously described (30.Emory S.A. Belasco J.G. J.

Set B and set C were designed with the Primer Select 3.03/96 (DNA Star, Madison, WI) and Oligo 5.0/96 (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) programs, in order to obtain the highest specificity and performance in multiplexed PCRs. Target genes code for the two subunits of NrdAB (nrdA, nrdB); Trx1 and Trx2 (trxA, trxC); Trx reductase (trxB); Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3 (grxA, grxB,grxC); glutathione reductase (gorA); γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gshA); thioredoxin-linked Tpx (tpx); formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (fpg); hydroperoxidase I catalase (katG); OxyS RNA (oxyS); SoxS transcription factor (soxS); and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf).

Primers for katG and oxyS were alternately included in set B, since both were labeled with the same fluorophor and gave PCR products of identical length. As control, primers of new sets amplify some of the genes of set A. Thus, set A shares the nrdA, trxA, and grxA genes with set B and the gorA gene with set C.

Twenty-seven cycles of PCR were performed with set A, 24 cycles with set B, and 25 cycles with set C. Each cycle consisted of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 15 s of annealing at 70 °C, and 30 s for enzymatic primer extension at 72 °C. Multiplex PCR products were quantified as described previously (19.Gallardo-Madueño R. Leal J.F.M. Dorado G. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol.

Differences among PCR outcomes were normalized by comparing the fluorescence intensity of each band to that resulting from gapA amplification (internal standard). Samples for comparison of different experimental conditions or different bacterial strains were handled in parallel. Data are the means ± S.E. from n independent multiplexed PCR amplifications. Comparison between groups was done by Student'st test. We have recently devised a sensitive, rapid, nonradioactive, and semiquantitative procedure (RT/MPCR) for comparing the in vivo expression of metabolically related genes (19.Gallardo-Madueño R.

In this technique, the target genes and a constitutively expressed reporter gene are coamplified in the same reaction vessel. Specific fluorophor-labeled primers are used, and amplification products are subsequently analyzed with a DNA sequencer (GeneScan). The levels of expression of the genes of interest are presented in reference to the internal standard. Here we have used three sets of primers to examine the expression of genes coding for most components of both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems as well as pivotal members of the OxyR and SoxRS regulons. One of the sets includes an external standard to control the potential variability of the reporter gene. Hydrogen peroxide activates the transcription factor OxyR through the oxidation of two cysteines and formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond (12.Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Superoxide-generating compounds, such as paraquat, activate the transcription factor SoxR by oxidizing the [2Fe-2S] clusters in the protein through an unknown mechanism (14.Ding H. Demple B. Proc.

Treatment with H2O2 stimulated the expression of the two genes (gorA and grxA), identified as being under theoxyR control (11.Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G.

Maximal induction levels of ∼3.5-, ∼1.6-, and ∼13.0-fold were observed for fpg, gorA, andgrxA, respectively, after 10 min of treatment with concentrations of 100 μm H2O2. Paraquat also activated the expression of these three genes but at higher concentrations than did H2O2. On the contrary, expression of nrdA, nrdB, andtrxA genes was not induced after oxidative stress by either H2O2 or paraquat. To examine the role of OxyR and SoxRS regulators in fpg,gorA, and grxA expression induction by H2O2 and paraquat, strains carrying the ΔoxyR::kan (OxyR−) or Δsox-8::cat (SoxRS−) mutant allele were constructed and subjected to oxidative stress conditions in conjunction with wild-type bacteria (Fig.3). H2O2 was used at a concentration of 100 μm, and paraquat was used at a concentration of 500 μm; gene expression was examined at 5 min upon exposure. The induction of fpg, gorA, and grxA expression by H2O2 or paraquat was abolished by the introduction of the ΔoxyR::kan mutation, indicating that activation by both oxidants is OxyR-dependent. In contrast, this transcriptional up-regulation was preserved in the stra"

To study the mechanisms of MMP action on collagenous substrates, we have constructed homotrimeric triple-helical peptide (THP) models of the collagenase cleavage sites in types I and II collagen. The THPs incorporate either the α1(I)772–786 or the α1(II)772–783 sequence. The α1(I)772–786 and α1(II)772–783 THPs were hydrolyzed by MMP-1 at the Gly-Ile and Gly-Leu bonds, respectively, analogous to the bonds cleaved in corresponding native collagens. Thus, the THPs contained all necessary information to direct MMP-1 binding and proteolysis. Subsequent investigations using the α1(I)772–786 THP showed hydrolysis by MMP-2, MMP-13, and a COOH-terminal domain-deleted MMP-1 (MMP-1(Δ243–450)) but not by MMP-3 or a COOH-terminal domain-deleted MMP-3 (MMP-3(Δ248–460)). Kinetic analyses showed ak cat/K m value of 1,808 s−1m−1 for MMP-1 hydrolysis of α1(I)772–786 THP, approximately 10-fold lower than for type I collagen. The effect is caused primarily by relativeK m values. MMP-2 and MMP-13 cleaved the THP more rapidly than MMP-1, but MMP-2 cleavage occurred at distinct multiple sites. Comparison of MMP-1 and MMP-1(Δ243–450) hydrolysis of α1(I)772–786 THP showed that both can cleave a triple-helical substrate with a slightly higher K mvalue for MMP-1(Δ243–450). We propose that the COOH-terminal domain of MMPs is necessary for orienting whole, native collagen molecules but may not be necessary for binding to and cleaving a THP. This proposal is consistent with the large distance between the MMP-1 catalytic and COOH-terminal domains observed by three-dimensional structural analysis and supports previous suggestions that the features of the catalytic domain contribute significantly toward enzyme specificity.

In particular, MMPs are believed to initiate interstitial collagen catabolism and participate in denatured collagen (gelatin) degradation. Interstitial collagens (types I–III) are hydrolyzed at a single locus by MMP-1 (collagenase 1) (5.Fields G.B. J. Theor.

Several investigations have attempted to define which MMP domains are required for collagenolytic activity. Deletion of the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain from MMP-1 (residues 243–450), MMP-8 (residues 243–467), or MMP-13 (residues 249–451) results in a loss of collagenolytic activity (9.Murphy G.

A chimeric MMP-8 whose linker region (16 residues) between the catalytic and COOH-terminal domains is replaced with the corresponding MMP-3 sequence (25 residues) lost activity toward collagen (17.Hirose T.

Residues 183–191 from the catalytic domain of MMP-1 are also required for collagenolytic activity (18.Chung L. Shimokawa K.-i. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Tam J.P. Barany G. Peptides for the New Millennium. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of an MMP to cleave interstitial collagens is dependent upon the combination of catalytic domain, COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain, and the hinge region (18.Chung L.

However, the exact roles of each of these regions with respect to binding and cleaving the collagen triple helix have not been elucidated.

Thus, a local unwinding of the triple-helical structure must occur before cleaving three α chains of interstitial collagens. One approach for better defining the mechanisms by which MMPs hydrolyze native interstitial collagens is the utilization of triple-helical peptide (THP) model substrates. Substrates containing only potential cleavage sites would be much smaller than native collagens and thus could be used in combination with mutagenesis to distinguish MMP domains responsible for binding and orienting native collagens, as opposed to domains responsible for unwinding the triple helix and cleaving individual collagen strands. Mechanistic information could be obtained via studies of MMP kinetics and x-ray crystallographic analysis of MMP/THP co-crystals. Also, THP substrates could be used to develop selective substrates for MMP family members, which in turn would allow for the design of specific inhibitors. Based on collagenolytic activities, it is possible that THPs may be used to design selective substrates for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-14, and MMP-18. Successful THP substrates would be required to incorporate a sequence that could be cleaved in triple-helical conformation and also have sufficient thermal stability to remain triple-helical under assay conditions. The interstitial collagen sequences targeted by MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, and MMP-13 have been identified, and a model collagenase cleavage site has been proposed based on the combination of triple-helical collagen primary, secondary, and super-secondary structures (5.Fields G.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The THPs incorporate either the α1(I)772–786 sequence Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln-Arg-Gly-Val-Val-Gly-Leu-Hyp or the α1(II)772–783 sequence Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Leu-Ala-Gly-Gln-Arg-Gly-Ile-Val (see Fig. 1). We have compared the susceptibility of THPs to several MMP family members: MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13. Whereas MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-13 cleave type I collagen, MMP-3 does not. The different collagenolytic behaviors of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 may be based primarily, although not exclusively, in the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain. We have utilized MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13, along with COOH-terminal deletions of MMP-1 (residues 243–450) and MMP-3 (residues 248–460), to examine hydrolysis of potential THP substrates. All standard peptide synthesis chemicals were analytical reagent grade or better and purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego) or Fisher. HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) was from Richelieu Biotechnologies (St. Hyacinthe, Quebec). Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-amino acid derivatives were obtained from Novabiochem. Amino acids are of the lconfiguration (except for Gly). THPs were synthesized and purified by methods described previously in our laboratory (28.Fields C.G. Lovdahl C.M. Miles A.J. Matthias-Hagen V.L. Fields G.B.

The synthesis and characterization of the α1(I)772–786 THP and α1(I)772–786 single-stranded peptide have been published (31.Grab B. Miles A.J. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1090 or 1100 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a Hypersil small pore, narrow bore C18 RP column (5-μm particle size, 120 Å pore size, 100 × 2.1 mm). Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (mixture A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (mixture B). The elution gradient was 0–50% mixture B in 30 min with a flow of 0.3 ml/min. Detection was at 229 nm. Edman degradation sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer/120A analyzer as described (49.Fields C.G. VanDrisse V.L. Fields G.B. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar) for “embedded” (noncovalent) sequencing. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A LD-TOF mass spectrometer using either a sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (9:1, v/v) matrix (50.Henkel W.

CD spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190–250 nm on a JASCO J-600 using either a 0.1- or 1.0-cm path length quartz cell. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm while the temperature was increased continuously in the range of 5–80 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. The temperature was controlled using a JASCO PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the reflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm). Alternatively,Tm was evaluated from the midpoint of the transition. Pro-MMP-1 (51.Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and pro-MMP-3 (52.Ito A. Nagase H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were purified from the culture medium of human rheumatoid synovial cells stimulated with rabbit macrophage-conditioned medium. Pro-MMP-2 was purified from the culture medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts (53.Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 was activated by reacting with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C for 45 min. Pro-MMP-1 was activated by reacting with 1 mm4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and an equimolar amount of MMP-3 at 37 °C for 6 h. After activation, MMP-3 was completely removed from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography using an anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10 column. Pro-MMP-3 was activated to the 45-kDa MMP-3 by reacting with 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Chymotrypsin was inactivated with 2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate. Pro-MMP-13 was a generous gift from Dr. P. G. Mitchell, Pfizer, Inc. Pro-MMP-13 was activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Pro-MMP-1(Δ243–450) and pro-MMP-3(Δ248–460) were expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pET3a (Novagen), refolded from inclusion bodies, and purified as described previously (54.Suzuki K. Kan C.-C. Huang W. Gehring M.R. Brew K. Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both zymogens were activated as described above for the full-length pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3. The amounts of active MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 were determined by titration with recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (55.Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) over a concentration range of 0.1–3 μg/ml. Two different assay methods were utilized, the first for Edman degradation sequence analysis and the second for mass spectrometric and fluorometric analyses. For the first assay method, THPs were prepared as 260 μm stock solutions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Initial MMP assays were carried out by incubating 40 μm substrate in either PBS or TNC buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, 0.02% NaN3) with 67 nm enzyme for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequent assays were performed with 2 or 20 nmMMP-1 and MMP-1(Δ243–450) for 4 h at 37 °C. These reactions were stopped by adding 130 μl of 3% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. The fluorogenic substrates NFF-1 (MoAc-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Lys(DNP)-Gly, where MoAc is (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl and DNP is 2,4-dinitrophenyl) and NFF-3 (MoAc-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(DNP)-NH2, where Nva is norvaline) were used for assays of MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively, as described (56.Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TNC buffer was found to interfere with Edman degradation sequence analyses. Thus, PBS was the preferred buffer for these assays, with the exception of MMP-2, which was the only MMP tested which required TNC buffer for activity. For the second assay method, THPs were prepared as 270 μm stock solutions in “fluorometric assay” buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35). MMP assays were carried out in assay buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations with 40 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Enzymatic activity was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of the enzyme/substrate solution to 30 μl of o-phenanthroline (20 mm) at the appropriate times. Rates of hydrolysis were monitored by the addition of 200 μl of fluorescamine solution. Fluorescamine solution was prepared by first dissolving fluorescamine in acetone at a concentration of 40 mm, then diluting the fluorescamine concentration to 5 mm with assay buffer minus Brij-35. Fluorescamine reacts with free amino groups, resulting in a fluorophore with λexcitation = 387 nm and λemission = 480 nm. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini Dual-Scanning Microplate Spectrofluorometer. Initial velocities were obtained from plots of fluorescence versus time, using only data points corresponding to less than 40% full hydrolysis. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain initial velocity in units of μm/s. Two different THPs were constructed as possible MMP substrates (Fig. 1). The first incorporated the α1(I)772–786 sequence between an NH2-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)6 domain and a COOH-terminal covalent branching structure. The α1(I)772–786 THP has been described previously (31.Grab B. Miles A.J. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12234-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has Tm values of ∼43 °C in acetic acid/water (1:99) (31.Grab B. Miles A.J. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12234-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and 32 °C in 0.01% (v/v) fluorometric assay buffer (Fig. 2), which is a desirable thermal stability for an MMP substrate. The stability of triple-helical peptides has previously been found to be enhanced in acetic acid compared with buffer systems such as PBS (57.Holmgren S.K. Bretscher L.E. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 63-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The second THP incorporated the α1(II)772–783 sequence between an NH2-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)6 domain and a COOH-terminal covalent branching structure. The composition and homogeneity were confirmed by Edman degradation sequence analysis, RP-HPLC, and MALDI-MS. The α1(II)772–783 THP has aTm ∼33 °C in acetic acid/water (1:99), which is adequate thermal stability for testing as an MMP substrate. The THPs were tested as potential substrates for MMP-1. Both THPs were found to be completely stable after overnight incubation at 37 °C in either PBS, TNC, or fluorometric buffer (see Fig.3 A). 2Lauer-Fields, J. L., Nagase, H., and Fields, G. B. (2000) J. Chromatogr. A, in press.After overnight reaction with MMP-1, RP-HPLC analysis indicated that the THPs were cleaved by MMP-1 (data not shown). Edman degradation sequence analysis of the α1(I)772–786 THP cleavage products (Fig.3 B) showed that MMP-1 hydrolysis occurred exclusively at the Gly-Ile bond, as the only amino acids seen in first cycle are PTH-Gly (emanating from the NH2 terminus of the intact THP or the NH2-terminal fragment of the cleaved THP) and PTH-Ile (emanating from the COOH-terminal fragment of the cleaved THP). The molar ratio of PTH-Ile to PTH-Gly was 1:1, indicating complete cleavage of the THP. MMP-1 hydrolysis of the α1(I)772–786 THP was also examined by MALDI-MS. The intact α1(I)772–786 THP has a mass of 9,844 Da. If the Gly-Ile bond is cleaved, the two products generated are the single-stranded NH2-terminal peptide (Gly-Pro-Hyp)6-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly ([M+H]+ = 1,961.1 Da) and the branched COOH-terminal peptide (Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln-Arg-Gly-Val-Val-Gly-Leu-Hyp)3-(Lys, Lys)-Tyr-Gly ([M+3H]+ = 4,033.7 Da). Mass spectrometric analysis of MMP-1 hydrolysis showed two products of [M+H]+ = 1,965.4 Da and [M+3H]+ = 4,039.8 Da. Thus, both Edman degradation sequence analysis and MALDI-MS analyses indicated that MMP-1 cleaved the α1(I)772–786 THP exclusively at the Gly-Ile bond. This is the analogous bond cleaved by MMP-1 in the native α1(I) collagen chain (59.Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 1996; 40: 399-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-1 hydrolysis of the α1(II)772–783 THP was studied next at 37 °C. RP-HPLC analysis indicated that the THP was cleaved by MMP-1 (data not shown). Sequence analysis confirmed that the cleavage site was exclusively the Gly-Leu bond (data not shown). MMP-1 hydrolysis of the α1(II)772–783 THP was also examined by MALDI-MS. The intact α1(II)772–783 THP has a mass of 9,047.2 Da. If the Gly-Leu bond is cleaved, the two products generated are the single-stranded NH2-terminal peptide (Gly-Pro-Hyp)6-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly ([M+Na]+ = 1,983.1 Da) and the branched COOH-terminal peptide (Leu-Ala-Gly-Gln"
https://openalex.org/W2001702554,"DsbG, a protein disulfide isomerase present in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, is shown to function as a molecular chaperone. Stoichiometric amounts of DsbG are sufficient to prevent the thermal aggregation of two classical chaperone substrate proteins, citrate synthase and luciferase. DsbG was also shown to interact with refolding intermediates of chemically denatured citrate synthase and prevents their aggregation in vitro. Citrate synthase reactivation experiments in the presence of DsbG suggest that DsbG binds with high affinity to early unstructured protein folding intermediates. DsbG is one of the first periplasmic proteins shown to have general chaperone activity. This ability to chaperone protein folding is likely to increase the effectiveness of DsbG as a protein disulfide isomerase.

Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). Folding catalysts accelerate rate-limiting steps in the folding pathway. The formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds is one rate-limiting step in protein folding (2.Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Cell. 1993; 74: 769-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consequently, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have developed systems that catalyze disulfide bond formation (DsbA) and isomerization (protein disulfide isomerase PDI) in vivo (2.Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Cell. 1993; 74: 769-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3.Freedman R.B. Curr.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones, the second class of folding helpers, act by preventing off pathway reactions such as misfolding and aggregation. They recognize and bind to aggregation-sensitive folding intermediates, thereby keeping their free concentration low and inhibiting aggregation (5.Fink A.L. Physiol Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). It has been found that eukaryotic PDI, a folding catalyst in the endoplasmic reticulum, also exerts chaperone activity in vitro (4.Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,6.Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1515-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7.Puig A.

This chaperone activity likely supports the isomerase activity of PDI. Disulfide bond formation and isomerization is catalyzed in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria by a battery of Dsb enzymes. All the known Dsb proteins contain the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys sequence motif, and nearly all are likely to incorporate the thioredoxin fold (9.Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies demonstrated that DsbA, a soluble periplasmic protein, donates its disulfide bond directly to folding proteins. DsbA is reoxidized by the inner membrane protein DsbB (10.Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 11.Bardwell J.C.A.

Recently, we have reported that DsbB is, in turn, reoxidized by the electron transport system using quinones as electron acceptors (14.Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because DsbA has the most oxidizing disulfide known, the oxidation of protein thiols by DsbA is very rapid, and the formation of some incorrect disulfide bonds in periplasmic proteins seems unavoidable. DsbC, a periplasmic protein that has both disulfide isomerase and chaperone activity (15.Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16.Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, a new member of the Dsb family, DsbG, has been identified (19.Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Straaten M. Missiakas D. Raina S. Darby N.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although the exact in vivo role of DsbG is controversial, recent experiments indicated that DsbG contributes to the isomerization activity in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). DsbG shows disulfide isomerase activity in vitro (19.Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that DsbG functions also as a molecular chaperone. DsbG is capable of interacting with both highly structured, late folding intermediates and unstructured, early folding intermediates of citrate synthase and luciferase. The folding helper activity of DsbG is not dependent on its active site cysteines. The expression strain BL21/pETdsbG was very generously provided by Paul Bessette and George Georgiou (University of Texas, Austin) (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The expression strain was grown at 30 °C in Luria broth medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin to midlog phase (A 600 = ∼0.5), and DsbG expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 12 h of growth at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 40 mm HEPES, and 5mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Polymyxin B sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to permeabilize the outer membrane. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the periplasmic proteins were separated from the protoplasts by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mmMES,1 pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA overnight, and DsbG was purified according to Straaten et al. (20.Straaten M. Missiakas D. Raina S. Darby N.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The purified protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration of DsbG was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 16,570m−1 cm−1 (22.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Purified DsbG was in its oxidized state as judged by fluorescence measurements (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Reduced DsbG was generated by incubating purified DsbG in 10 mm DTT (in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) for 20 min on ice. DTT was purified away from reduced DsbG by PD10 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The extent of reduction was >95% as monitored by fluorescence (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The reduced DsbG was stored at −70 °C and stable for more than 2 months. The two cysteines (Cys-126 and Cys-129) of DsbG were both mutagenized to serine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, following the protocol of Quik-Change TM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This was achieved by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the primer 5′-cgccgatccgttctCcccatatAgtaaacagttctggc-3′ and its complementary primer. The resulting plasmid carrying the mutated gene encoding a cysteine free DsbG variant was verified by DNA sequencing using T7 promoter sequencing primer. The chaperone activity of DsbG was determined using citrate synthase (CS) or luciferase as chaperone substrate proteins. To monitor the influence of DsbG on the thermal aggregation of CS or luciferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the proteins were diluted to final concentrations of 0.15 or 0.10 μm, respectively, into prewarmed 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 43 °C under constant stirring (23.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 24.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation was monitored with light scattering measurements using a Hitachi Spectrofluorometer F4500 equipped with thermostated cell holder and stirrer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm for measurements when luciferase served as a substrate protein and to 500 nm when citrate synthase served as a substrate protein. The excitation and emission slit widths were set to 2.5 nm. To test the influence of the redox state of DsbG on its chaperone activity, we monitored the thermal aggregation of luciferase also in the presence of reduced DsbG and DTT. To analyze whether DsbG influences the aggregation of refolding intermediates of chemically denatured substrate protein, CS was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 2 mmDTT for 2 h (CS concentration, 30 μm) and diluted 1:200 into 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, to initiate renaturation and aggregation. Light scattering measurements at 25 °C were performed as described above. To test the influence of DsbG on the reactivation kinetics of chemically denatured CS, CS was denatured as described (CS concentration, 15 μm) and was then diluted 100-fold into 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at room temperature to initiate the refolding reaction. Enzyme activity was determined according to Srere et al. (25.Srere P.A. Brazil H. Gonen L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S129-S134Crossref Google Scholar) using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. The influence of DsbG on the reactivation of CS was performed in the absence and presence of 0.75 mm DTT. DsbG is a soluble periplasmic protein. When overexpressed under the T7 promoter, DsbG comprises >80% of the periplasmic protein content. This good overexpression allows its straightforward purification from periplasmic extracts to >99% purity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19.Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Straaten M. Missiakas D. Raina S. Darby N.J.

To analyze the potential chaperone activity of DsbG, its influence on the thermal aggregation of two commonly used chaperone substrate proteins was tested. In the absence of molecular chaperones, both luciferase and citrate synthase rapidly and irreversibly aggregate at 43 °C, temperatures that resemble heat shock in vivo(23.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 24.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the absence of DsbG, luciferase is completely aggregated within 7 min of incubation at 43 °C as monitored by light scattering (Fig. 1). The presence of DsbG in quantities as small as 0.5:1 molar ratio decreased significantly the extent of the aggregation. A 5:1 molar ratio of DsbG to luciferase was sufficient to completely suppress the thermal aggregation of luciferase. Similar results were obtained using citrate synthase as a substrate protein except that higher concentrations of DsbG were needed to suppress the aggregation of this dimeric enzyme (Fig.2). To verify that the chaperone activity of DsbG is a specific effect, a 15-fold molar excess of bovine serum albumin was used as a control in a parallel experiment but failed to inhibit the aggregation of CS (Fig. 2).Figure 2Influence of DsbG on the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase. 30 μm CS was diluted 200-fold into prewarmed 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 43 °C in the absence (a) or presence of 1.5 μm(b) or 3.0 μm DsbG (c), respectively. To exclude unspecific protein effects, control experiments in the presence of 2.2 μm bovine serum albumin (d) were conducted. Light scattering measurements were performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that DsbG fulfills the main criteria that defines molecular chaperones (26.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar); it is capable of recognizing and binding to folding intermediates of two different thermolabile proteins, luciferase and citrate synthase, and effectively prevents their nonspecific aggregation in vitro. To further characterize the chaperone activity of DsbG, we studied its effect on the aggregation of refolding CS following complete denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride. In the absence of chaperones, CS immediately aggregates upon its dilution from the denaturant into refolding buffer (27.Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This aggregation is nucleated by high local concentration of aggregation-sensitive folding intermediates (27.Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The aggregation reaction goes to completion within the first 3 min after initiating the refolding of CS, as monitored by light scattering (Fig.3). A 20-fold molar excess of DsbG was sufficient to significantly suppress the formation of light scattering CS aggregates. This indicated that DsbG is able to recognize and bind very early, presumably unstructured folding intermediates with the goal to keep them from aggregating. To analyze how this suppression of aggregation affects the refolding yield of CS, reactivation studies using CS were performed in the absence and presence of DsbG. Surprisingly, a 5-fold molar excess of DsbG reduced the refolding yield from about 20% in the absence of DsbG to about 5% in its presence of DsbG (Fig. 4 A). To rule out the possibility that this phenomena was simply due to disulfide cross-linking between DsbG and citrate synthase molecules, which would prevent the refolding citrate synthase from assuming the native conformation, the reactivation assays were performed with reduced DsbG in the presence of 0.75 mm DTT. Reduced DsbG showed a similar ability to prevent the CS reactivation, indicating that this effect is not due to the formation of mixed disulfides between DsbG and CS folding intermediate.Figure 4Oxidized and reduced DsbG prevents the reactivation of chemically denatured citrate synthase. Denatured enzyme was diluted to a final concentration of 0.15 μminto 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5.

DsbG, used in all but the last experiments, was entirely in the oxidized form, as judged by fluorescence (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that DsbG displays molecular chaperone activity in its disulfide isomerase inactive, oxidized form. To confirm that the chaperone activity of DsbG is indeed not dependent on the redox status of its cysteines and, therefore, not connected to the isomerase activity of the enzyme, chaperone activity assays were performed with reduced DsbG in the presence of 2 mm DTT. The presence of DTT should exclude the possibility of DsbG reoxidizing during the test assay. The equilibrium constants of DTT and DsbG with glutathione are known to be −320 and −125 mV, respectively (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). From these redox potentials one can calculate the equilibrium constant between DTT and DsbG to be 0.3 × 10−6m. This implies that under assay conditions DsbG will be completely reduced. Reduced DsbG displayed the same chaperone activity as oxidized DsbG as judged by its ability to prevent the aggregation of thermally unfolding luciferase (Fig. 1) and refolding CS (Fig. 3). We therefore, conclude that the chaperone activity of DsbG is not affected by its redox state. To completely eliminate the possibility that mixed disulfide complexes between DsbG and the substrate are the source of the observed chaperone activity, we constructed a mutant of DsbG that removes both active site cysteines. This leaves DsbG entirely cysteine-free and thus unable to form mixed disulfide complexes with any substrate. The ability of this cysteine free mutant of DsbG to influence the aggregation kinetics of luciferase was compared side by side with the wild type DsbG protein in aggregation assays equivalent to those reported in Fig. 1. The curves generated by the cysteine free mutant protein were virtually superimposable with those from wild type DsbG protein. Quantification of the difference between wild type and mutant showed that the mutant had 99.8% of the activity of the wild type (data not shown). This demonstrates unequivocally that the chaperone activity we are measuring is not due to the formation of mixed disulfides between the enzyme and the substrate. Disulfide bond formation and protein folding are known to be error-prone processes. They are assisted in the cell by folding catalyst and molecular chaperones (1.Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). In the endoplasmic reticulum, a number of different protein folding catalysts and molecular chaperones are present that assist in the folding of proteins (3.Freedman R.B. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 93-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The periplasm, on the other hand, appears rather devoid of general molecular chaperones. Although several substrate specific periplasmic chaperones such as Skp and PapD have been identified (28.Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 29.Chen R. Henning U. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30.Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 1021-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), general chaperone activity has only been observed for one protein to date: the disulfide isomerase, DsbC. We decided to attempt to identify additional molecular chaperones in the periplasm. We describe here that DsbG, a new member of the Dsb family, functions as a molecular chaperone. In this report, we show that DsbG is able to significantly suppress the aggregation of two classical chaperone substrate proteins, citrate synthase and luciferase. This strongly suggests that it has the ability to recognize and bind exposed, aggregation-prone surfaces of folding intermediates to prevent their nonspecific aggregation. Eukaryotic PDI has been reported to have similar, isomerase-independent chaperone activity (31.Quan H. Fan G. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that DsbG serves as a prokaryotic counterpart of PDI. Both proteins assist in protein folding processes in oxidizing cell compartments by at least two different means: one is to catalyze disulfide exchange allowing formation of the proper disulfides, and the other is to protect the proteins in nonnative conformation from aggregation, by acting as a chaperone. We also conclude that the chaperone activity of DsbG, although general, differs in its effectiveness depending on the substrate proteins used. Comparison of the influence of DsbG on the thermal aggregation of cellular proteins revealed that the chaperone activity of DsbG is at least 10-fold more efficient with the monomeric luciferase then with dimeric CS. The substrate binding affinity of DsbG is also higher for early, presumably unstructured and monomeric folding intermediates that are generated from chemically denatured CS than for the dimeric CS unfolding intermediates that are known to be generated by thermal unfolding processes (32.Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This suggests that DsbG may have a higher affinity for monomeric, poorly structured folding intermediates. Because protein translocation requires at least partial unfolding of the polypeptide, the implied preference of DsbG for unstructured polypeptides might reflect its affinity for extending polypeptide chains that are newly translocated into the periplasm. DsbG prevented CS molecules from reactivation, suggesting that it forms a rather stable complex with the refolding intermediates of CS. Addition of DTT or removal of all cysteine residues in DsbG by mutagenesis did not influence this interaction, indicating that intermolecular disulfide bond formation is not involved in the chaperone activity of DsbG. The mechanism by which DsbG releases its substrate proteins is still under investigation. It is unlikely to involve ATP because ATP has not been detected in the periplasm and DsbG does not show any consensus motif indicative of an ATP binding motif. The chaperone activity of DsbG is reminiscent of the chaperone activity recently reported for DsbC (18.Chen J. Song J. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). DsbC and DsbG are the most homologous proteins among the Dsb family with 28% sequence identity and 56% sequence similarity (19.Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both proteins are dimeric, form an unstable disulfide bond, and are maintained in the reduced state via the action of DsbD (21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). They are both predicted to exhibit the thioredoxin fold and have disulfide isomerase activity (19.Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our finding that DsbG also works as a general folding helper protein in vitro doubles the number of known chaperones with wide substrate specificity that are known to exist in the periplasm of E. coli. We are very grateful to Drs. Paul Bessette and George Georgiou for providing us with the DsbG overexpressing strain."

Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Since the initial discovery of the mevalonate pathway, it was widely accepted that isopentenyl diphosphate, the fundamental unit in terpenoid biosynthesis, was only formed through the ubiquitous mevalonate pathway. However, it has been disclosed that many organisms, including several bacteria, green algae, and the chloroplasts of higher plants, use an alternative mevalonate-independent pathway (nonmevalonate pathway) for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate (2.Rohmer M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 45-67Crossref Google Scholar). Because the nonmevalonate pathway is absent from animals, the enzymes involved in the pathway are considered to be good targets for the screening of antimicrobials. The initial step of this pathway is the formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)1 by the condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate-dependent DXP synthase (Fig.1). The dxs gene homologs encoding the enzyme have been cloned from Escherichia coli(3.Sprenger G.A. Schorken U. Wiegert T. Grolle S. Graaf A.A. Taylor S.V. Begley T.P. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. Proc.

In the second step, the intramolecular rearrangement of DXP was assumed to give a hypothetical rearrangement product, 2-C-methylerythrose 4-phosphate, which was then converted to 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) by an unspecified reduction process (8.Duvold T.

We have succeeded in the first cloning and overexpression of the gene (dxr, formerlyyaeM) encoding the DXP reductoisomerase from E. coli and have shown that the recombinant enzyme catalyzed the formation of MEP from DXP in a single step in the presence of both NADPH and a divalent cation, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, or Co2+ (10.Kuzuyama T.

Recently, it has been reported that fosmidomycin and its derivative inhibited DXP reductoisomerase from Plasmodium falciparumand that these inhibitors cured mice infected with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium vinckei. Thus, DXP reductoisomerase has been shown to represent an effective target for the chemotherapy of malaria (17.Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I.

For a more effective drug design, it is important to identify the amino acid residues essential for catalyzing this reaction. We initially assumed the possibility that MEP might be synthesized from DXP by the same reaction mechanism as that by the ketol-acid reductoisomerase (EC1.1.1.86), which is involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids with a branched chain, such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine (18.Rane M.J. Calvo K.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). No significant similarity, however, was found between the total amino acid sequences of both reductoisomerases except for the NADPH binding motif (11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H.

In this study, we describe the characterization of the DXP reductoisomerase from E. coli and the first identification of its catalytic residues by analyzing the mutant DXP reductoisomerases, which were constructed from E. coli dxr-deficient mutants induced byN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and by site-directed mutagenesis. Materials from commercial sources included NADPH (Sigma), nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen), and high and low molecular weight electrophoresis calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. The expression and purification of the recombinant DXP reductoisomerase were done as already described (10.Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The standard assay system consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MnCl2, 0.3 mm NADPH, and 0.3 mm enzymatically synthesized DXP (10.Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme solution to the complete assay mixture. The oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm with a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad) adjusted at 37 °C. One unit of the DXP reductoisomerase activity is defined as the amount of the enzyme that causes oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH per min at 37 °C. The wild-type enzyme (1.2 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with diethyl pyrocarbonate (600 μm) in 500 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Fifty-μl aliquots were removed at 15-min intervals and assayed for enzyme activity. Restoration of the activity by hydroxylamine was investigated as follows. The wild-type enzyme was incubated at 25 °C with diethyl pyrocarbonate (600 μm) in 500 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After 30 min of incubation, hydroxylamine (final concentration, 1 m) was added to the enzyme solution. Fifty μl aliquots were then removed at 15-min intervals and assayed for activity. Three E. coli DXP reductoisomerase (dxr)-deficient mutants, ME1–ME3, were isolated and reported (11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Seven mutants, ME4–ME10, which showed the same phenotype as that of ME1, were further isolated by a previously described method (11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNAs from these 10dxr-deficient mutants were extracted as described by Maniatis and co-workers (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). On the basis of the nucleotide sequences just upstream and downstream of the dxr gene, two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-TGTCTCAACTCTGGATGTTTC-3′ (upstream of the initiation codon in the dxr gene) and 5′-CTCTCTGTAGCCGGATTATCC-3′ (downstream of the termination codon in thedxr gene), were synthesized (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These primers were then used with the total DNA from the 10 mutants to amplify each mutant dxr gene by using Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the protocol of the supplier. Each polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Strain JM109 (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was used as a recipient during this transformation. Clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing as described below. On the basis of the entire nucleotide sequence of thedxr gene, two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GGGGGATCCAAGCAACTCACCATTCTGGGC-3′ (5′ of thedxr gene) and 5′-GGGGGATCCGCTTGCGAGACGCATCACCTC-3′ (3′ of thedxr gene), including the BamHI restriction sites (underlined) were synthesized (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These primers were used with the total DNA from ME3 and ME9 to amplify each mutant dxr gene. Each polymerase chain reaction fragment was cleaved with BamHI and cloned into pUC118 (Takara Shuzo). Strain JM109 was used as the recipient during this transformation. Clones were analyzed for each correct insert by DNA sequencing as described below. Each correct fragment was cloned into the multicloning site, BamHI, of the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen), which produces the histidine-tagged protein, to give pQEDXR3 and pQEDXR9 for the mutant enzymes E232K and G14D, respectively. The expression and purification of the mutant enzymes were done using the identical procedure for that of the wild-type enzyme (10.Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with an automated sequencer (model 4000L, Li-cor) and the protocol of the supplier. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8–25% gels or native PAGE on 8–25% gels with the PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All in vitro mutations were generated using a Takara polymerase chain reaction in vitro mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo). The sequences of the mutagenic primers are as follows: H153Q, 5′-GCGTTTTGTTCGCTATCGAC-3′; H209Q, 5′-TTCGGTTGACGGCAGGCTTG-3′; and H257Q, 5′-TGATTCAGTCAATGGTGCGC-3′ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The underlined letters represent the substituted nucleotides. Each mutant gene was sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of the polymerase chain reaction-generated mutations. Construction of the plasmid for overexpression of these mutant dxr genes was done as already described. E. coli DXP reductoisomerase appeared to have a broad pH optimum, with more than 75% of its maximum activity observed between pH 7.0 and 8.5 in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer. The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity was investigated over a range of 16–80 °C. The maximum activity was observed at 40–60 °C, and 70% of the maximum activity was obtained even at 80 °C (Fig. 2). The activation energy was estimated to be 75 kJ/mol based on an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 2,inset). The purified enzyme was not heat stable above 50 °C. For example, heating the enzyme at 55 or 60 °C for 10 min led to 70 or 100% losses in the activity, respectively. On the other hand, the enzyme retained more than 90% of the activity after storage at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) for 1 month. When 1-deoxyxylulose (DX) in place of DXP was added to the reaction mixture over a concentration range of 0.05–2 mm, the oxidation of NADPH was not observed. Furthermore, the reaction of DXP reductoisomerase was not inhibited by the addition of 0.05–2 mm DX (data not shown). Kinetic parameters for DXP reductoisomerase were determined in the presence of each divalent cation (Mn2+, Mg2+, or Co2+), as summarized in TableI. In each case, the addition of 1 mm divalent cation showed the highest enzyme activity. The DXP reductoisomerase yielded the lowest K m value for the substrate DXP when assayed in the reaction mixture containing Co2+. On the other hand, the lowest K mvalue for NADPH was calculated in the presence of Mn2+. Because the highest k cat value was also obtained in the assay mixture containing Mn2+, an additional standard assay for the mutant enzymes was carried out in the reaction mixture with 1 mm MnCl2.Table IKinetic parameters for the wild-type and the mutant DXP reductoisomerasesEnzymeDivalent cation (1 mm)K mk catk cat/K mfor DXPDXPNADPHμm10 2 × min −110 2 × min −1μm −1Wild-typeMnCl22507.4590024MgCl29918130013CoCl2608.8310051MutantE231KMnCl227018140.053H153QMnCl28807.05900.67H209QMnCl21900188.60.0046H257QMnCl248001604.50.00090 Open table in a new tab We had isolated the E. coli dxr-deficient mutants prepared byN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment.

S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The deficiency could be a result of the amino acid substitutions caused by base substitution mutations introduced by this treatment. Because kinetic characterization of such mutant enzymes provides important information on the amino acid residues for catalysis, we decided to determine the mutational points of thedxr-deficient mutants. A DNA sequencing analysis of thedxr genes from the 10 dxr-deficient mutants revealed base substitution mutations at four points: two nonsense mutations (C472 to T472 and C757 to T757) and two amino acid substitutions (G41 to A41 and G691 to A691, corresponding to Gly14 to Asp14 and Glu231 to Lys231, respectively). E. coli DXP reductoisomerase has eight histidine residues per subunit. Of these histidine residues, His153, His209, and His257 are conserved among the DXP reductoisomerases from six genera of bacteria, two plants (23.Schwender J. Muller C. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24.Lange B.M. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a malaria parasite P. falciparum (17.Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). A reaction of the wild-type enzyme with diethyl pyrocarbonate was accompanied by a time-dependent loss in activity. The subsequent addition of hydroxylamine restored approximately 50% of the initial activity (data not shown). This result suggested involvement of the histidine residue(s) in the catalytic site. To examine which histidine residues (of His153, His209, and His257) in the DXP reductoisomerase are essential for the activity, we used site-directed mutagenesis in the E. coli enzyme. The codon for each histidine was altered to encode glutamine, a residue that has an amide nitrogen that can be isosteric with the imidazole nitrogen of histidine but that can serve neither as an acid nor as a base. The mutant enzymes, H153Q, H209Q, and H257Q, were then overexpressed as histidine-tagged proteins. They were obtained as soluble proteins and purified with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin almost to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4). As summarized in Table I, the kinetic parameters for the mutant DXP reductoisomerases were determined in the presence of MnCl2. To compare the kinetic parameters, the two dxr-deficient mutant enzymes, G14D and E231K, were overexpressed in E. coli as the histidine-tagged proteins. Although it was highly expressed, G14D was obtained as an insoluble product. E231K was overexpressed as a soluble enzyme and purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Although the mutant enzyme E231K had normal K m values for DXP and NADPH of 270 and 18 μm, respectively, the enzyme yielded a catalytic rate constant (k cat) of 1.4 × 103 min−1, representing a decrease of this value to 450-fold that of the wild-type. H153Q and H209Q yielded wild-typeK m values for NADPH (Table I). However, these mutant enzymes gave 3.5- and 7.6-fold the wild-type K mvalue for DXP, respectively. H257Q yielded 20-fold the wild-typeK m values for DXP and NADPH.k cat and the specificity constants (k cat/K m) of these three mutant enzymes were much lower than those of the wild-type enzyme, indicating the importance of His153, His209, and His257. The enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase simultaneously catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement and reduction of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate to yield 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (Fig. 1). Although DXP reductoisomerase has so far been cloned from E. coli, plants (23.Schwender J. Muller C. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24.Lange B.M. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a malaria parasite (17.Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), its kinetic characterization has not fully been carried out. We describe here the biochemical characterization of the novel enzyme that constitutes the nonmevalonate pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis. We have previously demonstrated that DXP reductoisomerase uses only NADPH as a cofactor (10.Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the enzyme also requires a divalent cation such as Mn2+, Mg2+, or Co2+ (10.Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Recently, Proteauet al. (25.Proteau P.J. Woo Y. Williamson R.T. Phaosiri C. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Radykewicz et al. (26.Radykewicz T. Rohdich F. Wungsintaweekul J. Herz S. Kis K. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Zenk M.H. Arigoni D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) independently reported that the E. coli enzyme belonged to a class B dehydrogenase. In this study, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme in the presence of each divalent cation were determined. The highest k cat value was obtained when Mn2+ was added to the reaction mixtures. The highest specificity constant (k cat /K m) was obtained when Co2+ was added. In terms of the specificity constant, it is speculated that Co2+ is an in vivo relevant cation. In addition, the enzyme activity in the presence of 0.1 mm of each cation was reduced to approximately 30% of the maximum activity obtained in the presence of a 1 mmconcentration of each cation (data not shown), suggesting that the enzyme activity is significantly affected by the in vivoconcentration of each cation. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of producing 2-C-methylerythritol from DX using DXP reductoisomerase. When DX was used as the substrate in place of DXP, the oxidation of NADPH was not observed under the described conditions. This indicates that the DXP reductoisomerase cannot use DX as a substrate. We isolated several E. coli dxr-deficient mutants, which absolutely required for 2-C-methylerythritol, a free alcohol of MEP, for growth and survival (11.Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Thus, it is evident that the analyses of these mutants provide important information on critical amino acid residues in catalysis and/or structural integrity. DNA sequencing analysis revealed the point mutations of the amino acids, Gly14 to Asp14 and from Glu231 to Lys231 in the E. coli dxr-deficient mutants. These amino acid residues, Gly and Glu, were found in all the DXP reductoisomerase sequences from nine organisms (Fig. 3). In order to elucidate the enzymatic properties, we overexpressed the mutant enzymes G14D and E231K. The expression in E. coli of the mutant gene E231K yielded a high level of soluble protein, which was subsequently purified to homogeneity and characterized. E231K had less than a 0.24% wild-type k cat value, although the mutant enzyme had wild-type K m values for DXP and NADPH. These results strongly suggest that Glu231 of the E. coli DXP reductoisomerase plays an important role(s) in the conversion of DXP to the reaction product, MEP, not only in vitro but also in vivo. Because thedxr-deficient mutant with Lys231 requires 2-C-methylerythritol, a free alcohol of MEP, for growth, it is evident that the E231K enzyme does not in fact produce enough MEP for the growth. On the other hand, the expression in E. coliof the mutant gene G14D yielded an insoluble protein. Although glycine residue 14 is speculated to be a part of the NADPH binding motif, the residue may also contribute to maintaining the secondary or tertiary structure of the enzyme. An amino acid sequence comparison of the DXP reductoisomerase fromE. coli with those from bacteria and plants revealed three conserved histidine residues, His153, His209, and His257 (Fig. 3). Diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment inactivated the wild-type enzyme, and subsequent hydroxylamine treatment restored the activity of the diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated enzyme. Thus, we employed site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli DXP reductoisomerase to identify which histidine residues function during catalysis. The expression in E. coli of the mutant genes H153Q, H209Q, and H257Q yielded soluble proteins, which were subsequently purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail. H209Q and H257Q showed drastic decreases to 5200- and 27,000-fold the wild-type k cat/K m value, respectively. Furthermore, thek cat/K m values of H209Q and H257Q are much lower than that of E231K, which is obtained from adxr-deficient mutant. Thus, it is suggested that H209Q and H257Q have no enzymatic function in vivo. Moreover, H153Q showed a decrease to 36-fold the wild-typek cat/K m value, suggesting that His153 also functions during catalysis. We consider it unlikely that the low k cat values of the mutant enzymes, E231K, H153Q, and H209Q, are a consequence of the altered structural integrity, because these mutant enzymes exhibited K m values for NADPH not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Although H257Q was 20-fold the wild-type K m value, the mutant enzyme showed the same mobility in the native PAGE as did the wild-type enzyme (data not shown), suggesting that the mutant did not alter the quaternary structure. Because the DXP reductoisomerase is a new target for antimicrobials (12.Kuzuyama T. Shimizu T. Takahashi S. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 7913-7916Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar), herbicides (18.Rane M.J. Calvo K.C. Arch. Biochem.

Although the crystal structure analysis of the DXP reductoisomerase is indispensable to determining the functional residues in detail, our study provides important information for the crystal structure analysis and the opportunity for modeling enzyme-drug interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2004248502,"Abstract Regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the gonadotrope cell line LβT2 was investigated. Treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of ERK by GnRHa occurred within 5 min, and declined thereafter, whereas activation of JNK by GnRHa occurred with a different time frame, i.e. it was detectable at 5 min, reached a plateau at 30 min, and declined thereafter. GnRHa-induced ERK activation was dependent on protein kinase C or extracellular and intracellular Ca2+, whereas GnRHa-induced JNK activation was not dependent on protein kinase C or on extracellular or intracellular Ca2+. To determine whether a mitogen-activated protein kinase family cascade regulates rat luteinizing hormone β (LHβ) promoter activity, we transfected the rat LHβ (−156 to +7)-luciferase construct into LβT2 cells. GnRH activated the rat LHβ promoter activity in a time-dependent manner. Neither treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, nor cotransfection with a catalytically inactive form of a mitogen-activated protein kinase construct inhibited the induction of the rat LHβ promoter by GnRH. Furthermore, cotransfection with a dominant negative Ets had no effect on the response of the rat LHβ promoter to GnRH. On the other hand, cotransfection with either dominant negative JNK or dominant negative c-Jun significantly inhibited the induction of the rat LHβ promoter by GnRH. In addition, GnRH did not induce either the rat LHβ promoter activity in LβT2 cells transfected stably with dominant negative c-Jun. These results suggest that GnRHa differentially activates ERK and JNK, and a JNK cascade is necessary to elicit the rat LHβ promoter activity in a c-Jun-dependent mechanism in LβT2 cells."

Previous investigations have shown contradictory results regarding whether TNFα induces cytotoxicity through necrosis or apoptosis (17.Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that TNFα induces necrosis in L929 cells, although apoptosis-like features have also been observed (18.Vercammen D. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W.

Regardless of the mode of cell death, however, it has been shown that TNFα-induced cytotoxicity of L929 cells is mediated by mitochondrial formation of ROS (20.Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K.

Furthermore, substantial evidence in other systems implicates mitochondria and mitochondrial cytochromec release in both apoptosis and necrosis (27.Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev.

As part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome ctransports electrons from the b-c 1 complex (complex III) to cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Consequently, cytochrome c release upon a cell death-inducing stimulus may block the normal flow of electrons and may promote the increased steady-state reduction of the respiratory components upstream of cytochrome c, such as theb-c 1 complex. Increased steady-state reduction of components of complex III (e.g. cytochrome b) may then promote free radical generation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of TNFα in the presence of CHX on cytochrome c release and the redox state of mitochondrial cytochromes and the potential role of the redox state in ROS generation and TNFα-induced cytotoxicity. We show that TNFα treatment promoted mitochondrial cytochromec release, increased the steady-state reduction of cytochrome b, and generated elevated amounts of ROS. We also demonstrate that blocking cytochrome b with antimycin A abrogated ROS generation and arrested the cytotoxic response. Finally, we show that mitochondria underwent a sequence of morphological changes that preceded cell death. Recombinant human TNFα was purchased from Genzyme Co. (Cambridge, MA).

Potassium cyanide (KCN) was supplied by Ferosa (Barcelona, Spain). l-Glutamine, penicillin, phosphate-buffered saline, and streptomycin were from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Sera-Lab (Sussex, United Kingdom). Cells from the murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. During the process of cell death, L929 cells detach from the flask and float in the medium. In this study, we exploited this phenomenon as an easy way to separate attached/living cells and floating/dead cells. Thus, after various incubation times, the medium containing the nonadherent cells was removed, and the cells were collected. The remaining monolayer of attached cells was harvested by trypsinization. Viability of floating and attached cells was determined by PI staining and microscopic visualization. Only samples of attached cells with >85% of viable cells were used for further studies. The floating cell population was 100% PI-positive. Cytotoxicity was measured using lactate dehydrogenase leakage from damaged cells and was expressed as a percentage of total cellular lactate dehydrogenase activity, as described by Decker and Lohmann-Matthes (30.Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a commercial assay kit (Cromatest, Laboratorios Knickerbocker, S. A. E., Barcelona, Spain). DNA fragmentation was measured by quantifying hypoploid nuclei after DNA staining with PI. L929 cells were treated with TNFα, CHX, or a combination of TNFα/CHX for 12 h. Both attached and floating cells were harvested and fixed with 70% cold ethanol at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the fixed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PI staining solution (5 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. Stained nuclei were analyzed on the FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA). Hypoploid cells appeared as a sub-G1 peak. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular generation of ROS was performed using dihydrorhodamine 123 as probe (21.Shoji Y. Uedono Y. Ishikura H. Takeyama N. Tanaka T. Immunology. 1995; 84: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in six-well plates, and at confluence (1 × 106cells/well) they were treated with TNFα (25 ng/ml), CHX (0.1 mmol/liter), or a combination of TNFα/CHX. After 6 h of incubation, dihydrorhodamine 123 (1 μm) was added and the incubation was prolonged for an additional 30 min. The cells were harvested, washed, centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium, and analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 530 nm). Rhodamine 123 fluorescence was analyzed in viable cells. To measure intracellular hydroperoxide production, we determined the conversion by endogenous esterases of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate to membrane-impermeant 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, which reacts with hydroperoxides to form highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (31.Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured as above in the presence of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (1 μg/ml). After 6 h, the cells were washed, resuspended in RPMI medium, and analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation, 488 nm; fluorescent detection between 515 and 565 nm). DCF fluorescence was analyzed in viable cells only. Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) as described by Ohkawa et al. (32.Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23531) Google Scholar). TBARS were measured fluorometrically (excitation, 515 nm; emission, 553 nm) using malondialdehyde and tetramethoxypropane standards. Cellular glutathione was measured using the Eady et al. modification (33.Eady J.J. Orta T. Dennis M.F. Stratford M.R. Peacock J.H. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of Tietze's assay (34.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with TNFα, CHX or the combination TNFα/CHX for 8 h. At this time, the attached cells were harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in respiration buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm K+Hepes, 5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) at a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. One-half ml of the suspension was injected into a chamber containing 3.5 ml of air-saturated respiration buffer and 1 mm ADP at 37 °C. The cells were permeabilized with digitonin (final concentration 0.005%), and substrates and inhibitors were added in the following order and final concentrations: antimycin A, 50 nm; ascorbate, 1 mm; tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), 0.4 mm. Antimycin A was used to inhibit autologous mitochondrial electron transport. TMPD is an electron donor that reduces cytochrome c nonenzymatically. Therefore, when TMPD is used as a substrate, changes in O2 uptake rates reflect changes in cytochrome c oxidase activity. Ascorbate was used to reduce TMPD. Oxygen concentration was calibrated with air-saturated buffer, assuming 390 ng atoms of oxygen/ml of buffer. Rates of potassium cyanide-sensitive oxygen consumption are expressed as ng atoms of oxygen/min/1 × 107 cells. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described (36.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Potential mitochondrial contamination of the cytosol was monitored by Western blotting for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Twenty-five μg of cytosolic proteins were separated on a 15% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel. After protein transfer, the membrane was incubated with various primary antibodies. Anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (clone 7H8.2C12; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was diluted 1:1000; anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (clone 6C5; Research Diagnostic, Inc., Flanders, NJ) was diluted 1:5000; anti-CPP32 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was diluted 1:1000; and anti-PARP polyclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted 1:1000. The membrane was then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000 dilution. The specific protein complexes were identified using the “Supersignal” substrate chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). L929 cells were cultured on 1-mm glass coverslips and treated with TNFα/CHX for 8 h. Both attached and floating cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) and PI (5 μg/ml) and analyzed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). The redox state of mitochondrial cytochromes was studied by absorption spectroscopy as described by Chance (37.Chance B. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 273-329Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cultures of confluent L929 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 in the absence (control) or presence of 25 ng/ml TNFα and 0.1 mmol/liter CHX for 2, 3, 4, and 8 h. After the indicated times, floating cells were removed, and attached cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/albumin (0.1%) at a final concentration of 30 × 106 cells/ml. Control cells were placed into the reference cuvette, and TNFα/CHX-treated cells were placed into the sample cuvette. The difference absorption spectra were recorded on an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL) at room temperature and with continuous stirring. The spectra were obtained in a path length of 1 cm with a scan speed of 2 nm/s and a slit width of 2 nm. L929 cells were treated with 25 ng/ml of TNFα and 0.1 mmol/liter CHX for 0, 3, 6, and 8 h. The growth medium and floating cells were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced by Karnofsky's reagent. The floating cells were centrifuged, resuspended in Karnofsky's reagent, and subjected separately to the same protocol. After fixation for 30 min at room temperature, attached cells were scraped off the flasks, washed in 0.1 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 10 min. Cells were dehydrated with rising concentrations of ethanol, and, after passage through propylene oxide, the blocks were embedded in Epon 812 according to standard technique (38.Robinson G. Bancroft J.D. Stevens A. Electron Microscopy. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1977: 326-370Google Scholar). Semithin, 1-μm cross-sections were stained with toluidine blue. Representative samples of the cells were chosen, and ultrathin 60–90-nm cross-sections were cut and mounted on bare copper grids. The staining was done with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The samples were examined in a Hitachi HU-12A and in a JOEL-100SX microscope. An independent, trained, unbiased observer evaluated all cells in one section from each sample. The various mitochondrial conformations were classified into four different categories, and the number of cells with each conformation was counted. The four categories were defined according to the following criteria: 1) orthodox configuration, mitochondria with normal matrix density and regularly spaced and oriented cristae; 2) hyperdense configuration, cristae with increased density and normal orientation and increased matrix density; 3) ultracondensed configuration and distortion of cristae, mitochondria with engrossed cristae that have lost their parallel configuration, increased volume in the outer and intracristae compartments, decreased matrix volume, and increased matrix density; and 4) lytic configuration, swollen mitochondria with hydropic matrix, loss of cristae and often rupture of the outer membrane. All results are expressed as means ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. The unpaired Student'st test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups, accepting p < 0.05 as the level of significance. In order to address the modality of cell death induced by TNFα/CHX treatment, several morphological and biochemical tests were performed. An increased number of cells showing the typical apoptotic feature of plasma membrane blebbing was detected by light microscopy (Fig.1 A). Flow cytometric analysis showed a 10-fold increase in the sub-G1 population in TNFα/CHX-treated cells, suggesting the presence of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C), and Western blot analysis of cellular extracts showed activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in the floating/dead population (Fig. 1 D). These results suggested that cells die by apoptosis. To confirm that TNFα/CHX-treated cells underwent classical apoptosis, we examined nuclear morphology and plasma membrane integrity simultaneously by Hoechst and PI double staining. The presence of condensed chromatin without plasma membrane disruption is a main feature of classical apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, TNFα/CHX treatment of L929 cells resulted in an increased number of cells with condensed nuclei. However, all condensed nuclei were also PI-positive, indicating that plasma membrane disruption was an early event in this model of cell death. Even when examined at different time points, none of the cells showed the typical blue condensed nuclei in the absence of plasma membrane disruption. Together, these observations suggested that TNFα/CHX-treated L929 cells underwent a particular form of cell death, which was characterized by events common to both the apoptotic (DNA fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing, caspase activation) and the necrotic pathways (early plasma membrane disruption). Intracellular generation of ROS by cultured L929 cells in response to TNFα treatment was measured by flow cytometry using the dihydrorhodamine 123 probe. As shown in Fig.2 A, treatment of cells with 25 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h resulted in a significantly higher rhodamine 123 fluorescence, indicating increased ROS generation. This effect was substantially enhanced in cells treated with TNFα in the presence of 0.1 mmol/liter CHX (TNFα/CHX), whereas increased ROS formation by CHX alone was not significant. Increased ROS formation induced by TNFα/CHX treatment was prevented by co-incubation of cells with 50 μm α-tocopherol, a well established antioxidant. The fluorescent probe DCF was used to measure intracellular hydroperoxide formation. Treatment of L929 cells with 25 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h led to increased intracellular hydroperoxide formation (Fig. 2 B). Again, this increase was significantly higher in cells treated with TNFα/CHX, whereas increased hydroperoxide formation by CHX alone was not significant. Next, we also assessed whether these treatments induced lipid peroxidation by measuring TBARS. Incubation of cells with TNFα/CHX for 6 h increased the production of TBARS 2.78 ± 0.13-fold (p < 0.001), which was prevented by co-incubation with 50 μm α-tocopherol (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of cells with TNFα alone also enhanced TBARS production significantly (p < 0.01), although the increase was less marked than with the combination treatment. CHX alone again did not significantly change the production of TBARS. To investigate the antioxidant reserves under TNFα/CHX treatment, we analyzed the levels of glutathione. Although incubation of cells with TNFα or CHX alone for 6 h resulted in a significant decrease in total cellular glutathione, this effect was again intensified by treating cells with TNFα/CHX (p < 0.001) (Fig.2 E). Finally, we showed that both TNFα/CHX-induced cytolysis (Fig.2 D) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C) were prevented by the antioxidant α-tocopherol. Recently, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c has been proposed as a critical event in both apoptosis and necrosis. Cytochrome c is the mobile redox protein that shuttles electrons from complex III to complex IV. Therefore, its release and exclusion from the electron transport chain can result in dysfunction of the normal electron flow. As a consequence, electrons are retained upstream of cytochrome cand can alter the steady-state reduction of mitochondrial cytochromes. The accumulation of reducing equivalents in some components of the respiratory chain might promote free radical generation. Therefore, to examine a possible association between mitochondrial cytochromec release and the steady-state reduction of mitochondrial cytochromes, both events were monitored simultaneously over several hours after TNFα/CHX treatment. To study cytochrome c release, cytosolic extracts were prepared at various times after the addition of TNFα/CHX under conditions that kept mitochondria intact, and cytosolic and mitochondrial cytochrome c protein levels were measured by immunoblot analysis. Cytochrome c accumulated in the cytosol within 2 h of treatment with TNFα/CHX and reached maximum levels at 8 h (Figs. 3 A and7 B). Concomitantly, cytochrome c levels in mitochondria from TNFα/CHX-treated cells were substantially reduced (Fig. 3 B). As a consequence of cytochrome crelease and reduced cytochrome c levels in mitochondria, one might expect an inactivation of cytochrome coxidase-dependent oxygen uptake when using ascorbate/TMPD as electron donor. As shown in Fig. 3 C, TNFα/CHX treatment did indeed result in a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity. Thus, the loss of cytochrome c appears to be associated with an interruption of normal electron flow that could divert electrons to the generation of ROS. Neither cytochromec release nor cytochrome c oxidase inactivation was observed in cells treated with TNFα or CHX alone (Fig. 3,B and C).Figure 7Effect of antimycin A and α-tocopherol on TNFα/CHX-induced mitochondrial cytochromec release. A, Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts from cells treated for 8 h with TNFα/CHX, TNFα/CHX with 30 μg/ml antimycin A (AA), or 50 μm α-tocopherol (Tph) added at 3 h.

As shown in Fig.1 D, there was neither activation of caspase-3 nor PARP cleavage in the attached population, whereas clear activation was detected in the floating population. These data suggested that cytochrome c release was an early event, preceding cell death by several hours. In order to study the effect of cytochrome c release on the redox state of the mitochondrial cytochromes, difference absorption spectra between control cells and cells treated with 25 ng/ml TNFα and 0.1 mm CHX were performed. Fig.4 shows typical difference spectra between control cells and cells treated for different times with TNFα/CHX. After 2 h of incubation, two small peaks located at 428 and 438 nm and two valleys at 550 and 605 nm were observed, which became dramatically more prominent at 3 h. At this time, the difference spectrum showed two large peaks at 428 and 438 nm and two deep valleys at 420 and 445 nm of the Soret region. Likewise, a prominent shoulder appeared at 558–560 nm and two valleys appeared at 550 and 605 nm of the α region of the spectrum. A similar pattern was also observed at 4 and 8 h, although there was a gradual disappearance of the peak at 428 nm, probably due to the greater predominance of the peak at 438 nm. These results indicate that cytochrome b is reduced, while cytochromescc 1 and aa 3 are oxidized. Together these observations suggest that cytochrome crelease is associated with and possibly precedes the accumulation of reducing equivalents at the cytochrome b level. Previously, we have shown that TNFα/CHX treatment induced a marked increase in ROS generation, which was abolished or strongly reduced by the simultaneous addition of mitochondrial inhibitors (39.Sánchez-Alcázar J.A. Ruiz-Cabello J. Hernández-Muñoz I. Pobre P.S. de la Torre P. Siles-Rivas E. Garcı́a I. Kaplan O. Muñoz-Yagüe M.T. Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30167-30177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the mitochondrial electron transport chain was the likely source of ROS. In order to investigate which component of the mitochondrial respiration chain was responsible for ROS production, we used a different strategy in the present study. Various inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were added to the cells only after 3 h of incubation with TNFα/CHX when cytochrome b had already become reduced. Under these conditions, only antimycin A caused a marked decrease in the ROS generation induced by TNFα/CHX treatment (Table I). Since antimycin A specifically binds to cytochrome b, this observation strongly suggested that this cytochrome may be involved in ROS formation. The e"

Allergy to animals is distinguishable by its intensity and the possibility of sensitization by a limited contact with danders or hair. The animals responsible for allergy are obviously familiar domestic cats and dogs, but also the horse, which is often incriminated. Five main horse allergens have been isolated and purified (1.Dandeu J.P. Rabillon J. Divanovic A. Carmi-Leroy A. David B. J.

Among these, the Equ c 1 protein (molecular mass 21.5 kDa, 187 amino acids, pI = 4.5) has been defined as a major allergen, because it induces an IgE-mediated type I allergic reaction in a majority of the patients allergic to horses. Equ c 1 belongs to the lipocalin family (3.Gregoire C. Rosinski-Chupin I. Rabillon J. Alzari P.M. David B. Dandeu J.P. J. Biol.

Although members of this family display low sequence similarity (often lower than 20% of amino acid identities), all share a conserved folding pattern, an 8-stranded β-barrel flanked by an α-helix at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 880-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, rSLG Equ c 1 was expressed as a His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli, purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography, treated with factor Xa to excise the His tag, and concentrated to 6.0 mg/ml for crystallization. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals, space group P41212, were grown at 291 K using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique (4.Gregoire C. Tavares G.A. Lorenzo H.K. Dandeu J.P. David B. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 880-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A first diffraction data set (with an overall R-merge value of 8.9%) was collected at 2.9 Å resolution from a flash-frozen (110 K) crystal using synchrotron radiation at EMBL/DESY (Hamburg). Subsequently, a second data set was recorded at room temperature to a higher (2.3 Å) resolution using the X31 beamline at EMBL/DESY (λ = 1.2 Å) from a capillary-mounted crystal (the statistics of data collection are shown in Table I). All diffraction data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The unit cell parameters measured at room temperature (a = b = 84.04 Å, c = 58.48 Å) are slightly different from those found for the frozen crystal (a = b = 84.36 Å,c = 54.89 Å). In particular, the significant shrinkage (8%) of the c parameter upon flash freezing of the crystal could be related with the loss of diffracting power of the crystal at low temperature.Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statistics for the Equ c 1 structureData collection Number of measured reflections43339 Number of unique reflections 9166 Resolution20–2.3 Å (2.4–2.3 Å) Completeness94.4% (97.7%) R-merge8.2% (43.1%) Percentage of refs with 1 > 2ς(I)88.5% (69.6%)Refinement Resolution range15–2.3 Å (2.4–2.3 Å) Number of reflections9128 (1119) R-factor19.5% (21.0%) Free R-factor25.2% (33.1%) Root mean square (bond lengths)0.014 Å Root mean square (bond angle distances)0.037 Å Protein atoms1317 Water molecules 79 Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by molecular replacement methods using the program AMoRe (21.Navaza J.

Phillips S.E. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B. North A.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which shares 49% of sequence identity with Equ c 1 (Fig. 1), was used as the search model. A clear solution was obtained using the low temperature data set, with a correlation coefficient of 0.39 and a crystallographic R-factor of 48.7%. Initial rigid body refinement was carried out with the program XPLOR (22.Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), followed by 31 cycles using the slow cool protocol of XPLOR for all reflections with F > 3ς(F) between 10 and 2.9 Å resolution. At this stage (R-factor = 27.5%, free R-factor = 37.9%), the L3 loop involving residues 82–86 and the C-terminal end of the protein (beyond the long α-helix) were not visible in the electron density map. The current model was then positioned in the room temperature unit cell by molecular replacement, and further crystallographic refinement was carried out against the 2.3 Å data set obtained at room temperature using the maximum likelihood refinement program REFMAC (23.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (24.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). At each stage of the refinement, errors in the model were detected by examination of (Fo -Fc) and (2Fo -Fc) maps with the program O (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Toward the end of the refinement the whole polypeptide chain could be traced unambiguously in the electron density map, and 79 water molecules were added to the protein model using the program ARP (26.Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Refinement converged to a final R-factor of 19.5% (freeR-factor = 25.2%) for intensities between 15 and 2.3 Å (Table I). The average real space correlation coefficient for all main chain atoms of the final model is 0.95 (0.89 for side-chain atoms). The atomic coordinates of Equ c 1 have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (code 1EW3). Four point mutants of rSLG Equ c 1 (R26S, E82A, K129S, and E148A) were produced by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis using two common primers derived from the sequence of the pGEX plasmid (P5′rac, 5′-GGCAAGCCACGTTTGGTG-3′ and P3′rac, 5′-CCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTC-3′) and one mutagenic primer for each single mutant (5′-ATCGAAGTTGCTTATCGCAACATC-3′ for R26S, 5′-TCAGTACACGCTCCATTTACC-3′ for E82A, 5′-GGAATGGTCTGTCGCTGTCGAAATTC-3′ for K129S, and 5′-CTTCCTTGATTGCTGGACTCACATC-3′ for E148A). Inserts containing no additional mutation were selected and subcloned into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of the pET 28 (a) plasmid. Bacterial expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and protein purification of each rSLG Equ c1 point mutants were performed as described before (3 and 4). Eight-week-old Balb/c mice were injected three times with natural Equ c 1. Conventional procedures were used to fuse immune spleen cells to SP2/0 cells with polyethylene glycol, and specific IgG-secreting hybridomas were then selected after screening of the supernatants. For ELISA screenings, purified Equ c 1 molecule, either natural (from horse dander extract) or recombinant (wild-type or point mutants), was coated at 10 μg/ml in 0.1 mcarbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, in 96-well microtitration plates. After saturation with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, serial concentrations of mouse mAb (0.01 to 100 μg/ml), rabbit polyclonal Ab (0.01 to 100 μg/ml), or human serum IgE (1/2 to 1/100) were added in duplicate or triplicate to each well and incubated at 37 °C during 1 h 30 m. Binding was revealed with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit Ig, or biotinylated goat anti-human IgE + peroxidase-coupled streptavidin, respectively, followed byo-phenylenediamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Competitive experiments were performed by co-incubating serial dilutions of the competitor Ab (0.1 to 100 μg/ml) with a predetermined concentration of the anti-Equ c 1 Ab biotinylated (for the experiments reported in Fig. 4) or not (for the experiments reported in Fig. 5) in Equ c 1-coated microtitration plates. Residual binding was revealed with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin or appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary Ab, respectively.Figure 5Competitive ELISA between mouse mAbs and human serum IgE from horse allergic patients. Equ c 1 (10 μg/ml), either natural (A) or recombinant (B), was coated on a microtitration plate, and IgE serum representative of eight allergic patients (1/10 dilution) was co-incubated with varying concentrations of competitor antibody: mAb 118 (○), mAb 197 (▵), mAb 220 (■), mAb 65 (⋄), or rabbit anti-Equ c 1 polyclonal Abs (●).

The final parameters of refinement and model stereochemistry are summarized in TableI. Only the solvent-exposed side chain of Arg131 in a surface loop was not visible in the electron density map and was modeled as alanine, although other exposed amino acid residues (Arg26, Asp67, Glu82, Glu94, Glu148, and Glu165) also display very high temperature factors for their side-chain atoms. All but one nonglycine and nonproline residues (99.3%) have main-chain dihedral angles which fall within allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram, as defined by PROCHECK (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson S.C. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The outlier Glu115(φ = 70.3°, ψ = −35.6°), is located in the exposed L6 loop, a structurally conserved region in lipocalins (28.Flower D.R. North A.C. Attwood T.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which often displays unfavorable main-chain conformations (18.Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R.

Biol. 1987; 198: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), an 8-stranded β-barrel flanked by an α-helix. In Equ c 1, there is a short additional β-strand and one helical turn at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. A conserved disulfide bridge links Cys83 in loop L3 with Cys176 at the C-terminal region of the chain. As in most lipocalins, the β-barrel defines an internal cavity, which can accommodate a small hydrophobic ligand. Loops L2 (connecting βB–βC), L4 (βD−βE), and L6 (βF−βG) define the “closed” end of the β-barrel, whereas loops L1 (partly helical), L3, and L5 form the entry site for ligand binding (Fig. 2). The protein backbone of the horse allergen is structurally similar to that of the mouse allergen mMUP (9.Bocskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B. North A.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), with an overall root mean square deviation between main-chain atoms of 1.124 Å (Figs.1 and 2 b). In particular, the core of the structure (the two β-sheets and the α-helix) and the long L1 loop, which partially closes the ligand entry site, are well conserved. The most important differences between the two structures involve the N- and C-terminal ends of the polypeptide chain. Minor, but significant, differences are also observed for loops L2 (which includes a single amino acid insertion in Equ c 1, see Fig. 1), L3, L6, and L7 (Fig. 2 b). Equ c 1 is found to form a dimer in the crystal, in agreement with gel filtration experiments in solution at neutral pH (4.Gregoire C. Tavares G.A. Lorenzo H.K. Dandeu J.P. David B. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 880-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crystallographic dimer is formed by the side-to-side packing of the β-barrels through the interaction of strands βF, βG, and βH from each monomer, with the two α-helices on the same side of the dimer and running antiparallel to each other (Fig. 2 c). The entry sites to the putative binding sites of Equ c 1 (loops L1, L3, and L5) are located on opposite sides of the dimer and are accessible for ligand binding. The tight association buries 1070 Å2 of exposed molecular surface from each monomer (as calculated with the program DSSP (33.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12186) Google Scholar)), which represents 13% of the total solvent accessible surface (8300 Å2). Such an extended contact surface suggests that the dimerization state observed in the crystal is physiologically relevant. The center of the contact surface is composed by an extended hydrophobic patch including aliphatic and aromatic side-chains (Ile25, Val46, Val98, Val108, Phe109, Ile111, Val125, Phe127, and Phe133) (Fig.2 d). Toward the periphery of the interface, hydrophilic amino acids are also involved in dimer formation (Arg26, Asn27, Asp45, Thr93, Glu94, Glu95, Asn102, Tyr106, Arg110, Tyr123, Asp128, Lys129, Asp130, Pro132, Glu134, Lys159, and Arg160). Although monomeric forms of lipocalins have been characterized (such as the allergen Bos d 2 (19.Rouvinen J. Rautiainen J. Virtanen T. Zeiler T. Kauppinen J. Taivainen A. Mantyjarvi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the retinol-binding protein (8.Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), or the human neutrophil gelatinase-associated protein (31.Coles M. Diercks T. Muehlenweg B. Bartsch S. Zolzer V. Tschesche H. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), lipocalins often exist as dimers or higher oligomers. However, no consistent pattern of dimerization is obvious from the analysis of known three-dimensional structures. Indeed, the mode of dimerization of Equ c 1 has not been previously observed in other lipocalin dimers studied by x-ray diffraction (Fig. 3). In mMUP, the dimer interface includes the β-sheet composed of strands B, C, and D, and two Cd2+ ions (9.Bocskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B. North A.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), whereas bovine β-lactoglobulin dimerizes by joining the first β strand and the L1 loop of each monomer (17.Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C. Findlay J.B. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and dimerization of the odorant-binding protein involves the swapping of the α-helix between the two monomers (7.Bianchet M.A. Bains G. Pelosi P. Pevsner J. Snyder S.H. Monaco H.L. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8.Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The biological role of Equ c 1 is unknown. As in most proteins belonging to the lipocalin family, its physiological role might be concerned with the binding and transport of small hydrophobic ligands. The internal space between the two β-sheets of Equ c 1 defines a hydrophobic pocket similar to that observed for mMUP. Indeed, amino acid residues that are in contact with the pheromone ligand in mMUP are also well conserved in Equ c1 (Fig.1). The mMUP residues Leu44, Val58, Phe60, Phe94, Ala107, Leu109, Leu120, and Tyr124, are replaced in Equ c 1 by Val58, Ala73, Tyr75, Phe109, Leu122, Leu124, Leu135, and Tyr139, respectively. The presence of the additional hydroxyl group of Tyr75 in Equ c 1 (Phe60 in mMUP) is compensated by the smaller volume occupied by the neighboring residues Ala73 and Val58 (Val58 and Leu44 in mMUP), therefore suggesting that Equ c 1 could bind small hydrophobic molecules similar to those recognized by mMUP. The partially helical L1 loop connecting β-strands A and B folds over the entrance to the cavity, forming a lid that apparently precludes ligand access to the putative binding site (Fig. 2). The temperature factor values of L1 residues are similar to those of the protein core, and the observed conformation of the loop is stabilized by several hydrogen bonding interactions (Table II). Because no residues from this loop are involved in crystal contacts, the observed closed conformation appears to be an intrinsic property of Equ c 1, at least under the current crystallization conditions (high ionic strength, basic pH). Indeed, no substitution was observed in crystals of Equ c 1 soaked with different lipocalin ligands (histamine, retinol, retinoic acid, S-β citronellol, methone, α−ionone, benzyl benzoate, or 3-pyridine-propanol) lending further support to the hypothesis of a blocked binding site. It is conceivable that more physiological conditions (i.e. lower ionic strength and/or more acidic pH) could favor a modification of the L1 loop toward an “open” conformation allowing the access of ligands to the binding pocket.Table IIHydrogen bonding interactions involving residues from the L1 loopResidueAtomResidueAtomDistanceÅLys47OLys49N2.95Lys49OMet56N2.87Glu51OGly54N2.45Met56OVal58N2.89Asp104Oδ2Lys49Nζ2.86Asn53Oδ1Asn80N3.00Ser55OγAsp104Oδ22.54Ser55OTyr103OH2.77 Open table in a new tab To gain further insight into putative regions of the Equ c 1 molecule that might define B cell epitopes, mAbs were raised in Balb/c mice immunized with natural Equ c 1 purified from horse hair dander extract (3.Gregoire C.

Four hybridomas were selected for the secretion of specific antibodies (IgG1, κ) reacting with the natural form of Equ c 1 (Table III). Dissociation constants as measured by ELISA (34.Friguet B.

Treatment of Equ c 1 with the reducing compound dithiothreitol did not affect the binding of mAbs 118, 220, and 65 but abolished the reactivity of mAb 197, suggesting that the epitope recognized by the latter depends on the integrity of the disulfide bridge. Competition experiments in ELISA (Fig. 4) revealed that mAbs 118 and 197 mutually inhibited each other for binding to natural Equ c 1, indicating that both mAbs recognize overlapping epitopes. However, mAb 220 binds to a different target on the molecular surface, because its reactivity with natural Equ c 1 was not affected by the presence of mAbs 118 or 197 (and conversely).Table IIIBinding constants of anti-Equ c 1 monoclonal (IgG1, κ) antibodiesAntibodyK D aK Ddissociation constant determined by the method of Friguet et al.

Proteins containing a PTS2, which has the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(Q/H)(L/A) and is found at or near the amino termini of a small subset of peroxisomal matrix proteins, also require several peroxins for their import, including Pex7p, which binds directly to PTS2s. An interesting feature of peroxisomes is their ability to import oligomeric proteins (7.Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In many cell types, peroxisomes increase in size and number in response to certain extracellular stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 10.van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that this regulation is controlled by a subset of peroxins. In yeast, Pex10p (11.Tan X. Waterham H.R.

In mammalian cells, PEX11β has been shown to induce peroxisome proliferation in the absence of an external stimulus (e.g. a hypolipidemic drug such as clofibrate) (17.Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Other evidence suggests that there is also metabolic control of peroxisome abundance and size in mammalian cells. Cells of a patient with a specific deficiency in acyl-CoA oxidase were shown to have enlarged peroxisomes that are heterogeneous in size (18.Poll-The B.T. Roels F. Ogier H. Scotto J. Vamecq J. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. van Roermund C.W.T. van Wijland M.J.A. Schram A.W. Tager J.M. Saudubray J.-M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 42: 422-434PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that human cells lacking either acyl-CoA oxidase or MFE2 have a 5-fold reduction in peroxisome abundance and a 2–4-fold increase in peroxisome diameter, as compared with normal cells (19.Chang C.-C. South S. Warren D. Jones J. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification and characterization of theMFE2 gene of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and the study of the targeting of its encoded protein, MFE2, to peroxisomes. We also provide evidence of a role for β-oxidation enzymes in the regulation of peroxisome size and number in Y. lipolytica, the first evidence for this type of metabolic control in yeast. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Media components were as follows: YEPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose; YEPA, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% sodium acetate; YPBO, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% K2HPO4, 0.5% KH2PO4, 1% Brij 35, 1% (w/v) oleic acid; YND, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose; YNO, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 40, 0.2% (w/v) oleic acid; YNA, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% sodium acetate. Liquid YNO and YND media and YNO agar plates were supplemented with 2× Complete Supplement Mixture (minus the appropriate amino acids or nucleotides) (Bio 101, Vista, CA). YNA agar plates were supplemented with leucine, uracil, and lysine, each at 50 μg/ml, as required.

Open table in a new tab A fragment of theMFE2 gene was isolated serendipitously from the DNA of aY. lipolytica strain containing a PEX16disruption construct (16.Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) spuriously integrated into its genome. This strain was unable to use oleic acid as a carbon source. A fragment containing the disruption construct and flanking genomic DNA was recovered from this strain and ligated into pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega) to generate the plasmid p6AD. By sequencing, a 1146-bp fragment of theMFE2 gene (nucleotides 1090–2235, where +1 is the “A” nucleotide of the initiation codon) was identified within the disruption construct. To clone the entire MFE2 gene,Y. lipolytica genomic DNA was isolated from the wild-type strain E122, digested with EcoRI, and fractionated by size. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA fragments within each fraction using oligonucleotides 731 and 742 (Table II), it was determined that fragments of DNA containing the MFE2 gene were between 6 and 8 kilobase pairs in size. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA of this size range was ligated into pGEM7Zf(+) to construct a library for colony hybridization. A fragment of the MFE2 gene amplified by PCR from p6AD using oligonucleotides 731 and 742 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP and used to probe this library. One plasmid, pG7MFE2, was isolated from a positive colony, and both strands of the ∼6.8-kilobase pairs insert were sequenced. The sequence of the MFE2 protein was deduced from the gene nucleotide sequence and compared with protein data bases using the BLAST algorithm provided by the network service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD).Table IIOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence564GCCGAATTCAACCAAGACACACAAAAATG565GAAGGATCCGGCGGGGTTCTGCTCG731GGTTGTTCAGACCGCTA742GGTGTTGAAGGCCTT901AATGACCCTTGTTGCCCTCC909CCAACAGTTGAACTTCGCC913GCATTATCCATATCCGAGG921TAATAGCGTCGACACCTCAATTGAGTTAGCAG922TGAGGTGTCGACGCTATTATCTGACCAAGTG944ATGTCTTACGTACTCTGGAGAACTAAGATACG945TCCAGAGTACGTAAGACATTGTGTGTGTGTGTTGAAT953CTTGGTCAGATAATAGCTTAATCCTTGGG958GAGCTCTTCCCCAAGGATTAAGCTATTAT1009GAAGGATCCGAGGCTATAATTACC1010GAAGGATCCTCAACTGAACACAAC1011ATTAAAATACGTAGTGTGGTGATTGCTGT1012CCACACTACGTATTTTAATTTGTGTGGTTGTT1013CAGGTTGTCATTGTCACTAGTGCCGGT1014AATGCCAGCACCGGCACTAGTGAC1015AGGTCGTCATTGTTACCAGTGCCGG1016ACCGCCACCGGCACTGGTAACAUPGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTRestriction endonuclease recognition sites are underlined.

To make an MFE2 expression plasmid, pG7MFE2 was digested with SphI, and the fragment containing the open reading frame (ORF) of the MFE2 gene, as well as 1066 and 426 bp of sequence upstream and downstream of the ORF, respectively, was ligated into the Escherichia coli/Y. lipolytica shuttle vector pINA445 (20.Nuttley W.M. Brade A.M. Gaillardin C. Eitzen G.A. Glover J.R. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 507-517Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) cut with SphI to make the plasmid pMFE2 encoding MFE2. pINA445 contains the Y. lipolytica LEU2 gene for the positive selection of yeast transformants and the Y. lipolytica ARS68 gene for autonomous plasmid replication inY. lipolytica cells. The flanking regions of the MFE2 ORF were amplified from pG7MFE2 using oligonucleotides 909 and 921 for the 5′ region and oligonucleotides 922 and UP for the 3′ region (Table II). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR using oligonucleotides 909 and UP. As oligonucleotides 922 and 921 haveSalI recognition sequences and complementary 5′ ends, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing bothMFE2 flanking regions separated by a SalI site. This PCR product was cut with SphI, and the 1467-bp fragment was ligated into the SphI site of pGEM-7Zf(+). The Y. lipolytica URA3 gene flanked by SalI sites was then ligated into the unique SalI site to generate the plasmid pΔMFE2. The URA3 gene flanked by 1019 and 426 bp ofMFE2 upstream and downstream regions, respectively, was excised from pΔMFE2 with SphI, and the linear fragment was introduced into the wild-type strain E122 by electroporation. Strains that converted to uracil prototrophy and that were unable to grow on oleic acid medium (YNO agar) were further characterized by Southern blotting. One strain, mfe2-KO, was confirmed to have the MFE2 ORF replaced by URA3. The PEX5 disruption strain, pex5-KO2, was made as described previously (21.Szilard R.K. Titorenko V.I. Veenhuis M. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1453-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), except that the URA3 gene was used in place of the LEU2 gene. A modifiedMFE2 gene coding for a MFE2 protein tagged at its amino terminus was made by inserting a DNA fragment encoding three copies of the human c-Myc epitope (a gift of David Stewart, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta) in-frame at the 5′ end of theMFE2 ORF. First, a SnaBI site was generated after the initiation codon of the MFE2 gene using two-step PCR. Essentially, the regions of the MFE2 gene flanking the proposed SnaBI site were amplified from pG7MFE2 using oligonucleotides 909 and 945 for the 5′ region and oligonucleotides 944 and UP for the 3′ region (Table II). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR with oligonucleotides 909 and UP. As oligonucleotides 944 and 945 have SnaBI recognition sequences and complementary 5′ ends, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing both flanking regions of theMFE2 gene with a SnaBI site between them. This product was digested with NcoI and EcoRV, and the fragment containing the PCR-generated SnaBI site was ligated into the corresponding sites of pG7MFE2. A fragment withHindII/XhoI termini encoding the peptide GEQKLISEEDLNGEQKLISEEDLNGEQKLISEEDLNG, which contains three repeats of the c-Myc epitope (underlined residues) (22.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), was made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated in-frame into the SnaBI site to generate the plasmid pG7Myc-MFE2. This plasmid was digested withSphI, and the fragment containing the modifiedMFE2 gene, as well as 1066 and 426 bp of sequence upstream and downstream of the MFE2 gene, respectively, was ligated into SphI-digested pINA445 to create the plasmid pMyc-MFE2 encoding Myc-MFE2. The region of pMyc-MFE2 that was amplified by PCR (between the NcoI and EcoRV sites) was determined to be correct by sequencing. A two-step PCR procedure was used to generate a modified MFE2gene encoding Myc-MFE2 lacking its carboxyl-terminal tripeptide (Myc-MFE2ΔAKL). That portion of the MFE2 gene 5′ to the nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide of MFE2 was amplified from pG7Myc-MFE2 with oligonucleotides 909 and 953 (TableII). The stop codon and downstream sequence of MFE2 were amplified with oligonucleotides 958 and UP (Table II). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR with oligonucleotides 909 and UP. As oligonucleotides 953 and 958 have complementary 5′ ends, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing a modified MFE2 gene encoding Myc-MFE2ΔAKL. This PCR product was digested with SphI, and the fragment containing the modified MFE2 ORF, as well as 1066 and 426 bp of sequence upstream and downstream, respectively, of the MFE2 gene, was ligated into the SphI site of pINA445. The MFE2gene sequence upstream of the ClaI site was exchanged with the corresponding region of pMyc-MFE2 to generate pMyc-MFE2ΔAKL. The remainder of the MFE2 gene was checked to be correct by sequencing. Cells from YNO-grown cultures were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 or 30 min as indicated and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (23.Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), except that spheroplast preparation was done in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1.2 m sorbitol, 40 μg of Zymolyase-100T (ICN, Aurora, OH)/ml, 28 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 30 °C with gentle agitation. Images were captured using a Spot Cam digital fluorescence camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Whole cells were fixed in 1.5% KMnO4 for 20 min at room temperature, dehydrated by successive incubations in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in TAAB 812 resin (Marivac, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada). Ultrathin sections were cut using an Ultra-Cut E Microtome (Reichert-Jung) and examined in a Phillips 410 electron microscope. Electron micrographs were enlarged to a × 16,620 magnification on photographic paper. Images of cells were cut out and weighed, and the total cell area was calculated using standards (weights of pieces of photographic paper of known area). To quantify peroxisome size, the average peroxisome area was calculated. Essentially, peroxisome profiles were cut out and weighed, and the total peroxisome area was calculated and divided by the total number of peroxisomes counted. To quantify peroxisome number, the numerical density of peroxisomes (number of peroxisomes per μm3 of cell volume) was calculated by the method of Weibel and Bolender (24.Weibel E.R. Bolender P. Hayat M.A. Principles and Techniques of Electron Microscopy. 3. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1973: 237-296Google Scholar) for spherical organelles as follows. First, the total number of peroxisome profiles was counted and reported as the number of peroxisomes per cell area assayed (N A). Next, the peroxisome volume density (V V) was calculated for each strain (total peroxisome area/total cell area assayed). Using the valuesV V and N A, the numerical density of peroxisomes was determined (24.Weibel E.R. Bolender P. Hayat M.A. Principles and Techniques of Electron Microscopy. 3. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1973: 237-296Google Scholar). A two-step PCR procedure was used to generate a modified MFE2 gene encoding Myc-MFE2ΔAΔB, a Myc-tagged version of MFE2 containing the mutations G16S and G324S. A portion of the MFE2 gene 5′ to the nucleotides encoding Gly-16 was amplified from pG7Myc-MFE2 with oligonucleotides 1016 and 913 (Table II). A portion of the MFE2 gene 3′ to the nucleotides encoding Gly-16 was amplified with oligonucleotides 1015 and 901 (Table II). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR with oligonucleotides 901 and 913. As oligonucleotides 1015 and 1016 contain the G46A mutation and have complementary 5′ ends, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing a modified MFE2 gene encoding Myc-MFE2 containing the G16S mutation. A DNA fragment encoding MFE2 with the G324S mutation was made the same way except that oligonucleotides 1013 and 1014 (containing the G1045A and the A1047T mutations) (Table II) were used in place of oligonucleotides 1015 and 1016. The PCR product containing G46A was digested with EcoRV and NcoI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pG7Myc-MFE2 to yield the plasmid pG7Myc-MFE2ΔA. Next, the PCR product containing the G1045A and A1047T mutations was digested with EcoRV andAflII and ligated into the corresponding sites of pG7Myc-MFE2ΔA to yield pG7Myc-MFE2ΔAΔB. pG7Myc-MFE2ΔAΔB was digested with SphI, and the fragment containing the modifiedMFE2 ORF, as well as 1066 and 426 bp of sequence upstream and downstream of the MFE2 gene, respectively, was ligated into the SphI site of pINA445 to generate pMyc-MFE2ΔAΔB. An overexpression cassette containing the promoter and terminator regions of the ACT1 gene encoding Y. lipolytica actin was constructed using a two-step PCR procedure. 645 bp upstream of the ACT1 ORF was amplified from Y. lipolytica genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 1009 and 1012 (TableII). 462 bp downstream of the ACT1 ORF was amplified with oligonucleotides 1010 and 1011 (Table II). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR with oligonucleotides 1009 and 1010. As oligonucleotides 1011 and 1012 have complementary 5′ ends and contain SnaBI consensus sequences, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing the upstream and downstream regions of the ACT1 gene separated by a SnaBI site. This PCR product was digested with BamHI, and the cassette was ligated into the BamHI site of pINA445 to make the plasmid pACT-OC. The POT1 gene was amplified fromY. lipolytica genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 564 and 565 (Table II), made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ligated into the SnaBI site of pACT-OC in the correct orientation to make the plasmid pTHI-OV. To quantify thiolase levels, E122 cells transformed with either pTHI-OV or pINA445 were grown in YND medium overnight. Cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from each strain at various dilutions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either anti-thiolase or anti-Kar2p antibodies. The relative difference in the levels of thiolase in the pTHI-OV transformed strain versus the wild-type strain was determined by a comparison of the immunosignals for thiolase from different dilutions of lysate of each strain. Guinea pig antibodies to Y. lipolytica thiolase and rabbit antibodies to Y. lipolytica isocitrate lyase have been described (25.Eitzen G.A. Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Veenhuis M. Szilard R.K.

Rabbit antibodies to Y. lipolyticaacyl-CoA oxidase 5 were a kind gift of Jean-Marc Nicaud (Laboratoire de Génétique des Microorganismes, Thiverval-Grignon, France) and have been described (27.Wang H.J.

Rabbit antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae malate synthase were a kind gift of Andreas Hartig (Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Vienna, Austria). Guinea pig antibodies to Y. lipolytica Pex16p have been described previously (16.Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Guinea pig antibodies to Y. lipolytica Pex19p were a kind gift of Gareth Lambkin (Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo 1000M DNA synthesizer (Beckman). Sequencing was performed with an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). DNA was amplified using Ready To Go PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein alignments were done using the Clustal W algorithm of Omiga 1.1.3 (Oxford Molecular, Campbell, CA). Preparation of yeast lysates by disruption with glass beads, growth of E. coli, and manipulation of DNA and RNA were performed as described (28.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting using a wet transfer system (30.Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar), and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing of a DNA fragment recovered from a Y. lipolytica strain that contained an incorrectly integratedPEX16 disruption construct and that failed to grow on oleic acid-containing medium led to the identification of a 1146-bp piece of the MFE2 gene encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation MFE2 ofY. lipolytica. This DNA sequence was used to generate a probe to isolate the entire Y. lipolytica MFE2 gene by colony hybridization. Three positively hybridizing colonies were identified out of 5000 colonies screened, and the plasmids recovered from each positive colony were shown to be identical by restriction mapping. Sequencing demonstrated that the insert contained the entireMFE2 ORF, as well as 3474 and 426 bp upstream and downstream, respectively, of the ORF. The Y. lipolytica MFE2 gene and its encoded protein, MFE2, are shown in Fig. 1. A putative TATA box, TATATAA, is found between nucleotides –124 and –118 (where +1 is the “A” nucleotide of the putative initiation codon of theMFE2 gene). “A” nucleotides are found at positions –1 and –3 upstream of the initiator ATG, a feature common to strongly expressed genes of Y. lipolytica (31.Barth G. Gaillardin C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 19: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream regulatory region of the MFE2 gene contains the sequence CGGTTATAA between nucleotides –459 and –467. This sequence closely resembles the consensus oleic acid-response element (C/T)GGTT(A/G)TT(C/A/G) of Candida tropicalis(32.Sloots J.A. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Gene. 1991; 105: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and fits the consensus oleic acid-response element CGGNNNTNA ofS. cerevisiae (33.Filipits M. Simon M.M. Rapatz W. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Gene. 1993; 132: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34.Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which are sequences often found upstream of genes encoding peroxisomal matrix proteins. TheMFE2 gene contains an intron. Y. lipolyticaintron donor and branch sites (31.Barth G. Gaillardin C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 19: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were identified between nucleotides 172 and 178 and between nucleotides 234 and 245, respectively. The donor site GTGAGTA fits the consensus donor site GTGAGTPu, whereas the sequence AACTAACACCAG resembles very closely the consensus branch site (T/C)(A/G)CTAAC(N1–2)CAG. The S. cerevisiaetranscription termination consensus sequence TAG … TA(T)GT … TTT located upstream of poly(A) addition sites (35.Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) is also a feature of Y. lipolytica genes (31.Barth G. Gaillardin C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 19: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is found in the 3′ untranslated region of the MFE2 gene. A eukaryotic poly(A) addition signal, AATAAA (36.Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar), is found between nucleotides 3113 and 3118. The protein deduced from the MFE2 nucleotide sequence is 901 amino acid residues in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 97,300 Da. A search of protein data bases using the BLAST algorithm available through the network service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information showed that the encoded protein has a high degree of homology with peroxisomal MFE2 enzymes of other fungi (Fig.2). The highest homology is withNeurospora crassa MFE2, which shares 62% identical residues and 10% similar residues with Y. lipolytica MFE2. The carboxyl-terminal tripeptide Ala-Lys-Leu of Y. lipolyticaMFE2 fits the PTS1 consensus sequence. The entire MFE2 ORF was deleted by integration of theY. lipolytica URA3 gene into the E122 wild-type strain to create the strain mfe2-KO. The mfe2-KOstrain grew well on media containing acetate (see Fig. 8 C) or glucose (data not shown), w"

Members of this family couple electron transfer and proton translocation across the membrane. They also share some structural homologies, having three redox-active subunits in common: the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, a b-type cytochrome (cytochromeb or b 6), and a c-type cytochrome (cytochrome c 1 or f). Moreover, there is sequence homology between cytochromeb 6, subunit IV, and the Rieske protein of theb 6 f complex, and the N- and C-terminal parts of cytochrome b, and the Rieske protein of the bc 1 complex, respectively. Cytochromec 1 and cytochrome f, on the other hand, do not share any sequence homology. Spectroscopic and EPR properties of the hemes and of the iron-sulfur cluster are similar, although not identical, and some inhibitors affect both complexes equally (reviewed in Refs. 4.Hauska G.

The cytochrome b 6 f is the middle component of the photosynthetic chain, coupling the electron transfer from photosystem II (via plastoquinol) to photosystem I (via plastocyanin or a c-type cytochrome). The most widely accepted mechanism for the bc-type complexes is the so-called “Q-cycle” mechanism proposed by Mitchell (18.Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 137-139Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and modified by Crofts et al. (19.Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). According to this model, two electron paths are distinguished within the complex as follows: a high potential chain, composed of the iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske protein and the heme of the c-type heme, and a low potential chain, composed of the two hemes of the b-type cytochrome, the low potential b L and high potentialb H hemes. Two quinol/quinone-binding sites, located on opposite sides of the membrane, are also predicted: the Qo site, on the intermembrane space/lumenal side of the membrane, and the Qi site, on the matrix/stromal side of the membrane. A turnover of the Qo site comprises the oxidation of a two-electron carrier quinol, one electron reducing the Rieske protein, which in turn reduces the c-type cytochrome and which ultimately reduces plastocyanin or cytochrome c, and the other electron reducing b L, which in turn is oxidized by b H. These events are associated with the release of two protons in the intermembrane space/lumen. A second turnover reduces another plastocyanine molecule and places both hemes of the b-type cytochrome in a reduced state. The reduction of a quinone at the Qi site results in the oxidation of the two b hemes and an uptake of two protons from the matrix/stroma. Thus, these complexes contribute to generating the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis in respiration and photosynthesis. Recently, the structure of several bc 1 complexes from mitochondria have been determined by x-ray crystallography (1.Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J.

Depending on the inhibitor binding at the Qo site, different conformations of the extramembrane domain of the Rieske protein are observed: in the presence of stigmatellin, the iron-sulfur cluster is within electron transfer distances of the Qo site (the “proximal” position), whereas in the presence of myxothiazol or methoxyacrylate stilbene, it is closer to the heme of cytochrome c 1 (the “distal” position); in the native structure (i.e. in the absence of inhibitor) it is found either in an intermediate position (1.Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K.

Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). It is deduced from these data that the extramembrane domain of the Rieske protein undergoes a large scale movement to shuttle the electron from the quinol to the cytochrome c 1. This hypothesis has been confirmed by fluorescence quenching as a function of the redox potential between two fluorescent probes attached to the Rieske protein and cytochrome b of the bc 1 complex of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (21.Crofts A.R.

EPR studies on theb6f complex of spinach suggest different conformations for the extramembrane domain of the Rieske protein as well (68.Schoepp B. Brugna M. Riedel A. Nitschke W. Kramer D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although bc 1 andb 6 f complexes are similar with regard to function and structure, the differences that occur do not allow direct transposition of structural information from thebc 1 to theb 6 f (see e.g.Refs. 22.Kuras R.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of the b 6 fcomplex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These maps are derived from electron crystallography of assimilated two-dimensional crystals. This technique allows us to calculate density maps, i.e. to visualize the protein either in projection or in three dimensions (see Refs. 32.Yeager M. Unger V.M. Mitra A.K.

Depending on the quality of the crystals, low (∼15 Å) to high (4–3 Å) resolution data can be obtain. Low to medium resolution maps will outline domains of the protein, whereas atomic models can be built into higher resolution data (35.Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Murata K. Miyazawa A. Kidera A. Kimura Y. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 861-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 36.Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H.

In this work, we have looked for inhibitor-induced conformational changes on the b 6 f complex using electron crystallography. We show that the binding of stigmatellin to the b 6 fcomplex either prior to crystallization or on the preformed crystals induces changes in the projected structure of the complex. A conformational change following stigmatellin binding is seen both in negatively stained samples, where the information comes mainly from the extramembrane part of the protein, and in samples embedded in glucose, where the whole molecule contributes to the signal. We conclude that a similar movement of the Rieske protein occurs in theb 6 f complex as in thebc 1 complex to shuttle the electron from the plastoquinol to the cytochrome f. However, our data also suggest that this movement is accompanied by conformational changes of the transmembrane region that would be specific to theb 6 f complex. The cytochromeb 6 f complex from C. reinhardtii was purified as described in Ref. 13.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar. Briefly, specific solubilization of the thylakoid membranes by 6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glycopyranoside (Hecameg)2 is followed by sucrose gradient and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The two last steps of purification must be performed in the presence of lipids (eggl-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC)) and at the critical micellar concentration of the detergent to prevent dissociation of the complex (38.Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.P. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The crystallization of the complex was performed as described in Refs.30.Mosser G. Breyton C. Olofsson A. Popot J.L. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20263-20268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 31.Bron P. Lacapère J.J. Breyton C. Mosser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, except that no calcium was added to the crystallization medium. Briefly, PC and di-C18:1-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) solubilized in Hecameg were added (PC/DOPG = 1) to the purified protein (10 μm) at a protein/lipid ratio of 0.3 to 1.2 (w/w). The mixture was allowed to equilibrate overnight, and the detergent was removed by the addition of 25 g/100 ml of SM2-Bio-Beads for 6 h at 4 °C. After overnight sedimentation of the reconstituted material, samples were frozen (−196 °C) and thawed (4 °C) three times, and crystals were harvested 1–5 days later. C13-stigmatellin, kindly synthesized by P. Hervé and P. Fellmann (CNRS UPR 9052, IBPC, Paris, from Ref. 39.Höfle G. Kunze B. Zorzin C. Reichenbach H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1984; 12: 1883-1904Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), solubilized in 96% ethanol, was added (100 μm) either before or after crystallization. When added to preformed crystals, the incubation time ranged from 2 min to several days at 4 °C. It was checked that the presence of 2% ethanol in the crystallization medium did not alter nor modify crystallization. For negative stain studies, 2.5 μl of the crystal suspension were allowed to sit for 2 min on a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid. Excess of solution was blotted off, and the grid was washed 10 s with 2.5 μl of water to remove the ammonium phosphate present in the crystallization buffer, before being stained with two successive washes of 1% uranyl acetate (30 s each). Negative staining is mainly used to increase the contrast of the sample and to allow fast screening of crystallization conditions. The protein is embedded in a thin layer of a heavy metal salt outlining the protein, like a replica or a cast. As the stain is much denser than the protein, an image of a negatively stained crystal will be dominated by the information coming from the stain; the protein will be seen in negative. The resolution attained by such images is limited by the stain, and maps of negatively stained crystals are usually not calculated beyond ∼15 Å. At such a resolution, only the low resolution features as large domains of the protein are resolved. In the case of membrane proteins with large extramembrane domains, this method can give interesting data; as the stain does not usually penetrate the interior of the membrane (the heavy atoms are hydrophilic), only the extrinsic domains of the protein will be outlined. The projection map will thus be dominated by the extramembrane part of the protein. For electron cryo-microscopy, grids were prepared using the back injection method, i.e. 2.5 μl of sample were injected into a 2–6% glucose solution on a carbon-coated copper grid, blotted for 15 s face on the filter paper, and frozen in liquid nitrogen where samples were stored until examined. This method, rather than plunging the sample in liquid ethane as described previously (31.Bron P. Lacapère J.J. Breyton C. Mosser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), improved the yield of diffracting crystals. In this case, it is now the whole protein that contributes to the information contained in the image, so that in a projection map, extramembrane features as well as transmembrane elements will overlap. Because of the presence of the glucose though, the low resolution contribution of the extramembrane part of the protein will be lessened due to contrast matching between the glucose and the protein (40.Kühlbrandt W. Ultramicroscopy. 1982; 7: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41.Grigorieff N. Beckmann E. Zemlin F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the case of an α-helical membrane protein, helices perpendicular to the membrane will be projected as strong density peaks at 10–7 Å resolution, whereas tilted helices, loops, or β-sheets will contribute less strongly to the projection map. These projection maps will thus be dominated by the information coming from the transmembrane helices. Electron micrographs of stained or unstained crystals were recorded on a CM12 or a CM120 electron microscope at 120-kV acceleration and at magnifications of × 45,000–60,000 x. A GATAN cold stage was used for unstained specimens. Images were taken with a 1-s exposure time using the low dose facility of the microscopes, at a total electron dose of ∼10 e·Å−2 in flood beam mode. Other cryo-grids were mounted in a Leica KF80 apparatus for transfer into a JEOL 3000 SFF electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with a top entry cryo-stage cooled to 4 K with liquid helium. Images were then taken using a spot-scan procedure with a total electron dose of 20–30 e·Å−2, at magnifications of × 53,000–70,000, on a 0° tilt holder. In all cases Kodak SO-163 films were used to record images and were developed for 12 min with full-strength Kodak D19. 2 (JEOL) + 5 (CM120) images were used to calculate the native cryo-map and 4 (JEOL) + 2 (CM120) were used to calculate the stigmatellin cryo-map. It was checked by comparing individual images that the differences observed did not come from the unequal number of images taken with each microscope. Optical diffraction was used to screen the micrographs, and areas giving rise to symmetrical distribution of sharp spots were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a 7-μm step size over an area of 6,000 × 6,000 pixels. Images were then corrected for distortion of the crystal lattice and effects of the contrast transfer function (CTF) using the MRC image-processing programs (42.Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Amplitude correction for the CTF was not made, as the low resolution amplitudes are particularly strong with these crystals, probably due to their three-dimensional nature. Projection maps were calculated from merged data, imposing the p22121 symmetry revealed by the program ALLSPACE (43.Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and already determined in previous work (30.Mosser G. Breyton C. Olofsson A. Popot J.L. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using the standard crystallographic computer programs in the CCP4 package (44.Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). Projection maps were scaled to a maximum density of 250 and contoured in steps of 0.25 × root mean square density. A negative temperature factor of −600 was applied in Fig. 3 to compensate partially for the resolution-dependent degradation of image-derived amplitudes. This value is within the range of values usually used at this resolution (45.Unger V.M. Schertler G.F.X. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1776-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 46.Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Difference maps were calculated from the vectorial difference between structure factors for the native crystals and the crystals with stigmatellin, after scaling the two merged data sets to the same total intensity. The background level was estimated by calculating a difference map between two sets of images resulting from halving the data set of the images of native crystals, and 2 × root mean square density value from this difference was used to contour the difference maps. Fig. 1 shows the projection maps in negative stain truncated at 15 Å resolution obtained from images of native crystals (Fig. 1 A) and of crystals grown in the presence of stigmatellin (Fig. 1 B). In both cases, theb 6 f is present as a dimer, the unit cell dimensions are similar, and the crystallographic statistics show that both maps are of comparable quality, allowing further comparisons to be made (TableI).Table ICrystallographic data for negatively stained images−stigmatellin+stigmatellinUnit cell parametersa = 178 Å ± 3a = 182 Å ± 3b = 72 Å ± 2b = 74 Å ± 2γ = 90.2° ± 0.4γ = 90.0° ± 0.3Number of images76Number of unique reflections (to IQ 7)4344Phase error to 15 Å after rounding to 0/180° (IQ 7 max, 45° is random)8.9°14.1° Open table in a new tab Within a monomer, two densities (labeled I and IIin Fig. 1) are resolved. Whereas density I does not show a major change in its position, density II appears to be shifted away from the 2-fold dimer axis and is more compact and round when stigmatellin is bound to the complex. The change in position is confirmed by the difference map (native − stigmatellin) shown in Fig. 1 C, where positive signal represents a density present in the native map but absent in the stigmatellin map. The most prominent signals (labeled a andb in Fig. 1 C) reflect the shift of density II away from the dimer axis induced by the binding of stigmatellin. The same behavior was observed when using phosphotungstic acid and ammonium molybdate as negative stains (data not shown), as well as when the stigmatellin was added on the preformed native crystals (data not shown). Thus, upon binding of stigmatellin, one of the densities of theb 6 f complex projection map in negative stain undergoes a major change in its position. It should be mentioned that in the crystals grown in the presence of stigmatellin, two type of images could be distinguished as follows: a set of images that merged, resulting in the projection map shown in Fig. 1 B, and another set of images, with the same lattice parameters, that after merging resulted in an identical map except for an additional large density between the dimers along the bdirection. These images have not been taken into account in this analysis, for it was not visible in maps calculated from crystals stained with phosphotungstic acid or ammonium molybdate. To visualize further and to confirm the conformational change seen in the negative stain study, analysis of the crystals grown with or without stigmatellin was done on unstained crystals. Fig.2 A shows a computed Fourier transform of an image of a crystal grown in the presence of stigmatellin, embedded in glucose, and observed in a JEOL 3000 SFF microscope at liquid helium temperature. The transform shows significant reflections up to 9 Å resolution. The phase errors associated with each of the Fourier components after merging six images, plotted in Fig. 2 B, show that the data are complete and isotropic to 9 Å resolution. The overall phase residual to 9.0 Å resolution was 18.8° (Table II). Fig.3 B shows the projection map at 9 Å resolution of b 6 fcrystals grown in the presence of stigmatellin.

Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the complex crystallizes as a dimer, and within the molecular boundaries, sharp and round densities surrounded by more elongated densities are resolved. These densities have diameters and spacings that could be compatible with the presence of transmembrane α-helices, but one should keep in mind that theb 6 f complex has two large extramembrane domains (of cytochrome f and of the Rieske protein) that will also contribute to the map (for examples of comparison between projection and three-dimensional maps of proteins that have extramembrane domains, see Refs. 47.Gohlke U.

By site-directed mutagenesis of Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and Clostridium difficile toxin B fragments, we identified tryptophan 102, which is located in a conserved region within the catalytic domain of all clostridial cytotoxins, to be crucial for UDP-glucose binding. Exchange of Trp-102 with alanine decreased the glucosyltransferase activity by about 1,000-fold and blocked cytotoxic activity after microinjection.

Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). C. difficile toxins A and B are responsible for symptoms in C. difficile-induced antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, whereas lethal toxin, hemorrhagic toxin, and α-toxin are virulence factors in gas gangrene (3.Hatheway C.L.

The toxins are glucosyltransferases that specifically modify and thereby inactivate small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho and Ras subfamily (5.Just I. Fritz G. Aktories K. Giry M. Popoff M.R.

Whereas the α-toxin from C. novyicatalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine moiety from UDP-GlcNAc to its substrates (9.Selzer J. Hofmann F. Rex G. Wilm M. Mann M. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25173-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), all other members of the toxin family share UDP-glucose as a cosubstrate. The modification occurs at amino acid Thr-37 in Rho or at Thr-35 in the other GTPases, resulting in inhibition of the interaction of the GTPases with their effectors (10.Perelle S. Gibert M. Bourlioux P. Corthier G. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11.Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because Rho proteins are regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, their inactivation results in a breakdown of cytoskeletal structures within target cells (12.Aktories K. Just I. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, various other signal transduction processes controlled by the small GTPases are inhibited (13.Schmidt M. Bienek C. Rümenapp U. Zhang C.Y. Lümmen G. Jakobs K.H. Just I. Aktories K. Moos M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The large clostridial cytotoxins belong to the superfamily of glycosyltransferases that have been classified in different families depending on their sequence homologies (14.Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Some of these glycosyltransferases share a DXD motif also conserved among all large clostridial cytotoxins. This motif is located within the NH2-terminal part of the toxins, which has been shown to be the catalytic domain of the toxins (15.Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Recently, crystal structures of two glycosyltransferases of families 2 and 7, exhibiting the DXD motif, have been solved (21.Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22.Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), showing that the proteins share a similar topology of the catalytic center and that most of the amino acid residues involved in nucleotide recognition are conserved among all members of the respective families. Based on these findings, we compared thoroughly the sequences of glycosyltransferases showing sequence homology to the large clostridial cytotoxins in the region around the DXD motif and identified another homology region conserved in all of these proteins. Here we report on a tryptophan residue located in this second conserved region of many putative glycosyltransferases, including clostridial cytotoxins, which is likely to be implicated in the binding of the cosubstrate UDP-glucose. 14C-Labeled UDP-hexoses were obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Dreieich, Germany). Polymerase chain reaction primers were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Amplification of NH2-terminal C. difficile toxin B and C. sordellii lethal toxin fragments and construction of COOH-terminal truncated fragments B5461 and LT546 was done as described previously (15.Hofmann F.

The QuikChange KitTM (Stratagene) was used for mutating one or two nucleotides in the pGEX 2T-LT546 construct or in the pGEX 2T-B546 construct, respectively. Procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were constructed as follows: K96A.LT546: Primer pair S1K96A sense/antisense (5′-CTGCTGCTTCTGCTATATTACGAATAT-3′/5′-GATATTCGTAATATAGCAGAAGCAGCA-3′).

W102A.B546: Primer pair B1W102A sense/antisense (5′-AAAAATTTACATTTTGTTGCTATTGGAGGTCAA-3′/5′-TTGACCTCCAATAGCAACAAAATGTAAATTTTT-3′). Sequencing of the mutated clones of LT546 and B546 was done with the Applied Biosystems, Inc. PrismTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt, Germany) to check both for correct cloning and mutations caused by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The recombinant GTP-binding proteins RhoA, Rac, Cdc42 and Ha-Ras were prepared from their fusion proteins as described (7.Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K.

The recombinant toxin fragments were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (see Fig. 2). GST fusion proteins from the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX 2T were isolated by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) followed by removing GST fusion proteins with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Recombinant Rap1a was a gift from Dr. A. Wittinghofer (Dortmund, Germany). Recombinant GTP-binding proteins (50–250 μg/ml) were incubated with recombinant toxin fragment LT546, B546, or mutated fragments at the indicated concentrations in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of UDP-[14C]glucose and unlabeled UDP-glucose at 37 °C for the indicated periods. The total volume was 20 μl. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequently by PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics, Germany). LT546 and the mutated fragments were incubated with 14C-labeled UDP-glucose and unlabeled UDP-glucose at the indicated concentrations in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MnCl2. The total volume was 5–10 μl. Samples of 1.5 μl were taken out at each time point and subjected to thin layer chromatography with polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck, Germany) and 0.2 m LiCl as mobile phase in order to separate hydrolyzed glucose from UDP-glucose. The plates were dried and analyzed by PhosphorImaging. The decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence of the wild-type fragment LT546 or the mutant W102Y.LT546 as a function of the UDP-glucose concentration was measured at 25 °C (25.Wilson B.A. Blanke S.R. Reich K.A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23296-23301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The solutions were excited at 280 nm (3.5-nm band pass), and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 340 nm (3.5-nm band pass) in a Perkin Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. The final concentrations of the fragments used in the experiments were 0.8 μm for LT546 and 1 μmfor W102Y.LT546. The fluorescence decrease of l-tryptophan was used to correct for the inner filter effect. All data points were corrected additionally for dilution. Initial rate data for the glucosyltransferase and glycohydrolase reaction were determined with regard to UDP-glucose binding by varying the UDP-glucose concentration from about 0.2 to 2 × K m. For the glucosyltransferase reaction, experiments were performed at fixed GST-Rac concentrations of 12.5 μm. The kinetic values were obtained by analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial velocities from three independent experiments. For microinjection studies, HeLa cells were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 4 mmglutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and plated on Cellocate (Eppendorf, Germany) coverslips at about 105 cells/dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Microinjection was performed with the microinjector 5242 and micromanipulator 5171 from Eppendorf. Caco-2 cells (Cell Line Service, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were subcultured every week and seeded on filter inserts for cell culture (12-mm diameter, Falcon) at a density of approximate 4 × 104 cells × cm−2 for electropermeabilization experiments and determination of transepithelial resistance. Caco-2 cells on filter inserts, cultured in 12-well plates, were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min in HBSS containing a 10 nm concentration of the toxin fragment to be inserted into cells in the apical and basolateral reservoir. Before electroporation, the transepithelial electrical resistance was measured using an epithelial volts/Ω meter (EVOM, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) supplemented with a chamber for filter inserts (Endohm 24). Only cells with an initial transepithelial resistance of at least 200 Ω cm2 were chosen for experiments. The electroporation was performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution in a purpose-built electroporation chamber where electrodes were positioned apically and basally of the cell monolayer. For the capacitative discharge a pulse generator (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) with a capacitance extender was used. According to the initial transepithelial electrical resistance of the filter, the parallel shunt resistor of the pulse controller was adjusted to 400 Ω for filters with 200–400 Ω cm2 or to 600 Ω for filters with 400–600 Ω cm2 to parallel the resistance of cell monolayer. After the pulse (200 V/cm; 10 microfarads; 1.2 ms), the filter inserts were transferred back into 12-well plates and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C. The transepithelial electrical resistance was measured after the indicated times. We have recently shown the importance of a highly conserved region (DXD motif) in active fragments of large clostridial cytotoxins for their glucosyltransferase activities (17.Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Besides the DXD motif, which we found to be essential for enzyme activity, this entire region contains 16 additional residues conserved among all large clostridial cytotoxins (Fig.1 A). At least two of these additional residues appear to be important for enzyme activity (17.Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When this whole region, which we refer to as the extended DXD motif, is used to search protein data bases, several further sequences can be identified, all of which share at least six residues of this motif with the clostridial toxins. Fig. 1 Ashows an alignment of some of these proteins in the mentioned section. Furthermore, another short amino acid stretch located NH2-terminal of the DXD motif is conserved in all sequences (Fig. 1 B). From these findings, we set out to elucidate the significance of this second homology region for the enzyme activity of large clostridial cytotoxins. Alanine mutants of all conserved amino acid residues in the region of amino acids 96–109 of the enzymatically active NH2-terminal fragment of C. sordellii lethal toxin (LT546) were constructed. The mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described. Fig.2 A shows a SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified fusion proteins. Next, we tested the glucosyltransferase activity of these mutants in a glucosylation experiment with the substrate GST-Rac. We found that all mutations (K96A, H99A, G105A, and D109A) had little effect on glucosyltransferase activity (not shown) except for that of Trp-102, which resulted in a reduced activity compared with the wild-type fragment (Fig.3). This decrease in activity was most likely not caused by major changes in the overall structure of the protein because the susceptibility of the fragment toward trypsin treatment was not changed (Fig. 2 B). Replacement of Trp-102 with arginine or tyrosine also led to a decrease in enzyme activity. Although the conservative mutation W102Y.LT546 resulted in an enzyme activity higher than that of the alanine mutant, the arginine mutant only showed a residual activity (Fig.4 A).Figure 4Glucosyltransferase activities of toxin mutants. Radioactively labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging (shown). Panel A, glucosyltransferase activities of W102Y.LT546 and W102R.LT546.

As shown in Fig.5, we found that W102A.LT546 was capable of modifying all substrates of the wild-type fragment, even though to a considerably lesser extent. When we compared LT546 and the mutant in time courses of the modification of the GST-Rac or Ras-protein, respectively, we observed an approximately 1,000-fold reduction of enzyme activity of the mutant W102A.LT546 for both protein substrates (Fig. 3). To confirm the significance of Trp-102 for the glucosyltransferase activity of the whole family of large clostridial cytotoxins, we constructed the respective alanine mutant of Trp-102 of the enzymatically active C. difficile toxin B fragment. Corroborating the results with the lethal toxin fragment, the mutant W102A.B546 was found to be much less active than the wild-type fragment in a glucosylation assay (Fig. 4 B). The effects of replacing Trp-102 with tyrosine or alanine on enzyme activity of LT546 were evaluated by comparing the relative specific activities for the glucosyltransferase and the glycohydrolase reaction (k cat andk cat/K m) of the wild-type and mutant proteins. Furthermore, we also compared the Michaelis constant (K m) of the fragments toward UDP-glucose. For the glucosyltransferase reaction, the kinetic parameters were determined by varying the UDP-glucose concentrations from 0.2 to 2 × K m at a fixed GST-Rac concentration of 5 μm. The values obtained by Lineweaver-Burk plots are summarized in Table I.Table IKinetic studies of Trp-102 mutantsK mUDP-Glck catRelativek catk cat/K mRelativek cat/K mμmh −1%m −1 h −1%Glucosyltransferase LT546612101002.4 × 108100 W102Y.LT54613029124.02.2 × 1060.9 W102A.LT5461200756.26.2 × 1040.03Glycohydrolase LT5461410561007.3 × 107100 W102Y.LT54614414201349.9 × 10613.6 W102A.LT546NDaND, not determined.NDNDNDNDAssays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experimental data were all determined to be statistically accurate to a standard deviation of not greater than ±10%.

The mutant was about 100-fold less efficient (9 × 103-fold lowerk cat/K m) compared with the wild-type fragment. Glycohydrolase activity was less influenced by the replacement with tyrosine. As can be seen in Table I, the activity (k cat) was unchanged, whereas the binding affinity was reduced about 10-fold, resulting in a 10-fold less efficient enzyme. On the other hand, the replacement of Trp-102 with alanine resulted in an enzyme that was altered much more dramatically in its kinetic properties. W102A.LT546 showed no detectable glycohydrolase activity (Fig. 6). Moreover, theK m value for the glucosyltransferase reaction was reduced more than 200-fold, whereas the specificity constantk cat was reduced 16-fold. Reflecting these alterations, the mutant W102A.LT546 was more than 3,500-fold less efficient (2.7 × 10−4-fold lowerk cat/K m) than the wild-type toxin fragment. To determine the dissociation constants for UDP-glucose binding independently of enzyme activity, we measured the decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence caused by quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 280 nm, emission at 340 nm) as a function of UDP-glucose concentration. The values recorded at the fluorescence maximum at 340 nm were corrected for dilution and the inner filter effect. We tested the wild-type toxin fragment and observed a quenching of about 20% at a concentration of 23 μm UDP-glucose (Fig.7). A dissociation constant (K d) of 6 μm was determined for this interaction. Similar results were obtained for UDP-mannose, a nucleotide sugar that inhibits the glucosylation reaction with UDP-glucose (not shown). GDP-mannose is neither a cosubstrate for the glucosylation reaction of the lethal toxin, nor does it inhibit the glucosylation reaction. When we tested this nucleotide sugar with the wild-type fragment, we observed a much weaker quenching effect (less than 10%). The quenching curve of the mutant W102Y.LT546 was superimposable on that of the wild-type fragment with GDP-mannose (Fig.7). This was also found for higher concentrations of the respective nucleotide sugars (not shown). Because of the low quenching effect, no dissociation constant could be determined. To characterize further the mutants W102Y.LT546 and W102A.LT546, we tested their biological activity by microinjection into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 8, we found the tyrosine mutant to elicit the same morphological effects as the wild-type fragment after 30 min when applied in a high concentration of 800 nm, whereas the alanine mutant showed no effect even after more than 4 h of treatment. To obtain more quantitative data, we measured the effect of LT546 and the mutants W102A.LT546 and W102Y.LT546 on transepithelial resistance of Caco-2 cells. For this purpose, the fragments were introduced in the cells by electropermeabilization. As can be seen in Fig.9, treatment with the wild-type toxin fragment LT546 led to an 80% reduction of transepithelial resistance after 450 min, whereas only a 20% decrease was observed with the tyrosine mutant of Trp-102. The mutant W102A.LT546 was without effect on the integrity of the monolayer.Figure 9Effects of LT546 and mutants on transepithelial resistance of Caco-2 cells. Cell monolayers were electropermeabilized and treated with toxin fragment or mutants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transepithelial electrical resistance of cell monolayers treated with 10 nmLT546 (▪), W102A.LT546 (●), and W102Y.LT546 (▾) was measured after the indicated times. The data are given as means of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The large clostridial cytotoxins belong to the superfamily of glycosyltransferases that use nucleotide sugars as cosubstrates. However, their homology to glycosyltransferase families as established by Campbell et al. (14.Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) is restricted to the small peptide motif DXD, which can be found in several otherwise unrelated families of glycosyltransferases. This motif has recently been shown to be crucial for enzyme activity of different types of glycosyltransferases (17.Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Elucidation of crystal structures of two glycosyltransferases has revealed the involvement of the aspartates of the DXD motif in the binding of the nucleotide sugar (21.Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,22.Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Based on the DXD motif and its conserved surrounding, the large clostridial cytotoxins appear to be related to some recently described putative glycosyltransferases. Among these proteins are a number of hypothetical enzymes that are part of capsular polysaccharide synthesis clusters in bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae cap8J and a related sequence in the C. difficile genome (23.Kolkman M.A.B. Wakarchuk W. Nuijten P.J.M. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24.Van Eldere J. Brophy L. Loynds B. Celis P. Hancock I. Carman S. Kroll J.S. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a group of yeast proteins related to the mannosyltransferase Och1p and a family of closely related proteins of E. coli EPEC and EHEC strains and a number of hypothetical proteins of Chlamydia trachomatisserotype D are homologous to large clostridial cytotoxins. All of these proteins share at least an extended form of the DXD motif and another short peptide motif containing a conserved tryptophan residue with the toxins (Fig. 1). Investigating the latter homology region by site-directed mutagenesis of an enzymatically active NH2-terminal fragment of C. sordellii lethal toxin, we observed only a small reduction (up to 50%) of enzyme activity with the alanine mutants of Lys-96, His-99, Gly-105, and Asp-109 (not shown). This decrease in activity might be caused by minor alterations of the tertiary structure, whereas a direct involvement of these residues in the catalytic process or substrate binding seems unlikely. Substitution of Trp-102, however, was found to have a major impact on enzyme activity of both the lethal toxin and the toxin B fragment. We observed a decrease in enzyme activity for all constructed mutants of this residue (Figs. 4 and 5). Because both glucosyltransferase and glycohydrolase activity were affected, an involvement of Trp-102 in the binding of the cosubstrate or the catalytic reaction was assumed. In line with this hypothesis, a similar decrease in glucosyltransferase activity was observed with two different protein substrates (Fig.3). Kinetic studies of different mutants of Trp-102 provided further insight into the role of this residue (Table I). As for the glycohydrolase reaction, we found about a 10-fold increase in theK m for the tyrosine mutant compared with the wild-type fragment, whereas k cat was slightly increased. From these results, a direct involvement of Trp-102 in the catalytic process could be excluded when k cat is taken as a measure for enzyme activity. The decrease in activity is rather caused by a reduction in binding affinity as theK m value is increased. The arginine and the alanine mutants showed no detectable glycohydrolase activity in our system, presumably reflecting the lower sensitivity of the glycohydrolase compared with the glucosyltransferase assay. With respect to the glucosyltransferase reaction of the tyrosine mutant, both the catalytic activity and the binding affinity to UDP-glucose were reduced. The alanine mutant showed an even more impaired efficiency, mainly because the K m for UDP-glucose was increased about 200-fold. This low in vitroactivity of the alanine mutant is reflected by its lack of cytotoxic activity when introduced into cells by microinjection or electroporation. The tyrosine mutant, however, showed a clearly detectable, albeit reduced, cytotoxic activity (Figs. 8 and 9). The decrease in k cat of the latter mutant observed with the glucosyltransferase reaction is contradictory to the findings with the glycohydrolase reaction. However, it is conceivable that the complex interactions in the three-component glucosyltransferase reaction are more sensitive to alterations in the enzyme's catalytic center than the glycohydrolase reaction. In contrast to recent findings, we found the glucohydrolase activity to be similar to the glucosyltransferase activity as the respectivek cat values were similar. This can be explained, however, by our using the relatively bad substrate GST-Rac for the determination of enzyme activity. From the experimental data shown in Fig. 3, turnover rates of the modification of GST-Rac or Ras were determined to be approximately 260 h−1 or 17,700 h−1, respectively. In conclusion, the results of the kinetic studies give evidence that the reduction in enzyme activity of Trp-102 mutants is mainly the result of a decrease in binding affinity for the cosubstrate UDP-glucose. These findings were corroborated further by tryptophan quenching experiments. We observed a quenching of about 20% with the cosubstrate UDP-glucose or the competitive inhibitor UDP-mannose, whereas the quenching effects of all other nucleotide diphosphate sugar used such as GDP-mannose (Fig. 7), UDP-GlcNAc, or GDP-glucose (not shown) were considerably lower. Because the quenching effect of UDP-glucose on the mutant protein W102Y.LT546 was reduced significantly, we conclude that the specific binding affinity of the mutant for the cosubstrate was decreased. Because of the low quenching effect we were unable to determine the K d for the mutant accurately. The overall low quenching of tryptophan fluorescence observed in our experiments implies that not all of the five tryptophan residues in the toxin fragment are involved in the interaction with the cosubstrate. Concerning the mode of the interaction of Trp-102 with the cosubstrate, it should be noted that the replacing Trp-102 with tyrosine resulted in the most active mutant, whereas the arginine mutant only exhibited a weak, hardly detectable activity (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in the Och1p-related yeast protein Sur1p, which shares the equivalents of Lys-96 and His-99 with the clostridial cytotoxins, the tryptophan residue is replaced by a tyrosine (Fig. 1 B). This leads us to hypothesize that Trp-102 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the cosubstrate UDP-glucose. Recently, two crystal structures of glycosyltransferases containing the DXD motif have been solved. These are the family 2 glycosyltransferase spsA from B. subtilis and the bovine β4-galactosyltransferase of family 7 (21.Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22.Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the homology of the amino acid sequences of these proteins is restricted to the DXD motif, they exhibit a similar fold of the catalytic core (26.Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both crystal structures comprise an aromatic residue that is involved in the stacking of the uracil ring of the cosubstrate in the catalytic fold. As found for the Trp-102 analog in the cytotoxin-related proteins, this conserved aromatic residue is located NH2-terminally of the DXD motif, and there is no strictly defined distance between this residue and the motif (Fig. 10). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that Trp-102 represents the analogous residue to the mentioned conserved aromatic residues. Furthermore, all glucosyltransferase family 2 members share several other conserved amino acids, all of which appear to be located within the nucleotide binding domain as determined by the crystal structures. This binding domain is most often located within the NH2-terminal half of the transferases, with the DXD motif representing its COOH-terminal end (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10, this structure can also be found in the proteins related to large clostridial cytotoxins. In conclusion, the large clostridial cytotoxins and the glucosyltransferase family 2 might share a similar architecture of their glucosyltransferase domain, with the nucleotide binding region located NH2-terminally of the region that binds to the sugar molecule and the acceptor. In this study, we have identified a conserved tryptophan residue that is essential for enzyme activity of large clostridial cytotoxins. A small group of proteins shares both the small motif in the vicinity of the tryptophan residue and an extended DXD motif with the toxins. Given the significance of those two motifs, it is conceivable that these proteins are also structurally related to large clostridial cytotoxins. Thus, we propose a family of large clostridial cytotoxin-related proteins."

More recently p38 JAB1 has been shown to promote the degradation of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and to be a component of the COP9 signalosome.

It does not appear to interact with the cell surface rLHR, however, and it does not affect its expression. When transfected into HeLa cells, p38 JAB1 potentiates the transcriptional activity of c-Jun, but co-transfection with rLHR prevents this effect. We conclude that p38 JAB1 interacts with the rLHR precursor and promotes its degradation.

While the functional consequences of these interactions have not always been clarified, it seems that the formation of such GPCR-protein complexes may result in the regulation of the activity of the associated protein, the activity of the associated GPCR, and/or the targeting and expression of GPCRs.

The Matchmaker™ two-hybrid system 2 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Using polymerase chain reaction-based strategies, we subcloned the C-terminal 42 residues of the rLHR (i.e. residues 632–674) into the pAS2–1 vector to generate a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. This plasmid was used as “bait” to screen a human kidney 293 cells cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector to generate fusion products with the GAL4 activation domain. This library was also purchased from CLONTECH. The full-length p38 identified from the two-hybrid screen was modified (by polymerase chain reaction) to have a consensus Kozak sequence immediately upstream of the initiator methionine and to encode for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus. The modified construct was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 for expression in mammalian cells. Human kidney 293T cells were plated in 60- or 100-mm plates and transfected (when ∼80% confluent) by overnight exposure to plasmid DNA co-precipitated with calcium phosphate as described by Chen and Okayama (27.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection as described elsewhere (28.Lazari M.F.M. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The lysates were diluted 2-fold with concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, resolved on SDS gels, and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described elsewhere (29.Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After blocking (29.Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) the blots were incubated overnight with 2–5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) to the HA epitope. A horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was then used during a 1-h incubation at a final dilution of 1:5,000 and the blots were finally developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system of detection from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For the subcellular fractionation experiments, the transiently transfected 293T cells (see above) were washed in an ice-cold solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, recovered by centrifugation and homogenized using 10 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon pestle at a speed of about 5,000 rpm. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pellets were re-homogenized and centrifuged again to give a final low speed pellet (called P1), and the supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to give a high speed pellet (P2) and a high speed supernatant (S2). The pellets were resuspended (by hand homogenization) in the buffer described above to give a suspension with a final volume identical to that of S2. Equal aliquots of each fraction were then diluted 2-fold with concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, resolved on SDS gels, and processed as described above. For the microscopy studies, the transfected 293T cells were trypsinized at the end of the overnight transfection and replated in polylysine-covered chambers. Twenty-four hours later, they were processed for microscopy using standard methods (30.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar) and the transfected HA-p38 was visualized by staining the cells with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml), followed by a rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse second antibody. The cells were ultimately examined using a Bio-Rad MRC laser scanning confocal microscope at the Central Microscopy Research Facility of the University of Iowa. Plasmids encoding for GST fusion proteins of the first (residues 365–373), second (residues 441–460), and third intracellular (residues 526–548) loop as well as the extreme C-terminal tail (residues 632–674) of the rLHR were generated by subcloning the indicated regions of the rLHR into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HA-tagged p38 JAB1 subcloned in pcDNA3.1 (see above) was linearized at the 3′ end and used to prepare in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled HA-p38 JAB1 with an in vitrotranscription-translation kit purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). For binding assays, 20 μg of the different GST fusion proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the [35S]methionine-labeled HA-p38 JAB1 in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4 (6.Klein U. Ramirez M.T. Kobilka B.K. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19099-19102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At the end of this incubation, each reaction received a 20 μl aliquot of a 50% suspension of glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same buffer and the incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature. The agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation, and they were washed two times with binding buffer and two times with 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, prior to elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted material was resolved on SDS gels, and the [35S]methionine-labeled HA-p38 JAB1 was detected with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Human kidney 293T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected (see above) with a constant amount of DNA (10 μg) containing different combination of three different plasmids, HA-p38 JAB1 (described above), an expression vector coding for the myc-tagged rLHR in pcDNA1/Neo (described in Ref. 31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and an empty expression vector (either pcDNA 3.1 or pcDNA1/Neo). Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The cells were then lysed during a 15-min incubation with ∼1 ml of a cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 60 mmoctylglucopyranoside, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and 1 ml aliquots (each containing the same amount of lysate protein) were rotated (overnight at 4 °C) with 50 μl of a 50-fold dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the HA epitope (polyclonal antibody HA.11 from BabCO) that had been prebound to 100 μl of 50% slurry of protein A. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, and the protein A beads were washed four times with 1-ml aliquots of cold lysis buffer and once with a 10-fold dilution of the cold lysis buffer. After the last wash, the beads were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 1 min. The eluted samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretic blots were prepared as described above. These blots were incubated overnight with a 1,000-fold dilution of a monoclonal antibody to the myc epitope (9E10) and ultimately developed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and the ECL detection system as described above. HeLa cells (provided to us by Dr. Dawn Quelle, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) were plated on 35-mm wells at a density of 2 × 105/well and were transfected (using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method described above) 24 h after plating. Each well was transfected with a constant amount of DNA (4.3 μg) containing a constant amount (0.1 μg) of the reporter plasmid (designated AP1-luc) and different amounts of four other plasmids. The AP1-luc plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) is a reporter plasmid encoding for the firefly luciferase gene driven by several copies of an AP-1 enhancer element. The other plasmids used were an empty vector (pcDNA 3.1 or pcDNA1/Neo), pRSV c-Jun (32.Farrow K.N. Manning N. Schaufele F. Gutierrez-Harmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (which was provided to us by Dr. Arthur Gutierrez-Hartman of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center), an expression vector coding for the myc-tagged rLHR in pcDNA1/Neo (described in Ref. 31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the expression vector for HA-p38 JAB1 described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). The methods used to measure the binding of125I-hCG to intact cells and their detergent extracts, the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine into the 68-kDa precursor of the rLHR, and the recovery of 125I-hCG binding following proteolysis of the mature cell surface rLHR have all been described (31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33.Min K.-S. Liu X. Fabritz J. Jaquette J. Abell A.N. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34911-34919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The only modification introduced here was that the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine into the 68-kDa precursor of the rLHR was measured using a PhosphorImager rather than by fluorography/densitometry. The rate of synthesis (S) and the rate constant for degradation (k deg) of the 68-kDa precursor were calculated by following the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine into the 68-kDa precursor of the rLHR as a function of time after addition the isotope. S andk deg were calculated from a nonlinear fit of these data (cf. Fig. 5) to Equation 1 (34.Berlin C.M. Schimke R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1965; 1: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar).[rLHR68] t=(S/kdeg)−(S/kdeg)e−kdeg×timeEquation 1 [rLHR68]t = amount of 35S incorporated into the 68-kDa rLHR precursor at time =t; S = rate of synthesis of the 68-kDa rLHR; and k deg = rate constant for degradation of the 68-kDa rLHR. If one assumes that the density of cell surface rLHR is dictated by the rate of externalization (E) and the rate constant for internalization (k int), these parameters can be calculated from the time course of recovery of 125I-hCG binding to the surface of proteolyzed cells as a function of time after removal of the protease (31.Fabritz J.

Nonlinear regressions were performed using the Delta Graph® software package, and they all had a regression coefficient of at least 0.95. Statistical analysis (t test with two-sided pvalues) was performed using Instat (Graph Pad Software). Human kidney 293T cells are a derivative of 293 cells that express the SV40T antigen (37.Margolskee R. McHenry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided to us by Dr. Marlene Hosey (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). HeLa cells were obtained from Dr. Dawn Quelle. The 9E10 hybridoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Purified hCG (CR-127, ∼15,000 IU/mg) was kindly provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). 125I-hCG was prepared using the purified hCG as described elsewhere (38.Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Partially purified hCG (∼3,000 IU/mg) was purchased from Sigma, and it was used only for the determination of nonspecific binding (see above). Cell culture medium was prepared by the Media and Cell Production Core, respectively, of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Other cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from commonly used suppliers. A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify candidate proteins that interact with the extreme C-terminal tail (residues 632–674) of the rLHR. Screening of about 107 transformants from a human kidney 293 cell library resulted in the isolation of about 30 clones that interacted with this portion of the rLHR. Five of these clones had a common insert with sequences identical to that of a human Jun activation domain-binding protein called JAB1 (GenBank™ accession no. U65928; Ref.22.Claret F.-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). One of these clones had a ∼1.3-kilobase pair insert that contained the entire open reading frame for JAB1. The insert of the chosen clone was excised, and it was modified at the 5′ end to encode for a consensus Kozak sequence (the sequence immediately upstream of the initiator ATG was changed from TCGGCC to GCCACC) and at the 3′ end and to encode for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) immediately upstream of the stop codon. The modified cDNA was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 for further studies. A protein (henceforth called HA-p38 JAB1) of the appropriate size (∼38 kDa) could be readily detected in Western blots of human kidney 293 cells transfected with the expression vector (Fig.1 A). Confocal microscopy of transfected cells revealed that HA-p38 JAB1 is distributed perinuclearly and throughout the cytosol in what appears to be small clusters (Fig. 1 B). This cytosolic localization was confirmed by subcellular fractionation experiments, which showed the presence of immunoreactive HA-p38 JAB1 almost exclusively in the high speed supernatant of homogenates of transfected cells (Fig. 1 C). An interaction between HA-p38 JAB1 and the rLHR could be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Fig.2 shows that 35S-labeled HA-p38 JAB1 prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation can bind to GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal tail (residues 632–674) or the third intracellular loop (residues 526–548) of the rLHR. It does not bind to GST fusion proteins of the first (residues 441–460) or the second (residues 526–548) intracellular loops of the rLHR or to GST, however. Thus, the bait used in the yeast two-hybrid screen represents only one of the two regions of the rLHR that interact with HA-p38 JAB1. More importantly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments done on lysates of 293 cells co-transfected with the myc-tagged rLHR and HA-p38 JAB1 also revealed an association of these two proteins in vivo (Fig. 3). There are two species of rLHR present in transfected cells, a ∼68-kDa intracellular precursor that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and a ∼85-kDa mature receptor that is localized at the plasma membrane (31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39.Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While both of these species are readily detectable in stably transfected cells (31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39.Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), immunoblots of cell lysates prepared from transiently transfected cells reveal only the 68-kDa precursor as a discrete band (identified by an arrow on theleft panel of Fig. 3). In transiently transfected cells the mature receptor is often identified as a smear or an aggregate at the top of the gels (Fig. 3, left panel). Anti HA-immunoprecipitates of lysates of cells co-transfected with HA-p38 JAB1 and myc-rLHR followed by blotting with an antibody to the myc epitope (9E10) revealed the presence of the 68-kDa precursor of the rLHR in the immunoprecipitates (identified by an arrow on theright panel of Fig. 3) but not that of the higher molecular weight forms of the rLHR. The presence of the mature form of the rLHR in these immunoprecipitates cannot be completely ruled out, however, due to its relative levels compared with that of the immature form (see left panel of Fig. 3 and Ref. 31.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally it should also be noted that the formation of an HA-p38 JAB1 /myc-rLHR complex could only be demonstrated by immunoprecipitating the lysates with an anti-HA antibody and probing the immunoprecipitates with an antibody to the myc epitope. Reversing the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and blotting could not be used to reveal such an association. An explanation for this finding was not sought. As mentioned above, HA-p38 JAB1 was initially identified by Claret and co-workers (22.Claret F.-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the activation domain of c-Jun as bait. These authors also showed that co-transfection of p38 JAB1 with c-Jun enhanced the transcriptional activation of c-Jun as measured in AP-1-driven transactivation assays. Since this is the only known functional assay for p38 JAB1, we used it in an attempt to further document an interaction between the rLHR and HA-p38 JAB1. The experiments presented on the left portion of Fig.4 reproduce some of the results initially published by Claret and co-workers (22.Claret F.-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These experiments readily demonstrate that 1) co-transfection of HeLa cells with c-Jun transactivates AP1-luc, a luciferase construct driven by the AP-1 promoter, 2) co-transfection of HeLa cells with HA-p38 JAB1 does not transactivate AP1-luc, and 3) co-transfection of Hela cells with c-Jun and HA-p38 JAB1 results in an enhancement of transactivation above and beyond that detected with c-Jun alone. Thus, whereas the relative luciferase activity of cells co-transfected with 0.1 μg of AP1-luc cDNA and 0.2 μg of c-Jun cDNA is ∼9, the addition of 2 or 5 μg of HA-p38 JAB1 cDNA to these transfection mixtur"
https://openalex.org/W2017566892,"Abstract Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in the negative regulation of receptor signaling, but its effect on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the intracellular pathways involved in IGF-1-induced activation of Akt and evaluated the effects of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on the Akt activation by IGF-1. IGF-1 induced a time- and concentration-dependent activation of Akt. The effect of IGF-1 was blocked by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 (50 μm) and wortmannin (0.5 μm), but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) or the p70 S6 kinase pathway inhibitor rapamycin (50 nm), suggesting that the stimulation of Akt by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway. Interestingly, cotreatment with PMA (400 nm) attenuated IGF-1-induced activation of Akt. The attenuation was blocked completely by the PKC inhibitor GO6983 (0.5 μm), but only partially by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm), indicating that MAPK-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. PMA induced the activation of PKC in PC12 cells, and this induction was blocked by GO6983. These data further support the role of PKC in the effect of PMA. Moreover, PKCδ is likely involved in the action of PMA on the basis of data obtained using isoform-specific inhibitors such as rottlerin. PMA also decreased IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and its association with PI3K. Taken together, these results suggest, for the first time, that stimulation of PKC modulates IGF-1-induced activation of Akt."

This polarized distribution of proteins at the cell surface allows for the transport of solutes across an epithelial cell layer in a directed, or vectorial, manner (1.Nelson W.J. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1993; 7: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2.Wagner M.C. Molitoris B.A. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1999; 13: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transport of Na+ and Cl− across an epithelial cell layer may result in the reabsorption or the secretion of solute. Epithelial Na+channels (ENaCs)1 are expressed on the apical membrane of selected epithelia that transport NaCl in an absorptive manner (3.Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol.

Several distinct epithelial Cl− channels are expressed in apical plasma membranes of secretory epithelia. These channels facilitate active Cl− secretion (11.Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Na+ is transported across secretory epithelia via paracellular pathways. Mutations in an epithelial, cAMP-regulated Cl− channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), are responsible for the cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype (12.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

As expected with mutations that lead to a loss of function of secretory Cl− channels, reduced epithelial secretions of NaCl in the airway, gastrointestinal tract, and certain exocrine organs results in changes in the viscosity of fluids which are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (15.Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Certain hormones that activate CFTR through a protein kinase A-mediated pathway have also been reported to activate ENaCs (16.Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17.Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J.

Whereas activation of CFTR in secretory epithelia will result in net NaCl secretion, activation of ENaC in absorptive epithelia will result in NaCl reabsorption. Selected epithelial cells, including those found in the airway, distal nephron, and sweat ducts, express both apical membrane ENaCs as well as CFTR. Activation of CFTR in these cells appears to be associated with Cl− reabsorption (19.Stanton B.A. Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 1997; 109: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Quinton P.M. Reddy M.M. Jpn. J.

In this setting, activation of both CFTR and ENaC might result in dramatic increases in NaCl entry into cells and associated cell swelling. Under these circumstances, mechanisms to modulate NaCl entry are required to avoid large shifts in cell volume. Several groups, including ours, have demonstrated in selected epithelial as well as nonepithelial cell types that activation of CFTR is associated with an inhibition of ENaCs (23.Ismailov I.I.

CFTR inhibits Na+ channel open probability (16.Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 266: C1061-C1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanism(s) underlying this inhibition have not been clearly defined. In contrast, CFTR expression in sweat duct is required for activation of ENaC by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated mechanisms (31.Reddy M.M. Light M.J. Quinton P.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the coordinate regulation of apical plasma membrane Na+ and Cl− channels, we examined whether ENaCs regulate CFTR. Our results demonstrate that forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)-stimulated CFTR Cl− currents are increased significantly in the presence of ENaC, suggesting that ENaCs regulate CFTR. Reagents were purchased from vendors listed below or from Sigma Chemical Co. Human CFTR and mouse α-, β-, and γENaC cRNAs (32.Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit (m-MESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). cRNA concentrations were measured spectroscopically, and the amounts of cRNA injected into oocytes are indicated under “Results” or in figure legends. Adult female Xenopus laevis were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI) and Xenopus-1 (Ann Arbor, MI). Oocytes were isolated and defolliculated by collagenase treatment. Oocytes were then placed in SOS (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin at 16 °C. Whole-cell current measurements were made 2 days after cRNA injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Single oocytes were placed in a 1-ml chamber containing modified ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 5.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, by NaOH), connected to a reference bath electrode by a 3 m KCl-agar bridge. Conventional two-electrode voltage clamp was performed at room temperature using an OC-725C oocyte clamp amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) connected to a PowerMac 7100 via an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, NY). Pulse+PulseFit software (HEKA elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) was used to ramp the applied transmembrane potential (V m) at 10-s intervals from −60 to 60 mV (with reference to the bath) at a rate of 16 mV/s. V mwas clamped at the prestimulation reversal potential between the voltage ramps. Transmembrane current (I) andV m were digitized at 200 Hz during the voltage ramps and recorded directly onto a hard disk. To reduce signal noise, a fifth-order polynomial was fitted to the rawI-V m curve from each voltage ramp. Ion replacement studies were performed by replacing NaCl in the ND96 solution either with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) Cl to produce a Na+-free extracellular environment or with Na+ methanesulfonate− to produce a Cl−-free extracellular environment. The differences in the whole-cell conductance measured in the presence and in the absence of 100 μm amiloride were used to define the amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance that is carried by ENaC. Activation of CFTR was accomplished by perfusion of the oocyte with buffers supplemented with 100 μm IBMX and 10 μm forskolin for 30 min. In all experiments, CFTR Cl− conductance was defined as the difference in conductance measured 30 min after perfusion with 10 μmforskolin and 100 μm IBMX (forskolin/IBMX) and the conductance measured prior to forskolin/IBMX stimulation. When indicated, 50 μm DPC or 200 μm DIDS was added to the perfusion buffer. The whole-cell conductance and reversal potential (E rev) were evaluated from the slope and x intercept, respectively, of the background-correctedI-V m curve using Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Whole-cell currents were measured at −50 mV. Single channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration. Pipette and bath solutions were Na+-free and contained (in mm): 96 NMDG Cl, 1 KCl, 0.2 CaCl2, 5.8 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NMDG. Electrical signals were amplified using a Dagan PC-one amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN), digitized by DigiData 1200 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and stored on disk. Pclamp7 (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. All data were collected at room temperature and were filtered at 300 Hz. Closed states of less than 20 ms and open states of less than 50 ms were ignored in analyses of open probability. Continuous recording of greater than 6-min duration with a minimum of 50 opening events was used to determine open probability and the number of channels within a patch. Recordings were performed between 30 min and 3 h after stimulation with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μmIBMX. TheXenopus oocyte expression system was used to examine the functional expression of hCFTR and αβγmENaC because this system readily allows for the expression and detection of a variety of exogenous ion channels at the oocyte plasma membrane. Oocytes injected with 10 ng of hCFTR cRNA were bathed in a solution containing 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX to activate endogenous protein kinase A and hCFTR. Whole-cell conductance was monitored by two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig.1 A). An 11-fold increase in whole-cell conductance, from 6.5 ± 1.5 μS to 73 ± 8 μS was observed in response to the addition of forskolin and IBMX (Fig.1 B, n = 38, p < 0.01). No forskolin/IBMX-activated conductance was observed in water-injected oocytes (data not shown). We previously isolated and characterized cDNAs encoding the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the mouse ENaC (32.Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with αβγmENaC cRNAs (3.3 ng/subunit) expressed an amiloride-sensitive whole-cell conductance of 75 ± 12 μS (Fig.2). An amiloride-sensitive whole-cell conductance was not observed in water-injected oocytes (data not shown). It was reported previously that co-expression of CFTR and ENaC inXenopus oocytes inhibited ENaC-mediated Na+conductance (29.Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R.

We used the oocyte expression system to examine whether ENaCs regulate CFTR. Oocytes were co-injected with human CFTR (10 ng) and mouse αβγENaC (3.3 ng/subunit) cRNAs, and whole-cell conductances were determined by two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, an amiloride-sensitive conductance of 81 ± 11 μS was observed in the absence of forskolin/IBMX (n = 38). However, after CFTR had been fully activated by forskolin/IBMX, no amiloride-sensitive whole-cell conductance was observed (268 ± 29 μS pre-amiloride; 274 ± 29 μS, post-amiloride, (n = 38); Fig. 3 C). In addition, replacement of Na+ with the impermeant cation NMDG in the bath solution did not significantly affect the forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductance (241 ± 29 μS, Na+ bath; 261 ± 32 μS, NMDG bath (n = 9); Fig.4), confirming the functional inhibition of ENaC expression after CFTR activation, in agreement with previous observations (29.Chabot H.

Additional experiments were performed to determine whether the forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductance in oocytes co-injected with hCFTR and mENaC cRNAs was mediated primarily by hCFTR. Replacement of Cl− with the impermeant anion methanesulfonate− (Fig. 6(n = 10)) in the bath solution resulted in a significant transient increase in the inward whole-cell current when the voltage was clamped at a hyperpolarizing potential (−50 mV). The maximum increase of the inward current was achieved within 30 s after ion replacement (data not shown). Furthermore, the forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductance in oocytes co-injected with hCFTR and mENaC cRNAs was blocked by 50 μm DPC (Fig.7 A (n = 10)) but was insensitive to 200 μm DIDS (Fig. 7 B(n = 10)). Taken together, these results indicate that the forskolin/IBMX-stimulated conductance in oocytes co-injected with hCFTR and αβγmENaC cRNAs was largely mediated by hCFTR (35.Schwiebert E.M. Flotte T.

Whole-cell currents were measured with the voltage clamped at a hyperpolarizing potential (−50 mV) 30 min after the addition of 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX to the bath solution. Currents were measured in a NaCl bath solution (white bars) and approximately 30 s after perfusion of a solution in which NaCl was replaced with Na+ methanesulfonate− (black bars).

Xenopus oocytes were injected with 10 ng of hCFTR or co-injected with 10 ng of hCFTR and 10 ng of αβγmENaC (3.3 ng/subunit). After stimulation with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX (white bars, panel A), whole-cell conductances were measured before and after the addition of 50 μm DPC (black bars; panel A) or 200 μm DIDS (panel B) to the bath solution. Whole-cell conductances in oocytes expressing hCFTR (73.2 ± 5.7 μS (−DPC), 18.9 ± 6.2 μS (+DPC), n = 10,p < 0.01) or co-expressing hCFTR and αβγmENaC cRNAs (269 ± 37 μS (−DPC), 56 ± 13 μS (+DPC),n = 10, p < 0.01) were significantly inhibited by 50 μm DPC. Whole-cell conductances in oocytes expressing hCFTR (89.2 ± 12.5 μS (−DIDS), 85.2 ± 11.8 μS (+DIDS), n = 10, p > 0.2) or co-expressing hCFTR and αβγmENaC cRNAs (241 ± 29 μS (−DIDS), 226 ± 23 μS (+DIDS), n = 10,p > 0.2) were not inhibited by 200 μmDIDS.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enhancement of hCFTR Cl− conductance observed when hCFTR was co-expressed with αβγmENaC in Xenopusoocytes was dependent on the amount of αβγmENaC cRNA injected. Oocytes co-injected with 10 ng of hCFTR and 2 ng (0.67 ng/subunit) of αβγmENaC cRNAs exhibited a forskolin/IBMX-stimulated conductance (162 ± 27 μS; n = 8) that was only 1.6-fold greater that the forskolin/IBMX-stimulated conductance observed in oocytes injected with 10 ng of hCFTR alone (101 ± 19;n = 8; p < 0.05, CFTRversus CFTR/ENaC; Fig. 8). The forskolin/IBMX-stimulated hCFTR Cl− conductance increased significantly when hCFTR was co-expressed with αβγmENaC inXenopus oocytes compared with oocytes expressing hCFTR alone. Increases in whole-cell hCFTR Cl− conductance could result from increases in hCFTR single channel conductance, hCFTR open probability, or in the number of hCFTR Cl− channels expressed at the plasma membrane. Human CFTR single channel Cl− conductance was determined by cell-attached patch clamp analyses of forskolin/IBMX-stimulated hCFTR Cl−channels expressed in the presence or absence of αβγmENaC. Analyses of hCFTR single channel current/voltage relationships revealed similar slope conductances (6.7 pS (hCFTR) and 6.9 pS (hCFTR/αβγmENaC)) (Fig. 9). Pipette resistance was similar in both groups (30.0 ± 5.9 megohms (hCFTR,n = 8); 35.1 ± 4.3 megohms (hCFTR/αβγmENaC,n = 9); p > 0.4). Eighteen hCFTR Cl− channels were observed in 16 patches in oocytes injected with hCFTR alone, whereas 42 hCFTR Cl− channels were observed in 16 patches in oocytes co-expressing hCFTR and αβγmENaC (p < 0.002), suggesting that the number of hCFTR Cl− channels expressed at the plasma membrane was increased when hCFTR was co-expressed with αβγmENaC. The average open probability was 0.11 ± 0.02 (n = 11) in oocytes expressing hCFTR alone. This was significantly less than the average open probability of 0.27 ± 0.04 (n = 10) observed in oocytes co-expressing hCFTR and αβγmENaC (p < 0.004, hCFTR versushCFTR/αβγmENaC (Fig. 9 D)). These data suggest that increases in hCFTR Cl− whole-cell conductance, when hCFTR is co-expressed with αβγmENaC, occur in conjunction with an increase in both hCFTR open probability and in the number of hCFTR Cl− channels expressed at the plasma membrane. Epithelial Na+ channels are composed of at least three structurally related subunits (38.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were detectable in oocytes injected with αENaC cRNA, but at levels that are ∼100-fold less than Na+ currents observed in oocytes injected with αβγENaC cRNAs (38.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 39.Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). No detectable amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were observed in oocytes injected with βENaC or γENaC cRNAs (38.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). We examined whether co-expression of CFTR with individual ENaC subunit cRNAs altered the levels of functional CFTR expression (Fig.10). The forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductance was 49 ± 10 μS in oocytes injected with 5 ng of hCFTR cRNA alone. The forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductance increased to 109 ± 23 μS in oocytes co-injected with 5 ng of hCFTR and of 5 ng αmENaC cRNAs (p < 0.03, hCFTR versus hCFTR/αmENaC (n = 7)) and to 90 ± 16 μS in oocytes co-injected with hCFTR and βmENaC cRNAs (p < 0.05, hCFTR versushCFTR/βmENaC (n = 7)). These data suggested that co-expression of hCFTR with individual mENaC subunits (αmENaC or βmENaC) enhanced functional hCFTR expression in Xenopusoocytes. Forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole-cell conductances measured in oocytes injected with hCFTR and γmENaC cRNAs (62 ± 13 μS) or in oocytes injected with hCFTR cRNA alone were not significantly different (p > 0.2, hCFTR versushCFTR/γmENaC (n = 7)). These data suggest that the enhancement of functional hCFTR expression by mENaC inXenopus oocytes is subunit-specific. Moreover, the absence of an effect of γmENaC on functional hCFTR expression suggested that the functional activation of hCFTR by αβγmENaC or by selected mENaC subunits is a specific effect and is not simply related to co-injection of an irrelevant cRNA with hCFTR cRNA. In addition to its primary function as a Cl− channel, CFTR functions as a regulator of several other epithelial ion channels (26.Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol.

Through these interactions, it appears that CFTR has an important role in regulation of the content and volume of fluids in airways, intestines, pancreas, sweat ducts, and renal tubules.

CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC may involve autocrine or paracrine signaling and G protein-coupled signaling mechanisms, changes in intracellular Cl− concentration that may alter ENaC activity, or perhaps direct interactions between CFTR and ENaC (25.Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 48.Cook D.I. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Eur. J.

The inhibition of ENaC by CFTR may be dependent on an intact first nucleotide binding domain and does not require expression of a full-length CFTR protein (33.Schreiber R. Hopf A. Mall M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5310-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ability of CFTR mutants to transport Cl−correlates with their ability to inhibit ENaC; i.e. CFTR mutants that express low levels of Cl− currents inXenopus oocytes are inefficient in inhibiting functional expression of ENaC (34.Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar); however, CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC is not necessarily dependent on the magnitude of Cl− current (29.Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that interactions between the CFTR and ENaC are more complex than suggested previously. The cAMP-regulated conductance in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC was significantly greater than that observed in oocytes expressing CFTR alone (Fig. 5), in agreement with a recent observation by Chabot and co-workers (29.Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This enhanced conductance observed in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC was blocked by the CFTR inhibitor DPC (35.Schwiebert E.M. Flotte T. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1464-C1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.McCarty N.A. McDonough S. Cohen B.N. Riordan J.R. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was insensitive to DIDS, a stilbene derivative that does not block CFTR but inhibits other anion transporters (35.Schwiebert E.M. Flotte T. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1464-C1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Cliff W.H. Schoumacher R.A. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1154-C1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and was not dependent on the presence of a permeant extracellular cation (i.e. Na+, see Figs. 4 and 7). These data suggest that this enhanced conductance in forskolin/IBMX-stimulated oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC is a result of increased activity of CFTR Cl− channels. The increase in CFTR Cl− conductance observed in oocytes co-expressing αβγ-mENaC was dependent on the amount of ENaC cRNA injected into oocytes (Figs. 5 and 8). Co-expression of CFTR with individual ENaC subunits enhanced Cl− conductance but in a subunit-specific manner (Fig. 10). An enhanced activation of CFTR occurred with co-expression of either the α- or β-subunits of ENaC but not with the γ subunit. This enhanced activation of CFTR observed with individual α- or β-mENaC subunits (2.2- fold and 1.8-fold, respectively) was considerably less than that observed with αβγ-mENaC (3.7-fold). The enhanced functional expression of CFTR Cl− channels which we observed with co-expression of ENaC was not dependent on expression of functional Na+ channels. Low levels of expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+currents have been reported in Xenopus oocytes expressing αENaC alone (38.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 39.Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and no amiloride-sensitive Na+currents have been observed in oocytes expressing βENaC alone (38.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). When ENaC subunits are expressed individually in Xenopusoocytes, the subunits are found primarily within intracellular compartments (50.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the co-expression of individual ENaCs with CFTR might result in increased functional CFTR expression by altering CFTR maturation or intracellular trafficking, leading to an enhanced cell surface expression of CFTR (see below). An increase of CFTR Cl− conductance was not observed in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and γENaC, suggesting that specific domains within the α- or β-subunits of ENaC are likely important in conferring the ability of ENaC to regulate the functional expression of CFTR. Consistent with this notion, previous work examining ENaC interactions with CFTR using a yeast two-hybrid approach also suggested that limited domains within αENaC were capable of binding CFTR through its NBD1/R domain (25.Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to define the mechanism(s) by which α- or βENaC alters functional CFTR Cl− channel expression. The increase in the whole-cell CFTR Cl− conductance observed in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC reflects changes in one or more of the following variables: single channel conductance, open probability, and the number of channels at the cell surface. Single channel analyses of CFTR Cl− channels indicated that CFTR single channel conductances were nearly identical in oocytes expressing CFTR alone and in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC (Fig. 9). The open probability of CFTR Cl− channels was increased significantly when CFTR was co-expressed with αβγENaC. However, this 2.5-fold increase in CFTR Cl− channel open probability did not account for the 3.7-fold increase in whole-cell conductance which we observed when CFTR Cl− channels were co-expressed with αβγENaC, suggesting that the number of CFTR Cl− channels at the plasma membrane of the oocytes was increased as well. Consistent with this notion, a significantly greater number of CFTR Cl− channels was observed in cell-attached patches of oocytes co-expressing CFTR and αβγENaC (42 channels in 16 patches) than were observed in oocytes expressing CFTR alone (18 channels in 16 patches). Additional studies using biochemical approaches to determine CFTR surface expression are needed to confirm this observation and to determine mechanisms by which αβγENaC enhances plasma membrane expression of CFTR. Increases in levels of plasma membrane expression of CFTR might arise from changes in CFTR biosynthesis, maturation, recruitment to the plasma membrane, or retrieval from the plasma membrane. Although the concept that one ion channel species (i.e.CFTR) regulates other ion channels is well established, it is unclear whether this phenomenon is broad or limited in scope. Coordinate regulation of Na+ and Cl− transport proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelia provides a mechanism by which epithelial cells can modulate rates of NaCl reabsorption in response to agonists. This is particularly important within selected regions of the lung, sweat duct, salivary gland, and kidney sites where epithelial cells reabsorb NaCl and express both ENaC and CFTR (19.Stanton B.A. Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 1997; 109: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Quinton P.M. Reddy M.M. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1994; 44: S207-S213PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Verrey F. J. Membr.

Protein kinase A-mediated activation of CFTR in epithelia expressing both CFTR and ENaC results in increased transepithelial Cl− reabsorption as well as an inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels as a result of reduced Na+ channel open probability (16.Stutts M.J.

In the absence of CFTR expression, ENaC is activated by agonists that activate protein kinase A because of increases in Na+ channel open probability or in the number of channels expressed at the plasma membrane (16.Stutts M.J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: F506-F511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the regulatory interactions between CFTR Cl−channels and epithelial Na+ channels provide a mechanism by which selected epithelia can modulate net NaCl entry across the apical membrane in response to agonists that would otherwise activate both CFTR and ENaC. In this regard, an enhanced activity of CFTR might augment CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC. These interactions provide a cellular mechanism by which certain epithelia limit increases in cell volume which might otherwise occur if CFTR and ENaC were activated in parallel. In summary, our results indicate that, in addition to acting as an ion channel and a regulator of other ion channels (including ENaC), CFTR activity is regulated by ENaC. Simply stated, Na+ channels are not innocent bystanders; ENaCs are active participants in this regulatory phenomenon.

Therefore, proteins of the complex plastids, which are encoded in the cell nucleus, must cross three or four membranes during transport to the plastid. To study this process we have developed a method for isolating transport-competent two membrane-bound plastids derived from the complex plastids of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta. This in vitroprotein import system provides the first non-heterologous system for studying the import of proteins into four-membrane complex plastids.

This membrane pair, called the plastid envelope, contains the translocons Tic and Toc. As shown in higher plants, these allow specific transport of proteins from the cytoplasm into the stroma (e.g. Ref.1May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, most alga groups harbor plastids surrounded by three or four membranes. Such plastids, termed complex plastids, have evolved in secondary endocytobiosis (2Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Delwiche C.F. Palmer J.D. Plant Syst. Evol. 1997; 11 (suppl.): 53-863Crossref Google Scholar, 4Gilson P.R.

In the case of haptophytes and heterokonts the plastid is surrounded by four membranes, whereas in euglenophytes and most dinophytes the plastid envelope consists of three membranes. Chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes (harboring complex plastids with four membranes, respectively) are unique in respect to their plastid morphology (Fig.1). This occurs because a narrow eukaryotic cytoplasmic compartment containing an additional pigmy nucleus called the nucleomorph exists between the outer and inner membrane pair (5McFadden G.I. Gilson P.R. Douglas S.E. Cavalier-Smith T. Hofmann C.J.B. Maier U.-G. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 46-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although knowledge on protein transport into chloroplasts of green plants and the components of the translocation machinery is rapidly increasing (1May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and first studies on protein import in Cyanophora were regarded (6Jakowitsch J. Neumann-Spallart C. Ma Y. Steiner J. Schenk H.E. Bohnert H.J. Löffelhardt W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), little is known about the transport of proteins into complex plastids. In these, the plastid proteins encoded in the cell nucleus have to cross three or four membranes to reach the stroma. These imported proteins contain an N-terminal extension, which is built up as a bipartite presequence (e.g. Refs. 7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 8Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Topology predictions suggest that the N-terminal part of the preprotein are similar to signal sequences in the first part and to transit peptides in the second part. In the case of Euglena it was shown that translocation of proteins into the stroma involves translocation of the preprotein into the ER,1 vesicular transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus, and fusing of Golgi vesicles with the outermost membrane of the plastid of Euglena (9Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13084-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown how proteins cross intermediate and inner plastid membrane of Euglena. The study of protein transport into complex plastids surrounded by four membranes was started by the isolation of physiologically active, but transport-incompetent, plastids from a diatom (11Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was found that nuclear-encoded plastid proteins from diatoms were imported into canine microsomes where they were processed (7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Bhaya D. Grossman A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By using heterologous pea and spinach chloroplasts, Kroth and co-workers (7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the transit peptide of the γ-subunit of the plastid ATPase fromOdontella sinensis led to import into the stroma of these heterologous chloroplasts. Today transformation techniques are established for the use of protein import studies in diatoms and apicomplexa (5McFadden G.I. Gilson P.R. Douglas S.E. Cavalier-Smith T. Hofmann C.J.B. Maier U.-G. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 46-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Apt K.E. Kroth-Panic P. Grossman A.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 572-579PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we present evidence that in cryptomonads the first step in translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins into the stroma of complex plastids involves co-translational translocation via an ER-like membrane. By developing a method for the isolation of transport-competent plastids from a cryptomonad, we demonstrate for the first time import of nucleomorph-encoded proteins into homologous complex plastids. Furthermore, a model for the translocation of nucleus- and nucleomorph-encoded proteins into the stroma is presented. All constructs used have been reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-amplified from G. theta RNA (14Müller S.B. Rensing S.A. Martin W.F. Maier U.-G. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Sequencing the inserts has been done on ALF-Express (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 7-deaza-dGTP. The full-length gapC1 gene (15Liaud M.F. Brandt U. Scherzinger M. Cerff R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44 Suppl. 1: 28-37Crossref Google Scholar) was amplified by the use of 5′-GCAAAAATGGCGTACTTCAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CTATTAGGCCTTGACCTTGG-3′. Deletion of the signal sequence encoding domain of G. theta gapC1 gene was obtained with the forward primer 5′-CAACATGGGATCCTCCTTTGTTCC-3′ (introducing a new translation start) and the reverse primer 5′-CTATTAGGCCTTGACCTTGG-3′. The nucleomorph gene encoding rubredoxin was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CGCGTCGTTTTACATATGTTTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGATAGGATCCAGCCTATTC-3′. G. thetacells were treated with 10 μg·ml−1Brefeldin A (solubilized in methanol) or only with methanol as a control. After 4 h, the cryptomonad cells were fixed and embedded in Epon 812 according to instructions from the manufacturer. Chloroplasts derived from pea seedlings (10–12 days) were isolated according to standard protocols described previously (16Bonk M. Hoffmann B. Von Lintig J. Schledz M. Al-Babili S. Hobeika E. Kleinig H. Beyer P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For isolation of G. theta plastids a modified procedure for isolation of Euglena plastids (17Ortiz W. Reardon E.M. Price C.A. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 291-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. One liter of algae was harvested for 10 min at 1,500 × g and resuspended in 10 ml of isoosmotic buffer (400 mm sorbitol, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) proteinase K and incubated on a shaker for approximately 60 min. When cells became round-shaped (controlled by phase contrast microscopy), 20 ml of resuspension buffer containing 100 mmPefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as inhibitor for proteinase K was added to the cells. Harvesting the cells occurred for 5 min at 2,500 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of breaking buffer (250 mm sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, 0.4 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.4). By the use of a Waring blender, cells were disrupted for 20 s. First centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g pelleted still intact cells. Centrifugation of the supernatant for 5 min at 2,500 ×g yielded the crude plastid fraction as the pellet. Carefully, resuspension of the pellet in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 1% (w/v) Ficoll, 5 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCl, pH 6.8) and centrifugation on a discontinuous 50:30% Percoll gradient for 12 min at 11,000 × gresulted in a red band representing intact plastids at the boundary of the two Percoll cushions. Broken plastids (green color) remained at the top of the 30% Percoll cushion. After collecting, the intact plastids were washed twice in import buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6) before chlorophyll determination and subsequent use for import reactions. In vitro transcription and translation of the constructs were performed using the coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation system (TNT system, Promega). Translation of the template was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocol. Co-translational import was obtained by adding canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega, Madison, MI) to the in vitro transcription/translation reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. Post-translational import of labeled precursor proteins into pea chloroplast and G. theta plastids took place in 100-μl assays containing chloroplasts/plastids (equivalent to 15 μg of chlorophyll) in import buffer with 2 mm ATP, 20 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm methionine, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 2% bovine serum albumin. After addition of labeled in vitro translation product, the import mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C for pea chloroplasts and 10 min at 25 °C for G. theta plastids, respectively. Termination of import was obtained by centrifugation the chloroplasts for 1 min at 1,000 × g. After washing in import buffer, chloroplasts were redissolved in 100 μl of import buffer and subjected to thermolysin treatment (0.1% (w/v) thermolysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 mm CaCl2final concentration for 10 min on ice to digest external protein of the import mixture. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm, followed by a centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion (4,500 × g, 5 min) recovering intact plastids. After washing the plastids and centrifugation, harvested chloroplasts were redissolved immediately in sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Nuclear-encoded but plastid-localized proteins in complex plastids show similar N termini. These consist of a bipartite presequence with two distinct domains that are compositionally similar to those in complex plastids of different algal groups and members of the apicomplexa (18Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Previously, studies with heterologous transport systems have involved complex plastid proteins (e.g. the γ-subunit of the chloroplast ATPase from the diatom O. sinensis, see Ref. 7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As part of the present work we also report the heterologous transport for the first nuclear-encoded protein (GapDH, see Ref. 15Liaud M.F. Brandt U. Scherzinger M. Cerff R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44 Suppl. 1: 28-37Crossref Google Scholar) from the cryptophyte G. theta using two preproteins. These are the complete GapDH precursor, which has an intact bipartite transit peptide, and a modified precursor GapDH, which has had the signal sequence deleted. In order to test if the putative N-terminal signal peptide of nuclear-encoded chloroplastic GapDH fromG. theta (15Liaud M.F. Brandt U. Scherzinger M. Cerff R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44 Suppl. 1: 28-37Crossref Google Scholar) is sufficient for co-translational import in an ER-like mechanism, we translated in vitro the GapDH gene in the presence of canine microsomes. Analysis of these products by SDS-PAGE showed two bands with an apparent molecular mass of 43 and 40 kDa (Fig. 2). The upper band disappeared when thermolysin was added to the reaction, whereas the lower band was protease-resistant. In the presence of Triton X-100 and thermolysin the upper and lower bands disappeared, leading to the conclusion that the lower band is the processed microsome import product and that the N-terminal few amino acids of the GapDH protein are a signal peptide. In heterokonts and cryptophytes the outermost membrane of the complex plastid is covered on the cytoplasmic side with ribosomes; therefore, this membrane has been referred to as “chloroplast” ER (19Gibbs S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test if this membrane behaves like an ER membrane, we incubated G. theta cells with Brefeldin A, a hydrophobic compound produced by toxic fungi that inhibits anterograde vesicle transport (2Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). After incubation, the cells were embedded, cut thin, and visualized by means of electron microscopy. Under the conditions used, characteristic changes were observed, the Golgi apparatus disassembled and the ER became dilated (Fig. 3,A and B). Furthermore, the space between the outermost and the second membrane of the complex plastid also became dilated (Fig. 3 C). Our observations that (i) ribosomes were attached to the outermost membrane, (ii) that Brefeldin A influenced the plastid membrane, and (iii) that the transport of GapDH occurred across microsome membranes strongly suggest that the first step in translocation of proteins into complex plastids is identical with co-translational ER translocation. The second part of the bipartite signal peptide of the nuclear-encoded but plastid-located preproteins has the characteristics of transit peptides. We used the truncated GapDH for import into heterologous chloroplasts. As shown in Fig. 4, the truncated GapDH (pGapDH) can pass the plastid envelope of pea chloroplasts, demonstrated by the fact that the lower processed band (representing the mature protein) is protease-resistant and is digested when Triton and thermolysin are added after the import reaction. However, pea chloroplasts are a heterologous system to study import of cryptomonad proteins. Therefore, we developed a method to isolate two membrane-surrounded plastids from cryptomonads which is, to our knowledge, the first example of transport-competent plastids from an organism with plastids surrounded by four membranes. Cryptomonads contain a second nucleus, the nucleomorph, which is located in between the outer and inner membrane pair in a narrow cytoplasm, the periplastidal compartment (Fig. 1). Plastid proteins encoded by this vestigial nucleus offers the unique possibility to investigate homologous protein transport across two membranes within these complex plastids. By sequencing the chromosomes of the nucleomorph of G. theta(4Gilson P.R. Maier U.-G. McFadden G.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Zauner S.

A. 2000; 97: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that in the nucleomorph a variety of plastid-located proteins are encoded (20Zauner S. Fraunholz M. Wastl J. Penny S.

Evol. 1999; 48: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, these proteins possess an N-terminal extension in comparison to their cyanobacterial homologs. However, these stretches revealed no similarity to known transit peptides from plants and green algae as predicted by PSORT and ChloroP V1.0. In order to investigate homologous transport of nucleomorph-encoded plastid proteins into plastids, we have used rubredoxin, a non-heme iron protein (23Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is encoded on chromosome II of the cryptomonad alga G. theta. For this we have developed a method to isolate plastids from G. theta. Fig. 5 A shows a Percoll density gradient indicating the plastid fraction. Light microscopic analysis (Fig. 5 B) indicated that the plastid fraction was devoid of contaminations of other cell compartments. By using of these plastids, we investigated protein translocation into homologous plastids. Fig. 6 shows the result of rubredoxin transport with into cryptomonad plastids. Cleavage of the precursor (pRub) accompanied the translocation of rubredoxin. The molecular mass of the protease-resistant mature rubredoxin (mRub) is approximately 11 kDa, demonstrating that our protocol for the isolation of cryptomonad plastids indeed led to transport-competent plastids. A processed protease-resistant band with similar molecular mass is also identified by using rubredoxin for the import into the heterologous pea chloroplasts (data not shown). If a construct without the coding sequence for the 56 N-terminal amino acids was used, no translocation across two membrane-bound plastids occurred (data not shown). In further experiments, we used the truncated GapDH (pGapDH) under the same conditions for import experiments in cryptomonad plastids. Interestingly, with this protein no import could be detected (data not shown) implicating a different entry pathway of nuclear-encoded proteins into the stroma. In cryptomonads as well as in diatoms plastid-located but nuclear-encoded proteins pass the first membrane co-translationally (this study and Refs. 7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 12Bhaya D. Grossman A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By using a homologous import system in this study, we have shown that for nucleomorph-encoded plastid proteins the third and inner membrane resembles a plastid envelope, as known from higher plants. Therefore, translocons similar to Tic and Toc, characterized in chloroplasts of higher plants (24Soll J. Tien R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 191-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may also be involved in transport across the third and fourth plastid membrane of cryptomonads complex plastids. This is also further suggested from the observation that, in the nucleomorph genome, some proteins homologous to the pea translocon machinery are encoded. 2J. Wastl and U.-G. Maier, unpublished results. Our results show that import of nucleomorph-encoded proteins into plastids is comparable to that of proteins into pea chloroplasts. This leads to the conclusion that the N-terminal extension of nucleomorph-encoded proteins (e.g. rubredoxin) is sufficient to direct the precursor into the plastid compartment. Processing of precursor proteins also seems to occur in a similar manner. Nevertheless, our homologous import system is not efficient for nuclear-encoded plastid proteins, which leads us to speculate that import of nuclear proteins into the stroma uses another mechanism. This is suggested by the fact that the possible transit peptides of the nuclear proteins are compositionally different from those of the nucleomorph-encoded proteins, which show a conserved stretch at its N terminus. Such a different import mechanism could be founded in the transport of nuclear proteins across the second membrane, a process that still seems to be uncharacterized. Previously it was thought that nuclear-encoded proteins with a plastid destination could be transported across the second membrane by a vesicularly mediated system (19Gibbs S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In electron microscopic studies on chromophytes vesicle-like structures were visible in the space between the second and third membrane (25Gibbs S.P. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 253-266PubMed Google Scholar). If a vesicle-mediated transport system is used, two possibilities for the further destination of the vesicles arise. First, the vesicles are uncoated in the space between the second and third membrane, leading to free proteins within the periplastidal space. Second, the vesicles fuse with the third membrane, and plastid proteins will be transported by this process into the space between the third and fourth membrane. Another possibility is that translocation across the second membrane occurs as the result of a specific, protein-based mechanism. In this case membrane proteins used for protein transport across the cytoplasmic membrane of the eukaryotic symbiont could have evolved to an import system, or components of the translocon machinery of the plastid envelope were relocated into the second membrane, a process mentioned recently (26Cavalier-Smith T. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that the N-terminal signal sequence is used for a co-translational translocation across the outermost membrane. Therefore, if the signal sequence is cleaved by crossing the outermost membrane, the only known topogenic signal that is left in the preprotein is the transit peptide. In cryptomonads the outermost membrane is continuous with the ER. Thus, a mixture of proteins for the exocytose pathway and for a plastid destination must be postulated for the space between the first and second membrane. If so, a specific sorting mechanism needs to exist to discriminate between the proteins requiring different subcellular localization. Pores for nonspecific protein transport as suggested for the complex plastids of diatoms (7Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) would be insufficient in the case of cryptophytes. Unlikely also is that sorting of proteins occurs at the level of signal recognition particle/signal sequence interaction, as proposed (8Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned above, there is no evidence that beside the signal sequence and the transit peptide another topogenic signal for protein translocation exists in nuclear-encoded proteins for a plastid destination. Therefore, if the signal sequence is cleaved off after passing the first membrane, which is in agreement with our results, the transit peptide is the best signal for discrimination between plastid proteins and proteins for the exocytose pathway. Than nuclear-encoded plastid proteins can be detected by a Tic/Toc similar mechanism in the second membrane and transported through the periplastidal space directly or by a vesicle-mediated mechanism. As our homologous plastid import system is inefficient for nuclear proteins, vesicle fusion with the third membrane or transport across the plastid envelope by an other translocon or with the help of further factors is likely. Taken together, our findings demonstrate by the use of Brefeldin A that the outermost membrane of cryptomonad complex plastids is an ER-like membrane. Nuclear-encoded plastid proteins that contain a bipartite N-terminal topogenic signal were transported across the first membrane co-translationally and, as shown in vitro with microsomes, processed. In heterologous pea plastids nuclear-encoded proteins lacking the signal sequence as well as nucleomorph-encoded plastid proteins were imported and processed, whereas in homologous plastids from cryptomonads only the nucleomorph-encoded plastid protein is imported. Thus, a different import mechanism is possible for the two types of non-organellar encoded proteins, most likely caused by protein sorting mechanisms in the ER-like lumen between the first and the second plastid membrane.

Both ceramide and TNF activate a wide variety of cellular responses, including NF-κB, AP-1, JNK, and apoptosis. Whether ceramide transduces these signals through the same mechanism as TNF is not known. In the present study we investigated the role of the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56 lck in ceramide- and TNF-mediated cellular responses by comparing the responses of Jurkat T cells with JCaM1 cells, isogeneic Lck-deficient T cells. Treatment with ceramide activated NF-κB, degraded IκBα, and induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression in a time-dependent manner in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells, suggesting the critical role of p56 lck kinase. These effects were specific to ceramide, as activation of NF-κB by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, and TNF was minimally affected. p56 lck was also found to be required for ceramide-induced but not TNF-induced AP-1 activation. Similarly, ceramide activated the protein kinases JNK and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells.

We have reported evidence that ceramide is needed but not sufficient for TNF-mediated apoptosis (25.Higuchi M. Singh S. Jaffrezou J-P. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of activation of most of these cellular responses by ceramide is usually slower than that by TNF, thus providing one argument that ceramide is not needed for TNF signaling (1.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). To explore this question, we used the JCaM1 cell line, a genetic variant of Jurkat deficient in p56 lck protein because of the deletion of exon 7 in p56 lck mRNA (28.Rouer E. Brule F. Benarous R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4262-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). p56 lck is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, has a molecular size of 56 kDa, is a member of the Src family that is expressed highly in T cells, and binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 receptor (29.Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar), all of which make it a candidate for the ceramide and TNF pathways. It is required for T cell signaling in the human Jurkat T cell leukemia line (30.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). This protein-tyrosine kinase mediates NF-κB activation upon interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 with the CD4 receptor (31.Briant L. Robert-Hebmann V. Acquaviva C. Pelchen-Matthews A. Marsh M. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role p56 lck plays in the ceramide or TNF-induced signaling is not known, however. We compared the cellular responses induced by ceramide with those induced by TNF in this cell line. We also used JCaM1 cells that had been reconstituted by transfection with the p56 lck gene (30.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The studies indicated that ceramide can activate p56 lck and is required for ceramide-induced activation of NF-κB, AP-1, JNK, MAPK kinase, and apoptosis. Although several cellular responses of ceramide mimicked those of TNF, p56 lck was not found to be essential for TNF-induced cellular responses. C2 ceramide (N-acetyl-d-sphingosine), NaCl, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. The phospho-specific anti-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc.

Antibody against IκBα, p50, p65, JNK1, c-Jun, c-Fos, Cyclin D1, c-Rel, Lck, and double-stranded oligonucleotide having the AP-1 consensus sequence were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Phospho-IκBα (Ser32) antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs. A 10 mm solution of ceramide was made in Me2SO and then further diluted in the cell culture medium. The cell lines Jurkat (human T cells), and JCaM1 (p56 lck -deficient) were obtained from the American Tissue and Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). JCaM1 cells transfected with the p56 lck gene were kindly supplied by Dr. Arthur Weiss (The University of California, San Francisco, CA). The characterization of these cells has been previously reported (30.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotics-antimycotics. To assay NF-κB activation, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) as described (32.Manna S.K. Zhang T.H. Ya J. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either phospho-IκBα or IκBα, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The c-Jun kinase assay was performed by a modified method as described earlier (32.Manna S.K. Zhang T.H. Ya J. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, after treatment of cells (3 × 106/ml) with TNF or ceramide for 15 min, cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell extracts (150–250 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with 0.03 μg of anti-JNK antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer (4 × 400 μl) and kinase buffer (2 × 400 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl). Kinase assays were performed for 15 min at 30 °C with GST-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate (2 μg/sample) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (9%). GST-Jun-(1–79) was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the dried gel was analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF or ceramide for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. A 50-μg aliquot of protein was resolved on each lane on 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the phosphospecific anti-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs) raised in rabbits (1:3000 dilution). The membrane was then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000 dilution), and bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ceramide-induced, NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was measured as described previously (33.Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (0.1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and then transfected with plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) for NF-κB promoter DNA that had been linked to heat-stable secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) by the calcium phosphate method. After 10 h, cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF or ceramide. Twelve hours later, cell culture-conditioned medium was harvested, and 25 μl was analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity essentially as described by the protocol ofCLONTECH Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The activity of SEAP was assayed on a 96-well fluorescent plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Lab Systems) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. This reporter system was specific, because TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of IκBα mutants lacking either Ser32 or Ser36 (33.Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The ceramide-induced cytotoxicity was measured by the modified tetrazolium salt 3-(4–5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl) 2–5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (34.Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Van N.T. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6800-6809PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (10,000 cells/well) were incubated in the presence or absence of the indicated test sample in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 72 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 0.025 ml of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 0.1 ml of the extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethyl formamide) was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the optical densities at 590 nm were measured using a 96-well multiscanner autoreader (Dynatech MR 5000), with the extraction buffer as a blank. Ceramide- and TNF-induced apoptosis was examined by proteolytic cleavage of PARP (32.Manna S.K. Zhang T.H. Ya J. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat and JCaM1 cells (2 × 106/ml) were activated with different concentrations of TNF or ceramide for 24 h, and then cell extracts were prepared by incubating the cells for 30 min on ice in 0.05 ml of buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Cell extract protein (50 μg) was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with anti-PARP antibody, and then detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apoptosis was represented by the cleavage of 116-kDa PARP into a 85-kDa peptide product. The p56 lck immunocomplex kinase assay was performed by a modified method (35.Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2095-2102PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment of cells (5 × 106/ml) with either TNF or ceramide for 15 min, cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell extracts (800 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of anti-p56 lck antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer (4 × 400 μl) and kinase buffer (2 × 400 μl: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl). Kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (9%). The p56 lck autophosphorylation band was analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To study the role of p56 lck in cellular signaling activated by ceramide and TNF, we used JCaM1 cells, which are known to be p56 lck -deficient. Jurkat cells were used as a p56 lck -positive control. Most ceramide-induced cellular responses are similar to those of TNF. To determine how ceramide signaling differs from that of TNF, the two agents were compared throughout this study. Although both TNF and ceramide activate NF-κB, whether activation requires p56 lck is not known. Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were treated with various concentrations of either TNF or ceramide for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for NF-κB activation by EMSA (Fig. 1 A). TNF (upper panels) activated NF-κB in both Jurkat and JCaM1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with optimum activation (5-fold) at around 100 pm. Ceramide (lower panels) activated NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells optimally at 5 μm (4-fold), but no activation was found in JCaM1 cells. These results suggest that p56 lck kinase is required for ceramide-induced but not for TNF-induced activation. To determine if this effect was time-dependent, Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were treated with either TNF (100 pm) or ceramide (10 μm) for different times and then examined for NF-κB activation (Fig.1 B). TNF activated NF-κB in both cell types with comparable kinetics (upper panels). Ceramide (lower panels) activated NF-κB in a time-dependent manner in Jurkat cells with optimum activation occurring at 15 min, but no significant activation of NF-κB was observed in p56 lck -deficient JCaM1 cells, even after 60 min. NF-κB is activated by a wide variety of stimuli through a pathway involving overlapping and nonoverlapping steps (36.Pahl H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). Thus we sought to examine if p56 lck is required for NF-κB activation induced by PMA, LPS, and H2O2. Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were stimulated with PMA (25 ng/ml), serum activated LPS (1 μg/ml), H2O2 (250 μm), TNF (0.1 nm), and ceramide (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. After these treatments, nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB by EMSA (Fig. 1 C). PMA, LPS, TNF, and H2O2 activated NF-κB in both cell types, but again ceramide activated the transcription factor only in Jurkat cells. These results suggest that the mechanism of activation of NF-κB by ceramide differs from that of other inducers. Activated NF-κB typically consists of p50 and p65 homodimers or heterodimers (37.Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). To determine the composition of the ceramide-induced NF-κB complex, we prepared nuclear extracts from untreated or ceramide-treated (10 μm) Jurkat cells (2 × 106/ml), incubated then for 15 min with different antibodies and unlabeled NF-κB probe, and then assayed them for NF-κB by EMSA (Fig. 1 D). Both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies supershifted the NF-κB complex, whereas irrelevant anti-cyclin D1, anti-cRel, or preimmune serum had no effect on the complex. The NF-κB band disappeared by competition with wild-type oligo but not with mutant oligo. NF-κB activation by most inducers requires IκBα degradation (37.Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Previously it has been shown that NF-κB activation induced by UV, pervanadate (PV), or reoxygenation does not coincide with IκBα degradation (38.Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Antonia L. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B-M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auderger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J-F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Whether p56 lck is required for ceramide-induced IκBα degradation was also examined (Fig.2 A). As expected TNF-induced IκBα degradation reached maximum at 15 min in both Jurkat and JCaM1 cells. The resynthesis of IκBα occurred at 30 min in Jurkat cells but at 60 min in JCaM1 cells, suggesting that Lck may decrease the rate of resynthesis of TNF-induced IκBα (Fig. 2 A, upper panels). Like TNF, ceramide induced IκBα degradation, reaching the maximum at 15 min in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A, lower left panel). In p56 lck -deficient JCaM1 cells, however, no ceramide-induced IκBα degradation was observed (Fig. 2 A,lower right panel). That PV activates NF-κB without IκBα phosphorylation in p56 lck -deficient JCaM1 cells has been reported (38.Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Antonia L. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B-M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auderger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J-F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Here we examined what effect p56 lck had on ceramide-induced IκBα phosphorylation. To detect the phosphorylated form of IκBα on the Western blot, we used antibodies specific to the serine 32 phosphorylated form of IκBα. Cytoplasmic extracts treated with ceramide or TNF for different times were probed with antibodies against the phosphorylated IκBα and examined by chemiluminescence. TNF induced IκBα phosphorylation as early as 5 min in both cell types (Fig. 2 B, upper panels), whereas ceramide induced IκBα phosphorylation in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells (Fig.2 B, lower panels). Because p56 lck is a protein-tyrosine kinase and IκBα phosphorylation detected is on serine, p56 lck must regulate an IκBα kinase that phosphorylates IκBα directly. NF-κB binding to the DNA and IκBα degradation is not sufficient to suggest that p56 lck is required for NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression (39.Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of p56 lck on ceramide-induced reporter gene expression was examined. As shown in Fig.3, TNF induced reporter gene expression in both Jurkat and JCaM1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ceramide induced expression in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells, suggesting that p56 lck was also required for ceramide-induced NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression. Most agents that activate NF-κB also activate AP-1. Whether AP-1 activation by either TNF or ceramide requires p56 lck was investigated. To determine the role of p56 lck in AP-1 activation, Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were treated with various concentrations of either TNF or ceramide for 30 min, and the nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for AP-1 activation by EMSA (Fig. 4 A). TNF activated AP-1 in both Jurkat and JCaM1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with optimum activation at around 100 pm(upper panels). Ceramide activated AP-1 in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells, but no activation was found in JCaM1 cells (lower panel). These results suggest that p56 lck kinase is also not required for TNF-induced AP-1 activation but is required for ceramide-induced activation. To determine if this effect is time-dependent, we treated Jurkat and JCaM1 cells with either TNF (100 pm) or ceramide (10 μm) for different times and then examined the cells for AP-1 activation (Fig. 4 B). TNF activated NF-κB in both cell types with similar kinetics. Ceramide activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells in a time-dependent manner, but again no significant activation was observed in p56 lck -deficient JCaM1 cells. Like NF-κB, AP-1 can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli (40.Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). To examine if p56 lck is required for AP-1 activation induced by PMA, LPS, and H2O2, Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were stimulated with PMA (25 ng/ml), serum activated LPS (1 μg/ml), H2O2 (250 μm), TNF (0.1 nm), or ceramide (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. After these treatments, nuclear extracts were prepared and then assayed for AP-1 by EMSA (Fig. 4 C). PMA, LPS, TNF, and H2O2 activated AP-1 in both cell types, but ceramide activated it only in Jurkat cells. These results suggest that the mechanism of activation of AP-1 by ceramide differs from that of other inducers. To determine the composition of ceramide-induced AP-1 complex, nuclear extracts were prepared from untreated or ceramide-treated (10 μm) Jurkat cells (2 × 106/ml), incubated for 15 min with different antibodies and unlabeled AP-1 oligo, and then assayed for AP-1 by EMSA (Fig. 4 D). Both anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun antibodies supershifted the AP-1 complex, whereas irrelev"
https://openalex.org/W2047891507,"The endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), a key signaling protein, undergoes a series of covalent modifications, including co-translational N-myristoylation at Gly2, as well as post-translational thiopalmitoylation at Cys15 and Cys26. Myristoylation of eNOS is required for the subsequent palmitoylation of the enzyme, and both acylations are required for the efficient subcellular targeting of eNOS to plasmalemmal caveolae. We constructed chimeric cDNAs encoding proteins comprised of various acylation-deficient eNOS mutants fused at their N termini to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the glycoprotein CD8 and characterized these constructs in transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells. One construct (termed CD8-myr−eNOS) encodes a fusion protein comprised of the eNOS myristoylation-deficient mutant coupled to the CD8 transmembrane domain. In biosynthetic labeling experiments using [3H]palmitic acid, we found that the CD8-myr−eNOS chimera undergoes palmitoylation. Subcellular fractionation showed that the CD8-myr−eNOS chimera is targeted to caveolae. We also constructed and characterized a cDNA encoding the CD8 transmembrane domain fused to the palmitoylation-deficient mutant eNOS (in which Cys15 and Cys26 are changed to serine). This chimera (termed CD8-myr−·palm−eNOS) did not undergo palmitoylation, indicating that the palmitoylation seen with the CD8·myr−eNOS fusion protein occurs on the same residues as in the wild-type enzyme. Importantly, the CD8-myr−·palm−eNOS fusion protein remained efficiently targeted to caveolae, in contrast to the palm−eNOS mutant lacking the CD8 transmembrane domain, which has nominal caveolar localization. A construct encoding the CD8 transmembrane domain alone was insufficient for selective targeting to caveolae. These results indicate that membrane targeting per se, but not necessarily myristoylation, is sufficient for eNOS palmitoylation and localization to plasmalemmal caveolae, and suggest further that sequences within eNOS itself, in addition to its palmitoylation sites, facilitate the selective localization of the enzyme within caveolae.

Bourne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation and thiopalmitoylation represent two distinct forms of protein acylation (1.Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 3.Casey P. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Myristoylation is a co-translational modification catalyzed byN-myristoyltransferase, an enzyme that modifies a specific glycine residue (Gly2) within a consensus sequence at the N terminus of the protein via the formation of an irreversible fatty acyl amide bond involving the Gly2 amino group (1.Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 3.Casey P. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Myristoylation alone is usually not sufficient to promote efficient targeting of peripheral membrane proteins to the plasmalemma, and many myristoylated proteins are further stabilized in their membrane association by other intermolecular interactions and/or covalent modifications, including palmitoylation. Protein palmitoylation involves the post-translational formation of a fatty acyl thioester between palmitoyl-CoA and specific cysteine residue(s) in the modified protein (2.Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to myristoylation, there is no clear consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation (1.Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Rather, the sites of palmitoylation within a given membrane-targeted protein characteristically occur at cysteine residues located in proximity to sites of the protein's membrane attachment, and enzymes that catalyze protein thiopalmitoylation have not been definitively identified. Indeed, there is evidence that protein palmitoylation can occur without the involvement of a separate protein catalyst (2.Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), although a protein palmitoylthioesterase that depalmitoylates the G protein Gαs (5.Duncan J. Gilman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) as well as eNOS (6.Yeh D. Duncan J. Yamashita S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33148-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) has recently been identified. In contrast to myristoylation, which is characteristically an irreversible covalent modification, the protein palmitoyl thioester bond is labile; the palmitoylation of several signaling proteins can be dynamically regulated by agonists (7.Mumby S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some examples of palmitoylated signaling proteins include G protein-coupled receptors, α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, diverse nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)1 (7.Mumby S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The eNOS plays a critical role in controlling vascular tone, platelet aggregation, and cardiac myocyte function (8.Loscalzo J. Welch G. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes, eNOS is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae (for review see Ref. 9.Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 146-152Crossref Scopus (853) Google Scholar), where the enzyme interacts with the scaffolding protein caveolin. The eNOS protein contains no hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and the enzyme is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae by virtue of dual acylation: by N-myristoylation at Gly2 and by thiopalmitoylation at Cys15 and Cys26 (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis of the myristoylation site of eNOS, in which Gly2 is changed to alanine, yields a myristoylation-deficient eNOS (myr−eNOS) mutant that is neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated and is recovered in the soluble subcellular fraction when expressed in cells (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the myr− mutant of eNOS remains in the cytosol and does not undergo palmitoylation (despite the presence of intact cysteine residues at its sites of palmitoylation), it is difficult to discern the relative contribution of myristoylation and palmitoylation in targeting the enzyme to caveolae. We therefore constructed a series of fusion proteins between various eNOS acylation mutants and a prototypical transmembrane domain (derived from the T cell surface glycoprotein CD8) and characterized the post-translational modifications and targeting of these chimeric constructs. The presence of a transmembrane domain in this chimeric protein provides an alternative mechanism whereby eNOS may be targeted to caveolae and/or undergo palmitoylation. Our results indicate the presence of the CD8 transmembrane domain is sufficient to promote eNOS palmitoylation and targeting to caveolae. Furthermore, we show that palmitoylation of eNOS is not required for the selective targeting of a CD8·eNOS fusion protein to plasmalemmal caveolae. cDNA constructs encoding wild-type eNOS, myristoylation-deficient (myr−) eNOS, and palmitoylation-deficient (palm−) eNOS have been previously described (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the various eNOS acylation mutants and CD8-eNOS chimeras used in these studies. The CD8·myr−eNOS DNA was previously constructed (12.Kantor D. Lanzrein M. Stary S. Sandoval G. Smith W. Sullivan B. Davidson N. Schuman E. Science. 1996; 274: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in an adenovirus transfer vector as a fusion protein between the glycoprotein CD8 transmembrane domain and the myr−eNOS cDNA. This CD8·myr−eNOS insert was excised from the adenovirus transfer vector (12.Kantor D. Lanzrein M. Stary S. Sandoval G. Smith W. Sullivan B. Davidson N. Schuman E. Science. 1996; 274: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pK, a derivative of pBK-CMV (Stratagene) modified as described previously (10.Robinson L.

To construct the palmitoylation-deficient CD8-myr−·palm−eNOS fusion protein, a cassette comprising ∼1.5 kilobases of the CD8-myr−eNOS cDNA was exchanged for the corresponding region of the palm−eNOS cDNA and excised using the restriction enzymes SrfI and BglII, yielding the plasmid CD8-palm−·myr−eNOS. The CD8 transmembrane domain encodes a polypeptide with a predicted M r∼22,000, and the chimeric constructs of CD8 plus eNOS (M r ∼135,000) yield fusion proteins ofM r ∼157,000 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Expression and subcellular fractionation of eNOS acylation mutants and chimeras. Shown is an immunoblot of transfected COS-7 cells probed either with eNOS antibodies (A) or CD8 N terminus antibodies (B). COS-7 cells were transfected as indicated in the figure with cDNAs encoding wild-type eNOS (wt-eNOS), palm−eNOS, CD8-myr−eNOS, or CD8-myr−·palm−eNOS (A) or with empty vector or the CD8-transmembrane domain (CD8-TMD,B). Lysates prepared from the transfected cells were resolved into particulate (P) and soluble (S) subcellular fractions by ultracentrifugation, as described in the text, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The blot is a representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) cDNA encoding the CD8 transmembrane domain region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the CD8·myr−eNOS plasmid using forward primer 5′-GAATTCGAGCCAAGCAGCGTCCTGGGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATCGATTCATCGGTTCCTGTGGTT-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and ClaI and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene). The sequence of this polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment was confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing, and the construct directed the expression of a protein of the expected size (∼22 kDa) that was detected by the CD8 N terminus-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). COS-7 cells were maintained in culture as described previously (11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were transfected with 1–5 μg of total plasmid DNA in 100-mm cell culture plates, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol plus protease inhibitors: lima bean trypsin inhibitor, soy bean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and antipain, each at final concentration of 2 μg/ml). Cells were sonicated (three 10-s bursts with 10-s intervals, output power at 10% of nominal converter amplitude) using a Branson 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT) to yield the cell lysate. Cell debris was removed following a brief 1000 × g centrifugation. When subcellular fractionation was required, cells were sonicated in buffer 1, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged to separate particulate and soluble fractions, in an ultracentrifuge (100,000 × g) for 1 h, at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Transfected COS-7 cells were biosynthetically labeled for 2 h with [3H]palmitate (1 mCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (13.Robinson L. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested as described above and then sonicated in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0 1% SDS, 1% Triton, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors as described above). Immunoprecipitation of eNOS was done in Buffer-B using a polyclonal antiserum against eNOS as described previously (11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose using a modified Laemmli sample buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol as reducing agent instead of β-mercaptoethanol (to minimize loss of the palmitate thioester). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels, which were then fixed and soaked in EN3HANCE (DuPont); radiolabeled proteins were detected in the dried gels by fluorography using XAR film (Kodak), with an average exposure time of 7 days. CEM and noncaveolar membranes (NCM) were resolved by a detergent-free ultracentrifugation method (14.Song S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. J. Biol.

Transfected cells from a 100-mm dish were harvested in 2.2 ml of 0.5 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 11, and homogenization was carried out sequentially with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (40 strokes) and a sonicator (3 × 20 s bursts). The extract was brought to 45% sucrose (in MES-buffered saline buffer: 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) by adding 2 ml of homogenate to 2 ml of 90% sucrose solution and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous gradient was formed above the 45% lysate solution by adding 4 ml of 35% and 4 ml of 5% sucrose solutions prepared in MES-buffered saline containing 0.25 msodium carbonate. Tubes were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a SW-41 rotor for 16–18 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 15 × 0.8-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. To concentrate the membranes within different regions of the gradient, fractions corresponding to CEM (fractions 4–7) and NCM (fractions 8–15) were pooled and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pelleted membrane proteins were solubilized in the solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-octylglucoside, 1% Triton X-100) and protease inhibitors mentioned above. Laemmli sample buffer (2×) was added in equal volume to the solubilized membranes, and equal amounts of proteins from CEM and NCM were separated on SDS-PAGE for the detection of eNOS, caveolin, and the CD8 transmembrane domain. Co-immunoprecipitations of eNOS and caveolin from transfected COS were was performed in CHAPS buffer (containing 20 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, plus protease inhibitors as above) using our previously reported protocols (17.Feron O.

Briefly, solubilized cell lysates were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (2 μg/mg protein; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then added for 1 h, and immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with the CHAPS buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7% gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, as described previously (18.Michel J. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J.

For immunodetection of eNOS and caveolin, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) directed against eNOS and caveolin, respectively, were used for chemiluminescent detection of proteins as described previously (17.Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T. Kelly R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of Myc-tagged caveolin-1 and CD8-transmembrane domain was performed using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies and polyclonal anti-CD8 (N terminus-specific; H-160) antibody, respectively, from Santa Cruz Laboratories, according to the manufacturer's protocols. The expression and targeting of the CD8·myr−eNOS fusion proteins were evaluated in transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells using the cDNA constructs shown in Fig. 1. As a preliminary characterization, we performed a subcellular fractionation of lysates of transfected cells using ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g to resolve the particulate cell pellet and the soluble supernatant fractions (Fig. 2). The wild-type eNOS was recovered principally in the particulate subcellular fraction (Fig. 2), and the myr− mutant eNOS was primarily in the supernatant (data not shown), as we have previously reported (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The palm− mutant of eNOS, which still undergoesN-myristoylation (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed a subcellular distribution intermediate between the wild-type enzyme (myristoylated and palmitoylated) and the myr− mutant, which is entirely acylation-deficient. However, in the CD8 fusion proteins, the presence of the CD8 transmembrane domain targeted the different eNOS mutants to the particulate subcellular fraction irrespective of the status of the acylation sites of the enzyme in the chimeric constructs. The truncated CD8 transmembrane domain was also recovered in the particulate fraction (Fig. 2 B). The overall nitric-oxide synthase activity in these lysates (assayed using the [3H]arginine → [3H]citrulline assay, Ref. 20.Bredt D. Snyder S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar) ranged from 1–3 pmol of [3H]citrulline formed/min/mg of protein in different preparations, and the distribution of nitric-oxide synthase enzyme activity between the soluble and particulate fractions paralleled the distribution of nitric-oxide synthase protein in the different subcellular fractions. These results indicate that the fusion of the CD8 transmembrane domain to eNOS can provide efficient targeting of the chimera to the particulate subcellular fraction; the loss of acylation sites in the eNOS N-terminal is entirely overcome by the addition of an N-terminal transmembrane domain, which yields a membrane-localized chimeric enzyme. The myristoylation-deficient mutant eNOS does not undergo palmitoylation, suggesting that myristoylation is required for eNOS palmitoylation (13.Robinson L. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because the CD8 transmembrane domain provides an alternative mechanism whereby the chimeric CD8-myristoylation-deficient eNOS fusion protein targets to the particulate fraction (Fig. 2), we explored whether this chimeric construct might also undergo palmitoylation. cDNA constructs encoding the various CD8-eNOS chimeric proteins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Transfection of the wild-type eNOS served as a positive control, and the palm−mutant eNOS served as a negative control. The transfected cells were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate, and soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-eNOS antiserum (11.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 3, the wild-type eNOS is palmitoylated, whereas the palm−eNOS mutant enzyme is not; these are the expected results (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs encoding the CD8·myr−eNOS fusion protein, immunoprecipitation of eNOS revealed the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the chimera, although the chimera is more weakly 3H-labeled than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). Importantly, the biosynthetic labeling of cells transfected with the CD8·myr−·palm−eNOS construct, in which the palmitoylation sites at Cys15 and Cys26 are mutated to alanine residues, showed no incorporation of the3H label. These results strongly indicate palmitoylation of the CD8·myr−eNOS occurs on the same residues as those that undergo palmitoylation in the wild-type enzyme and establish that the presence of the CD8 transmembrane domain alone is sufficient to promote eNOS palmitoylation of the myristoylation-deficient enzyme. To further validate that the incorporation of [3H]palmitate reflects the thiopalmitoylation of eNOS (rather than biosynthetic incorporation of labeled palmitate-derived amino acids), we used hydroxylamine to treat SDS-PAGE gels containing the biosynthetically labeled immunoprecipitated eNOS. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, the [3H]palmitate label was completely removed by hydroxylamine treatment, suggesting that the labeling reflects thioester formation from the incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid. These results indicate that membrane localization, rather than myristoylation per se, is sufficient to support the palmitoylation of eNOS. Palmitoylated proteins, which are almost invariably membrane-associated (1.Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 2.Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), undergo targeting to membrane fractions via diverse pathways; prenylated proteins, myristoylated proteins, and intrinsic membrane proteins may all contain cysteine residues that undergo palmitoylation. The present study establishes that a transmembrane domain is able to substitute forN-myristoylation and lead to the palmitoylation of a protein. Despite the proximity of a large chimeric transmembrane domain in place of the myristoylated glycine residue of the wild-type protein, the eNOS-CD8 chimera nevertheless undergoes palmitoylation, thereby providing further evidence that the proximity of a given cysteine residue to the site of membrane attachment is the principal determinant of its proclivity to undergo thiopalmitoylation. The localization of the different chimeric CD8-eNOS constructs to the particulate subcellular fraction obviously does not discriminate whether these proteins are specifically targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae. Our next series of experiments analyzed the subcellular distribution of the various transfected constructs in greater detail. We applied an isopycnic centrifugation method (14.Song S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 15.Bilderback T. Grigsby R. Dobrowsky R. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that resolves caveolae in carbonate-extracted cell lysates separated in discontinuous sucrose gradients to discriminate CEM versus NCM. Using this methodology, ∼80% of the caveolin-1 protein, but only 3% of the total cellular protein, is recovered in the CEM (Fig. 4), suggesting that this method reliably resolves caveolin-enriched from noncaveolar membranes. As shown in Fig. 4, the wild-type eNOS, as well as the CD8·myr−eNOS and CD8·myr−·palm−eNOS fusion proteins, are recovered principally in the CEM fraction. Indeed, the CD8·myr−eNOS fusion protein was even more efficiently targeted to CEM than was the wild-type enzyme (55 ± 7% targeted to CEM for the wild-type eNOS versus 78 ± 8% for the CD8·myr −eNOS chimera, p < 0.05 by ANOVA (analysis of variance), n = 3). By contrast, the palm−eNOS was recovered principally in the noncaveolar fraction, although some enzyme was always recovered in the CEM fraction (17 ± 8%, n = 3). The fusion protein between CD8 and the palmitoylation-deficient mutant eNOS was targeted to the caveolin-enriched membranes as efficiently as the palmitoylation competent chimeric CD8 eNOS (65 ± 7% for the CD8·myr−·palm− and 78 ± 8% for the CD8·myr−NOS constructs; p value not significant, n = 4). Transfection experiments using the construct encoding only the CD8 transmembrane domain (i.e.not as a fusion protein with eNOS) showed that this transmembrane domain was recovered almost exclusively in the NCM fraction, indicating that specific sequences within the CD8 moiety were not responsible for directing the targeting of eNOS to the CEM fraction. Taken together, these results suggest that the CD8 transmembrane domain alone is insufficient for targeting to caveolae, but that the CD8·eNOS fusion proteins are even more efficiently targeted to caveolae than the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the acylation of eNOS, once the enzyme is targeted to the membrane by virtue of the CD8 transmembrane domain, appears to play a relatively minor role in further enhancing targeting to caveolae. It must be noted that the targeting of wild-type eNOS to caveolae is importantly influenced by the status of the palmitoylation of the enzyme, which itself is dynamically regulated in the cell. However, caveolar localization of eNOS can occur in the absence of palmitoylation, so long as the protein finds its way to the plasmalemma by some other means. We have previously used co-immunoprecipitation techniques to investigate the associations between eNOS acylation mutants and caveolin (17.Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T. Kelly R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18.Michel J. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, there were significant differences between the various eNOS constructs in their interaction with caveolin-1, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. These co-immunoprecipitation experiments were controlled for equivalent protein expression by immunoblot analyses, and the specificity of the interaction was validated by the absence of co-immunoprecipitation in the sham-transfected cells (Fig. 5). The chimeras CD8·myr−eNOS and CD8·myr−·palm−eNOS, as well as the wild-type enzyme all are efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin, whereas there was considerably less efficient co-immunoprecipitation of palm−eNOS. The current report complements an earlier study in which caveolin overexpression was shown to lead to the association between caveolin and various eNOS acylation mutants (21.Feron O. Michel J. Sase K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that the proximity of eNOS and caveolin could be sufficient to permit their associating within the cell. Taken together, these results indicate that the ability of nitric-oxide synthase to interact with caveolin may be independent of the state of the enzyme's state of acylation per se but rather may be determined principally by 1) the relative partitioning of eNOS into the cell membrane and 2) by the presence of sequences within eNOS that are involved in its association with caveolin. For the wild-type eNOS, membrane partitioning is critically influenced by palmitoylation (10.Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Depalmitoylation of eNOS may promote its translocation principally by affecting the relative affinity of the enzyme for the cell membrane, thereby changing its proximity to, but not necessarily its affinity for, caveolin. Palmitoylated proteins are almost invariably found in the particulate subcellular fraction (23.Dunphy J. Linder M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24.Shaul P. Smart E. Robinson L. German Z. Yuhanna I. Ying Y. Anderson R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and the preponderance of palmitoylated signaling proteins can be found localized in plasmalemmal caveolae (7.Mumby S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The fact that membrane targeting via a transmembrane domain, rather than palmitoylation, leads to selective targeting to caveolae suggests that this acylation per se is not required for the selective targeting of eNOS to caveolae. On the other hand, sequences within eNOS are evidently required for targeting to caveolae and its interaction with caveolin in that the CD8 transmembrane domain by itself neither selectively localizes in caveolae nor co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin. If targeting to caveolae does not depend on palmitoylation, then why are so many palmitoylated proteins found in caveolae? Possibly, the fact that many of the signaling proteins targeted to caveolae undergo palmitoylation could represent a mechanism whereby the proteins may leave caveolae when depalmitoylated (as a consequence of their loss of hydrophobic acyl chains). However, if a transmembrane hydrophobic domain is the determinant obligating a protein's stable association with the plasmalemma, the additional presence of high affinity caveolin-binding domains within the protein could lead to its irreversible targeting to caveolae. A consensus sequence for caveolin binding has been found in a wide variety of signaling proteins (25.Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), including intrinsic as well as peripheral membrane proteins targeted to caveolae; the larger role of this consensus sequence in caveolar targeting has not yet been clearly defined. Indeed, many such intrinsic membrane proteins, including diverse growth factor receptors and G protein-coupled receptors, have been found to target to caveolae. Some G protein-coupled receptors have been found to be reversibly palmitoylated; the relationship between the reversible palmitoylation of these receptors and their dynamic targeting to caveolae remains less well understood. Clearly there are many pathways a protein may take on the path to or from plasmalemmal caveolae. A broader understanding of the determinants of this process may provide important insights into the regulation of caveolae-associated proteins in normal and pathological states. We thank Drs. Eva Neer, Kazuhiro Sase, Junsuke Igarashi, and Sylvie Bernier for their critical comments and helpful discussions. The AdCD8eNOS construct was provided by Dr. Erin Schuman (California Institute of Technology)."
https://openalex.org/W2027183238,"Lhx3, a member of the LIM homeodomain family of transcription factors, is required for development of the pituitary and is implicated in the transcription of pituitary-specific hormone genes. In this report we describe a novel gene product, SLB, that selectively interacts with Lhx3 and the closely related LIM factor, Lhx4. The SLB cDNA encodes a 1749-residue protein that contains seven WD40 repeats near the amino terminus and a putative nuclear localization signal and does not contain other recognizable motifs. SLB is expressed in a tissue-specific manner with the highest concentrations of SLB mRNA in the testis and pituitary cells. We demonstrate that SLB specifically binds to Lhx3 and Lhx4 with high affinity both in vitro and in vivo. SLB has much lower affinity or no detectable affinity for other LIM domains. An expression vector for a fragment of SLB containing the LIM-interaction domain was shown to reduce expression of Lhx3-responsive reporter genes. The ability of the LIM-interacting domain of SLB to alter reporter gene activity as well as the tissue-specific expression and the specificity of SLB binding to LIM factors suggest a possible role in modulating the transcriptional activity of specific LIM factors."
https://openalex.org/W2109312057,"Phenobarbital-responsive DNA elements were identified in the 5′-flanking region of the chicken CYP2H1gene by in reporter gene assays in a chicken hepatoma cell line (leghorn male hepatoma (LMH)). A 264-base pair (bp) enhancer sequence (phenobarbital-responsive unit (PBRU)) responded to phenobarbital and a variety of phenobarbital-type inducers. Analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites within the 264-bp element revealed a nuclear receptor half-site repeat (DR-4) neighboring a putative nuclear factor-1 site. This motif resembles phenobarbital response elements in the flanking regions of three phenobarbital-inducible genes, ratCYP2B2, mouse Cyp2b10, and humanCYP2B6. Activation of the 264-bp element was eliminated after site-directed mutagenesis of the DR-4 hexamer half-sites. Evidence for evolutionary conservation of this recognition site was indicated by activation in LMH cells of a mouse Cyp2b10phenobarbital-responsive enhancer by the same spectrum of inducers that activate the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU. Inhibition of this activation by okadaic acid may explain the reported inhibitory effects on induction of CYP2B1/2 and Cyp2b10 by this phosphatase inhibitor. We show that this inhibition occurs directly on the 264-bp PBRU, whereas the proximal promoter of CYP2H1 is induced by okadaic acid in reporter gene assays. These experiments exploit the unique phenobarbital inducibility of the hepatoma-derived cell line LMH."

This constancy makes the determination of the contribution of the linoleic acid-induced energy-dissipating pathway by the ADP/O method possible. No decrease in membrane potential is observed in state 3 respiration with increasing concentration of n-butyl malonate, indicating that the rate of ATP synthesis is steeply dependent on membrane potential. Linoleic acid decreases the yield of oxidative phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner by a pure protonophoric process like that in the presence of FCCP. ADP/O measurements allow calculation of the part of respiration leading to ATP synthesis and the part of respiration sustained by the dissipative H+re-uptake induced by linoleic acid. Respiration sustained by this energy-dissipating process remains constant at a given LA concentration until more than 50% inhibition of state 3 respiration byn-butyl malonate is achieved. The energy dissipative contribution to oxygen consumption is proposed to be equal to the protonophoric activity of plant uncoupling protein divided by the intrinsic H+/O of the cytochrome pathway.

It increases with linoleic acid concentration, taking place at the expense of ADP phosphorylation without an increase in the respiration. proton electrochemical gradient alternative oxidase plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein free fatty acids linoleic acid benzohydroxamate mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential state 3 respiration membrane potential of state 3 contribution of ATP synthesis-sustained respiration contribution of PUMP activity-sustained respiration carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone rate of ATP synthesis respiratory rate tetraphenylphosphonium Plant mitochondria contain two energy-dissipating systems: (i) electron carriers that dissipate redox energy instead of building a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient (ΔμH+),1 i.e. two (inner and outer) rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenases and an alternative ubiquinol cyanide-resistant oxidase (AOX) (1.Mackenzie S. McIntosh L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); and (ii) a plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein (PUMP) that dissipates energy contained in the ΔμH+ through a free fatty acid (FFA)-activated H+ cycling process (2.Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3.Ježeek P. Engstova H. Zackova M. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These two energy-dissipating systems leading to the same final effect (i.e. a decrease in ATP synthesis) act at two different levels of the overall energy transduction pathway. Recently, it has been shown that PUMP and AOX must have different physiological functions in plant cells, as they are functionally connected by FFAs (e.g. linoleic acid, LA), which activate PUMP and drastically inhibit the AOX activity (4.Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Measurements of respiration specifically sustained by ATP synthase, PUMP, or AOX activity were restricted to conditions in which one activity is functioning while the other two are blocked by specific inhibitors (5.Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These measurements do not reflect the true contribution of each pathway to the total state 3 respiration, as inhibition of one pathway inevitably affects the others. Indeed, inhibition of the cytochrome pathway by cyanide or myxothiazol increases concentration of ubiquinol that is the reduced substrate of AOX, thereby increasing the electron flux via AOX. Similarly, inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin increases the ΔμH+, which is the driving force of PUMP activity, thus increasing the activity of PUMP. The ADP/O method, based on the non-phosphorylating property of AOX with succinate (in the presence of rotenone) as oxidizable substrate, has been developed for the first time to determine the contributions of the cytochrome and AOX pathways in overall state 3 respiration of amoeba mitochondria (6.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This method involves pair measurements of ADP/O ratios plus or minus benzohydroxamic acid (BHAM, an inhibitor of AOX) and measurements of overall state 3 respiration in the absence of inhibitors of ubiquinol-oxidizing pathways. It has provided the first description of the steady-state kinetics of the two ubiquinol-oxidizing pathways when both are active simultaneously and of electron partitioning between them when the steady-state rate of the quinone-reducing pathway is decreased. Both PUMP and ATP synthase are able to consume ΔμH+built up by the protonophoric oxidoreductases of the respiratory chain and may be considered as two branching pathways contributing to respiration through the cytochrome pathway. PUMP is the ΔμH+ energy-dissipating path, and ATP synthase is the ΔμH+ energy-conserving path. Preparation of green tomato fruit mitochondria fully depleted of FFA and observation of the decrease in ADP/O by LA addition have suggested calculation of the contribution of PUMP activity and ATP synthesis in state 3 using pair measurements of ADP/O ratios in the absence or presence of LA (7.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The LA-induced energy-dissipating activity responsible for the decrease in ADP/O ratio was attributed only to the PUMP activity (7.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, protonophoric action of FFA can be mediated not only by uncoupling protein but also by several members of the mitochondrial carrier family (8.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), mainly in a high energy state of mitochondria. This FFA-dependent H+ re-cycling is a side function of these carriers and can be inhibited by their substrates or by their specific inhibitors. Thus, the LA-induced H+ re-cycling could be mediated, at least in part, by ADP/ATP carrier, dicarboxylate carrier, and phosphate carrier (8.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), likely at high membrane potential (ΔΨ) but unlikely during phosphorylating respiration, where they are employed in the import of ADP, succinate, and phosphate, respectively. Furthermore, some pieces of evidence in favor of the main responsibility of PUMP in the LA-induced H+ re-cycling have been obtained during study of post-harvest tomato fruit ripening (5.Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, a good correlation was established between PUMP protein concentration in the membrane and the effect induced by LA in state 4 and ADP/O. This makes PUMP the most important candidate to catalyze the LA-induced H+ re-cycling in tomato mitochondria. The present study supports the validity of the ADP/O method to determine the actual contributions of PUMP (activated with various LA concentrations) and ATP synthase in the BHAM-resistant state 3 respiration of tomato fruit mitochondria fully depleted of FFA and describes how the two contributions vary when the rate of succinate dehydrogenase is decreased by succinate uptake limitation. Results show how efficiently PUMP activity can divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation and even more efficiently with decreasing respiration as the PUMP contribution is constant at a given LA concentration while the ATP synthase contribution decreases with respiration rate. Tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) were grown in a greenhouse at the Centro de Biologia Molecular e Engenharia Genética. Tomato fruits were harvested at a green mature stage (but still completely green) and were used the same day. Mitochondria were isolated and purified on a self-generating Percoll gradient (21%) as described previously (4.Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The presence of 1% bovine serum albumin in isolation medium allowed chelating of FFA from the mitochondrial suspension and obtaining mitochondria fully depleted of FFA. For each mitochondrial preparation, full depletion of FFA was tested by measuring the effect of bovine serum albumin on the LA-induced respiration as described in Ref. 7.Jarmuszkiewicz W.

Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Biuret method (9.Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen uptake was measured using a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co.) in 1.3 ml of standard incubation medium (25 °C) containing: 125 mm sucrose, 65 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.33 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm KH2PO4, with 0.4–0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein. Mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential (ΔΨ) was measured under the same conditions as oxygen uptake, except that the standard incubation medium additionally contained 3 μm tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+), and a TPP+-selective electrode was used as described by Kamo et al. (10.Kamo N. Muratsugu N. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). For calculation of the Δψ value, the matrix volume of tomato mitochondria was assumed as 2.0 μl × mg−1 protein. All measurements were made in the presence of 10 mmsuccinate, 1.5 mm BHAM, 170 μm ATP, 5 μm rotenone, 0–8 μm LA, and 0–35 mm n-butyl malonate. ATP was added to ensure complete activation of succinate dehydrogenase. The ADP/O ratio was determined by an ADP pulse method with 220–240 nmol of ADP. The total amount of oxygen consumed during state 3 respiration was used for calculation of the ratio. Increasing concentrations ofn-butyl malonate were used to decrease steady-state 3 respiration. All experiments were performed in the presence of BHAM, to inhibit AOX activity, with succinate (plus rotenone) as oxidizable substrate. ADP/O ratios and state 3 respiration were measured during ADP pulses in the absence or presence of LA (Fig. 1). Pulse duration was defined with the help of ΔΨ measurement. LA increased the respiratory rate and decreased ΔΨ in state 4, while it scarcely modified state 3 respiration (V3) and membrane potential (ΔΨ3). However, the ADP/O ratio was clearly lowered in the presence of LA suggesting PUMP activation. In order to describe how contributions of PUMP and ATP synthase change with variations in the state 3 respiration, the rate of the quinone-reducing pathway (succinate dehydrogenase) was decreased byn-butyl malonate, a non-penetrating competitive inhibitor of succinate uptake. A typical example obtained from a single mitochondrial preparation is shown in TableI. V3 decreased with increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate up to 35 mm, inhibiting about 50% of respiration both in the absence and presence of LA. In the presence of 4 μm LA, V3 was lower compared with the value obtained at the same n-butyl malonate concentration in the absence of LA (roughly 10% inhibition). ΔΨ3 was almost unchanged by LA addition; however, a slight (around 2 mV) increase was systematically observed. Decrease in ΔΨ3 linked to inhibition of respiration by n-butyl malonate was not detected. The mean value of ΔΨ3 obtained with a set of different mitochondrial preparations and n-butyl malonate concentrations was 172 ± 5 mV (S.D., n = 61). In the absence of LA, the ADP/O ratio remained constant independent of V3 or respiratory control ratio. The mean value was 1.29 ± 0.03 (S.D., n = 55). In the presence of LA, the ADP/O ratio was lower and decreased with increasing concentration ofn-butyl malonate. Thus, the lowering of electron supply to the cytochrome pathway amplified the decrease in ADP/O induced by LA. This suggests that the relative contribution of the PUMP-sustained respiration was increasing with increasing concentration ofn-butyl malonate.Table IEffect of decrease in state 3 respiration on membrane potential and ADP/O ratio in the presence or absence of 4 μm LAn-Butyl malonateV3ΔΨ3ADP/O−LA+LA−LA+LA−LA+LAmmnmol O × min −1 × mg −1 proteinmV05425381711731.3451.136104354081741771.3521.045203523241741761.3250.97627.53082711731751.2970.924352792421751751.3200.78205385081741771.3331.129Assay conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” Oxidation of succinate (+ BHAM) in the presence or absence of 4 μm LA was gradually decreased by increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate (10–35 mm). Data deal with a single mitochondrial preparation. Open table in a new tab Assay conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” Oxidation of succinate (+ BHAM) in the presence or absence of 4 μm LA was gradually decreased by increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate (10–35 mm). Data deal with a single mitochondrial preparation. Calculation of the respective contributions to respiration in steady-state state 3 of ATP synthesis, which consumes ΔμH+ with energy conservation (Vcyt cons), and of PUMP activity, which consumes ΔμH+ with energy dissipation (VPUMP), by using Equations 1 and 2 implies several conditions.Vcyt cons=V3×ADP/O(ADP/O) −LAEquation 1 VPUMP=V3−Vcyt consEquation 2 (ADP/O)−LA is the ADP/O ratio in the absence of LA. Indeed, it assumes that: (a) ΔμH+dissipation occurs only through PUMP activity and then (ADP/O)−LA may be considered as an intrinsic stoichiometry including the intrinsic H+/O ratio of the respiratory chain and the intrinsic P/H+ ratio of ADP phosphorylation; (b) LA has no direct effect on the intrinsic stoichiometries through interactions with the complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation; and (c) LA has no indirect effect on the intrinsic stoichiometries through electron fluxes or ΔΨ modification. Assumptions b and c are required because of the use of (ADP/O)−LA in Equation 1, which is supposed to be applied in the presence of LA as well as in its absence. These assumptions must be made because the intrinsic stoichiometries of the enzymatic machinery are not necessarily fixed due to possible slippage (see “Discussion”). At almost constant ΔΨ3 (Table I), (ADP/O)−LA did not vary with V3, indicating that conditiona and part of condition c (i.e.stoichiometry-flux independence) are valid. Nevertheless, a possible occurrence of ΔμH+ dissipation (H+ leak) in the absence of PUMP activity will be considered under “Discussion.” Furthermore, as LA effect on ΔΨ3, if any, was very small (Table I), it is possible that condition c is fully valid. Lack of direct interaction between LA and the redox proton pumps in the presence of rotenone has already been evidenced (10.Kamo N. Muratsugu N. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), supporting part of assumption b. Further support in favor of assumptions b and carises from the analysis of the ADP/O ratio behavior during titration with n-butyl malonate in the presence of LA. For this purpose, Equations 1 and 2 have been rearranged and combined, leading to Equation 3.V3×ADP/O=(ADP/O) −LA×(V3−VPUMP)Equation 3 This equation predicts a linear relationship between the rate of ATP synthesis (V3 × ADP/O) and V3 provided that VPUMPremains constant when V3 is varied by n-butyl malonate addition (at fixed concentration of LA). This linearity was verified with 4, 6, and 8 μm LA (Fig.2). In the absence of LA, the straight line intersects the abscissa axis at a point not significantly different from the origin in accordance with the (ADP/O)−LA constancy. With increasing LA concentration, the abscissa axis intercept (VPUMP) was shifted to the right but the slope ((ADP/O)−LA) was not modified. Thus the set of parallel straight linesshown in Fig. 2 strongly suggests that LA has no effect on stoichiometries of the H+ translocating enzymes employed in the oxidative phosphorylation and that the H+ conduction rate via PUMP does not change with respiration rates. Several mitochondrial preparations used in this study were not identical regarding V3 value at a given condition (concentrations of LA andn-butyl malonate). Nevertheless, it was established that they have VPUMP contributions, at the same LA concentration, close enough to allow their gathering in the present analysis. As VPUMP values (see legend of Fig. 2) were almost proportional to the LA concentration, the apparentK m for LA, higher than 8 μm, cannot be evaluated. Indeed, higher LA concentration have not been investigated owing to the difficulty to safely determine ADP/O ratios using the ADP-pulse method when the respiratory control ratio decreases below 1.2. An apparent K m (equal to 83 μm) expressed in total concentration of LA added to the bulk medium has been determined with PUMP reconstituted into liposomes (11.Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the LA solubility into liposome and mitochondrial membrane prevents a straightforward comparison betweenK m values for the two systems. On the other hand, the saturation observed for the LA-induced non-phosphorylating respiration (S 0.5 = 10 μm) (7.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) did not reflect actual saturation of PUMP activity as ΔΨ decreased with increasing concentrations of LA (5.Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data obtained in the presence of carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) at low concentration (0.03 μm) exhibited the same feature as observed with LA (Fig. 2), suggesting a similar type of uncoupling action (see “Discussion”). Additionally, neither V3 nor ΔΨ3 was modified by 0.03 μm FCCP (data not shown), which only decreased the rate of ATP synthesis at a given V3 (Fig. 2). Measured ADP/O ratios are expected to be lower than an ideal value corresponding to the highest mechanistic stoichiometries, H+/O of the proton pumps of the respiratory chain (in this study, the ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase complex III and the cytochrome c oxidase complex IV), and P/H+ of ATP synthase plus ADP/ATP carrier. This means incomplete coupling that may be attributed to the passive permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to protons (leak) and to intrinsic uncoupling within the redox pumps or the ATP synthase (slip) as reviewed in Ref. 12.Murphy M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar. Leaks and slips depend on ΔΨ and values of pH inside and outside of mitochondria. However, leaks are usually supposed to act independently of the way ΔΨ and pH values have been reached in contrast to slips because slips are part of the kinetic mechanisms of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. However, as membrane permeability to ions is likely influenced by membrane proteins (13.Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the proton leak may also be under the direct influence of the respiratory enzymes' activity (14.Garlid K.D. Semrad C. Zinchenko V. Schuster S. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Masat Y.-P. Modern Trends in Biothermokinetics. Plenum Press, New York1993: 287-293Crossref Google Scholar). This view does not seem to be supported by experiment (15.Luvisetto S. Schemehl I. Canton M. Azzone G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Modulation of electron fluxes using inhibitors is expected to influence the relative contributions of uncoupling processes and of energy conservation processes, and consequently to modify the ADP/O ratio. A simplified theoretical approach (non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach) (16.Westerhoff H.V. Van Dam K. Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free-energy Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar) predicts that a linear relationship between the phosphorylation rate (J p = V3 × ADP/O) and the respiration rate (J o = V3) can be obtained. The slope (dJ p/dJ o) is either an upper or a lower limit of the mechanistic P/O ratio according to the step sensitive to the inhibitor used for the titration (17.Beavis A.D. Lehninger A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18.Beavis A.D Lehninger A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If respiration with succinate is inhibited with malonate (a competitive inhibitor of the succinate dehydrogenase), the ADP/O is expected to decrease and dJ p/dJ o is expected to be a lower limit of the mechanistic stoichiometry. Results obtained with rat liver mitochondria seem to be in agreement with the theoretical prediction (18.Beavis A.D Lehninger A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to the same simplified theoretical approach, ADP/O constancy such as observed with succinate (+ rotenone) when electron fluxes are changed by n-butyl malonate in tomato fruit mitochondria (mean ADP/O value = 1.29 ± 0.03 S.D., n = 55; this work) and in amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria (mean ADP/O value = 1.41 ± 0.07 S.D., n = 98) (6.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) would mean that the measured ratio is the optimal mechanistic stoichiometryi.e. that leaks and slips are negligible. Such an interpretation is questionable owing to experimental results in favor of higher stoichiometry with coupling sites 2 (complex III) and 3 (complex IV). Indeed, an ideal value of 1.5, significantly higher than the ADP/O obtained for succinate with tomato fruit mitochondria, has become generally accepted. For instance, an ideal value close to 2 for oxidative phosphorylation with succinate has been determined in rat liver mitochondria (19.Brown G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14704-14709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP/O ratio of 2.5 has been observed with pyruvate in yeast mitochondria in which coupling site 1 (complex I) is absent (20.Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochem. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that in our experiments, leaks and/or slips are not negligible and, surprisingly, remain in a constant ratio with oxygen consumption during titration withn-butyl malonate. However, a proper modeling of such behavior is lacking so far. In contrast, when titration concerns complex III (e.g. inhibition with antimycin A) instead of an upstream step, it has been shown that ADP/O constancy (or increase) may be due to a compensatory (or dominating) effect of the decrease in the relative contribution of slip within the titrated pump (21.Pietrobon D. Luvisetto S. Azzone G.F. Biochem. 1987; 26: 7339-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ADP/O constancy using antimycin A or cyanide as inhibitors was also observed with yeast mitochondria (20.Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochem. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the yield of oxidative phosphorylation of isolated tomato fruit mitochondria remains constant in the our experimental conditions but the exact meaning of this constancy is unclear. Nevertheless, it allows for the determination of the contribution of an energy-dissipating pathway by ADP/O measurement as has already been made for AOX in amoeba (6.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This will be discussed further for the LA-induced uncoupling. Another aspect of interest is that no decrease in ΔΨ (main part the proton motive force) is observed in state 3 when the respiratory rate is decreased by n-butyl malonate to around 50% (ΔΨ3 = 172 ± 5, S.D., n = 43). This means that the rate of ATP synthesis, which decreases with inhibition of respiration, is steeply dependent on ΔΨ, at least as strongly as reported for rat liver mitochondria (22.Zoratti M. Pietrobon D. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23.Woelders H. van der Velden T. van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Uncouplers stimulate the rate of respiration and decrease ΔΨ in state 4. They also decrease the yield of oxidative phosphorylation in state 3 (ADP/O). Such effects of uncouplers may arise from introducing an additional leak pathway (protonophoric uncoupling) or increasing slippage proportion when they bind to a redox proton pump or to ATP synthase (intrinsic uncoupling). Decoupling of localized proton circuits may also be considered (24.Rottenberg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FCCP is usually considered as a typical protonophoric uncoupler, although it might also have some direct effect on the redox pumps (21.Pietrobon D. Luvisetto S. Azzone G.F. Biochem. 1987; 26: 7339-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,25.Luvisetto S. Pietrobon D. Azzone G.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7332-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the rationale of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the effect of increased permeability to protons on the J p versus J o dependence obtained when the electron supply to the redox pumps is modulated (lower limit titration) should be a decrease in slope and an increase in the intercept with abscissa (linear extrapolation atJ p = 0). This has been observed with rat liver mitochondria (18.Beavis A.D Lehninger A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, in this experiment, the effect of FCCP on the slope was relatively small compared with that on the intercept. From these data, extrapolation to zero leak provided a P/O stoichiometry of 1.76 with succinate as oxidizable substrate. Luvisettoet al. (26.Luvisetto S. Conti E. Buso M. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1034-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that FCCP effect in lower limit titration plot of J K+ versus J o (determination of q+/O lower limit at sites II and III in rat liver mitochondria) is only a shift to the right with negligible change in slope. The same behavior observed in upper limit titration has been simulated using the kinetic model (slippy pump) of Pietrobon and Caplan (27.Pietrobon D. Caplan S.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5764-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) for a protonophoric ohmic leak inducer. In contrast, this model predicts that an intrinsic uncoupler (slip inducer) would modify the slope. In fact, lack of slope modification in lower limit titration appears to be a safe indication that two conditions are fulfilled: (i) no modification in the intrinsic stoichiometry of the oxidative phosphorylation by added agent, and (ii) no steep sensitivity of the protonophoric activity to ΔΨ variation during the titration. Thus, it may be concluded from the data of Fig. 2 that (i) both FCCP (0.03 μm) and LA (up to 8 μm) decrease the yield of oxidative phosphorylation in tomato fruit mitochondria by a pure protonophoric process; (ii) contribution sustained by the LA-induced protonophoric activity remains almost constant during titration with n-butyl malonate; and so (iii) ADP/O measurements allow calculation of this contribution. The inability of LA and FCCP to increase V3 suggests that, in state 3, respiration is likely at a maximum value limited by the electron supply to the cytochrome pathway (7.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Insensitivity of ΔΨ3 to LA as well as ton-butyl malonate is likely due to the kinetics of ATP synthesis. However, a small decrease in V3 accompanied by a small increase in ΔΨ3 (Fig. 1, Table I), if significant, may suggest that LA inhibits ATP synthesis, probably by inhibiting the ADP/ATP carrier (28.Wojtczak L. Wieckowski M.R. Schonfeld P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or interacting with the ATP synthase. In any case, slip induction seems to be excluded due to the absence of a decrease in dJ p/J o for all used concentrations of LA (Fig. 2). Pure protonophoric effect of LA is in agreement with the conclusion reached by Schönfeld et al. (29.Schonfeld P. Schild L. Kunz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) regarding FFA-induced uncoupling in rat liver mitochondria and contradicts the occurrence of slip induction in the redox proton pumps (21.Pietrobon D.

Contribution of respiration leading to ATP synthesis (Vcyt cons) with the same yield (probably not the highest possible but constant) as in the absence of uncoupler, and contribution of respiration sustained by dissipative H+re-uptake (VPUMP) have been calculated using the ADP/O values. This dissipative contribution to oxygen consumption is equal to the electrogenic transport activity of PUMP (H+ uptake (Ref. 31.Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or LA− exit (Refs. 3.Ježeek P. Engstova H. Zackova M. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The relative contribution of PUMP in oxygen consumption (VPUMP/V3) is also the relative contribution of PUMP in proton re-uptake. With 4 μm LA, this relative contribution varies from about 15% in the absence ofn-butyl malonate to about 40% in the presence of 35 mm n-butyl malonate. The relative PUMP activity increases with LA concentration at a given n-butyl malonate concentration and with n-butyl malonate concentration at a given LA concentration at the expense of ADP phosphorylation. Heat production is an obvious physiological role of AOX and uncoupling protein in specialized plant and animal thermogenic tissues, e.g. in spadices of Araceae (33.Meeuse B.J.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 117-126Crossref Google Scholar) and in brown adipose tissue (8.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), respectively. Their discovery in non-thermogenic tissues and protists has stimulated search for other functions of non-coupled respiration and uncoupling such as decreasing formation of reactive oxygen species (8.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 34.Wagner A.M. Moore A.L. Biosci.

Our results on tomato fruit mitochondria indicate that AOX and PUMP probably do not have interchangeable roles despite the fact that both activities lead to decrease in ATP synthesis and to increase in energy dissipation. Indeed, expression of AOX and PUMP proteins does not change in a parallel manner during post-harvest ripening of tomato (5.Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FFAs (like LA), which activate PUMP drastically inhibit AOX (4.Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the importance of the AOX activityin vivo in relation to that of PUMP, decreases with ripening during which FFA content increases (37.Güçlü J. Paulin A. Soudain P. Plant Physiol. 1989; 77: 413-419Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38.Rouet-Mayer M.A. Valentova O. Simond-Cote E. Daussant J. Thévenot C. Lipids. 1995; 30: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Results described in this paper point out an additional difference between PUMP and AOX. Namely, it has been shown that in the presence of BHAM (AOX inactive) and at a fixed concentration of LA, the ADP/O ratio decreases when state 3 respiration of isolated mitochondria is decreased by succinate uptake inhibition (Table I), the PUMP activity remains constant, while the rate of ATP synthesis decreases (Fig. 2). When the same experiment is performed in the absence of BHAM (AOX active) and in the absence of LA (PUMP inactive), the ADP/O ratio rapidly increases, when V3 decreases, up to that value obtained when neither AOX nor PUMP are active (39.Sluse, F. E., Jarmuszkiewicz, W., Almeida, A. M., Sluse-Goffart, C. M., and Vercesi, A. E. (1999) XXVIII Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, May 22–25, 1999, Caxambu, Brazil, Abstract SP14-03Google Scholar). Such behavior has also been observed with soybean cotyledon mitochondria (40.Moore A.L. Leach G. Whitehouse D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and amoeba mitochondria (6.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is due to the steep decrease in AOX activity when steady-state proportion of quinol (AOX substrate) is decreased (6.Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41.Dry I.B. Moore A.L. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, AOX and PUMP, which both decrease the ADP/O, have completely different kinetic behavior since AOX is highly sensitive to the redox state of the quinone pool that has no effect on PUMP. This leads to opposite effects of a ubiquinol level change on the yield of the oxidative phosphorylation according to whether AOX or PUMP is active. This further supports the view that AOX and PUMP have different roles in vivo. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the LA-induced PUMP activity very efficiently diverts energy from oxidative phosphorylation in state 3 respiration and that this diversion increases with LA concentration and relatively increases with the decreasing of electron flux."

In C6 glioma cells, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concomitantly potentiated the stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) and BH4 production induced by IFN-γ and interleukin-1β. Expression of both iNOS and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, was also markedly increased, as were their activities and protein levels. Ceramide, a sphingolipid metabolite, may mediate some of the actions of TNF-α. Indeed, we found that bacterial sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin and increases endogenous ceramide, or the cell permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide, but not C2-dihydroceramide (N-acetylsphinganine), significantly mimicked the effects of TNF-α on NO production and iNOS expression and activity in C6 cells. Surprisingly, although TNF-α increased BH4 synthesis and GTPCH activity, neither BH4 nor GTPCH expression was affected by C2-ceramide or sphingomyelinase in IFN-γ- and interleukin-1β-stimulated cells. It is likely that increased BH4 levels results from increased GTPCH protein and activity in vivo rather than from reduced turnover of BH4, because the GTPCH inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, blocked cytokine-stimulated BH4 accumulation. Moreover, expression of the GTPCH feedback regulatory protein, which if decreased might increase GTPCH activity, was not affected by TNF-α or ceramide. Treatment with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, which is known to inhibit NF-κB and sphingomyelinase in C6 cells, or with the peptide SN-50, which blocks translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, inhibited TNF-α-dependent iNOS mRNA expression without affecting GTPCH mRNA levels. This is the first demonstration that cytokine-stimulated iNOS and GTPCH expression, and therefore NO and BH4 biosynthesis, may be regulated by discrete pathways. As BH4 is also a cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, discovery of distinct mechanisms for regulation of BH4 and NO has important implications for its specific functions. Synthesis of 6(R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a required cofactor for inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, is usually coordinately regulated with iNOS expression.

Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), microglia, and astrocytes (2.Simmons M.L. Murphy S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Synthesis of this free radical gas is primarily a protective mechanism utilized by the host against invading organisms (reviewed in Ref. 3.MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been suggested that overproduction of NO in the central nervous system may mediate some of the pathological sequelae of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (4.Parkinson J.F. Mitrovic B. Merrill J.E. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and neuronal death following acute injury (5.Takeuchi A. Isobe K.I. Miyaishi O. Sawada M. Fan Z.H. Nakashima I. Kiuchi K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). iNOS is active as a homodimer of 130-kDa subunits and requires five cofactors to catalyze the conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline, a reaction that liberates NO (reviewed in Ref. 6.Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three of the cofactors, NADPH, FAD, and FMN, are usually present in cells at concentrations that are not limiting for enzyme activity. Calmodulin, the fourth cofactor, is constitutively bound to iNOS in a manner that, unlike its function with the two constitutive isoforms of NOS, makes iNOS activity calcium-independent (7.Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular level of the cofactor 6(R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is rate-limiting for NO generation, and its synthesis is usually co-induced by cytokines (8.Werner E.R.

The exact role that BH4plays in iNOS catalysis is still equivocal, but it has been shown to bind to iNOS monomers, promoting their dimerization and subsequent activation (11.Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and recently has been proposed to play a role in the enzymatic reaction in a radical form (12.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The cellular level of BH4 is largely regulated by the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway (6.Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GTPCH, a homodecamer of 30-kDa subunits that are arranged as two pentamers facing one another (13.Steinmetz M.O. Pluss C. Christen U. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Engel A. Aebi U. Pfeilschifter J. Kammerer R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), catalyzes the rearrangement of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. This intermediate is then converted to BH4 in two subsequent reactions catalyzed by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase, respectively, neither of which is rate-limiting. GTPCH mRNA expression can be induced by the same proinflammatory stimuli that induce iNOS mRNA (14.Hattori Y. Gross S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, cytokine-stimulated NO production is predominantly regulated by increased GTPCH mRNA expression (15.Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 16.Katusic Z.S. Stelter A. Milstien S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and not by changes in expression of endothelial NOS. Ceramide, formed by the sphingomyelinase (SMase)-mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, is now emerging as a lipid second messenger that mediates some of the biological effects of TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS in differentiation, apoptosis, and cell growth arrest (reviewed in Refs.17.Merrill A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 18.Kolesnick R.

Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. IB. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich1996: 537-563Google Scholar). Recently, LPS and SMase-mediated elevations in ceramide have been demonstrated to potentiate NO formation and iNOS expression in rat primary astrocytes and C6 gliablastoma cells (20.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in NO production have not yet been fully elucidated, although it appears that activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-κB, is essential for iNOS induction (21.Katsuyama K. Shichiri M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4506-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To study the potential role of ceramide in cytokine-stimulated BH4 production, we used C6 rat astroglioma cells, a convenient model astrocyte cell line. Furthermore, in this cell line, as in primary astrocytes, TNF-α has been shown to stimulate degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide (22.Singh I. Pahan K. Khan M. Singh A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20354-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although ceramide generation, similar to TNF-α treatment potentiated NO and iNOS expression induced by IFN-γ plus IL-1β, surprisingly, we found that it did not mimic the effects of TNF-α on BH4 or GTPCH expression. Our results thus suggest that BH4 and NO biosynthesis can be differentially regulated in C6 cells. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine was supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Murine recombinant IL-1β was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant rat IFN-γ and TNF-α were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).N-acetyl-d-sphingosine (C2-ceramide), C2-dihydroceramide, sphingosine, and SN-50 and mutant SN-50 peptides were from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc.

Mouse macrophage polyclonal iNOS antibody and a mouse macrophage positive control were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Ann Arbor, MI). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). All Western blot materials were from NOVEX (San Diego, CA). Dowex 50W-X8 was from Bio-Rad and was used in the sodium form. C6 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. All experiments were performed on a freshly thawed batch of cells that had been passaged only twice and then aliquoted and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor. Prior to each experiment, cells were defrosted and grown in 175-cm2flasks until 80–90% confluent, trypsinized, and then seeded at 100,000 cells/well in six-well plates (3 ml of medium). After 48 h, cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to treatments. All cytokine solutions were prepared according to the manufacturers' instructions. Lipids were prepared as 10 mm solutions in methanol and stored at –70 °C. C2-ceramide and C2-dihydroceramide were diluted in ethanol and added directly to the medium, maintaining a final ethanol concentration of ≤0.4% (v/v). Prior to use, an aliquot of sphingosine was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then resuspended in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin by probe sonication on ice. PDTC and SN-50 peptides were added 2 h prior to the addition of cytokines or lipids. Nitrite, which is the stable oxidation product of NO and an index of iNOS activity, accumulates in the medium and was measured essentially as described previously (9.Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 6-10PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, after stimulation for the indicated times, 100 μl of medium was mixed with 75 μl of Griess reagent B (2% sulfanilamide in 1m H3PO4, w/v) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min, after which 75 μl of Griess reagent A (0.2% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in water (w/v)) was added. After a further 10 min, the absorbance was measured at 550 nm using an EL-340 Bio Kinetics microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Standard curves were generated with NaNO2 added to the same medium. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), detached by trypsinization, then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Cell suspensions were sonicated on ice with a fine-tipped probe sonicator for 15 s, lysates were cleared at 10,000 × g for 3 min, supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce). BH4 was measured as described previously (9.Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 6-10PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, 50 μl of cell lysate was diluted to 80 μl with extraction buffer and then mixed with 20 μl of 1 mH3PO4, 1.5 m HClO4(1:1, v/v). Approximately 10 mg of MnO2 was added to oxidize reduced pterins to their fluorescent aromatic forms. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 5 min. Supernatants were removed and analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection as described previously (23.Davis M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GTPCH activity was measured essentially as described previously (24.Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, to 30 μl of lysate were added 5 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 μl of 10 mm GTP. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and placed on ice, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m HCl, followed by 5 μl of iodine reagent (1% I2/2% KI (1:1, w/v). After 20 min at room temperature in the dark, 5 μl of 2% ascorbic acid (w/v) was added followed by 10 μl of 2 m Tris base. Neopterin triphosphate was then dephosphorylated by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 units of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase, followed by the addition of 50 μl of 1 mH3PO4 to terminate the reaction. Samples were cleared by centrifugation at maximum speed in a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min. Neopterin was measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection (23.Davis M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates (50 μl) were added to 50 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 μm NADPH, 10 μm BH4, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μm l-arginine, 2 μCi ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine. NOS assays were carried out at 37 °C for 45 min and terminated on ice by the addition of 400 μl of stop buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm l-citrulline). [3H]Citrulline was collected by passing the samples through 1.0-ml Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Na+) columns, preequilibrated with stop buffer. The columns were washed twice with 0.5 ml of stop buffer. [3H]Citrulline in the combined run-through and washes was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA was isolated from confluent cultures with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA (1 μg) was converted to cDNA with random hexamers and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was amplified by PCR in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermal cycler using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles for iNOS and GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), 32 cycles for GTPCH, and 25 cycles for actin (94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min). Final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. The following forward and reverse PCR primers were used (predicted product size): iNOS, 5′-CTGCAGGTCTTTGACGCTCGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGAACACAGGGGTGATGCT-3′ (741 base pairs); GFRP, 5′-CAGATCCGTATGGAAGTGGGTC-3′ and 5′-CACCCCTGTCATGCTTAACAC-3′ (195 base pairs); GTPCH, 5′-GGATACCAGGAGACCATCTCA-3′ and 5′-TAGCATCCTGCTAGTGACAGT-3′ (372 base pairs); and actin, 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′ and 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′ (743 base pairs). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized with UV fluorescence and a video camera, and bands were quantified with the National Institutes of Health Image program. Reaction conditions were optimized in preliminary experiments so that amplifications were within the logarithmic phase and yields were approximately linear with input cDNA concentration. To ensure that contaminating genomic DNA was not being amplified, PCR was also performed without reverse transcriptase treatment. Aliquots of cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were concentrated using chloroform:methanol:H2O phase partition. In brief, lysates were diluted to 450 μl with H2O and mixed with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1) to give a final ratio of 1:1:0.9. The mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged in a benchtop microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 3 min to separate the phases. With this solvent combination, the proteins aggregate at the interphase. 700 μl of the upper phase was removed without disturbing the interphase and discarded, and an equivalent volume of methanol was added back to the lower phase. The protein aggregates were pelleted at maximum speed for 10 min. Supernatants were carefully aspirated, and the pellets were dried at 50 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 1× LDS NuPAGE sample buffer (NOVEX) containing 50 mmdithiothreitol and then heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins were resolved on 4–12% Bis/Tris NuPAGE gels for 90 min at 175 V and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 100 V for 60 min in NOVEX transfer buffer at 4 °C. NuPAGE antioxidant (1:1000, v/v) was added to assist with transfer of high molecular weight proteins. Membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.02% (v/v) azide, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for at least 1 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with wash buffer (KPL), membranes were incubated with iNOS antibody (1:7500) for 2 h in milk diluent (KPL) and then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000) for 1 h. Membranes were extensively washed, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Combinations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α, together with LPS, which induce NO production in astrocytes, also coordinately increase the synthesis of the NOS cofactor, BH4 (25.Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that ceramide potentiated LPS and cytokine-induced NO and iNOS expression in rat primary astrocytes (20.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because TNF-α has been shown to stimulate hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide in many types of cells, including C6 cells (22.Singh I. Pahan K. Khan M. Singh A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20354-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it was of interest to analyze the involvement of ceramide in TNF-α-induced NO and BH4 biosynthesis in these cells, as they express many of the properties of astrocytes. In agreement with previous studies (26.Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 62: 315-321Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α evoked a marked stimulation of NO production as measured by nitrite accumulation to a level of 36 μm in the medium after 24 h (Fig.1 A). TNF-α was unable to induce NO production by itself. Furthermore, in the absence of TNF-α, the amount of nitrite produced by IFN-γ/IL-1β was dramatically lower (2.1 μm). The cell permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide, in a dose-dependent manner, or exogenous bacterial SMase, which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate endogenous ceramide, mimicked the effect of TNF-α, and potentiated IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced NO production (Fig. 1). This appears to be a specific ceramide effect because other related sphingolipid metabolites, including sphingosine and the inactive ceramide analogue, C2-dihydroceramide, which has the same structure as C2-ceramide but lacks the double bond, did not replicate the effects of C2-ceramide or SMase (data not shown). In addition, C2-ceramide dose-dependently potentiated IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced iNOS activity as measured in vitro with a maximum stimulation of more than 10-fold at a concentration of 7.5 μm (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, neither C2-dihydroceramide nor sphingosine had any effect on IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced iNOS activity (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with its more potent ability to potentiate NO production, TNF-α notably enhanced IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced iNOS activity by more than 40-fold. It should be noted that similar to TNF-α alone, treatment with C2-ceramide or SMase in the absence of IFN-γ/IL-1β had no significant effects on NO production or iNOS expression or activity.Figure 2Ceramide specifically potentiates iNOS activity induced by IFN-γ and IL-1β. A, C6 cells were stimulated for 16 h with IFN-γ (40 units/ml) and IL-1β (8 units/ml) in the absence or presence of TNF-α (4000 units/ml) or the indicated concentrations of C2-ceramide and in vitro iNOS activity was determined by measurement of the conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as pmol of citrulline formed/mg/min and are means ± S.D. of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. B, cells were stimulated with IFN-γ and IL-1β in the absence or presence of 10 μm C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, or sphingosine for 16 h, andin vitro iNOS activity was measured. Asterisks in both panels indicate statistically significant differences compared with IFN-γ/IL-1β-treated cells as determined by Student'st test (p = 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was of interest to determine whether the stimulatory effect of TNF-α and ceramide on NO production and iNOS activity was due to an increase in iNOS expression. In agreement with previous reports, iNOS mRNA was not detectable by RT-PCR in untreated C6 cells (20.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but was induced by IFN-γ/IL-1β, and its expression was further enhanced by addition of TNF-α or C2-ceramide (Fig.3 A). The same pattern of responses was observed when iNOS protein levels were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, C2-ceramide dose-dependently increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3, C andD). Thus, C2-ceramide is able to mimic the effects of TNF-α in potentiating IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced iNOS transcription, translation, and enzyme activity, albeit with less efficiency than TNF-α. As C2-ceramide potentiated IFN-γ/IL-1β-induced iNOS activity and protein by 8–10-fold yet increased NO production to a much smaller extent, it was possible that in vivo iNOS activity might be limited by the availability of its cofactor, BH4. In order to establish whether BH4 levels were limiting for NO production, C6 cells were treated with 5 μm sepiapterin, which is readily taken up and converted to BH4 (28.Nichol C.A. Lee C.L. Edelstein M.P. Chao J.Y. Duch D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80 (1450): 1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Sepiapterin did not increase NO production in C6 cells treated with C2-ceramide and IFN-γ/IL-1β (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that iNOS activity in this case is limited by the intracellular concentration of BH4. Previously, we showed that cytokines and LPS induce both production of NO and de novo biosynthesis of BH4 in astrocytes (25.Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TNF-α in the presence of IFN-γ/IL-1β markedly stimulated BH4 biosynthesis in C6 cells by more than 5-fold over the effect of IFN-γ/IL-1β alone (Fig. 4). Changes in GTPCH activity mirrored the BH4 increases (Fig. 4), in agreement with its role as the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis. Indeed, it is likely that the increased BH4 results from increased de novo synthesis, rather than decreased catabolism, because the GTPCH inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, blocked the cytokine-induced BH4 increase (data not shown). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether ceramide, in a manner similar to its effects on NO production, mimicked the effects of TNF-α and mediated an increase in BH4 synthesis in these cells. However, increasing ceramide levels by treatment of C6 cells with C2-ceramide or SMase did not potentiate the effects of IFN-γ/IL-1β on BH4 biosynthesis or on GTPCH activity (Fig. 4). It has previously been reported that proinflammatory cytokines in combination with LPS stimulate GTPCH mRNA expression in mouse osteoblasts (27.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in C6 cells (27.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.D'Sa C. Hirayama K. West A. Hahn M. Zhu M. Kapatos G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the stimulatory effect of TNF-α on BH4 production and GTPCH activity in IFN-γ/IL-1β-treated C6 cells was due to an increase in GTPCH mRNA expression. We found that GTPCH mRNA is constitutively expressed at low levels in C6 cells and that its expression is increased by IFN-γ/IL-1β and further enhanced by the addition of TNF-α (Fig. 5 A). In agreement with their lack of effects on BH4 and GTPCH activity (Fig. 4), neither C2-ceramide nor SMase had any significant effects on GTPCH mRNA expression (Fig. 5 B). This is the first demonstration that GTPCH and iNOS expression can be differentially regulated. As it was possible that there might have been a rapid and transient increase in GTPCH mRNA expression evoked by the addition of C2-ceramide or SMase to IFN-γ/IL-1β-treated cells that might not be obvious after 16 h (Fig. 5), we examined a more complete time course for induction of both GTPCH and iNOS expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. TNF-α significantly increased GTPCH mRNA expression (normalized to actin expression) within 8 h in cells treated with IFN-γ/IL-1β (Fig. 6 B). Expression then increased nearly linearly for at least another 8 h. Addition of TNF-α also increased the intracellular concentration of BH4"
https://openalex.org/W1970296041,"The antagonist activity of antiestrogens is due to the presence of a long carbon side chain at positions 7α or 11β or equivalent on their steroid or steroid-like skeletons. These side chains establish hydrophobic interactions with amino acids of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) ligand binding domain. In addition, a hydrogen bond formed between amino acid Asp-351 and the tertiary amine present at the end of the side chain of partial antiestrogens is considered to be crucial for their antiestrogenicity. Here, we have investigated the role of Asp-351 in antiestrogen action in transiently transfected HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results indicate that disruption of the negative charge at position 351 does not increase the agonist activity of partial antiestrogens and thus that the hydrogen bond with the antiestrogen side chain is not determinant in positioning the side chain in an antagonist position. The negative charge at position 351 was not required for transcriptional activity in the presence of hormone, but its presence was necessary for basal activity of the wild-type receptor and constitutive activities of mutants L536P and Y537A, suggesting a role of Asp-351 in stabilizing the active conformation of ERα. This stabilizing role of Asp-351 could be due to interaction of Asp-351 with the amide group of the peptide bond between Leu-539 and Leu-540 in helix 12 observed in the active conformation of the ERα ligand binding domain.

However, the crystal structure of estrogen receptor α (ERα) revealed that helix 12 is repositioned in the presence of the antagonists tamoxifen (Tam) or raloxifene (Ral), thereby disrupting the surface of interaction with coactivators (16.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 23.Shiau A.K.

The side chain of these antiestrogens plays an important role in displacing helix 12. This suggests that amino acids of the ligand-binding domain that interact with the antiestrogen side chain play an important role in the transcriptionally inactive conformation of this domain. It has been suggested that integrity of aspartate 351, which forms a hydrogen bond with the tertiary amine present at the end of the side chains of Tam and Ral, is the key to the antiestrogenic character of these analogs (28.Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 58: 1872-1875Google Scholar). Indeed, a mutation of Asp-351 to tyrosine was isolated from an MCF7 tumor variant that was not inhibited but rather stimulated by Tam (29.Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30.Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both Tam and Ral also behaved as agonists for expression of the estrogen target gene transforming growth factor-α in MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with this mutant of ERα, while the full antiestrogen ICI182,780 remained inactive (28.Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 58: 1872-1875Google Scholar). Here we have introduced several mutations at position 351 and tested the functional consequences of these changes on ERα transactivation properties in the presence of estrogen and of antiestrogens. Our results demonstrate that Asp-351 can be mutagenized to Gly, Ala, or Val without diminishing the antagonist activity of antiestrogens in HeLa cells. However, we provide evidence for a stabilizing effect of Asp-351 on the active conformation of the wild-type ER LBD in the absence of hormones. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), and ICI182,780 were purchased from Sigma.

Mutations were introduced in the ER cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction amplification (the sequence of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis is available upon request). Expression plasmids for mutant ERs were generated by subcloning of a HindIII/BamHI fragment of 768 base pairs into the pSG5-HEGO expression vector.

Precipitates were washed 24 h after transfection, and cells were incubated in the presence of hormones (as indicated) for another 24 h before harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by three cycles of freeze-thawing and were standardized for β-galactosidase activity. CAT assays were performed as described previously (37.Barsalou A. Gao W. Anghel S.I. Carriere J. Mader S. J. Biol.

For Western blotting, gel shift, and hormone binding assays, the wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection of 15 μg of pSG5 expression vectors containing wild-type or mutant ERα cDNAs using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. Whole cell extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfer onto nitrocellulose, and incubation with anti-ERα mouse monoclonal antibodies B10 and F3 (obtained from Prof. P.

Complex formation between wild-type or mutant ERs and a consensus ERE probe from the vitellogenin A2 gene was determined as described previously (38.Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.Y. Chambon P. J. Biol.

Essentially, cell extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were preincubated with poly(dI-dC) (2 μg) for 15 min on ice prior to addition of the probe (100,000 cpm) and incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. Receptor-DNA complexes were resolved from unbound DNA in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. Whole cell extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared in high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors) by three cycles of freeze-thawing. Protein content was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). For each binding reaction, 80 μg of protein extract were used; each assay was carried out in duplicate. To the protein extract was added tritiated estradiol (6,7-[3H]estradiol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with or without a 100-fold excess of cold estradiol, and high salt buffer to a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature followed by 10 min on ice, 50 μl of high salt buffer containing 2% charcoal (Aldrich, Activated Carbon Norit SA3–100 mesh) and 0.1% Dextran T-70 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the samples. After 15 min of incubation on ice and centrifugation, 90 μl of supernatant were counted by scintillation counting. pSG5 plasmids containing cDNAs for wild-type or mutant ERs were linearized with BamHI, transcribed, and translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Mandel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation of the beads with 1 ml of crude bacterial extract in GST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Beads bound to GST fusion protein or GST alone were incubated with in vitro translated wild-type or mutant ERs in the presence of vehicle or 1 μm ligand at 4 °C, overnight. The beads were then washed three times with 800 μl of GST buffer, boiled for 2 min in 2× Laemmli buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed with 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 15 min, rehydrated for 15 min, washed for 15 min in a 1m salicylate solution, and vacuum-dried. Autoradiography was performed overnight. Several point mutations were introduced in wild-type human ERα (HEG0) at position 351 in helix 3 of the ligand binding domain. The aspartate residue was replaced by the hydrophobic amino acids alanine or valine, by the polar amino acid tyrosine or by the longer negatively charged residue glutamic acid; in addition, the effect of complete removal of the amino acid lateral chain at position 351 was investigated by replacement with a glycine residue (Fig.1 A). HEG0 and all mutants were expressed at similar levels after transient transfection into COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B) or HeLa cells (data not shown). The effects of these mutations on ERα transcriptional activity was investigated by cotransfection of expression vectors for each mutant together with a CAT reporter vector containing the minimal ERE3-TATA promoter. Levels of transcriptional activity generated from the reporter construct in the absence of exogenous hormone differed significantly between wild-type and mutant receptors (Fig. 2,inset). Although basal levels of activity with mutant HED351E were similar to those observed with HEG0, all other mutants generated very low or undetectable levels of activity in the absence of added hormone. However, levels of transcription achieved with all tested HED351 mutants at saturating concentrations of estradiol (10 nm and above) were comparable to those observed with HEG0 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Mutations that suppress the negative charge at position 351 reduce basal activity of the ER without affecting estradiol-induced transcription. Expression vectors for wild-type or mutant ERαs (0.5 μg) were transiently transfected into HeLa cells together with the reporter vector ERE3-TATA-CAT (2 μg) and the internal control vector CMV-βGal (2 μg). CAT activity was measured in extracts from cells treated with varying concentrations of estradiol. The inset presents the basal activities of wild-type or mutant receptors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether recruitment of coactivators is similar with wild-type or mutant receptors, we performed GST pull-down assays using a fusion protein between GST and the coactivator TIF2.1 (9.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 36.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Background levels of binding were observed in the absence of hormone or in the presence of antiestrogens OHT or ICI182,780. In the presence of estradiol, recruitment by the fusion protein of the HED351G, HED351V, and HED351Y mutants was comparable to that of wild-type ERα (about 10% of input protein, see Fig. 3), consistent with the transactivation data. The full antiestrogen ICI182,780 (100 nm) completely repressed transcriptional activity of HEG0 and all the Asp-351 mutants on the ERE3-TATA promoter (Fig. 4 A). Weak transcriptional activity was detected in the presence of the partial antiestrogen OHT (100 nm) with HEG0 and mutants HED351E and HED351Y (Fig. 4 A, inset). Activity of mutant HED351Y in the presence of OHT was comparable to those of wild-type and HED351E, but was elevated relative to its undetectable levels of basal activity. Similar results were obtained with the partial antiestrogen RU39,411 (data not shown). On the other hand, transcriptional activity of mutants HED351G, HED351A, or HED351V was undetectable in the presence of OHT (Fig. 4 A). We next investigated whether increased concentrations of coactivators could boost the agonist activity of OHT with mutants at position 351. Expression vectors for coactivators of the p160 family (TIF2, SRC1, and AIB1) were transiently cotransfected in HeLa cells together with an expression vector for wild-type ERα and the reporter vector ERE3-TATA-CAT. Induction of estradiol-dependent transcription was maximal when cotransfecting the expression vector pSG5-TIF2.1 (Ref. 9.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar; data not shown). Estradiol-induced transcriptional activity of HEG0 or of the Asp-351 mutants was increased by ∼7-fold in the presence of TIF2.1 (Fig. 4 B). Strikingly, basal activity of the wild type or of the HED351E mutant was increased 80-fold, while basal activity of all other mutants was still undetectable. No activity of wild-type ERα or any of the mutants was detected in the presence of the full antagonist ICI182,780 (Fig.4 B). Activity of HED351Y with OHT was stimulated 40-fold in the presence of TIF2.1, converting OHT into an almost full agonist (Fig. 4 B). Activity of wild-type ERα or of HED351E in the presence of OHT was also stimulated, although levels of transcriptional activity reached were lower than with HED351Y. On the other hand, transcriptional activity of the HED351G, HED351A, or HED351V mutants in the presence of OHT remained very low even in the presence of excess TIF2.1 (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of HeLa cells cotransfected with expression vectors for ERα mutants and pSG5-TIF2.1 with increasing concentrations of OHT demonstrates that, although transcriptional activity of the D351Y mutant reached a plateau at nanomolar concentrations of OHT, activity of the D351G, D351A, and D351V mutants remained very low in the nanomolar to micromolar range of OHT (Fig.4 C). To investigate whether the cellular context could influence the degree of agonist activity observed in the presence of OHT with the different mutants at position 351, we repeated our experiments in breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells. Levels of OHT-induced activity were undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with expression vectors for HEG0, HED351E, HED351V, or HED351Y and the minimal ERE3-TATA promoter. When coactivator TIF2.1 was overexpressed in these cells, activity of HED351Y was clearly detectable in the presence of OHT. HEG0 and mutant HED351E were stimulated to lesser degrees, and mutant HED351V was even more weakly active (Fig.5). Thus, similar to what was observed in HeLa cells, removing the negative charge at position 351 was not sufficient to increase the agonist activity of OHT in MDA-MB-231 cells. The absence of activity of the HED351G, HED351A, and HED351V mutants with OHT could be due to defective antiestrogen binding. HeLa cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of OHT premixed with 0.3 nm E2. The resulting competition curves were similar for all receptors tested including HED351Y, suggesting that the relative affinity for OHTversus E2 was comparable in all mutants (Fig.6 A). Similar results were obtained with ICI182,780 (data not shown). We also performed in vitro hormone binding assays with wild-type and mutant receptors to assess whether ER mutants have a reduced affinity for estradiol. Results of these experiments indicate that the D351A, D351V, or D351Y mutations did not significantly affect estradiol binding (Fig.6 B and data not shown). These results demonstrate that mutations at position 351 suppressing the negative charge do not grossly perturb the structure of the ligand binding domain, and that the lower activity of the resulting mutants with OHT cannot be attributed to a low affinity for this antiestrogen. Although mutations D351G, D351A, and D351V did not affect ERα function in the presence of estrogen, all inhibited its basal activity, even in the presence of overexpressed TIF2.1 (Figs. 2, 4, and5). These results are similar to the phenotype associated with a previously described mutation in the ERα ligand binding domain, G400V, which results in a receptor (HE0) with very low basal levels of activity due to diminished dimerization and DNA binding in the absence of hormone (31.Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We performed gel shift assays to compare the effect of the G400V and the D351A, D351Y, or D351E mutations on binding to the consensus ERE. Wild-type ERα and all Asp 351 mutants bound to an estrogen response element with similar efficiency in the absence and in the presence of hormone (Fig. 7, comparelanes 5–12 to lanes 1 and2; note that concentrations of the Asp 351 mutants were higher than those of HEGO in this assay). By comparison, ER mutant HEO did not bind DNA in the absence of hormone (Fig. 7, comparelanes 3 and 4 to lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that, unlike mutation G400V, mutations at position 351 do not affect DNA binding and dimerization. The absence of effect of the Asp-351 mutations on ER ligand binding and DNA binding properties suggest that the removal of the negative charge at this position specifically affects transcriptional activity of ERα in the absence of added estrogen. To confirm that mutations at position Asp-351 can repress transcriptional activity in the absence of hormone, we introduced mutation D351A in the HEY537A (34.White R. Sjöberg M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35.Lazennec G. Ediger T.R. Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) receptors, which are constitutively active ERα mutants that can recruit coactivators in the absence of hormone in vitro (33.Eng F.C.S.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). While mutants HEY537A and HEL536P activated the ERE3-TATA promoter both in the absence or the presence of estradiol, but not antiestrogens (Fig. 8), mutation of D351A abolished the high levels of basal activity observed with both constitutive receptors. In contrast, activity of the double mutants HED351A,L536P and HED351A,Y537A in the presence of estradiol was comparable with that of their singly mutated counterparts (Fig. 8). These results confirm that Asp-351 plays a role in the active conformation of ERα that is more important in the absence of hormone than in its presence. The presence and precise length of the antiestrogen side chain has been correlated with their antagonist activity (39.Jordan V.C. Gosden B. Mol. Cell. Endocrine. 1982; 27: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40.Lednicer D. Lyster S.C. Duncan G.W. J. Med. Chem. 1967; 10: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In human ERα, aspartate 351 interacts with the tertiary amine present at the end of the side chains of Tam and Ral (16.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 23.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P. Agard P.J. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). We have investigated the precise role of this interaction in the pharmacology of partial antiestrogens. Hydrogen bonding between Asp-351 and the side chain of partial antiestrogens could potentially contribute to the affinity of the ERα-antiestrogen complex. However, previous characterization of mutant D351Y indicated that the relative affinity for estradiol or for the antiestrogen tamoxifen was not affected by this mutation (41.Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 9: 1053-1063Google Scholar). Our experiments are consistent with this report and indicate that other mutations leading to replacement of Asp-351 by Ala or Val did not noticeably affect the relative affinity of the corresponding receptors for estradiol and OHT in transiently transfected cells. It is likely that the hydrogen bonds formed by the hydroxyl group of OHT and the numerous hydrophobic interactions with the steroid-like skeleton and the side chain contribute most of the affinity of interaction between ERα and partial antiestrogens. It has been suggested that amino acid Asp-351 is key to the antiestrogenic character of partial antiestrogens (28.Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 58: 1872-1875Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observation that mutant D351Y has increased transcriptional activity in the presence of tamoxifen and raloxifene in breast cells MDA-MB-231. A possible role of the hydrogen bond formed by Asp-351 may be to maintain the side chain of OHT or Ral in an antagonist position. Among the mutations at position 351 tested here, D351Y was unique in its capacity to yield a receptor that was stimulated by OHT and, to a lesser degree, by RU39,411 and Ral (data not shown), but not by full antiestrogen ICI182,780. We speculate that a tyrosine at position 351 may destabilize the inactive conformation and/or stabilize a partially active structure of the ER bound to partial antiestrogens. However, our results indicate that disruption of the hydrogen bond between Asp-351 and the side chain of partial antiestrogens is not sufficient for this effect. Indeed, replacement of Asp-351 by Gly, Ala, or Val did not increase the agonist activity of partial antiestrogens in HeLa and in MDA-MB-231 cells, in the presence or absence of overexpressed TIF2.1, on either a minimal promoter (ERE3-TATA-CAT) or a more complex promoter (ERE3-tk-CAT, data not shown). Moreover, our results are consistent with the observation that the steroid analog RU486, which has a tertiary amine-containing side chain, is an antagonist not only for the progesterone receptor, which contains a glutamic acid at the position corresponding to Asp-351 of ERα, but also with the glucocorticoid receptor, which contains a glycine instead (19.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We observed a marked reduction in the basal activity of the HED351G, HED351A, HED351V, and HED351Y mutants, but not of HED351E. In contrast, estradiol-induced transactivation and TIF2.1 recruitment in vitro were not affected under the conditions of our assays. The DNA and ligand binding properties of these receptors were not affected either. Introduction of mutation D351A in the constitutively active receptors HEL536P and HEY537A confirmed that abolition of the negative charge at position Asp-351 inhibits folding of the unliganded receptor in an active conformation, while estradiol binding was sufficient to stabilize the active conformation despite the D351A mutation. Examination of the active structure of the ERα ligand binding domain reveals that Asp-351 interacts with the amide of the peptide bond between helix 12 amino acids Leu-539 and Leu-540 (16.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 23.Shiau A.K.

Accurate positioning of helix 12 is crucial for recruitment of coactivators that interact with nuclear receptors through LXXLL motifs. We propose that positioning of helix 12 in the active conformation is unstable in the absence of hormone. In this model, disruption of the interaction between Asp-351 and helix 12 would be sufficient to fully destabilize the active configuration in the unliganded receptor. On the other hand, the active conformation of helix 12 in the presence of estradiol is brought about by a network of intra- and intermolecular interactions, such that the contribution of Asp-351 may be less important in the liganded receptor. The larger stimulation of wild-type ERα activity by TIF2.1 overexpression in the absence of hormone than in the presence of estradiol is consistent with a role of this coactivator in stabilizing the unstable active conformation of unliganded ERα LBD. Hydrophobic mutations of Asp-351 fully blocked this positive effect of TIF2.1 on basal activity of ERα, supporting our hypothesis that Asp-351 is important for the active structure of the unliganded ER LBD. Previous studies with antiestrogen analogs have demonstrated the importance for the antagonist activity of antiestrogens of hydrogen bond acceptor groups at the position corresponding to the tertiary amine in OHT (42.Robertson D.W. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Hayes J.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this light, our results that the hydrogen bond between Asp-351 and the antiestrogen side chain can be disrupted without affecting antagonist activity are unexpected. However, we cannot exclude possible tissue-specific effects or the possibility that interaction of the antiestrogen side chain with Asp-351 may prevent this amino acid from stabilizing an active conformation of the ER in a manner similar to our observations with the unliganded receptor. Mutagenizing Asp-351 to hydrophobic residues would prevent such a stabilizing role in addition to disrupting the hydrogen bond with the antiestrogen side chain. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ERα mutants lacking the negative charge at amino acid Asp-351 are efficiently repressed by partial antiestrogens in HeLa cells. These results are not consistent with a crucial role of amino acid Asp-351 in maintaining the side chain of OHT in an antagonist conformation. We are grateful to Dr P. Chambon for the GST-TIF2 and TIF2.1 cDNAs and for monoclonal antibodies B10 and F3. We also thank Dr. J. H. White for critical reading of this manuscript."

Sterol biosynthesis provides an exception to this trend. Eukaryotes use two distinct pathways (Fig. 1) to make structurally similar sterols (1.Ehrhardt J.D. Hirth L. Ourisson G.

Why plants use this two-enzyme route (8.Heintz R. Benveniste P. J. Biol.

Itoh T. Saito M. Matsumoto T. J. Org. Chem. 1984; 49: 709-712Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) requires severe conditions (10% H2SO4 in refluxing isopropyl alcohol for 24 h), it is likely that the enzyme employs a metal or an unusually acidic amino acid residue to open the ring.As a prelude to investigating its catalytic mechanism and biological function, we have cloned and heterologously expressed theArabidopsis thaliana cDNA that encodes cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCycloeucalenol cycloisomerase is a membrane protein (26.Cattel L. Anding C. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 931-935Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and although it has been partially purified from maize by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (10.Hartmann-Bouillon M.A. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1037-1042Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), purifying protein to homogeneity (a prerequisite for peptide sequence-based cloning) has not been reported. Conventional complementation approaches were impossible because hosts such as yeast and bacteria lack the isomerase, precluding the generation of mutants for complementation. We therefore metabolically engineered a yeast strain that mimicked an isomerase mutant. Yeast cyclizes oxidosqualene directly to lanosterol, a tetracyclic sterol precursor (27.Corey E.J.

We found that SMY10 requires ergosterol, like other lanosterol synthase mutants producing endogenous cycloartenol (28.Hart E.A. Hua L. Darr L.B. Wilson W.K. Pang J. Matsuda S.P.T. J. Am. Chem.

Clearly, yeast lanosterol synthase mutants provided with exogenous or endogenous cycloartenol produce insufficient ergosterol to support aerobic growth.If SMY10 acquired enzymatic activity to convert cyclopropyl sterols to Δ8 sterol, it could produce ergosterol and become sterol-independent. The major uncertainty with using SMY10 as a complementation host for this experiment was that 4,4-dimethyl cyclopropyl sterols such as cycloartenol are not measurably metabolized by higher plant isomerases (8.Heintz R.

For example, the bramble isomerase accepts cycloeucalenol and other 4-desmethyl sterols but has little activity on cycloartenol (9.Heintz R. Bimpson T. Benveniste P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

If cycloartenol were the only sterol accumulating in the SMY10 host, isomerase expression would not restore ergosterol prototrophy. Fortunately, yeast at least partially demethylates cycloartenol at the 4-position (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem.

We reasoned that the isomerase would accept the resulting demethyl cyclopropyl sterols and convert them to tetracyclic Δ8 sterols, which wild-type yeast enzymes would metabolize further to ergosterol (Fig.2). The likelihood of complementation would depend on whether this level of ergosterol production was sufficient to support life. Fortunately, yeast can use a variety of different compounds for bulk membrane sterol as long as a trace of ergosterol is present (37.Ramgopal M. Bloch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, yeast lanosterol synthase mutants grow well on 5 mg/liter cycloartenol but only if supplemented with 0.5 mg/liter ergosterol (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These earlier findings suggested that a yeast lanosterol synthase mutant expressing cycloartenol synthase might gain a growth advantage upon obtaining an isomerase gene, and the success of our screen confirms this prediction.Figure 2A functional ergosterol biosynthetic pathway encoded by yeast and plant genes. Wild-type yeast biosynthesizes oxidosqualene, which it cyclizes to the sterol precursor lanosterol. A yeast strain with lanosterol synthase replaced with cycloartenol synthase produces cycloartenol, which it partially metabolizes to various desmethyl cyclopropyl sterols (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G.

One yeast strain became sterol-dependent when it lost its plasmid, suggesting that the plasmid facilitated sterol biosynthesis. Yeast that coexpresses the novel protein and cycloartenol synthase synthesize significant amounts of ergosterol in vivo, and the enzyme expressed in E. coli converts cycloeucalenol to obtusifoliol in vitro. The cDNA consequently encodes cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, and we named the corresponding gene CPI1(cyclopropyl sterol isomerase).CPI1 encodes a predicted 36-kDa protein (Fig.3) with a calculated isoelectric point of 7.3.

Cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase mutants have not been described, but recent technical advances allow the isolation of A. thaliana disruption mutants (43.Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Sussman M.R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) when sequence information is available. cpi1 mutants would be useful for determining the biological function of cyclopropyl sterols. If cpi1 mutants are viable, they should have cyclopropyl membrane sterols instead of conventional tetracyclic ones. Tobacco calli selected for resistance to normally inhibitory concentrations of the isomerase inhibitor fenpropimorph contain up to 99% cyclopropyl sterols (44.Schaller H. Maillot-Vernier P. Benveniste P. Belliard G. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2547-2554Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclopropyl sterols can be effective membrane components. Because functional cyclopropyl brassinosteroids have not been described, cpi1 mutants might therefore be expected to be brassinosteroid-deficient dwarfs. No brassinosteroid biosynthetic mutants have been reported to map to the region of chromosome 5 that contains CPI1.The A. thaliana CPI1 and CAS1 genes could be useful to make transgenic plants for determining why plants use the tandem pair rather than lanosterol synthase. Plants rapidly metabolize lanosterol to sterols (45.Hewlins M.J.E. Ehrhardt J.D. Hirth L. Ourisson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), so a transgenic plant expressing lanosterol synthase in place of cycloartenol synthase and the isomerase should be able to make conventional tetracyclic membrane sterols. However, it would lack cyclopropyl sterols completely and should have a discernible phenotype if these compounds have biological roles other than as precursors to tetracyclic sterols.Comparing the CPI1 cDNA to other plant sequences revealed similar genes in corn (cDNAs with GenBankTMaccession numbers AW065429, AI967279, AI947898, and AI586678), cotton (cDNA AW187278), rice (cDNA C97202 and genomic fragmentAQ859984), and tomato (cDNAs AI773332, AI782398, AI780029 and genomic fragment AQ367965). No fungal or bacterial sequences, including the completely sequenced S. cerevisiae and E. coli genomes, show significant sequence identity to A. thaliana CPI1. Moreover, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which lacks sterol biosynthesis altogether, also lacks aCPI1 homolog.The yeast ergosterol biosynthetic pathway has been studied extensively, and all of the yeast sterol biosynthetic genes have been cloned (34.Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13794-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,35.Gachotte D. Sen S.E. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Krieger M.

Biol. 1999; 34: 33-47PubMed Google Scholar). Because fungi and plants share similar sterol biosynthetic pathways, sequence comparisons coupled with genomic sequencing efforts will soon uncover the A. thaliana and rice homologs of yeast sterol biosynthetic genes. The plant pathway requires four enzymatic activities absent in the yeast pathway that would not necessarily be accessible by homology-based approaches. cDNAs encoding three of these have already been described: cycloartenol synthase (19.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11628-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), sterol Δ7-reductase (47.Lecain E. Chenivesse X. Spagnoli R. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10866-10873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a second sterol methyltransferase (48.Bouvier-Nave P. Husselstein T. Benveniste P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CPI1 is the last of these genes that lacks an obvious homolog in yeast sterol biosynthesis. It consequently may be relatively straightforward to clone the remaining plant sterol biosynthetic genes by homology to yeast genes.Finally, the isomerase is a promising antiprotozoal drug target because parasitic amoebae such as Acanthamoeba (15.Raederstorff D. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) andNaegleria (49.Raederstorff D. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) use cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, whereas humans and other vertebrates apparently do not. The cloned and expressed isomerase should greatly facilitate mechanistic studies of these enzymes and subsequent inhibitor design. Even distantly diverged organisms generally biosynthesize shared molecules by such similar routes that bacteria and yeast have been suitable systems for deducing much of human metabolism. Sterol biosynthesis provides an exception to this trend. Eukaryotes use two distinct pathways (Fig. 1) to make structurally similar sterols (1.Ehrhardt J.D. Hirth L. Ourisson G. Phytochemistry. 1967; 6: 815-821Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Animals and fungi cyclize oxidosqualene to the tetracyclic Δ8-triterpene lanosterol (2.Corey E.J. Russey W.E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 4750-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which they metabolize further to tetracyclic membrane sterols (3.Bloch K. Steroids. 1992; 57: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4.Bloch K.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 14: 47-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 5.Nes W.R. McKean M.L. Biochemistry of Steroids and Other Isopentenoids. University Park Press, Baltimore1977: 229-270Google Scholar). Plants cyclize instead to the pentacyclic cycloartenol (6.Benveniste P. Hirth L. Ourisson G. Phytochemistry. 1966; 5: 45-58Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7.Rees H.H. Goad L.J. Goodwin T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1968; 9: 723-725Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and consequently must isomerize the cyclopropane ring to form Δ8 tetracycles en route to tetracyclic sterols. Why plants use this two-enzyme route (8.Heintz R. Benveniste P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4267-4274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than cyclizing directly to tetracyclic sterols using lanosterol synthase remains unknown. Although the enzyme has not been purified to homogeneity, cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase (also known as cycloeucalenol-obtusifoliol isomerase) activity has been observed directly in both dicots (9.Heintz R. Bimpson T. Benveniste P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and monocots (10.Hartmann-Bouillon M.A. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1037-1042Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of an isomerase has been demonstrated indirectly in diverse plants (11.Schmitt P. Benveniste P. Leroux P. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 2153-2159Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12.Bladocha M. Benveniste P. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1983; 71: 756-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Khalil I.A. Mercer E.I. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1991; 39: 404-407Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14.Cerdon C. Rahier A. Taton M. Sauvaire Y. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 423-431Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the protozoan Acanthamoeba polyphaga(15.Raederstorff D. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by identifying cyclopropyl sterols after treatment with isomerase inhibitors. In D2O, the isomerase adds a deuterium to C-19 and abstracts hydrogen from C-8 (16.Rahier, A., Benveniste, P., and Cattel, L. (1976) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 287–288Google Scholar, 17.Rahier A. Cattel L. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1187-1192Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neither ATP nor NADPH enhances activity (8.Heintz R. Benveniste P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4267-4274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acidic ring opening seems the most likely mechanism. Because the nonenzymatic acid-catalyzed isomerization (18.Shimizu N. Itoh T. Saito M. Matsumoto T. J. Org. Chem. 1984; 49: 709-712Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) requires severe conditions (10% H2SO4 in refluxing isopropyl alcohol for 24 h), it is likely that the enzyme employs a metal or an unusually acidic amino acid residue to open the ring. As a prelude to investigating its catalytic mechanism and biological function, we have cloned and heterologously expressed theArabidopsis thaliana cDNA that encodes cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCycloeucalenol cycloisomerase is a membrane protein (26.Cattel L. Anding C. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 931-935Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and although it has been partially purified from maize by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (10.Hartmann-Bouillon M.A. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1037-1042Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), purifying protein to homogeneity (a prerequisite for peptide sequence-based cloning) has not been reported. Conventional complementation approaches were impossible because hosts such as yeast and bacteria lack the isomerase, precluding the generation of mutants for complementation. We therefore metabolically engineered a yeast strain that mimicked an isomerase mutant. Yeast cyclizes oxidosqualene directly to lanosterol, a tetracyclic sterol precursor (27.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because the yeast lanosterol synthase mutant SMY8 (20.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Baker C.H. Ting A.Y. Cheng H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cannot make sterol, it requires ergosterol supplementation. SMY10 (an SMY8 derivative expressing A. thaliana cycloartenol synthase (19.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11628-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) from the integrated yeast expression vector pRS305GAL) converts biosynthetic oxidosqualene to cycloartenol. We found that SMY10 requires ergosterol, like other lanosterol synthase mutants producing endogenous cycloartenol (28.Hart E.A. Hua L. Darr L.B. Wilson W.K. Pang J. Matsuda S.P.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9887-9888Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or grown on exogenous cycloartenol (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous studies that showed low (30.Venkatramesh M. Nes W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or unmeasurable (31.Anding C. Parks L.W. Ourisson G. Eur. J.

Tobacco calli selected for resistance to normally inhibitory concentrations of the isomerase inhibitor fenpropimorph contain up to 99% cyclopropyl sterols (44.Schaller H. Maillot-Vernier P. Benveniste P. Belliard G. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2547-2554Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclopropyl sterols can be effective membrane components. Because functional cyclopropyl brassinosteroids have not been described, cpi1 mutants might therefore be expected to be brassinosteroid-deficient dwarfs. No brassinosteroid biosynthetic mutants have been reported to map to the region of chromosome 5 that contains CPI1.The A. thaliana CPI1 and CAS1 genes could be useful to make transgenic plants for determining why plants use the tandem pair rather than lanosterol synthase. Plants rapidly metabolize lanosterol to sterols (45.Hewlins M.J.E. Ehrhardt J.D. Hirth L. Ourisson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), so a transgenic plant expressing lanosterol synthase in place of cycloartenol synthase and the isomerase should be able to make conventional tetracyclic membrane sterols. However, it would lack cyclopropyl sterols completely and should have a discernible phenotype if these compounds have biological roles other than as precursors to tetracyclic sterols.Comparing the CPI1 cDNA to other plant sequences revealed similar genes in corn (cDNAs with GenBankTMaccession numbers AW065429, AI967279, AI947898, and AI586678), cotton (cDNA AW187278), rice (cDNA C97202 and genomic fragmentAQ859984), and tomato (cDNAs AI773332, AI782398, AI780029 and genomic fragment AQ367965). No fungal or bacterial sequences, including the completely sequenced S. cerevisiae and E. coli genomes, show significant sequence identity to A. thaliana CPI1. Moreover, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which lacks sterol biosynthesis altogether, also lacks aCPI1 homolog.The yeast ergosterol biosynthetic pathway has been studied extensively, and all of the yeast sterol biosynthetic genes have been cloned (34.Gachotte D.

Biol. 1999; 34: 33-47PubMed Google Scholar). Because fungi and plants share similar sterol biosynthetic pathways, sequence comparisons coupled with genomic sequencing efforts will soon uncover the A. thaliana and rice homologs of yeast sterol biosynthetic genes. The plant pathway requires four enzymatic activities absent in the yeast pathway that would not necessarily be accessible by homology-based approaches. cDNAs encoding three of these have already been described: cycloartenol synthase (19.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11628-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), sterol Δ7-reductase (47.Lecain E. Chenivesse X. Spagnoli R. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10866-10873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a second sterol methyltransferase (48.Bouvier-Nave P. Husselstein T. Benveniste P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CPI1 is the last of these genes that lacks an obvious homolog in yeast sterol biosynthesis. It consequently may be relatively straightforward to clone the remaining plant sterol biosynthetic genes by homology to yeast genes.Finally, the isomerase is a promising antiprotozoal drug target because parasitic amoebae such as Acanthamoeba (15.Raederstorff D. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) andNaegleria (49.Raederstorff D. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) use cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, whereas humans and other vertebrates apparently do not. The cloned and expressed isomerase should greatly facilitate mechanistic studies of these enzymes and subsequent inhibitor design. Cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase is a membrane protein (26.Cattel L. Anding C. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 931-935Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and although it has been partially purified from maize by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (10.Hartmann-Bouillon M.A. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1037-1042Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), purifying protein to homogeneity (a prerequisite for peptide sequence-based cloning) has not been reported. Conventional complementation approaches were impossible because hosts such as yeast and bacteria lack the isomerase, precluding the generation of mutants for complementation. We therefore metabolically engineered a yeast strain that mimicked an isomerase mutant. Yeast cyclizes oxidosqualene directly to lanosterol, a tetracyclic sterol precursor (27.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because the yeast lanosterol synthase mutant SMY8 (20.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Baker C.H. Ting A.Y. Cheng H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cannot make sterol, it requires ergosterol supplementation. SMY10 (an SMY8 derivative expressing A. thaliana cycloartenol synthase (19.Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11628-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) from the integrated yeast expression vector pRS305GAL) converts biosynthetic oxidosqualene to cycloartenol. We found that SMY10 requires ergosterol, like other lanosterol synthase mutants producing endogenous cycloartenol (28.Hart E.A. Hua L. Darr L.B. Wilson W.K. Pang J. Matsuda S.P.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9887-9888Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or grown on exogenous cycloartenol (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous studies that showed low (30.Venkatramesh M. Nes W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or unmeasurable (31.Anding C. Parks L.W. Ourisson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) isomerase activity in yeast. Clearly, yeast lanosterol synthase mutants provided with exogenous or endogenous cycloartenol produce insufficient ergosterol to support aerobic growth. If SMY10 acquired enzymatic activity to convert cyclopropyl sterols to Δ8 sterol, it could produce ergosterol and become sterol-independent. The major uncertainty with using SMY10 as a complementation host for this experiment was that 4,4-dimethyl cyclopropyl sterols such as cycloartenol are not measurably metabolized by higher plant isomerases (8.Heintz R. Benveniste P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4267-4274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Heintz R. Bimpson T. Benveniste P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 32.Rahier A. Taton M. Benveniste P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, the bramble isomerase accepts cycloeucalenol and other 4-desmethyl sterols but has little activity on cycloartenol (9.Heintz R. Bimpson T. Benveniste P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). If cycloartenol were the only sterol accumulating in the SMY10 host, isomerase expression would not restore ergosterol prototrophy. Fortunately, yeast at least partially demethylates cycloartenol at the 4-position (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33.Buttke T.M. Bloch K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The yeast demethylating enzymes Erg25, Erg26, and Erg27 (34.Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13794-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35.Gachotte D. Sen S.E. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Krieger M. Ray B.D. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that normally metabolize lanosterol apparently have sufficiently broad substrate specificity to accept its isomer cycloartenol. We reasoned that the isomerase would accept the resulting demethyl cyclopropyl sterols and convert them to tetracyclic Δ8 sterols, which wild-type yeast enzymes would metabolize further to ergosterol (Fig.2). The likelihood of complementation would depend on whether this level of ergosterol production was sufficient to support life. Fortunately, yeast can use a variety of different compounds for bulk membrane sterol as long as a trace of ergosterol is present (37.Ramgopal M. Bloch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38.Rodriguez R.J. Low C. Bottema C.D. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 837: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, yeast lanosterol synthase mutants grow well on 5 mg/liter cycloartenol but only if supplemented with 0.5 mg/liter ergosterol (29.Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Crumley F.G. Kalinowska M. Akihisa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These earlier findings suggested that a yeast lanosterol synthase mutant expressing cycloartenol synthase might gain a growth advantage upon obtaining an isomerase gene, and the success of our screen confirms this prediction. The complementation host was constructed by transforming a lanosterol synthase mutant with a plasmid expressing the A. thalianacycloartenol synthase under galactose control. The resulting strain was transformed with a yeast library (22.Minet M. Dufour M.-E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) expressing A. thalianacDNAs from a constitutive promoter, and sterol-independent strains were selected on sterol-free medium with galactose as a carbon source (to induce the cycloartenol synthase). One yeast strain became sterol-dependent when it lost its plasmid, suggesting that the plasmid facilitated sterol biosynthesis. Yeast that coexpresses the novel protein and cycloartenol synthase synthesize significant amounts of ergosterol in vivo, and the enzyme expressed in E. coli converts cycloeucalenol to obtusifoliol in vitro. The cDNA consequently encodes cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, and we named the corresponding gene CPI1(cyclopropyl sterol isomerase). CPI1 encodes a predicted 36-kDa protein (Fig.3) with a calculated isoelectric point of 7.3. Analysis with the SMART program (39.Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar) predicted four to seven transmembrane domains and a potential signal sequence, consistent with the observation that the isomerase is a membrane protein (26.Cattel L. Anding C. Benveniste P. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 931-935Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A BLAST search (40.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) of A. thaliana genomic DNA identified a 2.3-kbp sequence on P1 clone MXI22 (41.Kotani H. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Asamizu E. Kaneko T. Miyajima N. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 213-216Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) identical to CPI1 except for the presence of seven introns. Only a few of these splice sites were correctly predicted by exon identification programs, highlighting the continued importance of cDNA sequence information for transcript identification in genomic analysis. No close homologs are present inArabidopsis genomic DNA sequenced to date (84% complete as of January, 2000), suggesting that CPI1 is a single copy gene in Arabidopsis. CPI1 maps near the bottom of chromosome 5, just south of the molecular marker nga129 (42.Bell C.J. Ecker J.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase mutants have not been described, but recent technical advances allow the isolation of A. thaliana disruption mutants (43.Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Sussman M.R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) when sequence information is available. cpi1 mutants would be useful for determining the biological function of cyclopropyl sterols.

F-ATPase functions as an ATP synthase in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and oxidative bacteria (1.Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). V-ATPase functions as a proton pump in acidic organelles, in plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells (2.Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends. Biochem.

Because V-type and F-type ATPases resemble each other both structurally and functionally, it is accepted that the reaction mechanism and energy coupling mechanism of the two ATPases are similar (2.Nelson N.

Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), has now been verified as the mechanism of F-ATPase; the energy of ATP hydrolysis is converted into the physical force in the form of rotation of the γ subunit, with three ATP hydrolyses/rotation (7.Noji H.

To fully understand the transport mechanism, characterization of the ion binding reaction of the F0 portion is essential. However, in both cases, it was difficult to examine the ion binding to the F0 portion directly, because for E. coli the ion was a proton and forP. modestum the affinity was too low (K m= 0.8 mm) (16.Laubinger W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells of 25D/pCemtp18 were cultured at 37 °C in KTY medium containing 0.5m NaCl supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin. Membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purification of Na+-ATPase was performed using anion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies as described previously (21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar). Concentration of the purified sample was carried out using ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM 100 filter). The incubation mixture contained 0.1 mg of protein of membrane vesicles in 50 μl of A buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and 22NaCl (final concentration, 20 μm; 35,000 cpm/nmol). The concentration of contaminating Na+ in the mixture before addition of 20 μm22NaCl was measured using flame photometry. The mixtures including the membrane vesicles from ATCC 9790 and 25D/pCemtp18 had Na+ concentrations of 4 and 8 μm, respectively. We took into account the contaminating Na+ to estimate the total concentration of Na+ in the mixture. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature; this period was sufficient to saturate the Na+ binding sites of the membrane (data not shown). The mixture was applied to a spin column of 400 μl Dowex-50 WX4–200 (H+ form, Sigma) preloaded with K+, and the free 22Na+ was quickly separated from bound Na+ on membrane vesicles by centrifuging the spin column at 10,000 × g for 5 s at room temperature and washing the column once with 200 μl of A buffer (Dowex-50 method). The eluted fractions from the column were combined. The radioactivities in the eluted and trapped fractions were determined using a γ-scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo). The amount of specific binding of Na+ to the membrane vesicles was calculated by subtracting the amount of nonspecific binding that was measured by diluting the radioactivity in the reaction mixture with 10 mm nonradioactive NaCl. In addition to the Dowex-50 method, an ultracentrifugation method was also used (22.Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture described above was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was regarded as having only free22Na+. The measurement was repeated five times and averaged, and the standard deviation (S.D.) was calculated. The molecular mass of the Na+-ATPase is estimated as 664 kDa, when calculated from the molecular mass of each subunit and the subunit ratio (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, 1 mg of the purified enzyme corresponds to 1.5 nmol. The incubation mixture contained 0.02 mg of protein (final concentration, 0.6 μm) of the purified enzyme and 22NaCl (final concentration, 20 μm; 35,000 cpm/nmol) in 50 μl of A buffer plus 0.02% dodecyl maltoside (B buffer). The same mixture, but with various concentrations of 22NaCl, was used for determination of the Na+ concentration dependence of Na+ binding. The concentration of contaminating Na+ in the mixture before the addition of 22NaCl was found to be 2 μm by flame photometry. The contaminating Na+was taken into account to estimate the total concentration of Na+ in the mixture. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature, which was long enough to saturate the Na+binding sites of the purified enzyme. The free22Na+ was quickly separated by the Dowex-50 method using B buffer as the washing solution, and the amount of Na+ bound to the enzyme was calculated as described above. The equilibrium-dialysis method was also applied using a microequilibrium-dialysis apparatus as described previously (23.Yamato I. Rosenbusch J.P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 151: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme (final concentration, 3 μm ATPase) in 50 μl of B buffer was placed in a chamber, and 22NaCl (final concentration, 20 μm; 35,000 cpm/nmol) in 50 μl of B buffer was placed in another chamber. The concentration of contaminating Na+ in the mixture including 3 μm purified enzyme was found to be 5 μm and was taken into account to estimate the total concentration of Na+. The difference in radioactivities in the two chambers after dialysis for 3 h at 4 °C was used to calculate the specific binding to the purified sample. S.D. was calculated for five repeated experiments. Chasing experiments were started by adding 10 mmnonradioactive NaCl with or without 2 mm ATP (or ATPγS1) to the incubation mixture equilibrated with 20 μm22Na+, and free 22Na+was quickly separated by the Dowex-50 method at various time intervals. The release of 22Na+ bound to the purified enzyme was because of the exchange reaction with nonradioactive Na+; the release of 22Na+ from the enzyme was dependent on the concentration of added nonradioactive Na+ (data not shown). If the Na+ binding to Na+-ATPase is a simple binding reaction, the exchange rate constant (k exchange) should correspond to the dissociation rate constant (k off) of Na+ in the binding reaction. In this paper, we used the empirical k exchange values, because we do not know the detailed mechanism of the Na+ binding reaction. Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (24.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin used as standard. The Na+-ATPase activity was determined in the presence of 25 mm NaCl as described previously (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); the reaction was started by the addition of 2 mm ATP, sometimes after a 10-min preincubation with various reagents. Li+ of AMP-PNP (Sigma) and adenosine ATPγS (Sigma) were replaced with H+ by passing these chemicals through a 10-ml Dowex-50 WX4–200 (H+ form) column. The pH values of the H+ forms of AMP-PNP and ATPγS were adjusted to 7.5 with Tris. 22NaCl (1.36 TBq/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The Na+-ATPase activity in the membrane vesicles prepared from strain 25D/pCemtp18 was 5 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein. Specific binding of Na+to the same membrane vesicles was 0.8 ± 0.1 nmol/mg of protein when assayed in the presence of 20 μm22Na+. A similar value of Na+binding was obtained using the centrifugation method (0.8 ± 0.1 nmol/mg of protein). Because E. hirae V-ATPase is induced in response to an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration (19.Murata T. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the amount of this enzyme is limited when cultured in Na+-starved KTY medium (19.Murata T. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Na+-ATPase activity in the membrane vesicles of 9790 (wild type strain) grown in KTY medium was not detectable; the amount of Na+ binding to the membrane vesicles was 0.04 ± 0.01 nmol/mg of protein. These findings suggest that more than 93% of the amount of Na+binding to membrane vesicles from 25D/pCemtp18 was because of the Na+-ATPase. The Na+-ATPase activity of the purified enzyme was 26 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein, which represents an ∼5-fold purification from the membrane vesicles, because specific activities of the ATPase in the solubilized and membrane-embedded states were similar (data not shown). Specific binding of Na+ to the purified sample in the presence of 20 μm22Na+ was 4.0 ± 0.5 nmol/mg protein. A similar value (4.2 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein) was obtained using the equilibrium dialysis method. The specific binding of Na+ to the purified sample was about five times higher than that to the membrane vesicles, which was consistent with the purification efficiency. These findings indicate that the purified Na+-ATPase retained a Na+ binding capacity similar to that in the native state. Fig.1 shows the NaCl concentration dependence of the Na+ binding in purified Na+-ATPase. The Scatchard plot (Fig. 1, inset) of this data has an intercept on the abscissa at 6.2, indicating that about 6 mol (S.D. 6 ± 1) of Na+ bind/mole of enzyme. The slope of the Scatchard plot indicates that the dissociation constant (K d(Na+)) is 15 μm (S.D. 15 ± 5). This value is similar to the higher (20 μm) of the two K m values for Na+ of the ATPase activity (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar). Nitrate is known to inhibit V-type ATPase probably by dissociating the V1 complex of the ATPase (25.Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reagent inhibited the Na+-ATPase activity of both the purified sample and the membrane vesicles (Table I, row 2), but it did not affect the Na+ binding of the purified sample or membrane vesicles. This result is consistent with a model in which the ion binding sites reside in the membrane-embedded portions of F-ATPase (5.Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14.Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and V-ATPase (21.Murata T.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another potent inhibitor of V-type ATPase, destruxin B (27.Muroi M. Shiragami N. Takatsuki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), also had no effect on the Na+ binding, although it inhibited the ATPase activity (Table I, row 3).Table IEffect of various reagents on Na + -ATPase activity and Na + binding capacity of purified samples and membrane vesicles (25D/pCemtp18)ReagentPurified sampleMembrane vesicles (25D/pCemtp18)Relative Na+-ATPase activityRelative binding capacityRelative Na+-ATPase activityRelative binding capacity%%%%1No addition100100100100250 mm KNO32295 ± 32695 ± 930.1 mm Destruxin B1896 ± 52097 ± 640.1 mm DCCD (−25 mm NaCl)1548 ± 84080 ± 551 mm DCCD (−25 mm NaCl)214 ± 8340 ± 1061 mm DCCD (+25 mm NaCl)8990 ± 59092 ± 572 mm AMP-PNP1692 ± 72296 ± 782 mm ATPγS396 ± 7893 ± 592 mm ADP7293 ± 676100 ± 4102 mm ADP, 2 mm Pi7098 ± 47296 ± 8Na+ binding was determined by the Dowex-50 method after a 30-min incubation of the mixture with the reagents at the concentrations indicated except for DCCD. 0.1 or 1 mm DCCD was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 25 mm NaCl and was dialyzed against the respective standard reaction mixtures to remove DCCD and Na+. 100% activity corresponds to the control values for ATPase activity and binding capacity under “No addition”. Open table in a new tab Na+ binding was determined by the Dowex-50 method after a 30-min incubation of the mixture with the reagents at the concentrations indicated except for DCCD. 0.1 or 1 mm DCCD was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 25 mm NaCl and was dialyzed against the respective standard reaction mixtures to remove DCCD and Na+. 100% activity corresponds to the control values for ATPase activity and binding capacity under “No addition”. DCCD strongly inhibits F- and V-ATPases by covalently reacting with an acidic amino acid residue of the proteolipid of these ATPases (26.Arai H. Berne M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the coupling ion, Na+, prevented the inhibition by DCCD (21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar), the reactive amino acid was considered to reside at the ion binding site of the F0 or V0portion. Preincubation with the purified sample (0.6 μm) and 0.1 mm DCCD in the absence of Na+ lowered the Na+ binding capacity to about half of its normal level, whereas about 85% of the Na+-ATPase activity was inhibited (Table I, row 4). By preincubation with a large excess of DCCD (1 mm), the Na+ binding of the purified enzyme was reduced to 14 ± 8%, and the Na+-ATPase activity was reduced to 2% (Table I, row 5). In the presence of 0.1 or 1 mm DCCD, the Na+ binding of the membrane vesicles was reduced less than that of the purified enzyme (Table I, rows 4 and 5). As expected, neither the Na+ binding nor Na+-ATPase activity of the purified sample or membrane vesicles was inhibited by preincubation with 1 mm DCCD in the presence of 25 mm Na+ (Table I, row 6). This suggests that the Na+ binding sites are near the DCCD reactive sites in the V0 portion, in agreement with previous data (21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by AMP-PNP (K i = 400 μm) (Table I, row 7) and ATPγS (K i = 80 μm) (Table I, row 8). These two ATP analogs are considered to bind to the ATP binding site of F1-ATPase (29.Abrahams J. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) and probably bind to the ATP binding site of V1-ATPase. Therefore, these reagents may affect the Na+ binding properties of the enzyme. However, they did not have much effect on the Na+binding capacity (Table I, rows 7 and 8). Neither 2 mm ADP nor 2 mm ADP plus Piaffected the Na+ binding capacity (Table I, rows 9 and 10). This is consistent with a previous report that the V-ATPase reaction was not inhibited by the reaction products ADP and Pi (30.Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows the time course of release of 22Na+ bound to the purified enzyme following the addition of a large excess of nonradioactive NaCl. Semilogarithmic plots of the data appear to show three release phases and exchange rate constants (k exchange): a fast component (about 60% of the total amount of bound Na+;k exchange > 1.7 min−1), a slow component (about 30% of the total; k exchange = 0.16 min−1), and the slowest component (about 10% of the total; k exchange = 0.05 min−1) (Fig. 2 B). The observed fast exchange rate suggests that about 60% of the bound Na+ is freely exchangeable with Na+ in the solution. When 10 mm LiCl instead of NaCl solution was used in a chasing experiment, a similar time course of 22Na+ release and similark exchange values were obtained. However, when K+ or Rb+ was used instead of Na+, essentially no release was observed (data not shown). The cation specificity of chasing was the same as that of stimulation of the transport reaction (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding of Na+ is related to the transport reaction. When the exchange reaction was assayed with 10 mmnonradioactive NaCl solution containing 2 mm ATP, the slow component (k exchange = 0.16 min−1) disappeared and most of the bound Na+ quickly exchanged (k exchange > 4.8 min−1). Because ions were being translocated in the presence of ATP, the bound Na+ involved in the enzyme reaction of Na+-ATPase should be easily exchanged with nonradioactive Na+ in the solution. Even under these conditions, the slowest component (k exchange = 0.05 min−1) was still present (Fig. 2, C andD), indicating that this slowest component was not related to the enzyme reaction of Na+-ATPase. ATPγS inhibited the ATPase activity but not the Na+binding capacity of the enzyme (Table I, row 8). Interestingly, when 2 mm ATPγS was used in place of ATP in the chasing experiment, most of the bound Na+ quickly exchanged (k exchange > 4.7 min−1), although the slowest component (k exchange = 0.05 min−1) remained, as it did in the case when ATP was added (data not shown). This suggests that the conformational change brought about by binding of ATPγS at the ATP binding site in the V1 portion affects the ion binding properties of the V0 portion, resulting in the disappearance of the slow component (k exchange = 0.16 min−1) of the exchange rates. The exchange rate constant (k exchange) of Na+ bound to DCCD-treated Na+-ATPase was 0.05 min−1 (Fig. 2, E and F), corresponding to that of the slowest component, which was not related to the enzyme reaction of the Na+-ATPase. This suggests that all the Na+ binding sites of the purified enzyme that are involved in Na+ transport reaction react with DCCD. In this study, the 22Na+ binding of a V-type Na+-ATPase (that of E. hirae) was measured. This is the first direct demonstration of cation binding in the studies of V- and F-ATPases. Several of the properties of the Na+ binding of this enzyme are similar to those that previously reported for the enzyme's ATPase activity and transport activity (20.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21.Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 272: 24885-24890Google Scholar). These include the cation specificity, the affinity for Na+, and the reactivity to DCCD. Therefore we concluded that the Na+ binding we measured in this study is involved in the transport reaction of the Na+-ATPase. The number of bound Na+/ATPase was estimated as 6 ± 1. With the addition of 10 mm nonradioactive NaCl, about two-thirds of the bound Na+ was released quickly, and the remainder was released more slowly (Figs. 1 and 2). In the rotating model of F-type ATPase, the F0 portion is thought to contain 12 proteolipid 8-kDa subunits, called the c subunits, that form a rotor ring (31.Singh S. Turina P. Bustamante C. Keller D.J. Capaldi R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and each is postulated to have one H+ binding site (32.Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proteolipid (NtpK) ofE. hirae V-type ATPase is about 16 kDa and is considered to have one cation binding site (Glu-139). The Na+ transport activity disappeared in the strain with the E139N mutation, which was induced by site-directed mutagenesis (33.Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, the number of Na+ binding sites was found to be 6 ± 1. This suggests that the V0 portion of the Na+-ATPase contains six proteolipid (NtpK) subunits. Consistent with this estimate, the number of H+-conducting proteolipid subunits is thought to be six/V-ATPase (26.Arai H. Berne M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Pali T. Finbow M.E. Holzenburg A. Findlay J.B.C. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9211-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reason that 0.1 mm DCCD in the absence of Na+ strongly inhibited the ATPase activity of the purified enzyme but had only a moderate effect on Na+ binding capacity (Table I, row 4) is unclear. This discrepancy may be because the ATPase activity is inhibited by only a single DCCD molecule. This has been shown to be the case with an F-ATPase (28.Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so it seems likely that it also occurs with the V-ATPase. Because the other subunits in the Na+-ATPase that are not modified by DCCD should retain a Na+ binding capability, the reduction of binding would be expected to be intermediate. Our finding that about two-thirds of the bound Na+ was released quickly (fast component) and the remainder was released more slowly (slow component) (Fig. 2) suggested that about two-thirds of the Na+ binding sites of the Na+-ATPase are readily accessible from the aqueous phase. The slow component disappeared in the presence of ATP or ATPγS, suggesting that all or most Na+ binding sites of the enzyme are freely accessible from the aqueous phase under these conditions. In addition, the binding of an ATP analog (ATPγS) affected the existence of the slow component of release of the bound Na+. We believe that this indicates that the slow component must be involved in the transport reaction. The present findings concerning the Na+ binding reaction of the V-type Na+-ATPase in E. hirae should be useful in understanding the mechanisms of cation transport through membrane-embedded portions of V- and F-ATPases."

Here we report that a substrate-trapping mutant of the RPTPα membrane proximal catalytic domain (D1), RPTPα-D1-C433S, specifically bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from pervanadate-treated cells. The membrane distal catalytic domain of RPTPα (D2) and mutants thereof did not bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.

This protein was identified as p130 cas. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas from fibronectin-stimulated NIH3T3 cells bound to RPTPα-D1-C433S as well, suggesting that p130 cas is a physiological substrate of RPTPα.

The PTP family can be subdivided based on structural differences into receptor-like (RPTP) and cytosolic proteins (9.Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). RPTPs, with CD45 as the founding member (10.Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7182-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), consist of an extracellular domain, a single membrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Most RPTPs contain two tandemly repeated PTP domains in their cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, for all RPTPs with two PTP domains, the majority of the catalytic activity resides within the membrane proximal PTP domain (D1), whereas the membrane distal domain, D2, displays little or no catalytic activity. Inactivation of RPTPα-D1 or CD45-D1 is sufficient to abolish their biological activities, indicating that PTP activity in D1, but not D2, is essential for the function of RPTPs (11.den Hertog J.

To identify substrates of PTPs, “substrate trapping” mutants have been designed. For instance, mutation of the catalytic site Cys to Ala in YopH, aYersinia PTP, resulted in a mutant that bound substrates but was no longer able to dephosphorylate them, making this an excellent tool for identifying potential substrates (16.Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since then, other mutants have been found to bind substrates. For instance, mutation of the highly conserved Asp residue from the “WpD” loop that functions as a general acid to facilitate cleavage of the scissile P–O bond in the substrate generated an efficient substrate-trapping mutant. In fact, for PTP-PEST and PTP1B, these Asp mutants were shown to be even more efficient substrate-trapping mutants than the catalytic site Cys mutants (17.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K.

RPTPα is a transmembrane PTP with a short heavily glycosylated extracellular domain and two cytoplasmic PTP domains. Several potential physiological substrates of RPTPα have been identified. Expression of RPTPα was shown to interfere with insulin receptor (IR) signaling (26.Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Other reports have shown that RPTPα interferes with insulin-induced prolactin gene expression and GLUT4 translocation to the membrane (27.Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Lin C.H. Sap J. Quon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28.Jacob K.K. Sap J. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4800-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether direct dephosphorylation of the IR by RPTPα mediates the effects on the IR-signaling pathway remains to be determined definitively. RPTPα associates with the Kv1.2 potassium channel in response to activation of the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation regulates a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the Kv1.2 potassium channel, thereby suppressing the current generated by this channel. RPTPα recruitment to the Kv1.2 channel reverses the tyrosine kinase-induced phosphorylation and suppression of Kv1.2, suggesting that the Kv1.2 potassium channel may be a direct substrate of RPTPα in cells (29.Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Cachero T.G. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PTK Src is the most clearly defined target of RPTPα (11.den Hertog J. Pals C.E.

Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Murine Src is phosphorylated on Tyr529. The crystal structure of Src and Src family members demonstrated that the SH2 domain of Src binds to phosphorylated Tyr529, thereby blocking the catalytic site of the kinase (Ref. 33.Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar and references therein). Recently, a phosphotyrosine displacement mechanism was proposed to underlie RPTPα-mediated dephosphorylation of Src Tyr(P)529 (34.Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The C-terminal RPTPα Tyr(P)789 binds the Src SH2 domain, thereby displacing intramolecular Src SH2-Tyr(P)529 binding and allowing dephosphorylation and thus activation of Src. This model is consistent with the finding that RPTPα associates with Src family members independently of RPTPα activity (35.Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36.Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31890-31900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RPTPα knock-out mice show an increase in Src Tyr529 phosphorylation and a decrease in Src activity, providing strong support for the finding that Src is an in vivo substrate of RPTPα (31.Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32.Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Similarly, targeted disruption of RPTPα showed a decrease in activity of the Src family member Fyn (31.Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32.Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr.

Here, we report that a substrate-trapping mutant of RPTPα specifically bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas from pervanadate-treated and fibronectin-stimulated cells. The interaction with RPTPα depended on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p130 cas. Furthermore, RPTPα dephosphorylated p130 cas in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the subcellular localization of p130 cas and RPTPα by (immuno)fluorescence demonstrated that some, but not all, p130 cas co-localized with RPTPα at the plasma membrane. Our results demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas is a substrate of RPTPα. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and FaO cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 (DF) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. P19 EC, COS-7, and F9 cells were cultured in DF supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum. Pervanadate treatment of the cells was done for 30 min by addition of 1 mm orthovanadate and 1 mmH2O2, generating pervanadate, directly into the medium of nearly confluent cells. Fibronectin stimulation was done essentially as described (37.Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were removed from the dish gently using EDTA, allowed to recover in medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine calf serum for 30 min, and replated onto dishes that had been coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml, overnight, 4 °C). The cells were harvested after 30 min. Transient and stable transfection of SK-N-MC and P19 EC cells was done using calcium phosphate precipitation, exactly as described (11.den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression vector for activated murine Src, SrcY529F, an expression vector for GST-p130 cas, and an expression vector for human EGFR have been described (38.den Hertog J. de Laat S.W. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar, 39.den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T.

Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). SV40-driven expression vectors for expression of RPTPα or mutants have also been described (39.den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A hemagglutinin epitope tag was cloned to the N-terminal side of Asn20 in RPTPα (41.den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done on pSG-RPTPα or on pSG-HA-RPTPα. Mutations were verified by sequencing. The oligonucleotides that were used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: RPTPα-D401A, 5′-AGCTGGCCAGCCTTTGGGGTG; RPTPα-C433S, 5′-ACCTGCACTGGAGTGGACCAC; RPTPα-R438K, 5′-GCAGGTGTAGGGAAAACTGGCACCTTTG; RPTPα-C723S, 5′-CCCGGCACTGGAGTGGTGCACAGT; and RPTPα-R729K, 5′-GGGGCAGGAAAGACAGGAACC. The RPTPα-YFP fusion protein was generated by introduction of aBglII site at position 516 in RPTPα by site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, a polymerase chain reaction-generatedBglII fragment encoding yellow fluorescent protein (the kind gift of Roger Y. Tsien) was inserted in RPTPα at position 516, thus replacing RPTPα-D2. Expression vectors for bacterial expression of RPTPα glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were made as described (42.Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), using pGEX-KG (43.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors for GST-RPTPα-D1 contained residues 167–503, GST-RPTPα-D2 contained residues 504–793, and full-length bacterial RPTPα contained residues 167–793 (numbering according to Sap et al. (44.Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). The expression vector for bacterial expression of zebrafish PTP1B-C213S containing residues 1–282, corresponding to residues 1–284 in human PTP1B, was made as described by van der Sar et al. (45.van der Sar A.M. de Fockert J. Betist M. Zivkovic D. den Hertog J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 785-794PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were purified essentially as described (43.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were not cleaved off the beads but were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm PMSF. The fusion proteins were dialyzed against TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and rebound to glutathione-agarose beads. This elution and rebinding to glutathione-agarose beads greatly reduced contamination with bacterial proteins. For GST pull-down experiments, cell lysates were made as described (18.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mmiodoacetic acid, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF), and all other cells were lysed in lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF), incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and 10 mm dithiothreitol added to inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid. The lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 unist/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF), resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and the samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For immunoprecipitations, nearly confluent cells were lysed in CLB (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitation of HA-RPTPα was done by incubation with anti-hemagglutinin epitope tag antibody (mAb 12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The EGFR was immunoprecipitated using mAb 108.1 (46.Bellot F. Moolenaar W. Kris R. Mirakhur B. Verlaan I. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Felder S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GST-p130 cas was precipitated by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF), resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and the samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblotting analysis the material on the polyacrylamide gels was transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry blotting for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2 gel in transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 40 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol). Following transfer, the blots were incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 22 °C and in blocking buffer containing anti-Tyr(P) antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1.5 h at 22 °C. For immunoblotting with anti-p130 cas (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), with 12CA5, or affinity-purified anti-RPTPα antiserum 5478, blocking buffer contained 5% non-fat milk instead of bovine serum albumin. The filters were washed four times in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in TBS-T. The filters were washed four times in TBS-T and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection was performed. Before reprobing with different primary antibodies, the blots were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 45 min at 70 °C. For in vitrodephosphorylation assays, SK-N-MC cells were transiently transfected with GST-p130 cas together with SrcY529F. GST-p130 cas was precipitated from these cells with glutathione-agarose beads; the beads were washed 3 times in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μm PMSF) and two times in succinate buffer (50 mm succinate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were incubated with full-length GST-RPTPα in succinate buffer for different times at 30 °C, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and the samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells were seeded on glass coverslips, and at the appropriate time the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 s. After washing the coverslips were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Incubation of the coverslips with anti-neurofilament or anti-p130 cas antibodies and CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies was done exactly as described previously (38.den Hertog J. de Laat S.W. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we set out to identify substrates of RPTPα. Specific substrates of several non-receptor PTPs have been identified successfully in the past using substrate-trapping mutants (17.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We used a similar substrate trapping approach to identify physiological substrates of RPTPα. P19 EC cells were treated with pervanadate, which induced a strong increase in Tyr(P) content of many proteins (Fig. 1 A, left two lanes). Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal catalytic domain of RPTPα (D1 or D2, respectively) or mutants thereof were purified and incubated with lysates from pervanadate-treated P19 EC cells. Proteins from the lysate that associated with the fusion proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20) (Fig. 1). A major Tyr(P)-containing protein of approximately 130 kDa (p130) bound specifically to GST-RPTPα-D1 with the catalytic site Cys mutated to Ser (D1-C433S). p130 is the most prominent phosphotyrosyl protein in the lysate from pervanadate-treated P19 EC cells. Nevertheless, it is clear that RPTPα-C433S bound preferentially to p130 (Fig.1 A, and not shown overexposures of the blot in Fig.1 A). No tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected to bind to wild type GST-RPTPα-D1 or GST alone (Fig. 1 A). Substrate-trapping mutants of PTP1B and PTP-PEST in which the general base/general acid Asp was mutated to Ala were shown to be even more efficient substrate-trapping mutants than the catalytic site Cys mutants (17.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 18.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). RPTPα-D1 with the corresponding Asp to Ala mutation, GST-D1-D401A, did not bind any Tyr(P)-containing proteins from the lysate (Fig. 1 A). This suggests that there are differences in substrate binding between the Asp mutants in PTP1B or PTP-PEST and RPTPα-D1. It has been shown for PTP1B that mutation of the invariant Arg in the signature motif, Arg221 in PTP1B, almost completely abolished catalytic activity (17.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Similarly, GST-RPTPα-D1 with the corresponding mutation, D1-R438K, had no detectable PTP activity in in vitro PTP assays toward any of the substrates tested (data not shown). No tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected to bind to GST-D1-R438K (Fig. 1 A). Since p130 bound specifically to GST-D1-C433S and not to D1-D401A or D1-R438K, we conclude that p130 is not merely a RPTPα-binding protein but a bona fide substrate. Similar to the experiments with RPTPα-D1, substrate trapping experiments were performed with RPTPα-D2 and mutants thereof. No Tyr(P)-containing proteins bound to wild type D2 nor to GST-D2-C723S nor to any other D2 mutant (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, substrate-trapping mutants of RPTPα-D2 did not bind Tyr(P)-containing proteins. The apparent molecular weight of the protein that bound to RPTPα-D1-C433S prompted us to test whether this protein was p130 cas. The blot depicted in Fig. 1 A was stripped and reprobed with anti-p130 cas antibody (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). The substrate-trapping mutant GST-D1-RPTPα-C433S bound to a single protein detected by the anti-p130 cas antibody. This protein co-migrated exactly with p130 cas in lysates from pervanadate-treated cells. p130 cas in lysates from untreated cells migrated faster in the gel than p130 cas in lysates from pervanadate-treated cells (Fig. 1 A, 1st two lanes, bottom panel), consistent with reports that phosphorylation of p130 cas induced a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE gels (48.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). p130 cas did not bind to wild type RPTPα-D1, D1-D401A, D1-R438K, or GST alone, demonstrating that p130 cas binding is specific for the D1-C433S substrate-trapping mutant. p130 cas did not bind to GST-D2 or any of its mutants either. In conclusion, p130 from pervanadate-treated P19 EC cells that bound to GST-D1-C433S is p130 cas, and p130 cas bound specifically to the substrate-trapping mutant RPTPα-D1-C433S. Aliquots of the remaining P19 EC cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Tyr(P) antibody PY20 following the pull-down procedure, using the different GST fusion proteins (Fig.1"

AG is thought to be of potential use in diseases, such as diabetes, where pathological overproduction of NO is implicated. We show here that during the inactivation of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) by AG that the prosthetic heme is altered, in part, to dissociable and protein-bound adducts. The protein-bound heme adduct is the result of cross-linking of the heme to residues in the oxygenase domain of nNOS. The dissociable heme product is unstable and reverts back to heme upon isolation. The alteration of the heme is concomitant with the loss in the ability to form the ferrous-CO complex of nNOS and accounts for at least two-thirds of the activity loss. Studies with [14C]AG indicate that alteration of the protein, in part on the reductase domain of nNOS, also occurs but at low levels. Thus, heme alteration appears to be the major cause of nNOS inactivation.

NOSs are bidomain in structure with an oxygenase domain, which contains the cysteine residue that is coordinated to the prosthetic heme as well as the tetrahydrobiopterin binding site, and a reductase domain, which contains the binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH (5.Roman L.J.

For the neuronal and endothelial isoforms, the activity of the enzyme is regulated by calcium and calmodulin, which binds to a site between the oxygenase and reductase domains. In the case of the macrophage or inducible NOS (iNOS), the calmodulin is bound very tightly and is not regulated by physiological levels of calcium (6.Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The isoform-selective inhibition of NOS has been of intense interest because of the various physiological and pathological actions of nitric oxide caused by the three isoforms (for reviews see Refs. 7.Moncada S.

Our laboratory has focused on the inhibition of neuronal NOS (nNOS) by guanidine drugs (12.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). Aminoguanidine (AG) is structurally one of the simplest of these drugs containing a guanidino moiety and a hydrazine group. AG is thought to be of potential use in diabetes (11.Southan G.J. Szabo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 13.Holstad M. Jansson L. Sandler S. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and it was first reported by Corbett et al. (14.Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. Chang K. Hasan K.S. Ido Y. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr, J.R. Williamson J.R. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 552-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit iNOS in a selective manner. The selectivity for iNOS has been confirmed in various models (11.Southan G.J. Szabo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 15.Scott J.A. McCormack D.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 86: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although in some studies the selectivity appears to be limited (16.Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 334: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17.Laszlo F. Evans S.M. Whittle B.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 272: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that AG is an isoform-selective mechanism-based inactivator of iNOS in vitro, although the constitutive NOS in GH3 pituitary cells and that in endothelial cells could also be inactivated (18.Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Diaminoguanidine, which is structurally related to AG, is also a mechanism-based inactivator of all three isoforms of NOS, although it exhibits less selectivity for iNOS (19.Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which AG causes the inactivation of NOS is not known. In studies with the use of [14C]AG, it has been shown that inactivation of iNOS causes radiolabel to be associated in part with iNOS protein (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the same study, the fluorescence caused by the heme was not altered by AG treatment of iNOS, indicating that the prosthetic heme was not destroyed. HPLC analysis of iNOS treated with [14C]AG showed radiolabel associated with a peak that eluted with “near identity” to heme, and the authors suggest that this was an altered heme product, but this product was not further characterized (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is not clear how much of the prosthetic heme is altered in relation to iNOS inactivation from these studies. More recently, similar to the findings on iNOS, the inactivation of nNOS by AG has been found to occur without changes in the heme fluorescence and to lead to irreversible binding of [14C]AG to the protein (21.Bryk R. Lubeskie A. Wolff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that AG can alter the heme or protein of NOS, but the role for either of these processes in the inactivation has not been demonstrated In the current study, we have sought to define the mechanism by which AG inactivates recombinant nNOS. We demonstrated that AG causes the alteration of the prosthetic heme in part to a dissociable adduct as well as to a protein-bound adduct, which was primarily the result of heme binding irreversibly to a site(s) on the oxygenase domain. The alteration of the heme was concomitant to the loss in the ability to form the ferrous-CO complex and appears to be the major cause for the loss of enzyme activity. Inactivation of nNOS with [14C]AG gave radiolabel associated with the dissociable heme product as well as radiolabel irreversibly bound to the protein primarily at a site(s) on the reductase domain of nNOS. These studies further our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the inactivation of nNOS and may aid in predicting the action of NOS inhibitors in vivo. The affinity-purified rabbit IgG against brain NOS used for immunoblotting nNOS was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Aminoguanidine, trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, bovine pancreas), trypsin inhibitor (Type 1S, soybean), glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, myoglobin (horse heart), cytochrome c (Type III, horse heart), NADP+, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma.14C-Labeled aminoguanidine (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). (6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) was purchased from Dr. Schirck's Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence reagent were from Pierce. nNOS was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells as described previously (22.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M.

Oxyhemoglobin (25 μm) was added as a source of heme during expression. Cells were harvested and suspended in 1 volume of 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, containing 320 mm sucrose, 100 μm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μmpepstatin A, 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, 3 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, and the suspended cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization. Lysates from infected Sf9 cells (8 × 109) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 2′5′-ADP Sepharose column (8 ml), and the nNOS was affinity purified as described (5.Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), except that 10 mm 2′-AMP in high salt buffer was used to elute the protein. The nNOS-containing fraction was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μmtetrahydrobiopterin with the use of a ProDicon and a 100-kDa cut-off membrane. The concentrated sample was stored at −80 °C. nNOS (0.5 μm) was added to a “first reaction mixture” of 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 100 unit/ml superoxide dismutase, 25 unit/ml catalase, 40 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, and AG at various concentrations in a total volume of 150 μl at room temperature. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixture were transferred to an “oxyhemoglobin assay mixture” containing 200 μm CaCl2, 100 μm NADPH, 100 μm l-arginine, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 16 μm oxyhemoglobin in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the rate of NO-mediated oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at λ401–411 nm with a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA) as described previously (23.Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Where indicated, the concentration of nNOS in the first reaction mixture was changed, and the amount of calmodulin was proportionally increased. The first reaction mixtures were added to an equal volume of sample buffer containing 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and boiled for 2 min. For studies where the chemiluminescence of the heme was measured, 100 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine replaced dithiothreitol in the sample buffer, and the samples were treated at 50 °C for 10 min instead of boiling (24.Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 7% SDS polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 cm), using the discontinuous buffer system described by Laemmli (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). The protein-bound heme was detected with the use of enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) as described previously (24.Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The radioisotope bound to proteins on dried gels was detected with the use of a PhosphorImager (model 445 SI, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). nNOS (3 μm) was treated with AG in the first reaction mixture. An aliquot (150 μl) of the reaction mixture was added to 75 μl of a 0.1 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, solution containing 20 mm EGTA and trypsin (2000 milliunits/ml). After incubation at room temperature, an equal volume of gel sample buffer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml) was added. An aliquot (40 μl) was analyzed with the use of SDS-PAGE as described above. HPLC was performed with the use of a Waters 600S controller, 717 plus autosampler, and 996 photodiode array detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). First reaction mixtures were injected onto an HPLC column (C18 Vydac 5 μm, 0.21 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 65% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 35% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. After 15 min, a linear gradient was run to 100% solvent B over 10 min. Absorbance at 220 and 400 nm was monitored. Myoglobin was used as a standard. In studies with radioactive AG, an on-line radiochemical detector (Radiomatic 500TR, Packard, Downers Grove, IL) was used to detect the radiolabeled products. The ferrous-carbonyl complex was determined from the CO difference spectrum of the dithionite-reduced protein with the use of an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 (3.McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 26.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference spectrum was measured with the use of an Aminco-DW2 spectrophotometer modified with the OLIS-DW2 operating system. Aliquots (5 μl) of the first reaction mixture were added to a mixture containing 0.2 mmNADPH, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 40 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 units/ml catalase, 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 500 μm cytochrome c in a total volume of 195 μl of 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and incubated at 30 °C. The NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c was monitored over time at 550 nm with a SpectraMax Plus microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). An extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1cm−1 was used along with a correction for the pathlength as described by Molecular Devices. The initial rate was determined from the linear portion of the time-dependent change in absorbance. As shown in Fig. 1 A, AG caused a concentration- and time- dependent loss of nNOS activity. This inhibition process was saturable and could be described by an apparent dissociation constant for the initial reversible AG-enzyme complex (K i) and an inactivation constant (k inact) of 54.6 μm and 0.046 min−1, respectively (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 C, the inactivation caused by 50 μm AG (closed squares) was slowed in the presence of 50 μm l- arginine (open triangles) but not 50 μm d-arginine (closed triangles), indicating an active site-directed event. The inactivation caused by AG was dependent on the presence of calmodulin (Fig. 1 D, compare closed square with closed diamond), which is necessary for nNOS activity, and indicates a metabolism-dependent inhibition process. The kinetics described here are consistent with a suicide mechanism whereby a substrate is metabolized to a reactive intermediate that covalently alters nNOS and inactivates the enzyme (27.Abeles R.H. Chem. Eng. News. 1983; 61: 48-56Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings are also consistent with that established for the AG-mediated inactivation of the constitutive NOS found in GH3 pituitary cells, except that the reported K i andk inact are 830 μm and 0.25 min−1, respectively (18.Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The reason for the greater than 10-fold difference in the K i is not known, although IC50 values of 41 μm have been reported for the AG-mediated inhibition of nNOS found in GH3 pituitary cells (28.Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Gauld D.S. Neulander M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 350: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows the HPLC profile of nNOS treated with AG in the absence of calmodulin. The major fraction with absorption at 220 nm corresponds to heme-depleted apo-nNOS (NOS) and the major fraction with absorption at 400 nm corresponds to native heme (Heme), which dissociates from the protein under the acidic conditions of the chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2 B, treatment of nNOS with AG in the presence of calmodulin gave a loss in the peak area for native heme and the appearance of two new peaks with absorption at 400 nm (peak I and peak II). The profile at 220 nm showed the nNOS peak as well as three additional peaks, which are from the calmodulin preparation. As will be described in more detail below, peak I corresponds to a dissociable heme adduct, whereas peak II, which co-eluted with apo-nNOS, corresponds to an altered heme product irreversibly bound to the protein. The potential differences in absorptivity of the products precludes accurate quantitation by HPLC. As shown in Fig.3, the loss of heme observed on the HPLC profile at 400 nm was quantified and compared with the loss of nNOS activity. The loss of heme and activity occurred only when AG was incubated with nNOS in the presence of calmodulin (Fig. 3, compareAG with AG-CAM). Moreover, l-arginine could protect from the heme loss as well as from inactivation by AG (AG + ARG). Thus, like the activity loss observed above, the heme loss was dependent on calmodulin and attenuated by the natural substrate. As shown in Fig.4 A, the loss in heme and nNOS activity were both time-dependent. During the first 10 min, the amount of the heme that was altered appeared to approximate the enzyme inactivation, whereas after 15 min of incubation there was greater activity loss without much change in the amount of heme. The time course for the formation of the products corresponding to peak I (×) and peak II (▪) are shown in Fig. 4 B. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the differences in the extent of the loss of heme (HM) and activity (Act) at 15 min were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Thus, at short incubation times the heme loss accounted for nearly all of the activity loss, whereas at longer incubation times the extent of heme loss accounted for approximately two-thirds of the activity loss. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the cytochrome c reductase activity (R) was only slightly decreased, again supporting the notion that heme loss is the major cause of inactivation. We have determined that the loss of heme was concomitant to a loss in the ability of nNOS to form the ferrous-CO complex (Fig. 5 B, compare HM withFe-CO), a confirmation that heme loss results in dysfunctional enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the loss in P-450 did not result in the formation of substantial amounts of P-420.Figure 4Time dependence of the AG-mediated heme alteration.

Aliquots (20 μl) were taken at the same time for measurement of NOS activity (●).

The ferrous-CO complex, heme, cytochrome c reductase activity, and NOS activity were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A indicates the absorbance spectra of the dithionite-reduced ferrous-CO complex of untreated (solid line) and AG-treated (dashed line) nNOS.B indicates the residual nNOS activity (Act), heme (HM), ferrous-CO complex (Fe-CO), and cytochrome c reductase activity (R) as a percentage of the corresponding values obtained for the untreated sample. Data are the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown above, the alteration of the heme resulted, in part, in the formation of a dissociable heme product corresponding to peak I, which can be detected by its absorbance at 400 nm (Fig.6 C). In studies with the use of 150 μm [14C]AG, the inactivation of nNOS led to the association of radiolabel to peak I as well as to fractions containing nNOS protein (Fig. 6 B). The radiolabel was not detected in these fractions when calmodulin is absent during the treatment of nNOS (Fig. 6 A). Based on the amount of radioactivity associated with peak I, there was approximately 0.05 mol of radiolabeled product/mol of nNOS monomer. Similarly, there was 0.10 mol of radiolabel product/mol of nNOS found in the protein containing fraction. The stoichiometry of labeling on peak I and the protein was increased to 0.1 and 0.6 mol/mol of nNOS monomer, respectively, when nNOS was treated with 500 μm AG for 20 min (data not shown). The spectra of fractions that correspond to heme, peak I, and peak II were determined by on-line diode array analysis (Fig.7). All three samples were found to have the characteristic Soret absorbance of porphyrin compounds. The Soret of peak I was found to be red-shifted to 405 nm in comparison to that found for heme at 398 nm, whereas the Soret for peak II appeared to be similar to heme. We isolated the compound corresponding to peak I for subsequent mass spectral analysis but found the product to be unstable after isolation. Analysis of the isolated sample corresponding to peak I on the HPLC resulted in detection of native heme as determined by retention time and diode array analysis. This was also confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Thus, although the compound corresponding to peak I was stable in the reaction mixture, after isolation the compound reverted back to native heme. As shown in Fig.8, a peak that corresponds by retention time to peak I found in HPLC profiles of AG-treated nNOS was also found in reaction mixtures of nNOS treated with diaminoguanidine, which differs from AG by the addition of an amino group. The Soret for peak I detected in the reaction mixture with diaminoguanidine was also red-shifted to 405 nm (Fig. 8, inset).Figure 8HPLC profile of diaminoguanidine-treated nNOS. nNOS (1.3 μm) was incubated with 100 μm diaminoguanidine in the first reaction mixture for 60 min, and an aliquot (50 μl) was analyzed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HPLC profile at 400 nm for diaminoguanidine-treated nNOS (dashed line) and AG-treated nNOS (solid line).

This was further verified by a recently developed method for specific detection of protein-bound heme adducts after SDS-PAGE by enhanced chemiluminescence (24.Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The specificity for protein-bound heme is based on the ability of SDS-PAGE to separate heme that is irreversibly bound to protein from native heme that is dissociated from the protein and runs at the dye front (24.Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.9 A, nNOS that was treated with AG in the presence of calmodulin (lane 1) gave an intense chemiluminescence signal at a mass of approximately 160 kDa, which corresponds to the monomer of nNOS. The sample treated with AG but without calmodulin (lane 2) gave a very faint chemiluminescence signal. This is consistent with the absence of peak II in the HPLC profile of this sample. There was an increase in the chemiluminescence signal after treatment of nNOS with calmodulin alone (lane 3), indicating that autoinactivation can also give rise to the formation of protein-bound heme adducts, although clearly AG enhanced the formation of these adducts over this control level. To further define the site of adduct formation of heme with nNOS, we utilized limited tryptic digestion of nNOS. Salerno et al.(29.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) have shown that limited trypsinolysis of nNOS gives rise to a 77-kDa fragment, which represents the carboxyl-terminal reductase domain, and a 85-kDa fragment, which represents the amino-terminal oxygenase domain. As shown in Fig. 9 B, the limited tryptic digestion of AG-treated nNOS gave two major peptide bands at 77 and 85 kDa after a 10-min treatment with trypsin (compare lane 2with lane 1). The chemiluminescence signal caused by nNOS (lane 1) was predominantly associated with a band corresponding to the 85-kDa tryptic fragment after digestion (lane 2). Thus, the irreversibly bound heme was associated with the oxygenase domain. The identity of tryptic fragments giving rise to the faint chemiluminescence signals was not addressed. Further mapping studies were not successful because of the instability of the heme peptide. As shown above, HPLC analysis of nNOS treated with 150 μm [14C]AG for 20 min revealed that radioisotope was associated with the nNOS protein containing fractions with a stoichiometry of 0.1 mol of 14C-labeled compound/mol of nNOS. That nNOS was specifically labeled was further verified by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.10 A). As shown in Fig.10 A, the radiolabeling was greatly enhanced in the reaction mixture containing calmodulin (compare lanes 1 and2). There were greater amounts of radioisotope found on nNOS after treatment for 60 min, although there was an increase in the control samples as well (compare lanes 3 and 4). In that there is no greater activity loss because of AG from 20 to 60 min under these conditions, the increase in radioisotope associated with nNOS over this period must not be related to the inactivation process. Thus, we further characterized the binding of radiolabel to nNOS after a 20-min treatment with [14C]AG. As shown in Fig. 10 B, the [14C]AG-inactivated nNOS was treated with trypsin for 10 min to give two major Coomassie-stained peptide fragments at 85 and 77 kDa (left panel, comparelanes 1 and 2). The most intense radioactive band was at 77 kDa, which corresponds to a peptide in the reductase domain (right panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Smaller amounts of radioactivity were found in the 85-kDa band, which corresponds to the oxygenase domain, as well as a diffuse band of lower molecular mass that was more pronounced after a 30-min trypsin hydrolysis (lane 3). We have determined that the mechanism of inactivation of nNOS by AG was due in large part to the alteration of the prosthetic heme moiety. This loss of the heme could account for at least two-thirds of the activity loss and perhaps even more during the initial phases of the inactivation reaction. The AG-mediated alteration of heme was time- and metabolism-dependent and attenuated by the presence of the natural substrate, l-arginine. These findings were highly similar to that found for the loss in enzyme activity. The loss in heme gave a concomitant loss in the ability to form the ferrous-CO complex, indicating that the altered heme products were unable to function as P-450 catalysts, again confirming that heme loss was responsible for the activity loss. The loss of heme or ferrous carbonyl complex has been shown to occur during the suicide inactivation byN 5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (NIO) (30.Fast W. Nikolic D. Van Breemen R.B. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 903-916Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), N G-methyl-l-arginine (NMA) (31.Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and vinyl-NIO (32.Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8882-8889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).l-N 6-(1-Iminoethyl)lysine was found in one study to cause the loss of heme (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas another did not (33.Grant S.K. Green B.G. Stiffey-Wilusz J. Durette P.L. Shah S.K. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4174-4180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only in the case of NIO has the altered heme product been found (30.Fast W. Nikolic D. Van Breemen R.B. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 903-916Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current study, the heme was found to be altered, in part, to a dissociable and a protein-bound heme adduct. This is the first report of a protein-bound heme adduct of NOS, although examples of this reaction have been established for myoglobin (34.Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Osawa Y. Highet R.J. Bax A. Pohl L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3208-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hemoglobin (36.Kindt J.T. Woods A. Martin B.M. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cytochrome P-450 (37.Osawa Y. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38.Yao K. Falick A.M. Patel N. Correia M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recently described enhanced chemiluminescence assay (24.Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used to establish that the heme was predominantly bound to a site on the oxygenase domain. The chemiluminescence assay detects the peroxidase activity of the protein-bound heme adduct and indicates that the heme bound to the protein is intact and redox active. The current study also demonstrated the formation of an intact heme product that can be dissociated from the protein under acidic conditions. The radioisotope studies have further indicated that the dissociable adduct likely contains a carbon atom derived from AG. The dissociable heme adduct was found to be unstable and to revert to native heme during isolation. Taken together, the dissociable heme product may be a tight reversible complex of an AG metabolite with heme or a covalently altered heme that can chemically breakdown to give native heme. One potential AG metabolite is a carbon radical formed from the oxidation of the hydrazine, analogous to that found for the reaction of hemoproteins with aryl- and alkyl-hydrazines (39.Augusto O. Kunze K.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6231-6241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Ator M.A. David S.K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14954-14960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the reaction of nNOS with phenyldiazene gives rise to an iron phenyl complex with heme (41.Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The formation of a carbon radical intermediate would be consistent with the observation that a highly similar dissociable heme product was formed from diaminoguanidine, which can be oxidized to give the same carbon radical intermediate as that for AG. The finding that intact protein-bound and dissociable heme adducts are formed for nNOS is in accord with the report that nNOS and iNOS are inactivated by AG by a process that does not change the inherent fluorescence caused by the heme prosthetic group of the protein (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,21.Bryk R. Lubeskie A. Wolff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The AG-mediated inactivation of nNOS to form intact heme adducts is in contrast to that found for NIO-mediated inactivation of iNOS where biliverdin is formed (30.Fast W. Nikolic D. Van Breemen R.B. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 903-916Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The formation of the dissociable heme adduct for nNOS in our study is in accord with the observation by Bryk and Wolff (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that after treatment of iNOS with [14C]AG the radiolabel is found associated with an HPLC fraction containing native heme. This can be explained by the inability of the dissociable heme product to be separated from the native heme under the conditions employed by Bryk and Wolff (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that nNOS and iNOS are inactivated by similar mechanisms. In the current study on nNOS, we were able to resolve the dissociable heme product from heme and directly address the role of heme alteration in the inactivation process. The inactivation of iNOS with [14C]AG was found to give 0.63 mol of 14C label/mol of iNOS (20.Bryk R. Wolff D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recently, a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of 14C label/mol of nNOS was determined for the inactivation of nNOS (21.Bryk R. Lubeskie A. Wolff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on this stoichiometry and the lack of change in the heme fluorescence of the inactivated nNOS, Bryk et al. (21.Bryk R. Lubeskie A. Wolff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) concluded that the inactivation by AG was due to covalent alteration of the protein. This differs from our observations and conclusions, in part, because of the following two reasons. First, the lack of change in heme fluorescence cannot be interpreted as the lack of heme alteration because the modified heme products that were found in our current study also fluoresce. Second, Bryk et al. (21.Bryk R. Lubeskie A. Wolff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) measured the binding of [14C]AG to nNOS after treatment for 24 h. We found that radiolabeling of the nNOS protein occurs at a stoichiometry of 0.1 mol/mol of nNOS after treatment for 20 min but that the stoichiometry can increase to 0.6 mol/mol of nNOS after longer incubation periods. This greater binding, however, is not related to the inactivation event, which occurs over a shorter time period. In addition, even under conditions where nNOS was radiolabeled with a stoichiometry of 0.6 mol/mol of nNOS, more than two-thirds of the inactivation was still due to the heme loss (Fig. 3). Therefore, we conclude that the radiolabel bound to the protein likely plays a minor role in the inactivation process. The radiolabeling occurred to a much greater extent when nNOS was treated in the presence of calmodulin and indicates that a reactive metabolite is formed that covalently modifies the protein. It remains to be determined whether the reactive metabolite is the same as that responsible for the heme alteration. Moreover, tryptic mapping studies showed that the radiolabel binding occurs in large part to the reductase domain with some binding to the oxygenase domain. The mechanism for the cause of the activity loss by protein alteration is not known. The mechanism for inactivation of nNOS by covalent alteration of the protein may involve multiple mechanisms including destabilizing the active homodimer or interfering with the electron flow from reductase to the heme. NMA causes a substantial alteration of the prosthetic heme that appears to be the major mechanism for inactivation of iNOS (31.Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the same study, experiments with 14C-labeled NMA show that radiolabel is found associated with the iNOS protein with a stoichiometry of 0.1 mol/mol of NOS monomer. Thus, AG may be similar to NMA in that multiple mechanisms account for the loss of activity, with heme alteration being the major factor. The alterations of nNOS described here may be biologically important because suicide inactivated nNOS is selectively recognized by the proteosome and processed for degradation (42.Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of liver microsomal P-450 cytochromes, the cross-linking of the heme prosthetic group to the protein appears to be an important determinant in recognition by the proteosome (43.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 44.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R.

Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or “heme stripping” to form apoprotein (45.Bornheim L.M. Underwood M.C. Caldera P. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Wrighton S.A.

Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar) all fail to enhance proteolysis with liver microsomal P-450 cytochromes. The current study shows for the first time that nNOS can form heme-protein cross-linked adducts similar to that found for liver microsomal P-450 cytochromes. Thus, the current findings may aid in future studies on the elucidation of the nature of the alteration that triggers nNOS for proteosomal processing and degradation.

In the present report, we investigated the effect of hCG on NF-κB and AP-1 activated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Treatment of the CaCOV3 human ovarian cell line with hCG blocked TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription. hCG also blocked NF-κB activation induced by ceramide. The effect of hCG on NF-κB was mediated through inhibition of phosphorylation of IκBα. Because hCG also blocked TNF receptor-associated factor-2 and NF-κB-inducing kinase reporter gene expression, hCG must act at a step that causes phosphorylation of IκBα. AP-1 activation induced by TNF and ceramide was also suppressed by hCG. hCG abrogated the TNF-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase required for NF-κB and AP-1, respectively. Dideoxyadenosine and H-8 reversed the effect, and dibutyryl cAMP mimicked the effect, suggesting that hCG suppresses the transcription factors through cAMP-induced protein kinase A pathway.

For instance, hCG suppresses the cell-mediated allogeneic reaction involving maternal lymphocytes and fetal implants (4.Chaouat G. Menu E. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Suppression of mammary carcinogenesis similar to that induced by pregnancy has been achieved by treating young virgin rats with hCG (13.Russo I.H. Koszalka M. Russo J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1286-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). hCG also inhibits the development of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz(a)anthracene-induced mammary carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner (14.Russo I.H. Koszalka M. Gimotty P.A. Russo J. Br. J Cancer. 1990; 62: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro, hCG has been shown to block the proliferation of breast tumor cells (15.Alvarado M.V. Alvarado N.E. Russo J. Russo I.H. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.

Lei Z.M. Rao C, V. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). How hCG exerts this broad spectrum of effects is not understood. Because various genes that are required for carcinogenesis, immune modulation, cell proliferation, and HIV-1 replication are regulated by the nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), we hypothesized that many of hCG's effects are mediated through suppression of NF-κB and AP-1 activation. Numerous lines of evidence suggest this possibility. For example, various agents that promote tumorigenesis activate NF-κB (18.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including phorbol ester, okadaic acid, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In addition, several genes that are involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and inflammation are regulated by NF-κB (18.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that NF-κB protects cells from undergoing apoptosis and thus promotes proliferation (19.Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Giri D.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and most activators of NF-κB also induce apoptosis (18.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our hypothesis suggests that hCG would affect the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1. The activation of NF-κB by TNF has been shown to involve interaction of TNF receptor-1 through its death domain with TNF-receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), which then binds to TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-2. TRAF-2 then binds to NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which activates IκBβ kinase (IKK-β) to result in phosphorylation of IκBα, which in turn leads to ubiquitination, degradation, and finally NF-κB activation (18.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB is regulated by several other kinases, including those that belong to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family (21.Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Various agents that activate NF-κB also activate AP-1, another transcription factor (22.Karin M. Liu Z.g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). The activation of AP-1 is mediated through the activation of a stress-activated protein kinase called c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (22.Karin M. Liu Z.g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 23.Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because hCG inhibits various cellular responses that require NF-κB and AP-1 activation, we tested the hypothesis that these effects are mediated through its modulation of activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and members of the MAP kinase family. We found that hCG is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB and AP-1 activation, and inhibits TNF-induced JNK and MAP kinase kinase (MEK) activation.

Bacteria-derived recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Antibodies against IκBα and double-stranded oligonucleotide having the AP-1 consensus sequence were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-IκBα (Ser-32) antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; PD-10 (prepacked Sephadex G-25 medium) columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; IODO-GEN and gelatin were from Sigma. Expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged NIK (24.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. David Wallach (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The expression plasmid encoding myc-tagged TRAF-2 has been previously described (25.Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). CaCOV3 (human ovarian) cells, U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma), Jurkat (T cells), and HeLa (epithelial cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Most of the studies were performed with human ovarian cells, because the hCG receptors on these cells have been well characterized (2.Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1× antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. Cells were free from mycoplasma as determined using the Gen-Probe Mycoplasma Rapid Detection Kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). To assay NF-κB activation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described elsewhere (26.Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled, 45-mer, double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (6 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the HIV long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (underlining indicates NF-κB binding sites) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was resolved from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined using competition assay with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. The gels were dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. To assay AP-1 activation, 6 μg of nuclear extract, prepared as indicated above, was incubated with 16 fmol of the 32P-end-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (underlining indicates the AP-1 binding site) for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of binding was examined by competition assay with unlabeled oligonucleotide. The radioactive bands were visualized and quantified as indicated above. To assay IκBα, postnuclear (cytoplasmic) extracts were prepared (27.Chaturvedi M.M. Kumar A. Darnay B.G. Chainy G.B.N. Aggarwal S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30129-30134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) from TNF-treated cells and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IκBα, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). The c-Jun kinase assay was performed as described elsewhere (28.Kumar A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, after cells (3 × 106/ml) were treated with TNF for 10 min, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Cell extracts (150 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with 0.3 μg of anti-JNK antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 400 μL of lysis buffer and twice with 400 μL of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm NaCl). Kinase assays were performed for 15 min at 30 °C with GST-Jun (1–79) as a substrate (2 μg/sample) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 15 μL of 2 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9%). GST-Jun (1–79) was visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, and the dried gel was analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The effect of hCG on TNF-, TRAF-2-, NIK-, and p65 (transactivation subunit of NF-κB)-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was measured as described previously (29.Darnay B. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (0.1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates, treated with 50 ng/ml hCG for 12 h, and then transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were transfected with medium (1 ml) containing plasmid DNAs for TRAF2, NIK, or p65 (1 μg each) along with 0.5 μg of NF-κB promoter DNA linked to the heat-stable secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene. The total final amount of DNA was maintained at 3 μg by the addition of the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA. To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we transfected cells with the SEAP expression plasmid for 10 h before treating them with TNF (1 nm). In all transfections, treatment with hCG was continued during the transfection reaction. Cell culture-conditioned medium was harvested 24 h after transfection and analyzed (25 μL) for alkaline phosphatase activity as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). SEAP activity was assayed on a 96-well fluorescent plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Lab Systems) with the excitation wavelength set at 360 nm and the emission wavelength at 460 nm. This reporter system was specific, because TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of either an IκBα mutant lacking Ser-32/36, a kinase inactive NIK, or a dominant-negative TRAF-2 mutant (25.Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 29.Darnay B. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). CaCOV3 cells were treated with hCG for 24 h and then stimulated with 1 nm TNF for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB by EMSA. hCG alone did not activate NF-κB (Fig.1 A). Neither the concentration of hCG nor the duration of treatment had any effect on the viability of CaCOV3 cells (data not shown). TNF induced NF-κB activation by 7-fold; hCG pretreatment completely suppressed it in a dose-dependent manner with maximum inhibition at 50 ng/ml (Fig. 1 A). We next tested the incubation period required for hCG to block TNF-induced NF-κB activation by incubating cells with hCG for 6, 12, 18, or 24 h before adding TNF and then treating cells with TNF for 30 min. Only when the cells were pretreated for 24 h with hCG was maximum inhibition of NF-κB activation observed (Fig. 1 B). Co-treatment with hCG did not inhibit NF-κB activation. Various combinations of Rel/NF-κB proteins can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to specific sequences in DNA (19.Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To show that the retarded band visualized by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, we incubated nuclear extracts from TNF-activated cells with antibody to either the p50 (NF-κBI) or p65 (Rel A) subunits and then conducted EMSA. Antibodies to either subunit of NF-κB shifted the band to a higher molecular weight (Fig. 1 C), thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Neither preimmune serum nor such irrelevant antibodies as anti-cRel or anti-cyclin D1 affected the mobility of NF-κB. Excess unlabeled NF-κB (100-fold) caused complete disappearance of the band but mutant oligo did not, indicating the specificity of NF-κB. All of the effects of hCG described here were observed in human ovarian CaCOV3 cells. Recent reports indicate, however, that the NF-κB activation pathway may differ in different cell types (30.Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar). The receptors for hCG have been demonstrated on lymphoid cells and other cell types (2.Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lojun S. Bao S. Lei Z.M. Rao C, V. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31.Lin J. Lojun S. Lei Z.M. Wu W.X. Peiner S.C. Rao C.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: R13-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also studied whether hCG could block TNF-induced NF-κB activation in myeloid (U-937) cells, epithelial (HeLa) cells, and T (Jurkat) cells. In these experiments (Fig. 2) hCG inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation in all cell types, suggesting that this effect is not restricted to ovarian cells. NF-κB is also activated by a variety of other agents besides TNF, including phorbol ester, LPS, okadaic acid, and ceramide (19.Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathways induced by these agents differ. We therefore examined the effect of hCG on the activation of NF-κB by these agents as well as by TNF. hCG completely blocked the activation of NF-κB induced by ceramide but not that by H2O2, LPS, okadaic acid, or phorbol ester (Fig.3). These results suggest that TNF and ceramide activate NF-κB by a pathway that is different from that of the other agents and that hCG may act at a step where both of these agents converge in the signal transduction pathway that leads to NF-κB activation. As noted earlier (Fig. 1 A), TNF-induced NF-κB activation was completely suppressed by hCG. Because hCG shares a common receptor with a pituitary hormone, lutropin (2.Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of leutinizing hormone on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig.4 A, like hCG, pretreatment of cells with leutinizing hormone for 24 h suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum suppression occurring at 100 ng/ml. Although we used highly purified natural hCG in our studies, it is possible that the suppressive effects on NF-κB activation were due to a contaminant in the hCG preparation (32.Kachra Z. Guo W.X. Sairam M.R. Antakly T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4038-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we used synthetic hCG prepared by recombinant DNA methods. As shown in Fig. 4 B, this hormone also inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependant manner, indicating that the activity was not due to a contaminant in the hCG preparation. The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκBα (23.Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory action of hCG was due to an effect on IκBα degradation, the cytoplasmic levels of IκBα proteins were examined by Western blot analysis. IκBα was maximally degraded 15 min after TNF treatment of cells and resynthesis began thereafter. The pretreatment of cells with hCG completely abolished the TNF-induced degradation of IκBα (Fig.5 A). To determine if inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation by hCG was due to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation, we treated the cells with the proteosome inhibitor ALLN (33.Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. LeBail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N.R. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h and detected a hyperphosphorylated form of IκBα by using antibodies that recognize only the serine-phosphorylated form. The hyperphosphorylated form of IκBα appears as a slow-migrating band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B). TNF clearly induced the phosphorylation of IκBα and hCG suppressed it (compare lane 4 with lane 8). The lack of a slow-migrating band in hCG-treated cells further demonstrates that hCG blocked TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation (see lower panel of Fig.5 B). So far we have shown that hCG blocks the DNA binding of NF-κB protein to its consensus sequence. DNA binding alone did not always correlate with NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, suggesting that additional regulatory steps have a role (34.Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of hCG on TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, the hCG-pretreated or untreated HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the SEAP reporter construct and then stimulated with TNF. Although SEAP activity increased 5-fold over the vector control after stimulation with TNF, TNF-induced SEAP activity was almost completely abolished by pretreatment with hCG (Fig.6). These results demonstrate that hCG also represses NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF. TNF-induced NF-κB activation is mediated through sequential interaction of the TNF receptor with TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK-β, resulting in phosphorylation of IκBα. To delineate the site of action of hCG in the TNF-signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation, cells were transfected with TRAF2, NIK, and p65 plasmids, and then NF-κB-dependent SEAP expression was monitored in hCG-untreated and -treated cells. As shown in Fig. 6, TRAF2, NIK, and p65 plasmids induced gene expression and hCG suppressed TRAF-2 and NIK-induced but not p65-induced NF-κB reporter expression. Thus hCG must act at a step downstream from IKK-β. Because NIK is known to activate IKK-β, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα, it appears that hCG must block the activity of IKK-β. We next tested the effect of hCG on TNF-induced activation of AP-1 (35.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). TNF induced AP-1 expression by 5-fold in ovarian cells at a concentration of 1 nm. The activation of AP-1 was completely inhibited by hCG in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum suppression occurring at 50 ng/ml (Fig.7 A). Supershift analysis with specific antibodies against c-fos and c-junindicate that TNF-induced AP-1 consisted of c-fos and c-jun (Fig. 7 B). Lack of supershift by unrelated antibodies and disappearance of the AP-1 band by competition with unlabeled oligo shows the specificity. Most agents that activate NF-κB also activate AP-1 (35.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar); therefore, we also investigated the effect of hCG on AP-1 activation by PMA, LPS, H2O2, okadaic acid, and ceramide. Like NF-κB, all these agents activated AP-1, but only ceramide-induced AP-1 was blocked by hCG. Thus hCG blocked both NF-κB and AP-1 induced by TNF and ceramide. TNF is a potent activator of JNK and MEK. Activation of AP-1 and NF-κB are known to require the activation of JNK and MEK, respectively. To determine whether these kinases are modulated by hCG, we pretreated CaCOV3 cells with different concentrations of hCG for 24 h and then stimulated the cells with TNF (1 nm) for 10 min; JNK activation was then measured. TNF activated JNK by about 4-fold, an activation that gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of hCG. A 50 ng/ml concentration of hCG inhibited most of the JNK induced by TNF (Fig. 8 A). We found that hCG also abolished TNF-induced MEK activation (Fig.8 B). hCG is known to be a potent inducer of cAMP (1.Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). To investigate whether hCG-induced cAMP plays a role in suppression of NF-κB activation, cells were treated with the hormone in the presence of different concentrations of dideoxyadenosine, which is known to block adenylate cyclase (36.Dostmann W.R. Taylor S.S. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10484-10491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme responsible for generation of cAMP. As shown in Fig. 9 A, dideoxyadenosine had no effect by itself on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, but it abolished the suppressive effect of hCG on TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner achieving a complete block at 500 μm. These results suggest that the effects of hCG are caused by cAMP. To further confirm this, we treated cells with a cell-permeable analogue of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP. Bt2cAMP induced a gradual decrease in TNF-induced NF-κB activation with increases in concentration (Fig.9 B) just as hCG did. Since cAMP activates PKA, we also examined the effect of the PKA inhibitor H-8 on hCG-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation. Cells were either exposed to 2 μm H-8 for 1 h at 37 °C and then treated with hCG for 24 h or exposed simultaneously to 2 μm H-8 and hCG for 24 h or treated with 2 μm H-8 after the hormone exposure. The cells were then examined for TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The PKA inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effects of hCG when the cells were pretreated or co-treated with the hormone but post-treatment with H-8 produced almost no protection against hCG-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation (Fig. 9, panel C). These results indicate that the effects of hCG are mediated through activation of PKA. Because hCG exhibits anticarcinogenic, growth regulatory, and immunomodulatory effects, we hypothesized that these effects of the hormone are mediated through suppression of NF-κB activation, an early mediator of the pleiotropic effects of TNF. Our results clearly demonstrate that hCG is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation induced by TNF. The inhibition of NF-κB activation by hCG correlated with suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription. hCG also suppressed the TNF-induced activation of AP-1, MEK, and JNK. We show that the suppressive effects of hCG are likely mediated through cAMP. There are several possibilit"
https://openalex.org/W2041641295,"Recent studies of β2-adrenergic receptor suggest that agonist-promoted receptor internalization may play an important role in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by G protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we explored the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) type-1 receptor (AT1) internalization on Ang II-induced activation of ERK using the receptor internalization blocker concanavalin A (ConA) and the carboxyl terminus-truncated receptor mutants with impaired internalization. ConA inhibited AT1 receptor internalization without affecting ligand binding to the receptor, Ang II-induced generation of second messengers, and activation of tyrosine kinases Src and Pyk2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). ConA blocked ERK activation evoked by Ang II and the calcium ionophore A23187. Impairment of AT1receptor internalization by truncating the receptor carboxyl terminus did not affect Ang II-induced ERK activation. ConA induced proteolytic cleavage of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at carboxyl terminus and abolished Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor, which is critical for ERK activation by Ang II in VSMC. ConA also induced proteolysis of erbB-2 but not platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Thus, ConA blocks Ang II-induced ERK activation in VSMC through a distinct mechanism, the ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor.

Elliott M.E Catt K.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II binds to at least two types of receptor with high affinity, designated AT1 and AT2 receptors (2.Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J.

Since the AT1 receptor is a key mediator in the biologic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin system, there has been considerable interest in defining its signaling pathways that mediate the cardiovascular physiology.

In Rat 1a fibroblasts, the GPCR-mediated activation of ERK is sensitive to four mechanistically distinct inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, concanavalin A (ConA), hypertonic medium, depletion of intracellular potassium, and monodansylcadaverine (17.Luttrell L.M.

In addition, expression of dominant inhibitory mutants of β-arrestin1 or dynamin, which attenuate agonist-induced receptor internalization, inhibits β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated ERK activation (16.Luttrell L.M.

Since GPCRs appear to internalize through a clathrin-mediated process and AT1 receptor internalization is blocked by ConA (19.Tang H. Shirai H. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we performed studies to examine the possible requirement of AT1 receptor internalization for the receptor signaling using the receptor internalization blocker ConA and the receptor mutants with impaired internalization. We obtained evidence that AT1 receptor internalization is not required for the early signaling events and the downstream ERK activation by the receptor in VSMC. Furthermore, we found that ConA blocked Ang II-induced activation of ERK through a distinct mechanism, the ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor in VSMC. Ang II and [Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore.

Src family kinases assay kit and EGF were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-specific ERK and ERK and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and reagents for chemiluminescense detection were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were from Sigma. VSMC were prepared from the thoracic aorta of 12-week-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) by the explant method and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (20.Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Imai T. Kanno K. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subcultured VSMC from passages 3 through 15 were used in the experiments. Subconfluent VSMC were serum-starved in plain medium for 48 h. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Monoiodinated125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II was prepared by the lactoperoxidase method and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (21.Benya R.V. Kusui T. Shikado F. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11721-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of receptor affinity and density and measurement of the surface receptor binding capacity were performed as described previously (19.Tang H. Shirai H. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured into 12-well plates and, when nearly confluent, were stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 15 s. The IP3 mass generated in 15 s was measured by radioreceptor binding assay as described previously (19.Tang H. Shirai H. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ang II-mediated changes in intracellular calcium concentration were determined with Fura-2/AM as described previously (22.Thekkumkara T.J. Du J. Dostal D.E. Booz G.W. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 738-745Google Scholar). The truncated AT1A receptor mutants T318 and T328 lacking 42 or 32 amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus, respectively, were prepared by inserting a stop codon. The wild type or mutated AT1A cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pRc/CMV and stably expressed in CHO cells as described previously (23.Tang H. Guo D.-F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and then lysed on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at a full speed in a microcentrifuge. The clarified lysates were incubated sequentially (4 h for each incubation at 4 °C) with antibodies as indicated and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed four times with the lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates or immnunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with various primary antibodies as indicated and detected using the ECL system with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. For measuring the activities of Src family kinases, cell lysates prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and control IgG from normal rabbit serum, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody (SRC-2), which recognizes the carboxy-terminal sequence of the Src family members Src, Fyn, and Yes. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 15 μl of a buffer solution containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm Na3VO4, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 300 μm Src family kinase specific peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVKK) in a total volume of 35 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, peptide phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 50% acetic acid, and the reaction mixture was then applied onto P-81 phosphocellulose filter paper. Papers were washed four times in 0.75% phosphoric acid, washed once with acetone, dried, and then counted in a scintillation counter. ConA has been shown to inhibit the internalization of β-adrenergic receptors without affecting ligand binding, G protein activation, and generation of small molecule second messengers (24.Wang H.-Y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25.Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that ConA markedly inhibited internalization of AT1B receptors stably expressed in CHO cells (19.Tang H. Shirai H. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of ConA on the internalization of the endogenous AT1 receptor and the receptor-mediated formation of second messengers in VSMC, VSMC were preincubated with 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min at 37 °C as shown in Fig. 1. Radioligand binding experiments revealed that the binding of the receptor antagonist125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II to intact cells pre-exposed to 100 nm Ang II rapidly decreased with time, with a 40% loss after 5 min of preincubation of Ang II (Fig. 1 A). This indicated that the AT1 receptor was rapidly internalized in response to the agonist Ang II in VSMC. Pretreatment of the cells with ConA virtually blocked the Ang II-induced internalization of AT1 receptor in VSMC (Fig.1 A). However, ConA treatment did not affect Ang II-induced IP3 formation and calcium mobilization in VSMC (Fig. 1,B and C). In addition, ConA did not alter the AT1 receptor binding number (520 ± 70 fmol/mg of protein with ConA versus 505 ± 59 fmol/mg of protein without ConA treatment) and the receptor binding affinity to125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II in VSMC (K d = 0.72 ± 0.06 nm with ConAversus 0.68 ± 0.07 nm without ConA treatment). These results with ConA indicate that AT1receptor-mediated generation of second messengers occurs in the absence of the receptor internalization. In VSMC, ERK activation by Ang II is calcium-dependent (26.Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The ERK is activated upon phosphorylation of a Thr and a Tyr residue in a TEY motif (27.Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Specific antibody against phosphorylated ERK detects the activated form of ERK by immunoblotting. Using this phospho-specific antibody, we performed immunoblot analysis to determine the effect of ConA on Ang II-induced ERK activation in VSMC. As shown in Fig.2, treatment of ConA virtually abolished the ERK activation by both Ang II (100 nm) (Fig.2 A) and calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μm) (Fig.2 B). In contrast, ConA did not affect the ERK activation evoked by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 2 B). Thus, ConA interrupts signaling pathways to ERK activation downstream of calcium. Since Ang II-induced activation of ERK is calcium-dependent in VSMC (26.Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these results suggest that internalization of the AT1 receptor may not be involved in the ERK activation by Ang II in VSMC. To determine whether internalization of AT1 receptor is required for the ERK activation, we have constructed truncated mutants of the AT1A receptor and stably expressed them in CHO cells. Truncation mutants T318 and T328 lack 42 or 32 amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of the AT1A receptor, respectively. We reported that the dissociation constants (K d) for125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II among the wild type and these truncated mutants were similar, indicating that the wild type and the mutants possessed similar ligand binding affinity (23.Tang H. Guo D.-F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, Ang II (100 nm) induced rapid and profound internalization of the wild type AT1A receptor in transfected CHO cells, whereas the Ang II-induced receptor internalization was impaired in the truncated mutants (T318 and T328). We compared the ERK activation by Ang II among the wild type and the truncated mutants of AT1A receptors. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the ERK is fully activated by Ang II in CHO cells stably expressing the wild type AT1A receptor or the truncated mutant T318. The expression level of the mutant T318 is about 1.7-fold that of the wild type receptor (23.Tang H. Guo D.-F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis revealed that the extent of ERK2 phosphorylation by the mutant T318 is 2.28-fold that of the wild type receptor (Fig. 3 C). This may be due to the high expression level of receptor and more receptor remaining on the plasma membrane in cells expressing the mutant T318 during Ang II stimulation as shown in Fig. 3 A. We also observed that ERK was fully activated by Ang II in CHO cells expressing the mutant T328 (data not shown). These results indicate that the Ang II-induced receptor internalization and the ERK activation are two distinct receptor functions. AT1receptor internalization is not required for the ERK activation by Ang II. It has been recently reported that Src family kinases and the calcium-sensitive proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) play important roles in the ERK activation by Ang II (28.Ishida M. Ishida T. Thomas S.M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29.Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Masaki H. Maruyama K Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that Src family kinases and Pyk2 may mediate the Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor in VSMC (15.Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with an increase in its own kinase activity (30.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ConA on activation of Pyk2 by Ang II, VSMC were pretreated with 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min, and Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was measured as shown in Fig. 4 A. Ang II (100 nm) induced a rapid (1 min) tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, and this effect was not altered by ConA pretreatment in VSMC. We determined the effect of ConA on Src family kinase activation by Ang II. VSMC were pretreated with or without 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min as indicated and then stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 1 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal SRC-2 antibody, which recognizes the common carboxy-terminal sequence of the family members Src, Fyn, and Yes. The immunoprecipitable kinase activity was determined by its ability to phosphorylate the Src kinase-specific substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVKK) (31.Cheng H, -C. Litwin C.M. Hwang D.-M. Wang J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17919-17925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, ConA did not affect the activation of Src family kinases by Ang II in VSMC. The above results indicate that ConA blocks Ang II-induced activation of ERK through a mechanism independent of the AT1 receptor internalization in VSMC. Instead, ConA interrupts the signaling pathways downstream of calcium mobilization, Pyk2, and Src family kinases. We recently reported that Ang II activates ERK through a calcium-dependent transactivation of the EGF receptor in VSMC (13.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To determine whether ConA affects the Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by Ang II in ConA-treated VSMC as shown in Fig. 5 A. VSMC were pretreated with or without 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min and then stimulated with 100 nm Ang II or 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) against the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues 1005–1016) of EGF receptor, and the immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). The EGF receptor antibody reacts with the EGF receptor protein of mouse, rat, and human origin. Consistent with our previous report (13.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), Ang II (100 nm) induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor evoked by Ang II and EGF was abolished by ConA treatment (Fig.5A, upper panel). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Transduction Laboratory) that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the EGF receptor at amino acid residue 996 to 1022 and reacts with rat EGF receptor. Surprisingly, the intact EGF receptor was barely detected in ConA-treated VSMC when compared with that in control cells (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). These results suggest that ConA may induce degradation or proteolysis of the EGF receptor. Alternatively, ConA may induce post-modification of the EGF receptor, which may interfere with the immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor by the polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody we used in a nature condition. To confirm the effect of ConA on the EGF receptor degradation, VSMC were pretreated with or without 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min and then stimulated with 100 Ang II or 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min. Cell lysates were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by the polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) against the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues 1005–1016) of the EGF receptor. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the intact EGF receptor was barely detected by the antibody in ConA-treated VSMC when compared with that in control cells. Ang II or EGF did not affect the degradation of the EGF receptor by ConA treatment (Fig. 5 B). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Transduction Laboratory), which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the EGF receptor at amino acid residues 996 to 1022, or an EGF receptor antiserum (32.Cohen S. Fava R.A. Sawyer S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6237-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Stanley Cohen), which was raised with the whole molecule of mouse liver EGF receptor and reacts with the rat EGF receptor. Similar results were obtained when these two different anti-EGF receptor antibodies were employed in the immunoblotting (data not shown). These data indicate that ConA could induce degradation or proteolysis of the EGF receptor in VSMC. The EGF receptor subfamily member erbB-2 but not erbB-3 or -4 is expressed in VSMC. ConA treatment also resulted in a decrease of the erbB-2 protein in VSMC (Fig. 5 C). The erbB-2 was detected by an antibody (Santa Cruz) against the carboxyl terminus of the protein. In contrast, PDGF receptor type β, which is expressed abundantly in VSMC (33.Inui H. Kitami Y. Kondo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17045-17050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), remained intact during ConA treatment (Fig. 5 D). The PDGF receptor type β was detected by an antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) against the receptor carboxyl-terminal region (residues 1013–1025). To identify proteolytic cleavage fragment of the EGF receptor, cell lysates from ConA-treated VSMC were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7 or 10% gel) and analyzed by the polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) against the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues 1005–1016) of the EGF receptor. As shown in Fig. 6 A, ConA induced an appearance of a 26-kDa fragment in a time-dependent manner, which coincides with a decrease in the level of the native EGF receptor. Fig. 6 B shows that divalent succinyl ConA did not cause a decrease of the native EGF receptor and appearance of the 26-kDa fragment. This suggests that clustering of surface membrane proteins including the EGF receptor by ConA binding may be responsible for the EGF receptor proteolysis. Finally, we determined the effects of other two chemically distinct inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, such as hyperosmolar sucrose (34.Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and phenylarsine oxide (35.Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on proteolysis of the EGF receptor in VSMC. Both hyperosmolar sucrose and phenylarsine oxide inhibited the AngII-induced internalization of AT1 receptor in VSMC (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6 C, ConA caused proteolysis of the EGF receptor, which produces a 26-kDa EGF receptor fragment in VSMC. In contrast, treatment of VSMC with sucrose (0.45m) or phenylarsine oxide (20 μm) did not affect the integrity of the EGF receptor. These data strongly indicate that ConA induces proteolysis of the EGF receptor in VSMC, probably by cleaving the receptor carboxyl terminus at a site before amino acid residue 1005. Five sites of in vivo autophosphorylation have been identified in the EGF receptor: three major (Tyr1068, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173) and two minor sites (Tyr 992 and Tyr 1086) (36.Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 37.Hsuan J.-J. Totty N. Waterfield M.D. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites bind a variety of downstream signaling proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains, including Shc (40.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) and phospholipase Cγ (41.Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), thus leading to ERK activation. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region that contains these autophosphorylation sites by ConA will abolish the EGF-mediated mitogenic signal such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK. Thus, we determined ERK activation by EGF in ConA-treated VSMC. As shown in Fig.7, treatment of VSMC with 0.25 mg/ml ConA for 30 min abolished the ERK activation by EGF. The activation of ERK was determined by a phospho-specific antibody to ERK. In the present study, we explored the effects of AT1receptor internalization on the receptor signaling using the receptor internalization blocker ConA and the receptor mutants (T318 and T328) with impaired internalization. We have obtained evidence that AT1 receptor internalization is not required for Ang II-induced generation of second messengers (IP3 and calcium) and downstream activation of Pyk2, Src family kinases, and ERK in VSMC. Furthermore, we found that ConA blocked Ang II-induced ERK activation in VSMC through a distinct mechanism, the ConA-mediated proteolysis of EGF receptor. Recent studies indicate that internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor is required for the receptor-mediated ERK activation (16.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar).

However, several lines of evidence suggest that this concept may not be applied to the Gq-coupled AT1receptor. First, the mechanism of AT1 receptor internalization appears to be different from that of β2-adrenergic receptor. Internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor can be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and a selective Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (42.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, we found that neither herbimycin A and PP1 not tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate can attenuate the internalization of AT1 receptor in VSMC and CHO cells stably expressing the AT1 receptor (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of the K44A dynamin I mutant, which potently inhibited internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor (42.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), did not affect internalization of the AT1receptor (43.Zhang J. Ferguson S.S., G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Ishizaka et al. (44.Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) recently report that the internalization of the AT1 receptor may be mediated by caveolae in VSMC. Second, we found herein that blockade of AT1 receptor internalization by ConA did not affect the receptor-mediated IP3 formation and calcium mobilization as well as ligand binding to the receptor in VSMC. ConA blocked ERK activation by Ang II and by a calcium ionophore in VSMC. Since Ang II-induced ERK activation is calcium-dependent in VSMC (26.Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these results suggest that ConA suppresses Ang II-induced ERK activation by interrupting the signaling pathways to ERK downstream of calcium mobilization but not by the AT1 receptor internalization. Finally, we constructed truncated mutants (T318 and T328) of the AT1 receptor and stably expressed them in CHO cells. The agonist-induced receptor internalization was impaired in T318 and T328 mutants. However, ERK was fully activated by Ang II in these mutants. Taken together, these data indicate that the internalization of AT1 receptor is not required for the ERK activation by Ang II in VSMC. We and others recently reported that Ang II activates ERK through a calcium-dependent transactivation of the EGF receptor (13.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H.

Transactivation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase by GPCRs was originally reported in Rat-1 fibroblasts stimulated with endothelin-1, thrombin, or lysophosphatidic acid (45.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Transactivation of the EGF receptor family is likely to be a common and important mechanism for the GPCRs to activate ERK. The calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and Src family kinases seem to be involved in the Ang II-induced EGF receptor transactivation in VSMC (13.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of AT1 receptor internalization by ConA did not affect Ang II-induced activation of Pyk2 and Src family kinases. Interestingly, ConA abolished the Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor, which is due to the ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor. We have obtained substantial evidence indicating that ConA could induce proteolytic cleavage of the EGF receptor at the carboxyl terminus. ConA treatment also resulted in proteolysis of the EGF receptor subfamily member erbB-2 that is present in VSMC. However, PDGF receptor type β remained intact during ConA treatment. These data indicate that ConA blocks the Ang II-induced activation of ERK through the ConA-mediated proteolysis of EGF receptor family in VSMC. It has been shown that ConA blocks ERK activation evoked by lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, bombesin, and EGF in Rat-1 cells (17.Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ERK activation evoked by these agonists for GPCRs is mainly mediated by the transactivation of the EGF receptor in the Rat-1 cells (45.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Thus, ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor other than the inhibition of the GPCR internalization seems to be the common mechanism for the ConA to suppress the ERK activation. The lectin ConA binds specifically to terminal mannose residues on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids and modulates their lateral mobility differently in different cell types (46.Henis Y.I. Elson E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 136: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ConA polyclonally activates T cells (47.diSabato G. Hall J.M. Thompson L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 150: 3-17Google Scholar). On the other hand, ConA inhibits internalization of EGF receptor and the receptor-mediated mitogenic effects without affecting EGF binding and EGF-stimulated changes in pH, calcium, and levels of inositol phosphates in NIH 3T3 cells (48.Kaplowitz P.B. Haar J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 49.Hazan R. Krushel L. Crossin K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Five sites of in vivo autophosphorylation have been identified in the EGF receptor: three major (Tyr1068, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173) and two minor sites (Tyr992 and Tyr1086) (36.Downward J. Parker P.

In the present study, we found that ConA could induce proteolytic cleavage of the EGF receptor carboxyl terminus at a site before amino acid residue 1005 without affecting the EGF binding to the receptor in VSMC (3275 ± 395 cpm with ConAversus 3003 ± 360 cpm without ConA treatment). Proteolytic cleavage to remove the EGF receptor carboxyl-terminal region that contains these three major and two minor autophosphorylation sites will abolish the EGF mitogenic signal such as ERK activation. In fact, ConA did block the EGF-induced ERK activation in VSMC (Fig. 7). It has been reported that these EGF receptor autophosphorylation sites are also required for the binding of the receptor carboxyl terminus to the adaptor protein 2, thus mediating the receptor internalization (50.Nesterov A. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6320-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is interesting to determine whether the proteolytic cleavage of the EGF receptor carboxyl terminus is involved in the ConA-mediated inhibition of the EGF receptor internalization. In summary, we have obtained substantial evidence indicating that AT1 receptor internalization is not required for the early signaling events and the downstream ERK activation by the receptor in VSMC. Furthermore, we found that ConA, an AT1 receptor internalization blocker, suppressed Ang II-induced activation of ERK through a distinct mechanism, the ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor in VSMC."

However, agonist-mediated stimulation of either β1-AR or β2-AR fails to further enhance contractility in TG4 ventricular myocytes. Although the lack of β2-AR response has been ascribed to an efficient coupling of the receptor to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins in addition to Gs, the contractile response to β1-AR stimulation by norepinephrine and an α1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin is not restored by pertussis toxin treatment despite a Gi protein elevation of 1.7-fold in TG4 hearts. Since β-adrenergic receptor kinase, βARK1, activity remains unaltered, the unresponsiveness of β1-AR is not caused by βARK1-mediated receptor desensitization. In contrast, pre-incubation of cells with anti-adrenergic reagents such as muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol (10−5m), or a β2-AR inverse agonist, ICI 118,551 (5 × 10−7m), to abolish spontaneous β2-AR signaling, both reduce the base-line cAMP and contractility and, surprisingly, restore the β1-AR contractile response. The “rescued” contractile response is completely reversed by a β1-AR antagonist, CGP 20712A. Furthermore, these results from the transgenic animals are corroborated by in vitro acute gene manipulation in cultured wild type adult mouse ventricular myocytes. Adenovirus-directed overexpression of the human β2-AR results in elevated base-line cAMP and contraction associated with a marked attenuation of β1-AR response; carbachol pretreatment fully revives the diminished β1-AR contractile response. Thus, we conclude that constitutive β2-AR activation induces a heterologous desensitization of β1-ARs independent of βARK1 and Giproteins; suppression of the constitutive β2-AR signaling by either a β2-AR inverse agonist or stimulation of the muscarinic receptor rescues the β1-ARs from desensitization, permitting agonist-induced contractile response.

Owing to the critical role of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)1 in cardiac functional regulation, several transgenic and gene-targeted mouse models have been recently developed to alter β-AR signaling components (1.Koch W.J. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One such model that has drawn substantial attention is the transgenic mouse overexpressing the human β2-AR in a cardiac-specific manner (TG4 mice) (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In this model, due to the presence of spontaneously activated β2-ARs (designated as R*s), multiple components of base-line cardiac function, including heart rate, the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca]i) transient, and contractility, are substantially enhanced relative to those of wild type (WT) littermates (2.Milano C.A.

It has been suggested that this constitutive β2-AR stimulation may provide a novel mechanism for the inotropic support of the end stage, dilated, chronically failing heart (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F.

Surprisingly, in the context of substantially enhanced constitutive β2-AR stimulation, acute administration of either β1-AR or β2-AR agonists fails to elicit any contractile or chronotropic response in the intact animals (4.Du X.J.

Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3.Bond R.A. Leff P.

Our more recent studies, however, have demonstrated that this is not the case, because TG4 ventricular myocytes still respond to a direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin (5.Xiao R-P.

Furthermore, β2-AR agonist-mediated contractile response is rescued by pertussis toxin (PTX)-induced Gi ribosylation, indicating that an efficient coupling of β2-AR to Gi proteins (Gi2 and Gi3) negates the contractile response to β2-AR agonists (5.Xiao R-P.

Res. 1999; 85: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The loss of β1-AR responses in the context of β2-AR overexpression in TG4 mice, however, remained unexplained. It has been reported that acutely overexpression of β2-AR in rat C6 glioma cells also results in null β1-AR response (9.Zhong H. Guerrero S.W. Esbenshade T.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 175-184PubMed Google Scholar). This observation and those in the TG4 mouse heart point to a complex interplay among the closely related members of β-AR family, although the underlying mechanism was unknown.Since adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA signaling and the contractile machinery are intact in TG4 cardiomyocytes (5.Xiao R-P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y-Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 6.Zhou Y-Y. Cheng H. Song L-S.

Physiol. 1999; 521: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the loss of the β1-AR contractile response could be attributed to either a defect of the receptor per se, e.g.desensitization or down-regulation, or to interference of receptor signaling at a more distal level. As is true for most G protein-coupled receptors, prolonged exposure of β-ARs to an agonist leads to a decrease in receptor responsiveness, i.e. desensitization. When this occurs in the context of diminished responsiveness to a diverse array of other agonists (heterologous desensitization), it generally results from a negative feedback regulation by second messenger-stimulated kinases. For instance, activation of PKA downstream from various Gs-coupled receptors may lead to phosphorylation of β-AR (at PKA consensus sequences in the carboxyl terminus and/or the third intracellular loop) which, in turn, initiates receptor desensitization (10.Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar).Exposure to an agonist also can result in a diminished response to only that particular agonist, i.e. homologous (or agonist-specific) desensitization, which is generally mediated by the second messenger-independent mechanism, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (12.Freedman N.J.

Increased cardiac expression (3–5-fold) of βARK1 in transgenic mice leads to diminished β-AR agonist-stimulated cardiac contractility in vivo (15.Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and in isolated ventricular myocytes (16.Korzick D.H. Xiao R.P. Ziman B.D. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Lakatta E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H590-H596PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated receptors become binding substrates for a class of inhibitor proteins, β-arrestins, which inhibit further G protein coupling (17.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The chronic spontaneous β2-AR activation in TG4 cardiomyocytes could result in an increased G protein-coupled receptor kinase activity, as is the case in transgenic mice overexpressing Gsα (18.Vatner D.E.

Additionally, in both humans (19.Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and animals (20.Ping P. Anzai T. Gao M. Hammond H.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H707-H717PubMed Google Scholar), chronic heart failure is often associated with elevated plasma catecholamine levels (21.Kiuchi K. Shannon R.P. Komamura K.

Specifically, we have determined 1) whether β1-AR in TG4 hearts is desensitized via a PKA- or βARK1-dependent mechanism, 2) whether inhibitory mechanisms, particularly Gi proteins, cross-talk with β1-AR-coupled Gs signaling and counteract its contractile response, and 3) whether inhibition of the spontaneous β2-AR activation by either a β2-AR inverse agonist or stimulation of Gi-coupled muscarinic receptor restores the desensitized β1-AR signaling. Furthermore, using a modified adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique recently developed in this laboratory (24.Zhou, Y-Y., Wang, S-Q., Zhu, W. Z., Chruscinski, A., Kobilka, B., Ziman, B., Wang, S., Lakatta, E. G., Cheng, H., and Xiao, R-P. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), we have reproduced these experiments in cultured WT mouse cardiomyocytes infected with adenovirus carrying the human β2-AR gene (adeno-β2-AR). Our results indicate that the defect of β1-AR stimulation in TG4 cardiomyocytes is conferred to the enhanced constitutive β2-AR activation and is likely caused by PKA-dependent heterologous receptor desensitization, independent of βARK1 and Gi activation.DISCUSSIONUsing the genetically manipulated TG4 mouse model, the present and previous studies have revealed several intriguing phenomena related to interactions among receptor types or subtypes. For instance, overexpression of the human β2-AR induces a complete loss of β1-AR modulation of cardiac contractility and heart rate in vivo (4.Du X.J. Vincan E. Woodcock D.M. Milano C.A. Dart A.M. Woodcock E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H630-H636PubMed Google Scholar) and in isolated atria (3.Bond R.A. Leff P. Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A. McMinn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F. Nature. 1995; 374: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), consistent with previous observations in rat C6 glioma cells that overexpression of β2-AR results in a loss of β1-AR response (9.Zhong H. Guerrero S.W. Esbenshade T.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 175-184PubMed Google Scholar). The present study at the single cell level further demonstrates that this is likely caused by the spontaneous β2-AR activation and its concomitant cAMP/PKA-dependent β1-AR desensitization. More importantly, these observations in TG4 myocytes are entirely reproducible in vitro by acute, single-cell gene manipulation, excluding possible complications from chronic or developmental compensatory changes in the transgenic animal model. Thus, we conclude that heterologous receptor desensitization can result from ligand-directed receptor activation and from ligand-independent constitutive receptor activation as well. Although it is well established that Gi-coupled muscarinic receptor stimulation antagonizes β-AR-Gs-mediated contractile response (33.Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Boknik P. Watanabe A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1138-H1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Aprigliano O. Rybin V.O. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2726-H2735PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Lindemann J.P. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13122-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the principal novel finding of the present study is that activation of muscarinic receptor can resensitize heterologously desensitized β1-AR signaling in cardiomyocytes overexpressing β2-AR (Figs. 5 and 6). In other words, both positive and negative interactions between the adrenergic and muscarinic receptors can be demonstrated when the signaling system is predisposed differently. This observation exemplifies a principle that stimulation of a given receptor may elicit qualitatively different physiological responses in the same cell, depending on the set point of overt and “covert” parameters of the signaling circuitry. Specifically, these dual effects of muscarinic receptor stimulation appear to be related to different phases of β-AR and muscarinic receptor interaction. When β-AR and muscarinic receptor are simultaneously activated, muscarinic stimulation (at high agonist concentrations) negates the β-AR-mediated positive inotropic effect, as reported previously in many mammalian species (31.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar, 33.Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Boknik P. Watanabe A.M. Am. J.

G., Cheng, H., and Xiao, R-P. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, in mouse cardiomyocytes in which a high level of constitutive β2-AR signaling is present, pretreatment of the cells with CCh or acetylcholine (data not shown) sensitizes β1-AR response, presumably via reducing the basal PKA activation, thereby decreasing the basal β-AR phosphorylation. A similar cross-regulation between Giactivation and the Gs-coupled β-AR signaling has been demonstrated in hamster smooth muscle DDT1MF-2 cells, in which short term (60 min) pretreatment with an A1-adenosine agonist enhances β-AR-stimulated increases in adenylyl cyclase activity (36.Port J.D. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14784-14790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro studies emphasize the subtlety and complexity of cross-talk between β-AR subtypes and between Gs- and Gi-coupled receptors.It is noteworthy that Gi activation by CCh significantly reduces the base line of cAMP and contraction amplitude in TG4 myocytes and in cultured WT mouse myocytes overexpressing β2-AR, whereas it has no effect in control WT myocytes (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the magnitude of the anti-adrenergic effect of muscarinic receptor stimulation is very much dependent on the existing level of the cyclase/cAMP/PKA signaling. This is consistent with previous observations that M2 muscarinic receptor stimulation has no significant effect on base-line ventricular contraction but markedly inhibits β-AR-induced positive inotropic response (33.Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Boknik P. Watanabe A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1138-H1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Aprigliano O. Rybin V.O. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2726-H2735PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Lindemann J.P. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13122-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several cellular mechanisms are involved in modulating the throughput of β-AR signaling, e.g. PKA- or G protein-coupled receptor kinases-dependent receptor desensitization via receptor phosphorylation, receptor down-regulation, and other counterbalancing signaling. The failure of β2-AR to increase contractility in TG4 heart has been explained by the coupling of the receptor to Gi proteins (5.Xiao R-P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y-Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The loss of β1-AR contractile response in TG4 heart appears to be independent of either Gi or βARK1 activation (Figs. 2 and 3). In contrast, pre-activation of Gi proteins by CCh selectively revitalizes the β1-AR contractile response in TG4 heart. Similarly, the desensitization of β1-AR induced by the acute overexpression of β2-AR in vitro is also fully rescued by CCh pretreatment. Since β1-AR desensitization is accompanied by an enhanced cAMP accumulation, and conversely, its rescue by CCh is associated with a reduction in basal cAMP level, we conclude that the loss of β1-AR contractile response in cells overexpressing β2-AR is attributable largely to the cAMP/PKA-mediated heterologous receptor desensitization. Further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which CCh and ICI rescue the desensitized β1-AR, e.g. a reduction in basal β1-AR phosphorylation, or a translocation of the receptors from cytoplasmic pools to sarcolemmal membrane.Additionally, incubation cells with CCh or ICI only partially restores the β1-AR-mediated positive inotropic effect in TG4 ventricular myocytes. The maximal contractile response induced by β1-AR stimulation in CCh-treated cells is still lower than that induced by β1-AR stimulation in WT myocytes (Fig. 1) or by the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, in TG4 cells (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, CCh fully rescues the β1-AR signaling in WT myocytes overexpressing the human β2-AR (Fig. 6 D). These results suggest that additional unidentified mechanisms might be involved in the diminution of β1-AR contractile response in TG4 cardiac myocytes,e.g. reduction in β1-AR density (β1-AR down-regulation), or a dislocation between β1-ARs and downstream signaling molecules, reducing the signal transmission efficiency. Unfortunately, a direct view of β1-AR subcellular distribution or a measurement of the receptor density is technically impossible due to the vast overexpression of β2-ARs and the absence of absolutely selective β1-AR ligands.Finally, the present findings may have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications. In light of distinct mechanisms underlying β1-AR and β2-AR desensitization and their G protein coupling, the defects of β1-AR versusβ2-AR subtype signaling in the failing heart may be mediated by different cellular pathways. Under certain circumstances, blunted β-AR responsiveness is, at least in part, due to receptor desensitization. For example, the diminished β1-AR contractile response in chronic heart failure is associated with enhanced circulating catecholamine levels (21.Kiuchi K. Shannon R.P. Komamura K. Cohen D.J.

Med. 1982; 307: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). To resensitize these receptor functions, a new strategy might involve activation of Gi-coupled receptors to a critical level that is sufficient to rescue or prevent receptors from desensitization but not to directly antagonize the β-AR-Gs-mediated positive inotropic effects, as demonstrated in the present study. In addition to traditional pharmacological approaches, mouse genomic manipulation has opened new avenues of investigations of transmembrane signal transduction, particularly those signals mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Owing to the critical role of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)1 in cardiac functional regulation, several transgenic and gene-targeted mouse models have been recently developed to alter β-AR signaling components (1.Koch W.J. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One such model that has drawn substantial attention is the transgenic mouse overexpressing the human β2-AR in a cardiac-specific manner (TG4 mice) (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In this model, due to the presence of spontaneously activated β2-ARs (designated as R*s), multiple components of base-line cardiac function, including heart rate, the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca]i) transient, and contractility, are substantially enhanced relative to those of wild type (WT) littermates (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3.Bond R.A. Leff P.

It has been suggested that this constitutive β2-AR stimulation may provide a novel mechanism for the inotropic support of the end stage, dilated, chronically failing heart (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F.

Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), in which agonist-mediated β-AR contractile response is markedly diminished. Surprisingly, in the context of substantially enhanced constitutive β2-AR stimulation, acute administration of either β1-AR or β2-AR agonists fails to elicit any contractile or chronotropic response in the intact animals (4.Du X.J. Vincan E. Woodcock D.M. Milano C.A. Dart A.M. Woodcock E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H630-H636PubMed Google Scholar), isolated hearts, (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R.

The loss of β-AR responsiveness had initially been interpreted to indicate a saturation in contractility caused by the constitutive β2-AR signaling (2.Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C.

Our more recent studies, however, have demonstrated that this is not the case, because TG4 ventricular myocytes still respond to a direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin (5.Xiao R-P.

In NCT2544 keratinocytes, UTP and a proteinase-activated receptor-2 agonist caused similar inhibition, but in 13121N1 cells, transfected with the human P2Y2 or P2Y4receptor, UTP stimulated JNK and p38 MAP kinase activities. This suggests that the effects mediated by P2Y receptors are cell-specific. The inhibitory effects of UTP were not due to induction of MAP kinase phosphatase-1, but were manifest upstream in the pathway at the level of MEK-4. The inhibitory effect of UTP was insensitive to the MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059, changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, or pertussis toxin. Acute phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment also inhibited TNFα-stimulated SAP kinase activity, while chronic pretreatment reversed the effects of UTP.

These effects are mediated through two receptor subfamilies that are structurally distinct: ligand-gated cation channel P2X receptors and the heptahelical, G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors (4.North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Five mammalian P2Y receptors have been cloned to date (P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, 11), and each has a distinct pharmacological profile for the endogenous agonists ATP, UTP, ADP, and UDP (5.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson Jr., J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht/Boston/London1998: 181-205Google Scholar, 6.King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A.

In endothelial and smooth muscle cells, P2Y receptors mediate activation of many protein kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC)1 isoforms, homologues of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/44 MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, focal adhesion kinase pp125 fak, and related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (7.Purkiss J.R.

Activation of these kinases may underlie the sustained effects of ATP and UTP in smooth muscle and endothelial cells, such as increased cell proliferation (3.Boarder M.R. Hourani S.M.O.

However, another potential pro-mitogenic effect of UTP and ATP may be to prevent the pro-apoptotic actions of cytokines in cells where P2Y and cytokine receptors are co-expressed. A number of studies have shown that growth factors, in particular insulin-like growth factor-1, can negatively regulate the stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases JNK and p38 MAP kinase through activation of p42/44 MAP kinase (17.Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14560-14565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

However, to date no study has identified a similar role for G-protein-coupled receptors, which in many cells are linked to increases in JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity (20.Coso O.A. Chiarello M.

In this study we examined the effect of P2Y receptor stimulation upon tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated SAP kinase activity in endothelial cells. Rather than activating SAP kinases, as shown in other cell types (9.Huwiler A. van Rossum G. Wartmann M. Pfeilshifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), UTP and ATP caused a marked inhibition of TNFα-stimulated JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity. This effect, which was cell type-specific, was not mediated by p42/44 MAP kinase, nor intracellular Ca2+, but required activation of atypical Ca2+-independent isoforms of PKC. This is the first study to identify such an action of a P2Y receptor. The plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the GST-tagged truncated N terminus of c-Jun (GST-c-Jun5–89) was donated by J. R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada). The GST-tagged MAPKAP kinase-2 vector was a gift from C. J. Marshall (Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London). The MAPKAP kinase-2 antibody and the KKLNRTLSVA peptide substrate were gifts from P. Cohen (Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee, Scotland). We thank these people for their gifts. The JNK-1, p38 MAP kinase, and MEK-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-MEK4 and -MEK3/6 antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), PD 098059, Ro318220, Go6983, GF109203X, TNFα, (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Nottinghamshire, UK), reporter antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products, Hertfordshire, UK) were all of the highest commercial grade available. The human-derived EAhy926 endothelial cell line (23.Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT supplement), 27 mg/ml glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (250 units/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1, v/v). Experiments were performed in cells grown to confluence on 6-cm2 plates. 13121N1 cells expressing the human P2Y2 or P2Y4receptor were obtained from and cultured as described previously (24.Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). NCTC2544 keratinocytes expressing a functional human proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) were established in our laboratory by standard methods. Western blotting of p42/44 MAP kinase using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted as outlined previously (25.Malarkey K. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2267-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All antibodies were titered for optimum conditions. For immunoprecipitation of MEK-4, equal amounts of precleared cell lysates were incubated in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and with 1 μg/ml MEK-4 antibody, precoupled to protein G, for 3 h. Lysates were recovered by sequential washes in solubilization buffer and in the same buffer lacking detergents. Precipitates were assessed for either MEK-4 or phospho-MEK-4 content using Western blotting. To measure JNK activity, cells were stimulated as appropriate and the reaction terminated by rapid aspiration and the addition of ice-cold PBS. The cells were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.7, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and supernatants incubated with 5 μg of GST-c-Jun-(5–89) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were then washed three times in solubilization buffer and twice in 25 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNaV3O4, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Precipitates were then incubated with the same buffer containing 25 μm/1 μCi of ATP/[γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 30 μl for 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 × SDS-sample buffer and aliquots of each sample subjected to electrophoresis on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was then determined by autoradiography. For p38 MAP kinase activity, a procedure identical to that outlined above was employed except that the pH of the solubilization buffer was modified to pH 7.4. Full-length MAPKAP kinase-2 was used in the precipitation step, and the kinase buffer employed for the phosphorylation reaction was pH 7.4. MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in immunoprecipitates was determined by measuring incorporation of [γ-32P]phosphate into the substrate peptide KKLNRTLSVA as outlined previously (26.Stokoe D. Cauldwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 842-849Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were stimulated as appropriate, and the reaction terminated by rapid aspiration and the addition of PBS. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (20 min). After washing three times with PBS, the reaction was quenched (50 mm NH4Cl/PBS, 10 min). Following a further three washes, cells were incubated in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 4 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by washing three times in PBS, goat serum, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin for 5 min and three times in PBS. The relevant antibody was diluted as appropriate and placed on coverslips for 60 min. Coverslips were washed as outlined above and then incubated with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody, washed, and then fixed. Coverslips of fixed cells were imaged using a Zeiss 4 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope operating in confocal mode using either 40×, 63×, or 100× Plan-APOCHROMAT 1.4 NA oil-immersion objectives. Images were collected using a 488-nm laser and a long 510-nm filter set. Data files were saved in TIF format and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Initially, we examined the effects of UTP (30 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) upon TNFα-stimulated signaling events in EAhy926 cells. Preincubation with either agent for 60 min inhibited TNFα (20 ng/ml)-induced activation of both JNK and p38 MAP kinase by about 80% (Fig. 1). When sorbitol (0.5 m) was used as the stimulant, forskolin and UTP were both less effective, only producing about 50% inhibition. ATP (30 μm) also inhibited TNFα-induced SAP kinase activity, but UDP (30 μm) and EGF (100 nm) were ineffective. UTP had no effect upon the increase in IKKα activity or loss in IκBα expression evoked by TNFα (not shown), indicating that the site of inhibition of SAP kinase activity by UTP is downstream of the NFκB signaling cascade. UTP also inhibited enzyme activity downstream of p38 MAP kinase. Both sorbitol and TNFα increased MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in EAhy926 cells by 3–5-fold (Table I). Preincubation with UTP or ATP (30 μm) reduced the increase by over 80% (Table I). Forskolin (10 μm) only inhibited the TNFα-induced increase in MAPKAP kinase-2 activity by about 30% and had little effect on the sorbitol-induced activity. This is much less than the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by forskolin and may be due to an indirect stimulation of MAPKAP kinase-2 by cAMP-raising agents. 2S. Wilson, A. Paul, and R. Plevin, unpublished data.Table IEffect of UTP and forskolin on sorbitol- and TNFα-stimulated MAPKAP kinase-2 activityAgonistMAPKAPK-2 activityPretreatmentInhibition of agonist stimulation-fold stimulation%TNF-α5.1 ± 0.8UTP94.5 ± 1.0ATP83.5 ± 9.3Forskolin29.2 ± 12.8Sorbitol3.217 ± 1.5UTP86.8 ± 13.1ATP90.3 ± 4.8Forskolin4.1 ± 2.0EAhy926 cells were incubated with 30 μm UTP, 30 μm ATP, or 10 μm forskolin for 30 min before stimulation for a further 30 min with 20 ng/ml TNFα or 0.5m sorbitol.

Each value is the mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. The similar effects of UTP and ATP, but not UDP, on TNFα-stimulated SAP kinase activity suggested that P2Y2 and/or P2Y4 receptors (5.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson Jr., J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht/Boston/London1998: 181-205Google Scholar, 6.King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) could be present in EAhy926 cells. To characterize the interaction of these receptors with SAP kinases, we used 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells expressing recombinant human P2Y2 or P2Y4 receptors. However, in these cells, UTP (1–30 μm) stimulated both JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity by 3–5-fold and did not inhibit TNFα-mediated increases in SAP kinase activity over the micromolar range (Fig.2, panels A and B). In other respects these cells were like EAhy926 cells in that UTP (30 μm) evoked both [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation (10–20-fold) and MAP kinase activation (not shown). In another cell line, NCTC2544 keratinocytes, UTP (30 μm) inhibited the TNFα-stimulated increase in JNK activity, and this was mimicked by the PAR-2 peptide SLIGKV (200 μm) (Fig. 2,panel C). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of UTP may be cell type-specific. Next, several possible mechanisms of inhibition for UTP were examined. We have shown previously that UTP stimulates the induction of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in EAhy926 cells (10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated if JNK and p38 MAP kinase are co-localized with MKP-1. UTP (30 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) substantially induced MKP-1, and this, as expected, was restricted to the nucleus (Fig. 3). However, JNK was evenly distributed throughout the cell, but p38 MAP kinase was restricted to the cytosol and TNFα did not evoke relocation of either to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 4). Thus, dephosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and JNK by MKP-1 is unlikely to play a role in the inhibitory actions of UTP.Figure 4Subcellular distribution of JNK and p38 MAP kinase following exposure to TNFα. EAhy926 cells were incubated with vehicle control (panels A andB), 20 ng/ml TNFα for 30 min (panels C andD), or UTP for 30 min followed by TNFα for 30 min (panels E and F) and then assessed for JNK (panels A, C, E) or p38 MAP kinase (panels B,D, and F) fluorescence. Each panel is representative of at least three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data showing that the site of inhibition of p38 MAP kinase and JNK in EAhy926 cells is likely to be upstream of JNK are shown in Fig.5. Immunoblotting with phospho-JNK antibodies (Fig. 5, panel A) showed a similar pattern of UTP mediated inhibition of TNFα-stimulated JNK activation (p46 and 54 isoforms) and confirmed initial experiments using solid phase assays. In addition, activation of the signaling cascade at the level upstream of JNK was estimated using antibodies specific for phospho-MEK-4 (Fig.5, panel B). Using this method we found that preincubation with either UTP or ATP strongly inhibited TNFα-stimulated MEK-4 phosphorylation. This was not due to effects upon the recovery of MEK-4, which was found to be similar throughout each stimulation. Additional experiments using a phospho-MEK3/6 antibody showed a similar phenomenon (not shown) although the quality of the antibody precluded a more detailed analysis. The UTP-mediated inhibition of TNFα-stimulated SAP kinase activity was very rapid (Fig. 6). Preincubation with UTP (30 μm) for as little as 5 min prior to TNFα addition, or even simultaneous administration, essentially abolished the TNFα-induced increase in JNK activity over 30 min. Addition of UTP after TNFα had stimulated JNK still resulted in a substantial inhibition, which was only overcome after 15–25 min. A similar time course of inhibition was observed for p38 MAP kinase (not shown). These results confirm the unlikeliness of an inducible phosphatase playing a role in the negative regulation of SAP kinase activity by UTP. The next experiments were designed to determine which UTP-mediated signaling events are important for the inhibition of SAP kinase activity. Pertussis toxin pretreatment did not affect the inhibitory actions of UTP on JNK activity (not shown), ruling out a Gi2 protein-dependent mechanism. Preincubation with the MAP kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) inhibitor PD 098059 (50 μm) (27.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 28.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1996; 318: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 30 min prior to addition of UTP, prevented the UTP-stimulated increase in p42/44 MAP kinase activity, as estimated by MAP kinase gel-shift analysis (Fig. 7, panel A). However, PD 098059 did not substantially reverse the inhibitory effects of UTP upon TNFα-stimulated JNK or p38 MAP kinase activity (Fig. 7, panels B and C). This suggests that MAP kinase kinase-1 is not involved in the inhibitory actions of UTP. Consistent with this conclusion, EGF (100 nm) strongly stimulated p42/44 MAP kinase, but did not inhibit either SAP kinase (not shown). UTP is known to mobilize Ca2+ in endothelial cells and so the role of Ca2+ was investigated. Bathing EAhy926 cells in Ca2+-free medium and BAPTA-AM (50 μm) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of UTP upon TNFα-stimulated JNK activity (Fig. 8, panel A). Furthermore, the Ca2+ ionophore A23178 (1 μm) strongly stimulated rather than inhibited JNK activity, such that JNK activity increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching a peak within 30 min at some 8–10-fold of basal values (Fig. 8,panel B). A23178 was additive with TNFα in stimulating JNK activity. Finally, a possible role of PKC in the inhibitory actions of UTP was investigated. Acute incubation with the PKC activator PMA (100 μm) substantially inhibited the TNFα-induced JNK activation in a manner similar to that observed for UTP (Fig.9, panel A), while chronic pretreatment with PMA partially reversed the inhibitory effects of UTP upon TNFα-stimulated JNK activity (Fig. 9, panel B). Consequently, we examined the effect of several PKC inhibitors upon TNFα-stimulated JNK activity (Fig.10). GF109203X (500 nm) reversed PMA-mediated inhibition of TNFα-stimulated JNK activity, but did not modify the inhibitory effects of UTP (Fig. 10, panel A). In contrast, preincubation with Ro318220 (1 μm) and Go6983 (1 μm) resulted in a total reversal of the inhibitory effects of UTP (Fig. 10, panels B andC).Figure 10The effect of PKC inhibitors upon UTP-mediated inhibition of TNFα-stimulated JNK activity in EAhy926 cells. Cells were incubated with 500 nm GF109203X (GF) (panel A), 1 μm Ro318220 (panel B), or 1 μmGo6983 (Go) (panel C) for 30 min before addition of 100 nm PMA (P) or 30 μm UTP (U) for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 20 ng/ml TNFα (T) for a further 30 min. Samples were then assayed for JNK activity. Each autoradiograph is representative of four individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we have identified a novel mechanism of cross-talk regulation between the P2Y receptor and TNFα receptor signaling pathways in endothelial cells. UTP exerted a strong inhibitory effect upon TNFα- and sorbitol-stimulated JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity, an effect that was also seen downstream of p38 MAP kinase, at the level of MAPKAP kinase-2. It has been shown recently that UTP and other G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as thrombin and angiotensin II, can stimulate both JNK and p38 MAP kinase in a number of cell types (20.Coso O.A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first study to identify an inhibitory action of a G-protein-coupled receptor, the P2Y receptor, upon TNFα-stimulated SAP kinase activation. In these experiments, ATP had similar effects to UTP, but UDP was inactive. This rules out the P2Y6 subtype as the site of action, as UDP is the most potent agonist at this receptor (5.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson Jr., J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht/Boston/London1998: 181-205Google Scholar, 6.King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). UTP is not an agonist at the P2Y1 and P2Y11subtypes (5.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson Jr., J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht/Boston/London1998: 181-205Google Scholar, 6.King B.F. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that the responses seen here are mediated via the P2Y2 and/or P2Y4 subtypes, consistent with our previous studies in EAhy926 cells (8.Graham A. McLees A. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). (Note that although ATP is not an agonist per se at the human P2Y4receptor, in a static culture system as used here, it can donate a phosphate group to endogenous UDP to produce UTP, which will activate the P2Y4 receptor (see Refs. 30.Kennedy C. Herold C.L. Qi A. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 21PGoogle Scholar and 31.Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At present, it is difficult to differentiate pharmacologically between the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors due to the lack of selective ligands. Also, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that more than one P2Y receptor subtype is expressed in EAhy926 cells and that UTP and ATP act at separate sites. UTP also inhibited the TNFα-induced responses in NCTC2544 keratinocytes. However, in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the recombinant human P2Y2 or P2Y4receptors, we found that UTP alone significantly increased JNK activity and failed to reverse TNFα-mediated SAP kinase activation. This suggests that the effects mediated by P2Y receptors are dependent upon the cell type under study and that the P2Y receptor in EAhy926 cells and NCTC2544 keratinocytes couples to additional components. In support of this idea, the inhibitory effect of UTP is seen at lower concentrations (IC50 ∼1 μm) than we and others have previously observed for P2Y receptor-mediated excitatory responses, including activation of p42/44 MAP kinase (8.Graham A. McLees A. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13.Soltoff S.P. Avraham H. Avraham S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and generation of [3H]inositol phosphates (not shown). We sought to identify the site(s) and mechanism(s) responsible for the inhibitory action of UTP. One possibility was a role for an inducible MAP kinase phosphatase, in particular MKP-1, which we have shown previously to be induced by UTP and forskolin in EAhy926 cells (10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the data did not support such a role. Agonist-stimulated MKP-1 expression was located exclusively in the nucleus, while p38 MAP kinase was restricted to the cytosolic compartment and JNK was distributed evenly across the cell. TNFα and UTP did not evoke translocation of either SAP kinase to the nucleus. This was not due to a general lack of cellular responsiveness, as nuclear translocation of p42/44 MAP kinase was observed following stimulation with PMA 3C. M. J. Robinson and R. Plevin, unpublished data. and suggests that the normal inducible nuclear phosphates MKP-1 and MKP-2, which regulate JNK and p38 MAP kinase within the nucleus (10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32.Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), are not involved in the inhibitory actions of UTP. It may be that other cytosolic MAP kinase phosphatases which display substrate specificity for JNK and p38 MAP kinase, such as M3/6 and MKP-5 (33.Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U.

Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), are involved in the negative regulation of SAP kinases. However, we found that the site of action of UTP was upstream of JNK and p38 MAP kinase, at the level of MEK or above. Inhibition of TNFα-stimulated MEK-4 activation by UTP implies that dephosphorylation at serine and threonine of MEKs or MEKKs, possibly by PP2A (33.Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), or uncoupling of the pathway further upstream is a far more likely mechanism of action. This study showed that several intracellular signaling pathways activated by UTP via P2Y receptors are not involved in its inhibitory effects. p42/44 MAP kinase is activated strongly by UTP in EAhy926 cells (8.Graham A. McLees A. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the inhibition of JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity in other cell types. However, the MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059, at concentrations that abolished MAP kinase activity (27.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 28.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1996; 318: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), failed to reverse the effects of UTP upon JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, EGF, a robust activator of the MAP kinase cascade (35.Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 36.Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), did not mimic the inhibitory effects of UTP. The lack of effect of EGF also argued against a role for growth factor-mediated tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases in the inhibition of TNFα-stimulated SAP kinase activation. Similarly, we found no evidence for the involvement of a Ca2+-dependent mechanism in the inhibitory effects of UTP. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ and buffering of intracellular Ca2+ did not suppress the UTP inhibition of TNFα-evoked increased in JNK activity. Also, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by A23187 gave a strong and rapid stimulation of JNK activity. This suggest that the normal cellular mechanisms by which Ca2+ can increase JNK activity are present in EAhy926 cells. This contrasts with the finding that in cells transfected with the P2Y2 receptor, UTP evokes large increases in inositol trisphosphate and intracellular Ca2+levels (37.Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and increases JNK activity. Furthermore, previous studies have shown JNK activation by G-protein-coupled receptor agonists to be Ca2+-dependent (38.Mitchell F.M. Russell M. Johnson G.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39.Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), further arguing against a role for Ca2+ in inhibitory effects of UTP. While the inhibitory effects of forskolin imply a role for cAMP-dependent signaling events in the inhibitory effects of UTP, our previous study (10.Graham A. McLees A. Malarkey K. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that UTP does not increase cAMP in EAhy926 cells. Thus, forskolin and UTP may act by different mechanisms to inhibit SAP kinases. The present studies have revealed one such potential mechanism for UTP, involving PKC. Short term incubation with PMA mimicked the actions of UTP upon TNFα-stimulated JNK activity, while chronic pretreatment partially reversed the inhibitory action of UTP. This suggests a role for DAG-sensitive, Ca2+-independent isoforms of PKC. We showed previously that EAhy926 cells express the PKCα (Ca2+-dependent) and PKCε (Ca2+-independent) isoforms that are down-regulated by chronic PMA treatment (8.Graham A. McLees A. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As the inhibitory effects of UTP are independent of Ca2+, this clearly suggests that PKCε is the more likely to be involved or possibly PKCδ, which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by UTP in PC12 cells (13.Soltoff S.P. Avraham H. Avraham S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2653-2660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both possibilities were supported by the effects of PKC inhibitors. Ro318220, a nonselective PKC inhibitor (40.Hoffman J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), fully reversed the effect of UTP. GF109203X, at a concentration (500 nm) that is relatively selective for Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (41.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier P. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Martiny-Barony G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on UTP, but did reverse the inhibitory effect of PMA. Furthermore, GF109203X, at higher concentrations (3–10 μm) that are likely to also inhibit PKCε (42.Martiny-Barony G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reversed the effects of UTP (not shown). At present we cannot rule out that other PMA-insensitive PKC isoforms are also involved, in particular atypical isoforms such as PKCζ, which is reported to be sensitive to Ro318220 in some cell types (43.Mita D. Stenmark K.R. Ruff L.J. Dempsey E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1276-L1284PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting this possibility is our finding that Go6893, which also inhibits PKCζ (44.Gschwendt M. Dietrich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), also reversed the inhibitory effects of UTP. If PKCζ is present in EAhy926 cells and also involved in the inhibitory actions of UTP, then this may explain why the effect of PMA has a slower onset and is a less effective inhibitor of the SAP kinase responses than UTP. Alternatively, it may be that other PKC-independent mechanisms are also involved and PKC only plays a conditional role in the inhibitory effects of UTP. The involvement of PKC isoforms in the inhibition of JNK activity distinguishes our findings from recent studies in other cells types. For example PKCβ stimulates SAP kinase activity in U-937 and HL60 cells (45.Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yoshida K. Takekawa M. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in the EAhy926 line used in this present study, PKCβ isoforms are poorly expressed (8.Graham A. McLees A. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell-specific expression of PKC isoforms may dictate which effects are manifest upon SAP kinase signaling. In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism of cross-talk regulation between the P2Y receptor and TNFα receptor signaling pathways in endothelial cells, involving PKC. Activation of the recombinant human PAR-2 receptor expressed in NCTC2544 keratinocytes also suppressed TNFα receptor-mediated increases in SAP kinase activity. This suggests that such cross-talk can occur for other G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2058231188,"The mechanism of thiol modulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase by Escherichia coli thioredoxin was investigated in the isolated ATPase subcomplex and in the ATP synthase complex reconstituted in bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes. Thiol modulation was resolved kinetically by continuously monitoring ATP hydrolysis by the isolated subcomplex and ATP synthesis by proteoliposomes. The binding rate constant of reduced thioredoxin to the oxidized ATPase subcomplex devoid of its ε subunit could be determined. It did not depend on the catalytic turnover. Reciprocically, the catalytic turnover did not seem to depend on thioredoxin binding. Thiol modulation by Trx of the ε-bearing ATPase subcomplex was slow and favored the release of ε. The rate constant of thioredoxin binding to the membrane-bound ATP synthase increased with the protonmotive force. It was lower in the presence of ADP than in its absence, revealing a specific effect of the ATP synthase turnover on thioredoxin-γ subunit interaction. These findings, and more especially the comparisons between the isolated ATPase subcomplex and the ATP synthase complex, can be interpreted in the frame of the rotational catalysis hypothesis. Finally, thiol modulation changed the catalytic properties of the ATP synthase, the kinetics of which became non-Michaelian. This questions the common view about the nature of changes induced by ATP synthase thiol modulation. The mechanism of thiol modulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase by Escherichia coli thioredoxin was investigated in the isolated ATPase subcomplex and in the ATP synthase complex reconstituted in bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes. Thiol modulation was resolved kinetically by continuously monitoring ATP hydrolysis by the isolated subcomplex and ATP synthesis by proteoliposomes. The binding rate constant of reduced thioredoxin to the oxidized ATPase subcomplex devoid of its ε subunit could be determined. It did not depend on the catalytic turnover. Reciprocically, the catalytic turnover did not seem to depend on thioredoxin binding. Thiol modulation by Trx of the ε-bearing ATPase subcomplex was slow and favored the release of ε. The rate constant of thioredoxin binding to the membrane-bound ATP synthase increased with the protonmotive force. It was lower in the presence of ADP than in its absence, revealing a specific effect of the ATP synthase turnover on thioredoxin-γ subunit interaction. These findings, and more especially the comparisons between the isolated ATPase subcomplex and the ATP synthase complex, can be interpreted in the frame of the rotational catalysis hypothesis. Finally, thiol modulation changed the catalytic properties of the ATP synthase, the kinetics of which became non-Michaelian. This questions the common view about the nature of changes induced by ATP synthase thiol modulation.

The catalytic sector F1, with subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε (stoichiometry α3β3γ1δ1ε1) is a water-soluble entity bearing catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites (for review, see Ref. 2.Boyer P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The X-ray structure of the major part of this subcomplex has been elucidated in the case of the bovine heart mitochondrial species (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). The F0 sector is membranous and forms a proton-channeling device converting the energy of the electrochemical proton gradient Δμ̃H+ into mechanical energy. In chloroplasts, it contains the four subunits I, II, III, and IV in the probable stoichiometry I1II1III9–12IV1. The number of c subunits (subunit III equivalent) per complex was recently found to be 10 in crystals of the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase (4.Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis probably results in the rotation of the γ subunit within the α3β3 crown (5.Aggeler R.

The whole F0F1 complex is thought to act as a rotatory proton-driven motor (for reviews, see Refs. 10.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

It has been known for many years that the electrochemical proton gradient is necessary to activate CF0CF1 in addition to supplying it with energy for ATP synthesis (12.Carmeli C. Lifshitz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13.Bakker-Grunwald T. Van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, reduction by a dithiol of a specific disulfide bridge located on the γ subunit (14.Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) diminishes the magnitude of the Δμ̃H+ required to activate the enzyme (15.Mills J.D. Mitchell P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 93-104Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16.Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This process is called thiol modulation. Thiol modulation itself is energy-dependent (13.Bakker-Grunwald T. Van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17.Ketcham S.R. Davenport J.W. Warncke K. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7286-7293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet possible to locate the two cysteines involved (γCys199-γCys205) in the tridimensional structure because the only F1 structure that has been published until now is that of the mitochondrial enzyme (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar, 4.Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), in which there is no domain homologous to that containing γCys199 and γCys205. In fact, these two cysteines are included in an insertion specific of CF1(18.Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 211-226Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In vivo, the γ subunit reduction is achieved via a thioredoxin (Trx) by electrons diverted from photosystem I (19.Mills J.D. Hind G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 547: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Mills J.D. Mitchell P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 75-82Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two different Trxs, called f and m, are present in chloroplasts. On the basis of slightly better catalytic efficiency, Trx f has been proposed to be the physiological reductant of CF1. However, Trx m is also able to reduce CF1 with a good efficiency (21.Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli Trx, which is more similar in primary structure to Trxm than to Trx f, is more efficient than the former toward CF1 reduction and has already been used for in vitro studies of its interaction with CF1(21.Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22.Galmiche J.-M. Girault G. Berger G. Jacquot J.-P.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding properties of E. coli Trx to the isolated CF1 subcomplex, devoid or not of its ε inhibitory subunit, and in different redox states, have been investigated using fluorescent techniques (23.Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The kinetics of thiol modulation of CF0CF1 by different Trxs in energized thylakoid membranes has been analyzed and the rate constant of binding determined in the presence of a high protonmotive force (21.Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the domain of interaction of CF1 with Trx belongs to the γ subunit, it is expected to rotate during the enzyme turnover. It is then of particular interest to study the Trx interaction in the isolated CF1 subcomplex and in the membrane-bound CF0CF1 and to investigate carefully the effect of the protonmotive force and of the enzyme turnover on this interaction. The present paper is a kinetic analysis of the interaction of E. coli Trx with isolated spinach CF1, devoid or not of the ε subunit, and with complete CF0CF1 reconstituted into liposomes. The role of different effectors was investigated. In the whole complex, but not in the isolated ATPase, the enzyme turnover proved to have a specific effect on this interaction, antagonistic to that exerted by the membrane energization. The consequences for the mechanism of thiol modulation were examined in relation to the rotatory mechanism hypothesis. The catalytic properties of oxidized and thiol-reduced CF0CF1 were also investigated, and it was shown that thiol modulation does not simply consist of an increase in the proportion of active ATP synthases at a given magnitude of the protonmotive force. The soluble chloroplast ATPase (CF1) was extracted from spinach(Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves and purified under its two forms, containing or not the ε subunit (24.Berger G. Girault G. André F. Galmiche J.-M. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1987; 10: 1507-1517Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption spectroscopy assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.48 cm2 mg−1 at 278 nm (25.Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The enzymes were stored at 5 °C in 34% ammonium sulfate. The CF0CF1 ATP synthase complex was extracted and purified from spinach leaves following the procedure described in Ref. 26.Fromme P. Boekema E. Gräber P. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 1239-1245Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar. Its concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent from Pierce. The purified complex was kept frozen in small vials under liquid nitrogen before use in reconstitution experiments. The E. coli thioredoxin overexpression plasmid pFPI (27.de Lamotte-Guéry F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used to transform a DH5a E. coli strain (Life Technologies). Protein purification to homogeneity was performed with 24-h bacterial cultures, essentially as described in (27.de Lamotte-Guéry F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The main steps were: disruption of bacteria with a French pressure cell, heat-shock (3 min, 80 °C), ammonium sulfate fractionation, size exclusion chromatography on G-50, and ion exchange on DEAE-Sephacel (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purple membrane fromHalobacterium salinarium was isolated according to Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius (28.Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 55: 364-372Google Scholar) and stored for months at −20 °C. Bacteriorhodopsin at a final concentration of 4–5 mg ml−1in the reconstitution buffer was monomerized by incubation in presence of 2% (31 mm) Triton X-100 for 20 h at 4 °C in the dark. The concentration was determined from the absorption at 560 nm (ε = 52, 800 m−1cm−1). Unilamellar liposomes were made by reverse-phase evaporation from a mixture of 18 mm egg phosphatidylcholine, 2 mm egg phosphatidic acid, and 11 mm cholesterol in the reconstitution medium containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.3, 50 mm Na2SO4, and 50 mmK2SO4. Then, 80 μl of 200 mg ml−1 Triton X-100 was mixed with 60 μg of CF0CF1. 2 min later, 100 μl of 4 mg ml−1 bacteriorhodopsin was added to the mixture, which was then supplemented with reconstitution buffer (final volume 1.5 ml). 0.5-ml liposomes were added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The detergent was then removed with three successive additions of SM-2 Bio-Beads (first one, 80 mg; second one, 80 mg 1 h later; third one, 160 mg 1 h after the second). Bio-Beads were then eliminated by rapid filtration on glass cotton. Proteoliposomes were stored on ice and in darkness. Their activity was stable for 1 day (for details, see Ref. 29.Pitard B. Richard P. Duñach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CF1 or CF1-ε was diluted at a concentration of 10 nm (unless otherwise indicated) or 1.3 nm, respectively, in a 1-ml spectrophotometric microcuvette, stirred, and thermostatted at 37 °C. The reaction medium (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-SO4, 40 mm KHCO3, pH 8.0, 4 mmMgSO4, 1 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.45 mmNADH, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. KHCO3 was omitted when indicated. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored continuously. The time response of the coupled system was checked by ADP injections. The ATPase reaction was triggered by injecting 2 mm MgATP in the reaction medium. For studies of the ATPase reduction by Trx, a small aliquot of Trx preincubated with 2 mm DTT was injected into the reaction medium supplemented with 0.1 mm DTT. In some experiments, prereduced Trx was injected in the reaction medium devoid of MgATP, and the reaction was initiated later by injecting ATP. The first 10 s following each addition were discarded in the data analysis. Proteoliposomes were diluted 4-fold in the reconstitution buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ADP, and 10 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate. The 0.4-ml sample was contained in a transparent vessel, stirred, and thermostatted at 20 °C. It was illuminated continuously with a strong yellow light, obtained by filtering the light produced by a halogen lamp (filter band pass 500–650 nm, beam intensity 1.5 kW m−2). After 10 min of illumination, ATP synthesis was initiated by adding 50 mm K2HPO4 preadjusted at pH 7.3. Small aliquots were taken up at different times, quenched with trichloroacetic acid, and assayed for ATP concentration using the luciferin-luciferase technique as in Ref. 29.Pitard B. Richard P. Duñach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. Energy-induced thiol modulation of CF0CF1 was carried out by adding 3 μm Trx and 0.1 mm DTT before starting the illumination. Experiments with NEM-inactivated Trx were carried out as follows. Trx and DTT were mixed in the reaction medium 10 min before the addition of 0.25 mm NEM. 5 min later, NEM was neutralized by the addition of 0.2 mm DTT. Liposomes were then added, illuminated, and assayed for ATP synthesis as described above. Thiol modulation of CF0CF1 by Trx in darkness was achieved as follows. Liposomes were diluted in the reaction medium containing 3 μm Trx and 0.1 mm DTT. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.25 mm NEM at a given time. 5 min later, 0.2 mm DTT was added to neutralize NEM, and the experiment of ATP synthesis was carried out as described above. Proteoliposomes were diluted 5-fold in the reconstitution buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented with 50 mm KH2PO4, 4 mmMgSO4, 10 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate, 4 mm glucose, 2 mm NADP+, 20 units/ml hexokinase, and 20 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The 1-ml sample was contained in a spectrophotometric microcuvette, stirred, and thermostatted at 20 °C. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored continuously. The time response and the proportionality between the rate of ATP production and the rate of NADP+ reduction were checked using myokinase at different concentrations in the presence of ADP and absence of diadenosine pentaphosphate. A small positive drift was detected in the absence of a known ATP-producing reaction. This drift was constant for 1 h; it did not depend on the presence of the liposomes and was not affected by the illumination. It was subtracted from the measured rates of NADP+ reduction. The sample was illuminated from the top of the cuvette with an optical fiber equipped with a yellow filter (filter band pass 500–650 nm, light intensity 0.8 kW m−2). The setup allowed injections into the cuvette to be made without interrupting the actinic light. The windows of the spectrophotometer were protected from the actinic light with highly selective filters transmitting at 340 nm. 10 min after the beginning of illumination, ATP synthesis was initiated by adding 1 mm MgADP to the liposome suspension. It was verified that the rate of ATP synthesis was practically constant for periods as long as 30 min. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min, and then prereduced Trx was added in the presence of 0.1 mm DTT. ATP synthesis was then followed for the required time. In some experiments, prereduced Trx was injected in the reaction medium devoid of MgADP, and the reaction was initiated later by injecting MgADP. In studies at variable ADP concentrations, successive additions of substrate were made, separated by 4–5-min intervals. The first 10 s following each addition were discarded in all data analysis. Proteoliposomes were diluted 20-fold in the reconstitution buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented with 50 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm MgADP (or 1 mm MgATP), and 4 μm 9-aminoacridine. The sample was contained in a fluorometric microcuvette, stirred, and thermostatted at 20 °C. Fluorescence (λexcitation = 400 nm, λemission = 450 nm) was recorded continuously. Illumination was provided by the same setup as for spectrophotometric measurements of ATP synthesis. 0.1 μm valinomycin was added during the illumination. Data were fitted to theoretical models by a nonlinear least squares iterative procedure based on Marquardt's algorithm, using Microcal Origin 5.0. All reagents were of analytical grade. Egg phosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidic acid were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. SM2 Bio-Beads came from Bio-Rad. FCCP, valinomycin, DTT, NEM, diadenosine pentaphosphate, and cholesterol were obtained from Sigma. ATP, ADP, P-enolpyruvate, NADH, NADP+, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Ltd. Hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Calbiochem. The ATP-monitoring kit came from Bio-Orbit. 9-Aminoacridine was purchased from Fluka. Fig. 1 shows how the rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by isolated, oxidized CF1-ε changes after the addition of prereduced Trx into the reaction medium (a, direct curves; b, first derivatives). The ATPase starts to increase immediately after the addition of Trx and reaches a stable new value after a few minutes. Kinetics such as those displayed in Fig. 1 b could be fitted satisfactorily with the equationV(t)=Veq+(V0−Veq)e−kapptEquation 1 where V(t) is the rate of ATP hydrolysis at a given time t after the addition of Trx,V 0 the rate of ATP hydrolysis at zero time (just before the addition of Trx), and V eq is the final rate of ATP hydrolysis. V 0 (as a control),V eq, and k app are plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of the concentration of reduced Trx. It can be seen thatV eq is practically independent of the concentration of reduced Trx. This indicates that thiol activation is irreversible under these conditions, as expected from the presence of 0.1 mm DTT to rereduce oxidized Trx (DTT alone did not reduce CF1-ε in this time range). The reduced form of CF1-ε has a catalytic turnover that is approximately doubled with respect to the oxidized form. Fig. 2 also shows thatk app is proportional to the concentration of reduced Trx, which demonstrates that the activation of CF1-ε here is kinetically controlled by the formation of the supercomplex between oxidized CF1-ε and reduced Trx. The slope of the plot gives the value of the rate binding constant (k on) of reduced Trx to oxidized CF1-ε,kapp=kon[Trxred]Equation 2 where [Trxred] is the concentration of reduced Trx. The value of k on here is 1.2 × 105m−1 s−1.Figure 2Rate of thiol modulation (panel a) and ATPase activities (panel b) of CF1-ε as a function of thioredoxin concentration. Conditions as in Fig. 1. Panel a, rate constant of CF1-ε activation (k app) as a function of the concentration of reduced Trx. k app was calculated from fits as those displayed in Fig. 1 a. The slope of the graph givesk on = 1.2 × 105m−1 s−1. Panel b, rate of ATP hydrolysis before the addition of Trx (▪) and extrapolated at infinite time after the addition of Trx (■). The latter (V eq) was calculated from the same fit ask app. These two rates represent the activity of fully oxidized and fully reduced CF1-ε, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data of Figs. 1 and 2 were obtained in the presence of 40 mm bicarbonate ions, which activate the isolated ATPase. We have repeated the experiments in the absence of bicarbonate. The ATPase activity of oxidized CF1-ε was diminished by about 80%, but the residual activity was still doubled by thiol modulation. The rate of formation of the CF1-ε·Trx supercomplex, as defined by the k on constant, was unchanged (results not shown). At first sight, this binding rate does not depend on the catalytic turnover rate of CF1-ε. We got more decisive evidence that the rate of formation of the supercomplex does not depend on the catalytic turnover. 25 nm reduced Trx was added to oxidized CF1-ε in the absence of ATP. The substrate was injected at different times after the addition of Trx, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured immediately after the addition of ATP. Fig.3, closed circles, shows how the initial rate of ATPase activity increases with the time of incubation of oxidized CF1-ε with reduced Trx. On the same graph is also displayed the continuous measurement of the ATPase activity after the addition of 25 nm reduced Trx in the presence of ATP. The two kinetics of activation are identical, showing that the working enzyme is reduced by Trx at the same rate as the resting enzyme. We have investigated the effect of the presence of the ε subunit on the rate of activation of CF1 by reduced Trx. Experiments were carried out exactly as previously, except that CF1 containing its inhibitory ε subunit was used. As expected, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the oxidized enzyme, before the addition of Trx, was very low and probably represents a small subpopulation of CF1-ε because intact CF1 has been proposed to be fully inactive (30.Duhe R.J. Selman B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31.Soteropoulos P. Süss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the addition of 2.5 μm reduced Trx, the rate of ATP hydrolysis increased progressively, and the kinetics of activation critically depended on the CF1 concentration (Fig.4 a). Because the activation was more pronounced at low CF1 concentrations, it can be deduced, in accordance with previous proposals (30.Duhe R.J. Selman B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31.Soteropoulos P. Süss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that the reduction of the γ subunit decreases the affinity of ε for the ATPase subcomplex. Fig. 4 b shows the specific ATPase activity before the addition of Trx and at the end of the activation process, as a function of the CF1 concentration. In the initially oxidized state, the activity is independent of the enzyme concentration, which confirms that it is probably due to a small fraction of ε-depleted enzymes. Comparison of this activity with that of the oxidized CF1-ε (Fig. 2 b) suggests that this fraction represents about 5% of the total. After reduction, the specific activity decreases with the CF1 concentration. The data could be correctly fitted with the equationV=VmKd2[Et]1+4[Et]Kd−1Equation 3 where V is the rate of ATP hydrolysis at a given ATPase concentration, K d is the dissociation constant of the ε subunit from the reduced ATPase complex, [Et ] the total concentration (CF1+ CF1-ε) of the ATPase complex, and V mis the specific activity of the CF1-ε complex. An equimolecular stoichiometry (i.e. one ε subunit/CF1-ε) was assumed, i.e. the 5% contribution of permanently ε-depleted CF1 was neglected. It was also assumed in Equation 3 that reduced CF1 bearing the ε subunit was inactive, in accordance with Soteropoulos et al. (31.Soteropoulos P. Süss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not with Andralojc and Harris (32.Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 403-407Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The fit givesV m = 61.8 ± 2.5 s−1 andK d = 4.4 ± 0.7 nm. However, the data could also be fitted satisfactorily by a model where the reduced CF1 had a significant activity. In this case, this activity was estimated to 5.6 ± 1.9 s−1, and the two other parameters became V m = 68.2 ± 3.9 s−1 and K d = 2.3 ± 0.7 nm. In both cases the specific activity of the reduced CF1-ε so extrapolated (V m) is close to the value determined in Fig. 2 b. The values of the dissociation constant determined here for the reduced form of CF1 are close that previously reported by Soteropouloset al. (K d = 4 nm) (31.Soteropoulos P. Süss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the complexity of the process of activation of intact oxidized CF1 by reduced Trx, it is not possible to describe its time course with simple kinetic equations. It is then difficult to know which steps limit the rate of formation of reduced CF1-ε from oxidized CF1 in the presence of reduced Trx. Since the rate of activation depends on CF1concentration even at the beginning of the kinetics (Fig.4 b), the dissociation and reassociation of the ε subunit are probably fast, and other factors probably control the rate of formation of reduced CF1-ε, among them the binding of reduced Trx to CF1. Fig. 4 c shows the kinetics of activation of 10 nm CF1 by reduced Trx at different concentrations (from 0.5 to 5 μm). It appears qualitatively that in this range, the concentration of Trx at least partially controls the rate of activation. In the initial phase of the kinetics, and for any Trx concentration below 3μm, the instantaneous rate of ATP hydrolysis was indeed a unique function of the (time × Trx concentration) product (not shown). The analysis of this function 2By plotting the expression log (V eq − V) as a function of the (time × Trx concentration) product, V eqbeing the final rate of ATP hydrolysis and V its instantaneous value, one obtains a linear graph, the slope of which is the binding rate constant k on. The linearity is observed here only at the beginning of the kinetics. In the case of isolated CF1-ε, the activation of which is monophasic, this analysis can be applied to the whole kinetics. It gives the same value of k on as that calculated from Equations 1and 2, which demonstrates its validity. allowed calculation of a gross value for the rate constant of binding of reduced Trx to oxidized CF1. It was estimated to be 3 × 103m−1 s−1, about 40 times lower than for CF1-ε. Fig. 5 ashows the light-induced formation of ATP driven by bacteriorhodopsin-CF0CF1 proteoliposomes, in control conditions or a few minutes after the addition of 3 μm reduced Trx prior to illumination.

We observed a strong correlation between P4H assembly competence and peptide binding; mutants of PDI that failed to form a functional P4H tetramer were also inactive in peptide binding. However, there was also a correlation between inactivity in these assays and indicators of conformational disruption, such as protease sensitivity.

Klappa P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. Harwood Academic Press, London1999: 437-459Google Scholar). A molecular interpretation of PDI activity is made difficult by the fact that PDI is multi-functional in the cell. In addition, it has a wide range of actions in vitro and consists of multiple domains. Furthermore, there is as yet no high resolution structure of full-length PDI. Current efforts are focused on analyzing the domain structure of PDI and in establishing the roles of specific domains in specific functional activities.It is now clear (2.Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3.Freedman R.B. Gane P.J. Hawkins H.C. Hlodan R. McLaughlin S.H. Parry J.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that PDI has a structural organization based on duplicated sequence modules (Fig. 1). The full-length protein is constructed of four structural domains with homologous thioredoxin folds plus a C-terminal acidic extension. The homologous a and a′ sequence modules contain the active site motif -WCGHC- and show significant sequence identity to thioredoxin; a high resolution NMR analysis of the recombinanta domain confirms that it has the thioredoxin fold. The homologous b and b′ modules do not show significant sequence similarity to the a domain, but NMR analysis has revealed that the b domain also exhibits the thioredoxin fold (2.Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4.Kemmink J. Dijkstra K. Mariani M. Scheek R.M. Penka E. Nilges M. Darby N.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of the properties of individual domains as catalysts of simple thiol:disulfide oxidoreduction and of more complex protein folding linked to disulfide isomerization shows that the a and a′ domains function effectively as simple thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases but that the remaining domains are required for full activity in catalyzing protein folding associated with the formation of native disulfide bonds (5.Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). No specific function has yet been ascribed to the b domain, but cross-linking studies demonstrate that the b′ domain provides the principal peptide-binding site (6.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in catalyzing protein folding, PDI has also been described as the β-subunit of two hetero-oligomeric proteins, namely prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H) (7.Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and the microsomal triglyceride transferase complex (MTP) (8.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9801-9807Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 9.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MTP is obligatory for the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins, whereas P4H is important in the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagen in the endoplasmic reticulum (10.Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11.Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, both from attempts at reassociating these complexes after dissociation in vitro(11.Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar) and from studies on assembly of the complexes at biosynthesis, that PDI is required to prevent the aggregation of its partner subunits during either initial folding in the cell or refolding in vitro (12.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14.John D.C. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15.Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Ehnholm C. Shoulders C. Scott J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the β-subunit/PDI demonstrated that the active site cysteine residues of PDI were not essential for the assembly and activity of active P4H tetramer or of MTP (12.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15.Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Ehnholm C. Shoulders C. Scott J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The question then arises as to which domains or regions of PDI are involved in or required for its interaction with the other subunits in these hetero-oligomeric complexes. Analysis of deletion and point mutants of PDI recently demonstrated that the acidic C-terminal extension is not critical for the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI or for its ability to assemble into active P4H (16.Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, deletion and point mutations in the C-terminal end of the precedinga′ domain led to the identification of several residues that are apparently critical for the assembly of P4H.The interaction between PDI and the α-subunits of the P4H complex and MTP may be related to the interaction between PDI and the incompletely folded substrates on which PDI acts as an isomerase to facilitate folding and native disulfide bond formation. We have demonstrated previously that such misfolded protein substrates bind to PDI, and this binding is competitive with the binding of peptides; by using individual domains and truncated forms of PDI, we showed that theb′ domain constitutes the principal binding site for peptides but that additional domains are implicated in binding misfolded proteins (6.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).By using chemical cross-linking of a model peptide, we show here that mutations in the C-terminal part of the a′ domain, which affect the assembly of P4H, can also affect the peptide binding activity of PDI, a function associated with the b′ domain. We also demonstrate that the mutations influence the conformation and/or dynamics of the protein and infer that these changes in thea′ domain indirectly influence the binding properties of theb′ domain.DISCUSSIONA key issue in the molecular analysis of PDI is to understand its multifunctionality. In catalyzing protein folding associated with native disulfide bond formation, PDI acts on structured folding intermediates to facilitate disulfide isomerization linked to conformational change (21.Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22.Creighton T.E. Zapun A. Darby N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 18-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As a component of the P4H and MTP complexes its essential function appears to be to interact with nascent or newly synthesized α-subunits to prevent aggregation and maintain an active conformation. What these functions have in common is that PDI appears to interact with incompletely folded polypeptides, although the nature of these interactions is poorly understood.We have monitored the interaction of PDI with such polypeptides directly by cross-linking and have shown that the binding of these substrates is competitive with the binding of shorter unstructured peptides such as the 14-amino acid peptide Δ-somatostatin (20.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From studies with individual PDI domains and linked domain constructs, we demonstrated that the b′ domain forms the essential core of the binding site and is sufficient for the efficient binding of small peptides; fragments without the b′ domain did not show peptide binding (6.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The binding properties of the b′ domain for small peptides were identical to the properties observed for purified bovine PDI (20.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), i.e. the binding was reversible and sensitive to detergents. The addition of further domains is essential for the binding of more complex substrates, presumably by providing additional binding interactions.The working hypothesis derived from this work is that the peptide-binding site defines the core of a more extended site at which PDI binds its natural substrates for protein folding and possibly also the α-subunits of the P4H and MTP complexes.Although the principal peptide binding site of PDI lies within theb′ domain, it was noted recently that mutations in the C-terminal part of the a′ domain of human PDI affected the assembly into a functional P4H α2β2-tetramer. This clearly raises the question of whether the site of interaction between PDI and the α-subunit of the P4H tetramer is distinct from the peptide-binding site.To address this we investigated by chemical cross-linking the effects of various mutants in the C-terminal part of the a′ domain of recombinant human PDI with respect to peptide binding. This technique can be employed to study specific interactions between proteins available in small amounts without time-consuming purification steps. Model peptide substrates can be cross-linked to PDI and related proteins in the presence of crude cell extracts (23.Klappa P. Stromer T. Zimmermann R. Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as to purified bovine liver PDI. Cross-linking of model peptides and non-native proteins is specific, saturable, reversible, and independent of the presence of cysteine residues in the bound peptide (20.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Mutations in the C-terminal Part of the a′ Domain of PDI Affect Peptide BindingWe found that the 14-amino acid peptide Δ-somatostatin, after radiolabeling and precipitation, can be chemically cross-linked to wild type PDI and overexpressed in E. coli or Sf9 insect cells. Interestingly, we did not observe any interaction of Δ-somatostatin with endogenous insect PDI. When we compared our results obtained with Sf9 insect cells and E. coli lysates, we found them to be identical, i.e.mutants that showed peptide binding when expressed in Sf9 cells also exhibited peptide binding activity after expression in E. coli cells. Likewise, mutants that failed to bind the peptide in one cell lysate did not show peptide binding in the other cell lysate. We therefore conclude that both cell lysates are compatible with the peptide binding assay, leading to comparable and reproducible results.We observed that mutations in the C-terminal extension of PDI (465–491) or the deletion of this region did not affect the peptide binding activity. However, certain mutations in the precedinga′ domain, specifically all the deletion mutants from residues 436 to 454 and the point mutations F449R and L453E, were completely inactive with respect to peptide binding. There is no current high resolution structure for this domain, but modelling by homology to the a domain suggests that this region comprises a loop (434–442) and the C-terminal α helix (445–454) of thea′ domain. This result is consistent with recent observations that deletion of the entire C-terminal extension has no inhibitory effect on P4H assembly or function or on the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI (16.Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal α helix of thea′ domain seems to be a critical region for these functions (Table I). This was also confirmed by recent work of Dai and Wang who showed that truncation of the last 50 amino acids of PDI, comprising part of the C-terminal α helix of the a′ domain, led to inhibition of the chaperone and peptide binding activities (24.Song J. Quan H. Wang C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Our results clearly demonstrate that mutations in the C-terminal part of the a′ domain that interfere with the assembly of PDI into a functional α2β2 P4H tetramer also affect peptide binding. From this strong correlation we infer that the generation of a functional P4H tetramer requires the peptide-binding site of PDI.Peptide Binding Can Be Restored upon Removal of the Mutated a′ DomainAlthough the CD spectra of the point mutant F449R showed no major differences compared with wild type PDI (16.Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we noticed that this mutant was much more protease-sensitive than the wild type both in cell lysates and when probed by added protease. This clearly indicates that the replacement of phenylalanine 449 by an arginine leads to mobility and/or conformational changes that are not detected by CD spectra and that therefore may be fairly local. Protease treatment of the F449R mutant led to a fragment that co-migrated with thea-b-b′ domain construct of PDI and had the genuine N terminus of PDI. It appears probable that the F449R replacement destabilized the a′ domain, rendering this part of the molecule protease-sensitive. Indeed, structure predictions and homology modeling, based on the structure of the a domain suggest that the side chain of Phe449 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the molecule; replacement by Arg would be expected to have significant effects, whereas substitutions by Tyr and Trp would be more conservative.Once the protease-sensitive a′ domain was removed by treatment with Proteinase K, peptide binding could be restored to the residual a-b-b′ fragment. We therefore infer that the inhibition of peptide binding by mutations in the a′ domain is an indirect effect. Mutations in the a′ domain might induce subtle (but reversible) structural changes in the b′domain, leading to disruption of the peptide-binding site. Alternatively, the altered conformation of the mutated a′domain may physically prevent the reporter peptide from entering the peptide-binding site in the b′ domain. It is also possible that the mutated a′ domain mimics a misfolded polypeptide substrate on which PDI acts. This then would act as a ligand for binding by the peptide binding-site in the b′ domain. Such intramolecular interactions would have a high effective concentration, thus competing strongly for the binding of small peptides. All of the data presented here are fully consistent with the model for intramolecular occupancy of the peptide-binding site, but it should be noted that the F449R mutant shows no major differences in CD spectra to the wild type (16.Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The last two scenarios suggest that the a′ domain is in close proximity to the peptide-binding site in the b′domain, and this model could explain the results obtained previously by Noiva and co-workers (25.Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19645-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that a radiolabeled tripeptide could be cross-linked to residues within the C-terminal 50 amino acid residues of rat liver PDI (25.Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19645-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore assigned the peptide-binding site of rat liver PDI to the C terminus of thea′ domain. We speculate that the tripeptide may have bound to the peptide-binding site within the b′ domain and that cross-linking occurred to the C-terminal part of the a′domain, which is in close proximity to the peptide-binding site.From the results presented in this study it is tempting to speculate that there is a common polypeptide-binding site of PDI involved in all its functions. The b′ domain alone being essential and sufficient for the binding of small peptides, but a more extended region involving other domains is required for binding misfolded polypeptides and might be involved in the interaction between PDI and the α-subunit of P4H. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI),1 an abundant protein of the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, is a catalyst of disulfide bond formation and rearrangement in the course of protein folding (for review see Ref. 1.Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. Harwood Academic Press, London1999: 437-459Google Scholar). A molecular interpretation of PDI activity is made difficult by the fact that PDI is multi-functional in the cell. In addition, it has a wide range of actions in vitro and consists of multiple domains. Furthermore, there is as yet no high resolution structure of full-length PDI. Current efforts are focused on analyzing the domain structure of PDI and in establishing the roles of specific domains in specific functional activities. It is now clear (2.Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3.Freedman R.B. Gane P.J. Hawkins H.C. Hlodan R. McLaughlin S.H. Parry J.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that PDI has a structural organization based on duplicated sequence modules (Fig. 1). The full-length protein is constructed of four structural domains with homologous thioredoxin folds plus a C-terminal acidic extension. The homologous a and a′ sequence modules contain the active site motif -WCGHC- and show significant sequence identity to thioredoxin; a high resolution NMR analysis of the recombinanta domain confirms that it has the thioredoxin fold. The homologous b and b′ modules do not show significant sequence similarity to the a domain, but NMR analysis has revealed that the b domain also exhibits the thioredoxin fold (2.Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4.Kemmink J. Dijkstra K. Mariani M. Scheek R.M. Penka E. Nilges M. Darby N.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of the properties of individual domains as catalysts of simple thiol:disulfide oxidoreduction and of more complex protein folding linked to disulfide isomerization shows that the a and a′ domains function effectively as simple thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases but that the remaining domains are required for full activity in catalyzing protein folding associated with the formation of native disulfide bonds (5.Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). No specific function has yet been ascribed to the b domain, but cross-linking studies demonstrate that the b′ domain provides the principal peptide-binding site (6.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in catalyzing protein folding, PDI has also been described as the β-subunit of two hetero-oligomeric proteins, namely prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H) (7.Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and the microsomal triglyceride transferase complex (MTP) (8.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9801-9807Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 9.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MTP is obligatory for the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins, whereas P4H is important in the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagen in the endoplasmic reticulum (10.Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11.Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar) and from studies on assembly of the complexes at biosynthesis, that PDI is required to prevent the aggregation of its partner subunits during either initial folding in the cell or refolding in vitro (12.Vuori K.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the β-subunit/PDI demonstrated that the active site cysteine residues of PDI were not essential for the assembly and activity of active P4H tetramer or of MTP (12.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15.Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Ehnholm C. Shoulders C. Scott J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The question then arises as to which domains or regions of PDI are involved in or required for its interaction with the other subunits in these hetero-oligomeric complexes. Analysis of deletion and point mutants of PDI recently demonstrated that the acidic C-terminal extension is not critical for the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI or for its ability to assemble into active P4H (16.Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, deletion and point mutations in the C-terminal end of the precedinga′ domain led to the identification of several residues that are apparently critical for the assembly of P4H. The interaction between PDI and the α-subunits of the P4H complex and MTP may be related to the interaction between PDI and the incompletely folded substrates on which PDI acts as an isomerase to facilitate folding and native disulfide bond formation.

By using chemical cross-linking of a model peptide, we show here that mutations in the C-terminal part of the a′ domain, which affect the assembly of P4H, can also affect the peptide binding activity of PDI, a function associated with the b′ domain. We also demonstrate that the mutations influence the conformation and/or dynamics of the protein and infer that these changes in thea′ domain indirectly influence the binding properties of theb′ domain. DISCUSSIONA key issue in the molecular analysis of PDI is to understand its multifunctionality. In catalyzing protein folding associated with native disulfide bond formation, PDI acts on structured folding intermediates to facilitate disulfide isomerization linked to conformational change (21.Weissman J.S.

As a component of the P4H and MTP complexes its essential function appears to be to interact with nascent or newly synthesized α-subunits to prevent aggregation and maintain an active conformation. What these functions have in common is that PDI appears to interact with incompletely folded polypeptides, although the nature of these interactions is poorly understood.We have monitored the interaction of PDI with such polypeptides directly by cross-linking and have shown that the binding of these substrates is competitive with the binding of shorter unstructured peptides such as the 14-amino acid peptide Δ-somatostatin (20.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From studies with individual PDI domains and linked domain constructs, we demonstrated that the b′ domain forms the essential core of the binding site and is sufficient for the efficient binding of small peptides; fragments without the b′ domain did not show peptide binding (6.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The binding properties of the b′ domain for small peptides were identical to the properties observed for purified bovine PDI (20.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), i.e. the binding was reversible and sensitive to detergents. The addition of further domains is essential for the binding of more complex substrates, presumably by providing additional binding interactions.The working hypothesis derived from this work is that the peptide-binding site defines the core o"
https://openalex.org/W2093557800,"S100 family proteins are characterized by short individual N and C termini and a conserved central part, harboring two Ca2+-binding EF-hands, one of them highly conserved among EF-hand family proteins and the other characteristic for S100 proteins. In addition to Ca2+, several members of the S100 protein family, including S100A2, bind Zn2+. Two regions in the amino acid sequences of S100 proteins, namely the helices of the N-terminal EF-hand motif and the very C-terminal loop are believed to be involved in Zn2+-binding due to the presence of histidine and/or cysteine residues. Human S100A2 contains four cysteine residues, each of them located at positions that may be important for Zn2+ binding. We have now constructed and purified 10 cysteine-deficient mutants of human S100A2 by site-directed mutagenesis and investigated the contribution of the individual cysteine residues to Zn2+ binding. Here we show that Cys1(3) (the number in parentheses indicating the position in the sequence of S100A2) is the crucial determinant for Zn2+ binding in association with conformational changes as determined by internal tyrosine fluorescence. Solid phase Zn2+ binding assays also revealed that the C-terminal residues Cys3(87) and Cys4(94) mediated a second type of Zn2+binding, not associated with detectable conformational changes in the molecule. Cys2(22), by contrast, which is located within the first EF hand motif affected neither Ca2+ nor Zn2+ binding, and a Cys “null” mutant was entirely incapable of ligating Zn2+.

These and 13 of the S100 genes are clustered in the epidermal differentiation complex located on human chromosome 1 (1.Volz A. Korge B.P. Compton J.G. Ziegler A. Steinert P.M. Mischke D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding sites are well defined as two EF-hands. The C-terminal EF-hand follows the canonical consensus of the common EF hand motif, while the N-terminal one is S100-specific (2.Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 3.Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Although Zn2+ binding has been demonstrated unequivocally for several S100 proteins, including S100A2 (4.Franz C.

Biochem. 1998; 253: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In particular, molecular characterization has been hampered by the absence of a conserved cysteine- or histidine-containing Zinc-finger-like motif (10.Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recently, Brodersen and colleagues reported the crystal structures of the human S100A7 (psoriasin) dimer, both in the Zn2+-loaded and the free form and determined two zinc binding sites per dimer (11.Brodersen D.E. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). From their data, these authors further delineated two regions, one located in the first, variable EF-hand of one monomer and the second residing in the C terminus of the other monomer, which could function as potential ligands for zinc ions. Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding for wild type S100A2 and for mutants in which the EF-hands were substituted for parvalbumin EF-hands have been studied previously (4.Franz C. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18826-18834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of Zn2+ binding remained elusive. Human S100A2 protein has attracted particular interest based on its potential function as a tumor suppressor-related gene (12.Wicki R. Franz C. Scholl F.A. Heizmann C.W. Schäfer B.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on the observations that S100A2 expression is down-regulated in breast cancer (13.Lee S.W.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, localization studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the S100A2 protein is present in the nucleus in interphase cells (16.Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17.Mandinova A. Atar D. Schäfer B.W. Spiess M. Aebi U. Heizmann C.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human S100A2 harbors four cysteines, located at strategically interesting sites, that may be involved in Zn2+-binding. One cysteine residue, Cys1(3) (the number in parentheses indicating the position in the sequence of S100A2) is located at the very N terminus of the molecule. A cysteine at the same position has been proposed as a potential Zn2+ ligand in calcyclin (S100A6) by Kordowska et al. (9.Kordowska J. Stafford III, W.F. Wang C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The second cysteine, Cys2(22) resides within the first EF-hand. The first EF-hand of S100 proteins has only low affinity for Ca2+, is 2 amino acid residues longer than canonical EF-hands and, in the present case, contains a cysteine flanked by a highly conserved histidine residue. Moreover, the corresponding site in S100A7 seems to be involved in Zn2+ binding (11.Brodersen D.E. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The third and fourth cysteine in human S100A2, Cys3(87) and Cys4(94), are situated in the C terminus adjacent to the penultimate helix-loop-helix motif. In this region, histidine and cysteine residues are found in most human S100 proteins. Based on theoretical models (19.Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), NMR structures of the apo-form of related S100 family proteins, and sequence alignments (10.Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), these residues have been hypothesized to be ligands for Zn2+. In this study, we map the amino acids that can act as ligands for the zinc ion in S100A2 by site-directed mutagenesis and correlate the effects of the absence or presence of a single zinc-ligating amino acid with the binding characteristics of the wild type molecule. Serial substitutions of each of the four cysteines to serine residues did not alter the Ca2+-binding properties of human S100A2 but induced significant changes in the Zn2+ binding characteristics of the protein. In the wild type protein, Zn2+ binding induced conformational changes in the protein. In addition, the affinity for Zn2+ were raised 5-fold in the presence of Ca2+. In the absence of a conserved sequence motif that would provide all of the four necessary ligand amino acids for the Zn2+ ion, we hypothesize an involvement of the entire intact dimer to contribute to the Zn2+binding activity of S100A2. Analytical SDS gel electrophoresis on 10–26% gradient polyacrylamide minislab gels and Western blotting onto nitrocellulose (Hybond; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed essentially as described elsewhere (20.Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Transferred proteins were detected by incubation with a monoclonal anti-S100A2 antibody (SH-L1; Sigma) and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). S100A2 and cysteine-deficient mutants were cloned from a cDNA clone (ATCC number zo37194) into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the bacterial expression vector pMW 172 (21.Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A set of eight primers was used, allowing every possible combination of substituting one or more cysteines for serine by site-directed mutagenesis. The primers were as follows: 1, 5′-GAGAGAGACATATG ATGTGCAGTTCTCTG-3′; 2, 5′-GAGAGAGACATATGATGTCCAGTTCTCTG-3′; 3, 5′-CTACCTTCCACAAGTACTCCTCCCAAGAGG-3′; 4, 5′-GCTTGAACTTGTCACCCTCTTG GGAGGA-3′; 5, 5′-GAGAGAATTCAGGGTCGGTCTGGGCAGCCTTGGAAGAAGTCATTGGACAT-3′; 6, 5′-GAGAGAATTCAGGGTCGGTCTGGGGAGCCTTGGAAGAAGTCATTGGACAT-3′; 7, 5′-GAGAGAATTCAGGGTCGGTCTGGGGAGC-3′; 8, 5′-GAGAGAATTCAGGGTCGGTCTGGGCAGC-3′. All mutants in which the second cysteine (Cys2(22)) was substituted were cloned as follows. The N-terminal part and an overlapping C-terminal part of the molecule were amplified separately and then combined in a third step using the corresponding end primers. The clones used for expression of the recombinant proteins were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using a LI-Cor 400 automated sequencer (MWG Biotech) and selected for a maximum of expression by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli host strain BL-21. Purification was carried out according to a modified protocol by Becker et al. (22.Becker T. Gerke V. Kube E. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced at logarithmic growth by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After growth for an additional 3 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall GS-3 rotor at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer C1 (20 mmImodazole, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin) and opened with a French pressure cell (Spectronic Unicam, Cambridge, UK). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C1. Proteins were applied onto a Whatman DE-52 anion exchange column (60 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient from 20 mm to 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing recombinant S100A2 were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C1 containing 2 mm Ca2+, and applied onto a 10-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After elution of the recombinant protein with 4 mm EGTA, the protein was >90% pure. For further purification, the protein was applied to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech S100-HR gel filtration column (120 ml) in buffer C1. Mass spectra of wild type S100A2 or mutant proteins were generated on a PE SCIEX API 365 LC/MS/MS electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). The protein samples were dialyzed against water and diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in running medium containing 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid or 3 mm ammonium acetate. 20 μl of the protein solution were injected into the electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (ESI-MS)1 in the presence of 300 μm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2 or without metal ions. Sedimentation assays were carried out on a Beckmann Optima XL-1 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) centrifuge at 56,000 rpm and 20 °C using 0.3 mg/ml recombinant S100A2 in buffer C1 containing 2 mm Ca2+, 100 μm Zn2+, or 2 mm EDTA. The molecular mass of the complexes in solution (i.e. their oligomeric state) was analyzed as described earlier (23.Stafford III, W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24.Stafford III, W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The α-helical content of the protein and its change during Ca2+ binding were determined by measuring far-UV circular dichroism in a spectropolarimeter model 62D (Aviv Instruments, NJ). Spectra of 100 μm recombinant S100A2 in buffer C1 in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or Zn2+ were taken from 205 to 250 nm. Ellipticity θ at 222 nm is negative proportional to the α-helical content of the protein when normalized to the residue concentration (θMRW = θ0 × 115 g/mol/(1 mm × 1 mg/ml). Data were processed as described elsewhere (4.Franz C. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18826-18834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Internal tyrosine fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F2000 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi Instruments, CA) at room temperature and λext = 280 nm and λem = 260–360 nm. Emission scans were performed with 150 μm recombinant S100A2 in buffer C1 in the presence or absence of varying Ca2+-, Zn2+-, and EDTA concentrations. The maximum change in fluorescence at 315 nm was plotted as a function of the cation concentration against the fluorescence emission at 315 nm. Before the titrations, recombinant S100A2 and mutant proteins were reduced by an overnight incubation with 100 mm dithioerythritol in buffer C1 at room temperature followed by gel filtration on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with degassed buffer C1 lacking dithioerythritol. The amount of free sulfhydryl was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 412 nm after a 15-min incubation with 1 mm5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB). During the reaction with free sulfhydryl residues, an equivalent amount of 5-nitro-2-benzoate anions is released, which can be quantified by monitoring the absorption at 412 nm. The extinction coefficient of the reaction product is 13,600 OD/m × cm. The reactivity of the cysteine residues in dependence of metal binding was determined by measuring the change of the absorption at 412 nm with the time after the addition of 2 mm Ca2+, 40 μmZn2+, or 4 mm EDTA and 100 μmDTNB. All photometric measurements were carried out on a Hitachi U3000 Spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, CA). UV absorption spectra were scanned from 240 to 310 nm. The absorbance at 278 nm was used to calculate the sample concentration with ε10 g/liter = 3.03. 2–10 μg of the recombinant human S100A2 wild type or mutant proteins diluted in 20 μl of buffer C1 was spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (PALL, Linz, Austria), employing a vacuum dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). After 20 min of incubation, the blot was washed twice in buffer C1 while still in the apparatus and subsequently transferred to a Petri dish and equilibrated in metal binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). The membrane was then cut into strips (11 × 0.7 cm) containing 12 spots corresponding to the different mutant proteins (or protein concentrations) and incubated for 20 min in 2 ml of metal binding buffer containing varying ZnCl2concentrations traced with 65ZnCl2. After incubation, the membrane was washed twice in metal binding buffer containing no metal ions and exposed to an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight. Cells (porcine LLC-PK1 or human A431) were grown to 90% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture Petri dishes (Falcon), washed in HBS (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2), and harvested in 2 ml of HBS using a tissue culture scraper. For harvesting the cells and all following steps, the HBS contained either 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mmEGTA, or 50 μm ZnCl2, respectively. The cell suspension was homogenized with a glass-glass tissue grinder and fractionated by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 ×g (Sorvall, RC M150 GX) at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of HBS, containing the corresponding metal ions. For human A431 cells, the extract was mixed with 5 μg of recombinant S100A2 protein (c end = 2.5 μg/ml). The microsomal fraction was incubated for 5 min on ice and ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. The pellet was washed by a second resuspension and centrifugation step in the corresponding buffer. All pellets and supernatants were precipitated following the method of Wessel and Flugge (25.Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and an equivalent of 2 cm2 of cells was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant S100A2 was purified to homogeneity (Fig.1 A) as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ Similar to other members of this family S100A2 formed dimers both in the presence and absence of metal ions, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1 B). The conformational changes taking place during Ca2+-binding resulted in a significant change of the tyrosine fluorescence, presumably due to the exposition of a hydrophobic protein interface (Fig. 1 C). The half-maximal saturation for Ca2+in the presence and absence of Zn2+ was in the range of 350 μm. The addition of Zn2+ to the wild type S100A2 molecule in the presence or absence of Ca2+ led to an increase in tyrosine fluorescence greater than that induced by the addition of Ca2+ alone. (see below). Upon exposure to low concentrations of Zn2+, the recombinant protein oligomerizes (Fig. 1 B) and starts to precipitate in the upper micromolar range. CD spectra also detected conformational changes in the α-helical content during Ca2+ binding in the absence of Zn2+, whereas no change was observed during Zn2+ binding in the absence of Ca2+. Remarkably, the change induced in CD spectra by Ca2+ is reversed upon further addition of Zn2+ (Fig.1 D). Recombinant S100A2 can bind Zn2+ above its physiological range causing the protein to precipitate. This is assumed to be due to the presence of four cysteines in the protein, which are all capable of chelating Zn2+ as shown in the DTNB test. Upon the addition of 40 μm Zn2+, the reactivity of all four sulfhydryl residues of S100A2 to DTNB was dramatically decreased (see also Fig. 6). To overcome this problem and to identify the cysteine(s) involved in Zn2+ binding, we constructed a battery of cysteine-deficient mutants. The cysteines are tentatively named Cys1(3), Cys2(22), Cys3(86), and Cys4(94), the numbers 1–4 referring to the order in the amino acid sequence and the numbers in parentheses indicating the positions in the amino acid sequence. The mutants were numbered as Δn, where the number n refers to the cysteine(s) substituted for serine. The mutations and tentative names are summarized in Table I. The actual molecular mass as detected by ESI-MS and the theoretical mass calculated with the program GPMAW is shown in TableII. The deviation of 1–2 daltons between calculated and detected values can be caused by rounding the decimal places in the computer program, inaccuracies in the measurement, or loss of protons due to formation of disulfide bonds.Table IList of all S100A2 constructs, their tentative names, and half-maximal saturation concentrations for Ca 2+, Zn 2+, and Zn 2+ in the presence of Ca 2+CloneCysteines presentc(Ca)50c(Zn)50c(Zn)50+CaTyrosine fluorescenceWT1 2 3 434715030IncreaseΔ12 3 4348250NRNo changeΔ21 3 42768575IncreaseΔ31 2 433610075–100IncreaseΔ41 2 33087575IncreaseΔ234130130050–75IncreaseΔ1342330350–400NRDecreaseΔ1243301>500NRDecreaseΔ1234368>900NRNo changeΔ1234279>900NRDecreaseΔ123 4334>800NRNo changeConformational effects were determined by monitoring the changes of internal tyrosine fluorescence.

Almost identical elution profiles were obtained for all S100A2 mutants on an S100HR gel filtration column. Purified recombinant S100A2 and mutant proteins and their reactivity with the monoclonal anti-S100A2 antibody is shown in Fig. 2 A. Additional evidence for the structural integrity of all mutant proteins is the characteristic UV absorption spectrum that was identical for all mutants (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, the virtually identical Ca2+ binding characteristics indicated that none of the mutations influenced the dimeric state and/or EF-hand flexibility of the mutants compared with wild type S100A2. The half-maximal calcium saturation concentrations for all mutants were in the range ofc(Ca)50 = 310 ± 30 μm (Fig.2 C). The value of the mutant lacking all four cysteine residues (Δ1234) showed the highest affinity for Ca2+(c 50 = 280 μm). This value may be taken as the estimated Ca2+ affinity of the native S100A2 wild type protein in the cell, as it may be completely reduced in the cytoplasm of living cells. For freshly reduced wild type protein, similar values could be determined, but heavy oxidation was measured when monitoring the DTNB reactivity during Ca2+ titration. After several hours of incubation in the Ca2+-free state (and shorter in the Ca2+-bound state) wild type S100A2 harbors less than one free cysteine per monomer, and the Ca2+ affinity is in the range of 1 mm (data not shown). Therefore, all measurements were carried out immediately after complete reduction of the proteins in dithioerythritol (see ”Materials and Methods“). The state of reduction was measured as a function of the DTNB reactivity. The different cysteines contribute to this oxidation in different amounts as documented by the differential sensitivity to the reaction with DTNB. For example, the enhanced reactivity of Cys2(22) upon Ca2+ binding is most likely elicited through exposure of this residue to the solvent (see also Fig. 6). We employed ESI-MS to test whether S100A2 or mutants oligomerize during Zn2+-binding and to calculate the population of S100A2 dimers (or oligomers) that are bound to one or more zinc ions at a certain concentration. ESI-MS has been used before to analyze the Ca2+ binding properties of parvalbumin (26.Troxler H. Kuster T. Rhyner J.A. Gehrig P. Heizmann C.W. Anal.

Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although recombinant S100A2 and its mutant proteins are present as dimers under conditions used for the other tests, we were unable to obtain significant amounts of the native dimeric protein in ESI-MS analysis. The formation of S100 dimers is driven almost exclusively by hydrophobic interactions of several highly conserved residues located within helix 4 and helix 1, respectively (28.Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the organic solvent used in the ESI-MS will disfavor the formation and stabilization of the dimer. However, we could show that the monomers of recombinant human S100A2, forming the major particle population under these conditions, are sufficient to bind to two Ca2+ ions per monomer although with lower affinity, due to the low pH and the absence of cooperativity, mediated only by the intact dimer. No significant affinity for Zn2+ could be detected for monomers. The addition of Zn2+ to the wild type S100A2 molecule led to a strong increase in tyrosine fluorescence. Precise determination of the binding characteristics was restricted due to gradual precipitation of wild type S100A2 before a clear end point of the titration was reached. The estimated half-maximal Zn2+ saturation concentration in the absence of Ca2+ was c(Zn)50 = 150 μm. When Zn2+ was added in the presence of 500 μm Ca2+ (70–75% saturation according to the Ca2+ titration), this value increased about 5-fold toc(Zn)50ca = 30 μm (compare Table I). Cysteine 1 is situated at position 3 in the amino acid sequence of human S100A2. All mutants containing Cys1(3) (Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, Δ234), exhibited high affinity Zn2+ binding, which was associated with an increase in tyrosine fluorescence as a result of conformational changes in the molecule upon metal ion binding. When Cys1(3) was replaced by serine, no Zn2+ binding was detectable in all corresponding mutants (Δ1, Δ12, Δ123, Δ124, Δ134, Δ1234). Fig. 3 shows two representative curves for this series of experiments. A typical curve indicating Zn2+ binding associated with increased tyrosine fluorescence is demonstratd by the measurements for the Δ2 mutant. The ”Cys-null“ mutant Δ1234, by contrast, displays no Zn2+ binding before the protein starts to precipitate. All mutants missing Cys1(3) lacked specific Zn2+binding accompanied by conformational changes. In the absence of cysteines 2, 3, and 4, however, Zn2+ binding was restored in the presence of Ca2+ by the sole presence of the first cysteine only (mutant Δ234) (Fig. 4). From these data, we conclude that Cys1(3) is essential for the aspect of Zn2+ binding that induces a conformational change leading to an increased tyrosine fluorescence and that this is strongly enhanced (or even induced) only after Ca2+ binding of S100A2. A summary of all half-maximal concentrations for Ca2+ and for Zn2+ in the presence and absence of Ca2+ for all mutants is given in Table I.Figure 4Zn2+ binding in the Ca2+-loaded state. Zn2+ titrations monitoring the change of internal tyrosine fluorescence were carried out in the presence of 500 μm Ca2+. 0.1 mg/ml completely reduced protein was titrated with Ca2+ to 500 μm. Then the titration was continued with Zn2+. The fluorescent signal contributed by the presence of Ca2+ is shown by an exemplary Ca2+ titration (dotted line). Three different effects were observed depending on the S100A2 mutant tested. Representative for all mutants harboring Cys1(3), the curve of mutant Δ2 is shown (circles), which displays the characteristic 5-fold increase in c(Zn2+)50 compared with the measurement in the absence of Ca2+ (compare Fig. 3). Representative for mutants lacking Cys1(3) but still harboring Cys4(94), mutant Δ1 is shown (triangles). No specific conformational effect upon Zn2+-binding can be observed. In all mutants lacking both Cys1(3) and Cys4(94), a decrease of the internal tyrosine fluorescence is observed. This type of effect is represented by the titration curve of mutant Δ124 (rhomboids).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

Sequence alignment of the human MAP kinase ERK1 with allSaccharomyces cerevisiae kinases reveals a particularly strong kinship with Kss1p (invasive growth promoting MAP kinase), Fus3p (pheromone response MAP/ERK kinase), and Mpk1p (cell wall remodeling MAP kinase). A fusion protein of constitutively active human MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK) and human ERK1 was introduced under regulated expression into yeast cells. The fusion protein (MEK/ERK) induced a filamentation response element promoter and led to a growth retardation effect concomitant with a morphological change resulting in elongated cells, bipolar budding, and multicell chains. Induction of filamentous growth was also observed for diploid cells following MEK/ERK expression in liquid culture. Neither haploids nor diploids, however, showed marked penetration of agar medium. These effects could be triggered by either moderate MEK/ERK expression at 37 °C or by high level MEK/ERK expression at 30 °C. The combination of high level MEK/ERK expression and 37 °C resulted in cell death. The deleterious effects of MEK/ERK expression and high temperature were significantly mitigated by 1 m sorbitol, which also enhanced the filamentous phenotype. MEK/ERK was able to constitutively activate a cell wall maintenance reporter gene, suggesting misregulation of this pathway. In contrast, MEK/ERK effectively blocked expression from a pheromone-responsive element promoter and inhibited mating. These results are consistent with MEK/ERK promoting filamentous growth and altering the cell wall through its ability to partially mimic Kss1p and stimulate a pathway normally controlled by Mpk1p, while appearing to inhibit the normal functioning of the structurally related yeast MAP kinase Fus3p.

In response to an extracellular stimulus, particular MAP kinases become activated following the sequential triggering of upstream kinases, producing a kinase cascade. This results in the phosphorylation of substrates involved in both short term and long term (e.g. transcription-mediated) cell changes. As their name implies, activation of some MAP kinases can lead to a proliferative response. However, it is now clear that members of this family of kinases can initiate a variety of other cell fate pathways, such as differentiation and/or cell cycle arrest. In some cases, the activation of a given MAP kinase can lead to divergent cell fates depending upon the initiating stimulus or the cell type (1.Marshal C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar, 2.Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W.H. Zipursky L.S. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The regulation of MAP kinases and their signaling specificity are controlled at multiple levels (reviewed in Refs. 3.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar and 4.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The association of some MAP kinases and upstream cascade components with scaffold proteins appears to be one way of orchestrating both incoming activation signals and outgoing substrate phosphorylation signals (reviewed in Ref. 5.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization is another point that is utilized for regulating the accessibility of MAP kinases to their substrates. In particular, most MAP kinases have both cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, necessitating the use of nuclear import mechanisms to direct signaling (6.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Signal attenuation through the intervention of appropriate phosphatases (reviewed in Ref. 7.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and feedback phosphorylation (8.Errede B. Ge Q.Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are also involved. Incorporated within these regulatory mechanisms is the ability to modulate both the intensity and duration of phosphorylation signals, directly influencing the cell response (1.Marshal C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar). Once a MAP kinase is activated and properly localized, the final outcome is presumably dictated by substrate availability in a given cell type and by the intrinsic substrate specificity of each MAP kinase. As with other isozyme families, it is likely that the striking levels of sequence identity among the MAP kinases reflects both an evolutionary kinship of the genes encoding these enzymes and a structural constraint dictated by a shared catalytic mechanism. Conversely, the sequence variations among MAP kinases presumably highlight residues not strictly required for core enzyme function and should include determinants of isozyme-specific properties, such as substrate preference. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes six MAP kinases (9.Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) that share extensive sequence identity among themselves and with mammalian MAP kinases. For most of the yeast MAP kinase enzymes, activating extracellular stimuli, upstream kinase cascades, and phenotypic outcomes have been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 10.Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In particular, Fus3p and Kss1p have been studied in great detail and have served as paradigms for the study of MAP kinase regulation and function. In wild type cells, Fus3p responds to pheromone binding, and its activation produces a mating response that includes adoption of an elongated morphology (shmoo). Kss1p acts to control invasive (filamentous) growth, which results from different cues in haploid and diploid cells. And Kss1p has been implicated in the maintenance of cell wall integrity during vegetative growth (11.Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12679-12684Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The Fus3 and Kss1 proteins share striking sequence and function relatedness (12.Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 13.Cherkasova V. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 989-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Both Fus3p and Kss1p respond to the same upstream activating kinases (Ste11p and Ste7p), and gene deletion experiments have indicated that Kss1p can functionally substitute for Fus3p in the pheromone response, although at lower efficiency (12.Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14.Elion E.A. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9392-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, both Fus3p and Kss1p activate promoters that utilize the Ste12p transcription activator. Pathway discrimination is achieved in part through the intervention of the scaffold protein Ste5p, which preferentially recruits Fus3p into a pheromone-responsive kinase cascade (5.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and through the intervention of Ste12p-collaborating transcription factors, such as Tec1p, which is believed to be filamentous growth-specific. The distinct properties of Fus3p and Kss1p are also likely to reflect differences in substrate specificity dictated by sequence variation. S. cerevisiae haploids normally propagate as spherical, axial budding, individual cells in culture. Filamentous growth represents a differentiated state that requires the coordinated induction of cell elongation, bipolar budding, incomplete cell separation, and invasion (e.g. of agar medium). Similar changes can occur in diploid cells. Kss1p is a principal regulator controlling the switch to filamentous growth in both haploids and diploids (12.Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15.Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These phenotypes also require dramatic alterations in the cellular cytoskeleton and the cell wall and are likely mediated by multiple pathways (16.Mosch H.-U. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 671-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4874-4887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key regulator of cell wall integrity is the MAP kinase Mpk1p. The activity of this kinase is itself controlled by the upstream kinases Mkk1/2p and Bck1p. This MAP kinase cascade is regulated by Pkc1p, which appears to respond to upstream signaling from Rho1p in response to a membrane localized sensor of cell integrity encoded by the WSC1/HCS77/SLG1 gene (19.Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20.Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A.

This pathway must also be recruited for the organized remodeling of the cell wall in the transition to mating or filamentous morphologies (23.Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24.Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25.Navarro-Garcı́a F. Alonso-Monge R. Rico H. Pla J. Sentandreu R. Nombela C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hallmarks of disruption in this signaling pathway include cell lysis that is exacerbated by high temperature and mitigated by isoosmotic growth media (e.g.media with 1 m sorbitol) and by heightened sensitivity to caffeine (20.Verna J.

We used inducible expression of an activated human ERK1 in yeast cells to examine issues of MAP kinase substrate specificity controlling cellular responses. Primary sequence alignments have previously suggested a close relationship between mammalian ERK1 and particular yeast MAP kinases. We present experimental data and a modified alignment approach to address structure/function conservation. Changes in cell morphology and specific reporter gene activation reported here suggest that human ERK1 functions as an activator of filamentous morphology and cell wall remodeling pathways normally regulated by the yeast kinases Kss1p and Mpk1p and inhibits signals normally channeled through the highly related kinase Fus3p. The inducible system described here may also prove useful for the isolation of human MAP kinase interaction partners and regulators. Escherichia colistrain DH5a was used for the construction and propagation of plasmids. Yeast strains used in this work are listed in TableI. Transformations were performed using a modified lithium acetate method (28.Atienza J.M. Colicelli J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 14: 35-42Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells expressing MEK/ERK or the control plasmid (pYNH) were grown in synthetic complete medium without uracil or leucine, unless otherwise indicated. Growth assays were carried out by inoculating 105 cells from a log phase culture into 10 ml of selective medium with or without Cu2+(0.5 mm) or sorbitol (1 m) and at 30 or 37 °C. Quantitative matings were carried out essentially as described previously (29.Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Staub S.F. Koo D. Chang C.Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell.

Cells were examined using a Nikon Diaphot 200 with a ×100 objective and a phase condenser.Table IList of strainsStrainsGenotypeSP1MAT a ade8 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 aCold Spring Harbor Laboratory strain collection.W303–1AMAT a ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 bDr. Rodney Rothstein laboratory strain collection.L5684MAT a leu2 ura3 RED1+ cDr. Gerald Fink laboratory strain collection.L6149MAT a his3 leu2 ura3 tec1::HIS3 cDr. Gerald Fink laboratory strain collection.JTY256MAT a ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 ste12::URA3 dDr. Jeremy Thorner laboratory strain collection.L6018MAT a his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fus3::TRP1 RED1+ cDr. Gerald Fink laboratory strain collection.DC14MAT a his1 aCold Spring Harbor Laboratory strain collection.DC17MATα his1 aCold Spring Harbor Laboratory strain collection.DC124MATα ade8 his4 leu2 trp1 ura3 aCold Spring Harbor Laboratory strain collection.a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory strain collection.b Dr. Rodney Rothstein laboratory strain collection.c Dr. Gerald Fink laboratory strain collection.d Dr. Jeremy Thorner laboratory strain collection. Open table in a new tab The MEK/ERK plasmid was constructed from human MEK1 and human ERK1 clones generously provided by Natalie Ahn and Melanie Cobb, respectively. The constitutively active mutant MEK1 (ΔN3/S218W/S222D) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with the primers TCAGGTCGACCGGAGTTGGAAGCGCGTTA and TACGAAGCTTGCTAGCGACGCCAGCAGCATGGGTT and initially cloned into theSalI and HindIII sites of pBluescript KS (Stratagene). This construct (pKS-MEK/ERK) was then digested withNheI and NotI followed by ligation with theNheI to NotI ERK1 fragment of pCEP4Erk1. The MEK1/ERK1 fusion fragment was then released with SalI andNotI and cloned directly into pYNH, a form of pYEX (AMRAD Biotech) that had been previously modified to change the uniqueEcoRI site to NotI and to include an HA epitope sequence between the BamHI and SalI sites. To create the MEK1-only construct, the pKS-MEK/ERK plasmid was cut withNheI and NotI to release the ERK1 sequences then ligated in the presence of adaptor oligonucleotides. The resultingSalI to NotI fragment of MEK1 was then moved to the modified pYEX described above. Similarly, to make the ERK1-only construct, MEK sequences were released from the fusion construct by digestion with SalI plus NheI followed by ligation in the presence of appropriate adaptor oligonucleotides. The PRE(FUS1) and FRE(ty1) reporter constructs were provided by the laboratory of Dr. Gerald Fink (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). The FKS2 reporter was provided by Dr. David Levin (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). All three reporter plasmids originally contained URA3 marker genes, and each was changed to HIS3 by homologous recombination. HA-MEK/ERK fusion protein was expressed in SP1. Cultures were grown to logarithmic phase and induced with CuSO4 to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 3 h. Cultures were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. They were lysed as described previously (28.Atienza J.M. Colicelli J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 14: 35-42Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 50 μg of total extract was loaded on a gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membrane was probed with HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5), and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were done as described previously (30.Afar D. Han L. McLaughlin J. Wong S. Dhaka A. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. Witte O.N. Colicelli J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) except that lysates were precipitated with HA antibody (1 μl of ascites from 12CA5 hybridoma) for 1 h. Kinase reactions were carried out in a total volume of 40 μl using 2 μg of purified Elk1 (New England BioLabs) as substrate. GST-FAR1 and GST-STE12 were prepared from BL21 cells transfected with expression plasmids from Matthias Peter (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research) and Stan Fields (University of Washington), respectively. Purification on glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50 μl of bead volume for extract from a 200 ml culture. MEK, ERK, and MEK/ERK proteins were immunoprecipitated from yeast cell extracts (approximately 8 μg of total protein) using HA antibody. Kinase assays were performed using immunoprecipitated material resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl, 100 μm sodium vanadate). Assays were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, and the products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Liquid β-galactosidase assays for PRE and FRE reporters were performed and quantified by established techniques (31.Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Liquid β-galactosidase assays for the FKS2 reporter were performed by another method (32.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) due to the difficulty of lysing cells grown at 39 °C. The enzyme activity units for each method are distinct and not comparable. Yeast strains W303-1A and SP1 were used (see Table II). Pheromone induction was assayed in W303-1A cells using pSB234, a 2-μ based PRE(FUS1)::lacZ reporter construct. This construct was transformed into yeast cells containing pYNH or pYME. Transformants were grown overnight in selective medium, switched to YPD, and treated with α-Factor (Sigma) to a final concentration of 2.5 μm for 2.5 h. Cultures were then lysed and assayed. Similar results were obtained in the SP1 strain background. Filamentous induction was assayed in SP1 cells using a modified pLG669Z, a 2-μ based FRE (Ty1)::lacZ reporter construct. Similar results were obtained for this reporter in the W303-1A strain background. Induction of the cell wall remodeling pathway was assayed in SP1 cells using an FKS2(-706)::lacZreporter construct.Table IIMating efficiency (diploid colonies per mating pair)DC14DC17DC124-VDC124-MESP1-V<1 × 10−50.5 ± 0.10.50.007SP1-ME<1 × 10−50.009 ± 0.0030.0070.003SP1-V (Cu2+)0.5 ± 0.10.20.003SP1-ME (Cu2+)0.005 ± 0.0030.0060.0004SP1 (MATa) cells were paired with DC14 (MATa), DC17 (MATα) or DC124 (MATα) cells and mating was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” V and ME indicate vector and MEK/ERK construct transformants, respectively.

DC14 and DC17 matings were performed in triplicate. DC124 mating repeated in a separate experiment (data not shown) that gave consistent results. All data base searches were performed with the complete set of yeast open reading frames. Initial multiple alignments were obtained by applying ClustalW (33.Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Generalized profile construction and searches were run locally using the PFTOOLS package, version 2.0. Evolutionary surface patch analysis was used to identify functional surface patches in ERK1 and the yeast MAP kinases. In short, conservation difference scores are calculated for windows of positions, with each window representing a profile of residues adjacent in three-dimensional space rather than primary sequence. Relatedness between sequences A and B can be viewed as a minimum conservation difference score between two data sets (including or excluding B). A shift in local sequence similarities was used to identify regions of the protein in which the “local phylogeny” differs from that of the full sequence. The contribution of specific proteins to this “shift score” can be evaluated as described above for the conservation difference score. This analysis is an extension of the previously described evolutionary tracing analysis (34.Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 35.Landgraf R. Fischer D. Eisenberg D.S. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and will be discussed in detail elsewhere. 2R. Landgraf, I. Xenarios, and D. Eisenberg, manuscript in preparation. We created an active MAP kinase by connecting human ERK1 sequences to a constitutively active mutant form of human MEK1 (37.Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein, MEK/ERK, was also expected to show constitutive ERK1 kinase activity resulting from the steady state phosphorylation of this enzyme. MEK/ERK, which carries an HA epitope tag, was detectable in yeast extracts and appeared to have approximately the predicted molecular weight (Fig.1). The expression vector used included both URA3 and leu2d selectable markers and employed a CUP1 promoter for Cu2+-inducible expression. Growth in medium without leucine results in selection for high plasmid copy number and gave rise to a significant increase of protein levels, presumably due to basal expression from theCUP1 promoter. The addition of Cu2+ produced a further increase in the amount of protein (Fig. 1), that was maximal after 1–3 h (data not shown). Enzymatic activity was demonstrated by kinase assays of immunoprecipitated MEK/ERK protein from yeast cell lysates. MEK/ERK immunoprecipitated from yeast showed autophosphorylation and was capable of phosphorylating purified mammalian ELK1 protein, a well characterized ERK1 substrate (Fig. 2). This was not true for activated MEK alone. Immunopurified ERK appeared to be phosphorylated in the kinase reaction, perhaps reflecting the presence of a co-purified endogenous yeast MEK-type kinase, and this resulted in relatively weak kinase activity for ELK1. However, a mixture of MEK and ERK extracts resulted in substantial ERK phosphorylation and high level ELK1 phosphorylation. These results confirmed that, when expressed in yeast, the combination of constitutively activated human MEK with wild type human ERK, whether separate or covalently attached as a fusion protein, still shows normal substrate reactivity. Indeed, a similar construct fusing MEK1 with ERK2 has been reported to function as a constitutively active kinase in mammalian cells (38.Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the growth properties of haploid (3A) and diploid (3B) yeast cells expressing the MEK/ERK fusion and observed severe growth suppression. When grown at 30 °C, this phenotype was strongest following induction of the CUP1 promoter. Cells expressing MEK or ERK constructs alone had no discernible growth defect (data not shown). The effect of elevated temperature on cell growth was also examined. High temperature is a well studied stress condition that triggers a variety of cell responses, including cell wall remodeling (21.Rajavel M. Philip B. Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 39.Zhao C. Jung U.S. Garrett-Engele P. Roe T. Cyert M.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured at 37 °C, cells expressing MEK/ERK showed a marked long term reduction in growth compared with cells expressing vector only or MEK/ERK cells grown at 30 °C (Fig.3). In the presence of CuSO4, which induces higher levels of MEK/ERK expression, the negative effects of high temperature were exacerbated. Under these conditions, the MEK/ERK-expressing cells were unable to grow and showed no recovery after transfer to fresh medium without CuSO4 at 30 °C (data not shown). We next examined the effect of 1 m sorbitol on growth of MEK/ERK-expressing cells. This condition has been shown to rescue a variety of yeast cell wall integrity mutations, presumably by providing an isoosmotic environment in which cell wall defects can be tolerated. We observed that sorbitol rescued the growth defect of MEK/ERK-expressing cells with CuSO4-induced levels at 30 °C as well as uninduced (basal) levels at 37 °C. The combined effects of high MEK/ERK expression and elevated temperature, however, could not be rescued by sorbitol (Fig. 3). An examination of MEK/ERK-expressing cells under various growth conditions showed several morphological alterations (Fig.4 A). These included an elongated cell morphology and short linear chains indicative of polar cell division without separation. The changes were most pronounced when cells were grown in sorbitol and were enhanced by induction of high level MEK/ERK expression. These features are reminiscent of cells undergoing invasive growth, a filamentous phenotype normally controlled by an endogenous yeast kinase cascade utilizing the Kss1p MAP kinase. Diploid cells can normally undergo a related type of filamentous growth producing pseudohyphae cells (40.Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). In response to nitrogen starvation conditions, cells become elongated, switch to a unipolar budding pattern, do not fully separate leading to cell chains, and exhibit agar invasive properties. The switch to pseudohyphae growth, like filamentous growth in haploids, is controlled in part by Kss1p. We expressed MEK/ERK in diploid cells and observed a striking shift to predominantly elongated cells with a high proportion of cells found in short chains and clumps (Fig. 4 A). It should be noted that this apparent induction of filamentous growth took place in liquid medium with normal levels of ammonium as nitrogen source, conditions not normally conducive to this growth conversion. As with haploids, 1m sorbitol enhanced these effects, whereas elevated MEK/ERK expression appeared to produce a somewhat distorted cell shape. We also investigated the effects of elevated temperature on MEK/ERK-expressing cells. Growth a"

Transcription of the cecropin B gene (CecB) occurs rapidly after bacterial invasion. Using 235 base pairs (bp) of the CecB promoter region, a kappaB-related protein and two additional DNA-binding complexes (designated F2BPI and F4BP) were identified in nuclear extracts from immunized larval fat body by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (1). Further EMSA analyses indicated that the F2BPI-binding site was CATTA, and that F2BPI translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after infection. In a recently established B. mori cell line, NISES-BoMo-DZ, 235 bp of CecB promoter linked to a reporter luciferase was activated 6-fold by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a major trigger of CecB expression in larvae. Truncation of the F2BPI-binding site from the promoter reduced the activation 2-fold. Deletion of either of two kappaB motifs also reduced promoter activation 2-fold. Elimination of both the F2BPI-binding site and the kappaB motifs resulted in the complete loss of LPS inducibility. These results indicate that the F2BPI-binding site is an LPS-responsive cis-element that is necessary for full activation of CecB."

We now describe a role for p53 in the regulation of PTPA expression. Luciferase reporter assays in Saos-2 cells revealed that p53 could down-regulate PTPApromoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas four different p53 mutants could not. The p53-responsive region mapped to the minimal promoter. Overexpression of YY1 reverses the repressive effect of p53, suggesting a functional antagonism between p53 and YY1. The latter does not involve competition for YY1 binding, but rather direct control of YY1 function. Inhibition of PTPAexpression by endogenous p53 was demonstrated in UVB-irradiated HepG2 cells, both on the mRNA and protein level. Also basal PTPA levels are higher in p53-negative (Saos-2) versus p53-positive (HepG2, U2OS) cells, suggesting “latent” p53 can controlPTPA expression as well. The higher PTPA levels in U2OS cells, programmed to overexpress constitutively a dominant-negative p53 mutant, corroborate this finding. Thus, PTPA expression is negatively regulated by p53 in normal conditions and in conditions where p53 is up-regulated, via an as yet unknown mechanism involving the negative control of YY1.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that loss of p53 activity plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. A number of DNA tumor virus oncoproteins also target p53, including the SV40 large T, adenovirus E1b and papillomavirus E6 proteins, which interact with and inactivate p53 through a variety of mechanisms (2.Vousden K.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice deficient for p53 are developmentally normal but susceptible to an array of spontaneous tumors in early adult life (3.Donehower L. Harvey B. Slagle B. McArthur B. Montgomery C. Butel J. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). Based on these key observations, p53 is considered to be the prototype tumor suppressor. The p53 protein, normally present at low levels in the cell, can be up-regulated by stimuli such as DNA damage, hypoxia, or ectopic expression of oncogenes (4.Levine A. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). Upon activation, p53 diversely affects the expression of a variety of genes, resulting in the induction of pathways leading to either growth arrest or apoptosis (5.Ko L.J. Prives C.

However, it has also been reported that p53 can repress the transcription of a large number of genes, which do not have these consensus p53-binding sites within their regulatory regions (13.Ginsberg D.

Originally, the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (PTPA)1 was isolated as anin vitro regulator of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases implicated in cell cycle control, responses to signaling, cell differentiation, and cell transformation (26.Cayla X.

Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Via an as yet unknown mechanism, PTPA can specifically up-regulate the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (PTPase) activity of PP2A in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ (26.Cayla X. Goris J. Hermann J. Hendrix P. Ozon R. Merlevede W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29.Van Hoof C. Cayla X. Bosch M. Merlevede W. Goris J. Adv. Prot.

For this activation some highly conserved amino acids seem to be required (31.Van Hoof C. Janssens V. Dinishiotu A. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12899-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PTPA has been cloned from rabbit and human cDNA libraries (32.Cayla X. Van Hoof C. Bosch M. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. Peeters B. Merlevede W. Goris J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15668-15675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and homologues have been found in Xenopus laevis,Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (31.Van Hoof C. Janssens V. Dinishiotu A. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12899-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating a well conserved function for this protein throughout evolution. Whether the up-regulation of the PTPase activity of PP2A represents the actual in vivo function of PTPA remains elusive. Nevertheless, by a genetic approach in S. cerevisiae, we could identify a genetic interaction between PP2A andPTPA, indicating that PTPA could regulate at least some functions of PP2A. 2C. Van Hoof et al., submitted for publication. 2C. Van Hoof et al., submitted for publication. A recent report by Ramotar et al. (33.Ramotar D. Belanger E. Brodeur I. Masson J.-Y. Drobetsky E.A. J.

After cloning and characterizing the structure of the human PTPA gene (34.Van Hoof C. Sayed Aly M. Garcia A. Cayla X. Cassiman J.J. Merlevede W. Goris J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we recently analyzed its promoter region in more detail (35.Janssens V. Van Hoof C. De Baere I. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The minimal promoter, residing in an unmethylated CpG island, was identified between nt −67 and +38 and lacks a TATA box. Within this region, two functional yin-yang 1 (YY1)-binding sites are present. Upon mutation of these sites, promoter activity is completely abolished, implying a positive role for YY1 in the basal and ubiquitous expression of PTPA (35.Janssens V. Van Hoof C. De Baere I. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the complete promoter region that was isolated and sequenced (about 3 kilobases), several putative p53 consensus binding sites are present. Given the p53 well defined role in the cellular response to DNA damage (4.Levine A. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar) and the proposed role, at least in budding yeast, for PTPA in DNA repair, we now evaluated the putative role of p53 on the promoter activity and expression of PTPA. The data obtained classify PTPA as a novel p53 target gene, subject to p53 repression, and open the gate to further investigate thein vivo role of PTPA, particularly in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The generation of luciferase reporter gene constructs, containing different PTPA promoter fragments is described in detail in Ref. 35.Janssens V. Van Hoof C. De Baere I. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. CONp53-pLuc, that was used as a positive control, was generated by ligating two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCT-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCTA-3′, which were first annealed and phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the HindIII restriction site of the pGL2-Promoter vector (Promega). Upon sequencing of the insert, two copies of this oligonucleotide (and thus of the p53 consensus sequence) appeared to be present. To introduce point mutations in the putative p53-binding sites in the context of −102/+38-pLuc, five pairs of complementary and partially overlapping synthetic DNA oligonucleotides, some containing the desired mutations (Table I), were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, denatured, annealed, and ligated.

All p53-containing constructs, used for co-transfection, were derived from pSP65hp53, a plasmid containing the complete human p53 cDNA in the pSP65 vector (a kind gift of C. Desaintes (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France)). For the construction of pSG5-p53, the p53 cDNA was PCR amplified from pSP65hp53 with PWO polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the primers 5′-TAGAATTCAAGCTTATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATC-3′ and 5′-AATGGATCCTCTAGATCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′, and the resulting PCR product cloned in the EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites of pSG5 (Stratagene). pSG5-ΔC p53, encoding amino acids 1–308 of p53, was generated similarly, using 5′-TAGAATTCAAGCTTATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATC-3′ and 5′-ATATGGATCCTCACAGTGCTCGCTTAGTGCTC-3′ as primers. pSG5-ΔN p53, comprising amino acids 97–394 of p53, was generated with primers 5′-ATATCATATGGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTA-3′ and 5′-AATGGATCCTCTAGATCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′, followed by cloning in the BamHI and the Klenow polymerase-treatedEcoRI sites of pSG5. pSG5-p53 DBD, encoding the DNA-binding domain of p53 (amino acids 97–308), was generated similarly by using primers 5′-ATATCATATGGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTA-3′ and 5′-ATATGGATCCTCACAGTGCTCGCTTAGTGCTC-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate R273Lp53, a dominant negative p53 mutant, was performed using a standard PCR-based method. Two separate PCRs were performed with pSP65hp53 as template: the first with 5′-TAGAATTCAAGCTTATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATC-3′ (start primer) and 5′-GCTTTGAGGTGCTTGTTTGTGCCTGTC-3′ (reverse mutated primer), and the second with 5′-GACAGGCACAAACAAGCACCTCAAAGC-3′ (forward mutated primer) and 5′-AATGGATCCTCTAGATCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′ (stop primer). The combined reaction products of these two PCR reactions were then used as template for a second amplification round with the start and stop primers only. The resulting PCR product was cloned into theEcoRV-digested pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm the introduction of the mutation. Next, R273Lp53 was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSG5, and into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pRC-CMV (Invitrogen) to generate the pSG5-p53 R273L and pCMV-p53 R273L expression plasmids, respectively.

Transient transfections were performed in 24-well dishes using Fugene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 0.4 μg of reporter construct and 50 ng of the p53 expression plasmid (either the wild-type form or the different mutant forms), unless stated otherwise. To evaluate transfection efficiencies, cells were always co-transfected with a reporter vector containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-β-Gal) or by the elongation factor 1 promoter (pEF1-β-Gal). The amount of this co-transfected DNA was 1/10 of the total DNA used in the transfection. Whenever transfection efficiencies were evaluated between different cell lines, cells were treated with equal amounts of the same DNA-Fugene mixture and from then on treated equally and measured simultaneously. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were harvested in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA system (Pierce). After concentration adjustment, luciferase activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the MicroLumat LB96P (Berthold) with automated injection. Reagents for measurement of β-galactosidase activity were obtained from Tropix (Westburg). For each construct at least two different DNA preparations (QIAGEN) were tested and each transfection was repeated at least three times. For UV irradiation, three parallel lamps emitting predominantly within the UVB range (280–320 nm) with an emission peak at 313 nm were used. Prior to UVB irradiation, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Under a thin film of PBS the cells were then irradiated for 52 s (which corresponds to a dose of 20–25 J/m2) and the old medium was replaced. Cells (10 cm plate) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 200 μl of ice-cold NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μm microcystin). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the suspension was vortexed for 20 s and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were estimated by BCA (Pierce). After concentration adjustment protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) by semi-dry blotting. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with the primary antibody was performed in immunoassay buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mm NaOH, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (clone DO-7) was purchased from DAKO; anti-PTPA (40.Van Hoof C. Cayla X. Bosch M. Merlevede W. Goris J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and anti-PP2ACAT (anti-DYFL) (41.De Baere I. Derua R. Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16539-16547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) antibodies were generated as described and affinity purified before use. After washing in PBS-T with 5% non-fat dry milk, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO) at room temperature. To visualize the bands, the blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from treated and non-treated cell lines was isolated using the guanidinium-thiocyanate acid-phenol procedure (42.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose gels with 1% formaldehyde in 1 × NBC buffer (50 mm boric acid, 1 mmsodium citrate, and approximately 5 mm NaOH to make pH 7.5). Subsequently, the RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting. After UV cross-linking, blots were pre-hybridized (at least 4 h) and hybridized (overnight) at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 5 × SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed with a PTPA-specific probe, containing the full-length PTPA cDNA, or with an 18 S ribosomal RNA probe, at a specific concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Probes were labeled by random priming (random primed labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; [α-32P]dATP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were washed twice for 15 min at room temperature and once for 5 min at 60 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. For stable transfections, cells were transfected at 80% confluency with 5 μg of either pRC-CMV or pCMV-p53 R273L, using Fugene Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following transfection, the cells were allowed to grow for 48 h. On day 3 cells were split 1:3 and placed in normal growth medium, supplemented with 700 μg/ml of the neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies). Fresh selection medium was applied every 3 or 4 days. After 2–3 weeks, neomycin-resistant individual colonies could be isolated. To exclude clone-specific differences, experiments were performed with a mixture of >20 stable clones. To assess the putative influence of p53 on PTPA promoter activity, we performed transient transfections in p53-negative Saos-2 cells. The luciferase reporter construct, containing the longest PTPA promoter fragment available to us and harboring at least three putative p53-binding sites (−2356/+38-pLuc) was co-transfected with pSG5-p53 or with empty pSG5 (which served as a control to keep total amounts of transfected DNA constant). Upon co-transfection of pSG5-p53 a clear and reproducible repression of −2356/+38-pLuc activity could be observed (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). In order to eliminate the possibility that in the transfected cells p53 was having a negative influence on gene transcription in general, we also analyzed the effects of p53 expression on the luciferase expression of two control promoters under the same experimental circumstances (Fig. 1 A). No significant difference was seen on the activity of CMV-pLuc (lane 3), whereas introduction of a previously characterized p53 DNA binding sequence (CONp53) (12.Funk W.D. Pak P.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Promoter vector, promoted a strong transactivation by p53 (lane 2). In none of the cases was any effect of p53 seen on the empty pGL2-Basic vector (lane 8). Thus, the observed inhibition of PTPA promoter activity by p53 seemed to be specific and did not result from a negative effect of p53 on transcription in general. To delineate the p53-responsive region within thePTPA promoter, we performed similar co-transfection assays with several truncated PTPA promoter reporter constructs (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–7). The results indicate that p53 apparently inhibits the minimal PTPA promoter (located between nt −67 and +38) (35.Janssens V. Van Hoof C. De Baere I. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), since all reporter constructs still displaying promoter activity, were similarly repressed by expression of p53. This result is not surprising, since for most gene promoters known to be repressed by p53, the repression is situated at the minimal promoter level (43.Kley N. Chung R.Y. Fay S. Loeffler J.P. Seizinger B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44.Sandri M.I. Isaacs R.J. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Broggini M. Vikhanskaya F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4464-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As such the PTPA promoter may constitute another TATA-less promoter, subject to p53-repression. The degree of repression of the minimal PTPA promoter by p53 strongly depends upon the amount of co-transfected pSG5-p53 DNA (Fig. 1 B). Strong inhibition (90%) was reached at 250 ng of pSG5-p53 DNA, whereas 10 ng of pSG5-p53 retained only 40% inhibition. As little as 2 ng of pSG5-p53 failed to inhibit PTPA promoter activity. Similarly, transactivation of CONp53-pLuc was progressively reduced, when co-transfected pSG5-p53 levels were progressively diminished (results not shown). No effect on the activity of CMV-pLuc was observed at any of the pSG5-p53 concentrations used for the co-transfection (Fig. 1 B), which indicates that even the p53 concentrations resulting in 90% suppression of PTPA promoter activity were without effect on transcription in general. We next generated four p53 mutants and examined whether they still retained the ability to repress PTPA promoter activity. p53ΔC, p53ΔN, and p53DBD are deletion mutants that either lack the C terminus (amino acids 309–393), the N terminus (amino acids 1–96), or both. R273Lp53 is a dominant-negative p53 mutant (45.Chéne P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), commonly found in human cancers and containing a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain. As shown in Fig. 2, co-transfection of none of these mutants resulted in any down-regulation of minimal PTPApromoter activity, although they were all properly expressed and transcriptionally “active,” as measured by their ability to compete with wild-type p53 for transactivation of CONp53-pLuc (not shown). These results suggest that sequences of both the C and the N terminus of p53 are required to mediate repression. HepG2 cells were exposed to UVB irradiation (20–25 J/m2) to activate endogenous p53. Subsequently, the levels of PTPA were monitored by Northern and Western blot analysis over a period of 48 h. The results of the Western blot (Fig.3 A) clearly indicate an inverse relationship between p53 and PTPA protein levels: whereas p53 accumulated upon UVB treatment, PTPA expression was reduced progressively. However, the levels of the PP2A catalytic subunit remained unaffected. The p53 dependence of the observed effect was demonstrated in p53-negative Saos-2 cells, in which PTPA protein levels remained unaltered after UVB irradiation (Fig. 3 B). The"

This suggests that interaction of tRNAAla with alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) is necessary for import to occur. To test whether this interaction is sufficient to drive import, we co-expressed A. thalianatRNAAla(UGC) and the precursor to the A. thaliana mitochondrial AlaRS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The A. thaliana enzyme and its cognate tRNA were correctly expressed in yeast in vivo. However, although the plant AlaRS was efficiently imported into mitochondria in the transformed strains, we found no evidence for import of theA. thaliana tRNAAla nor of the endogenous cytosolic tRNAAla isoacceptors. We conclude that at least one other factor besides the mitochondrial AlaRS precursor must be involved in mitochondrial import of tRNAAla in plants.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These differences may reflect different import mechanisms. According to in vitro studies, tRNAs and proteins seem to be imported by distinct mechanisms into the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei (9.Nabholz C.E. Horn E.K. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and results obtained with Leishmania tropica indicate that tRNAs may bind directly to a mitochondrial outer membrane receptor (10.Adhya S.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs)1 are clearly not involved in the process in trypanosomatids (12.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. SA. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondrial targeting of tRNALys(CUU) in S. cerevisiae requires a functional mitochondrial protein import system (13.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and participation of both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) (14.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cytosolic LysRS is necessary for aminoacylation of the tRNA, which is a prerequisite for mitochondrial import of the natural tRNALys(CUU). Subsequently, the precursor to the mitochondrial LysRS and other unknown protein factor(s) are needed for the actual import step (14.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,15.Entelis N.S. Kieffer S. Kolesnikova O.A. Martin R.P. Tarassov I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In higher plants, nucleus-encoded tRNAAla isoacceptors partition between the cytosol and the mitochondria in all species investigated (4.Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M.

The implication of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the tRNA import process has been suggested in the case ofArabidopsis thaliana tRNAAla, because a mutant tRNA that is not aminoacylatable by the alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) (16.Carneiro V.T.C. Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Pelletier G. Small I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is also not imported into plant mitochondria in vivo(17.Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Carneiro V. Cosset A. Small I. Plant J. 1996; 10: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We previously cloned the A. thaliana nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial AlaRS and showed that it also encodes the cytosolic AlaRS by the alternative use of two transcription initiation sites and two translation initiation codons, leading to the synthesis of a long form of the protein with a N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide and a short one remaining in the cytosol (18.Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To clarify the involvement of A. thaliana AlaRS in mitochondrial import of tRNAAla, we addressed the question of whether this enzyme is sufficient to direct its cognate tRNA into the mitochondria of a eukaryote that does not naturally import tRNAAla. To do this, we expressed the A. thaliana mitochondrial AlaRS precursor and tRNAAla in S. cerevisiae and analyzed the presence of the enzyme and the tRNA in the mitochondria of the transformed cells. The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Culture conditions used the classical yeast medium SD (minimal medium) and YPD (rich medium) according to Ref. 19.Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar), in which the URA3marker was replaced by the LEU2 marker recovered from pFL36 (22.Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) following digestion with BglII. This modified pFL61 was named p61L. In all constructs, the AlaRS coding sequence was inserted as a NotI fragment between the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and terminator of p61L. The successive steps were as follows. The A. thaliana AlaRS cDNA corresponding to the cytosolic form of the enzyme (from the ATG to the TGA codon, excluding 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences) was amplified by PCR from the plasmid 2WT (18.Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTGCAGAACCAGTGTGCTGGAAAATGCCGGGTTCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGAACCAGTGTGCTGGTCAGTTGAGCTTCAT-3′ (introduced BstXI sites are underlined; the ATG initiation codon and the codon complementary to the TGA stop codon are indicated in bold type). Only the 5′ and 3′ parts of the 3-kilobase amplification product obtained were used for cloning into pFL61 to minimize the incorporation of PCR-amplified DNA. ABstXI-SstI DNA fragment from the PCR product, anSstI-SpeI fragment directly isolated from the 2WT plasmid, and an SpeI-BstXI fragment from the PCR product were ligated together and inserted intoBstXI-digested pFL61. Cloning of the mitochondrial A. thaliana AlaRS cDNA was done following the same strategy, except that the PCR used the plasmid 1WT2m (18.Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as a template and a 5′ primer 5′-CTGCAGAACCAGTGTGCTGGAAAATGAGATTAGTGAAG-3′ (the BstXI site is underlined, and the ATG initiation codon is indicated in bold type) designed such that the PCR product included the mitochondrial targeting sequence. In both cases, the AlaRS coding sequence flanked with BstXI sites was recovered byNotI digestion and cloned into p61L, giving the plasmids p61L-2WT and p61L-1WT2m, respectively (not shown). The A. thaliana tRNAAla(UGC) gene was recovered from a previous construct in pBluescript SK(+) (16.Carneiro V.T.C. Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Pelletier G. Small I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by anXbaI-SspI double digestion and recloned into theXbaI and SmaI sites of p61L, giving the p61L-tRNAAla construct (see Fig. 1). The sameXbaI-SspI fragment was also inserted between theXbaI and SmaI sites in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), giving the plasmid KS+/tRNAAla. AnEcoRI-HindIII fragment of pFL61 containing the pUC19 polylinker was cloned into the same sites of KS+/tRNAAla to allow the A. thalianatRNAAla gene to be flanked on both sides by aBamHI restriction site. The tRNAAla gene was then isolated from a BamHI digest and inserted into theBamHI site of the p61L-2WT and p61L-1WT2m plasmids. These constructs were named p61L-2WT/tR and p61L-1WT2m/tR (see Fig. 1). TheA. thaliana amber suppressor tRNAAla(CUA) gene was cut out with a KpnI-BamHI double digestion from a plasmid previously constructed for transient expression in tobacco protoplasts (16.Carneiro V.T.C. Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Pelletier G. Small I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and recloned into pFL61 at the same sites. To prepare total S. cerevisiae protein samples for Western blot analysis, cells from log phase cultures (A 600 nm = 1.5–2.0) were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with water, once with mitochondrial breakage buffer (see below), and directly extracted in 200 μl of denaturing sample buffer (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) including 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DIFP, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (according to the instructions of the manufacturer, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a droplet of antifoam (Sigma). Following cell disruption for 1 min on a vibrating homogenizer (mini-beadbeater, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) in the presence of 1 volume of 0.5-mm glass beads, the suspension was incubated for 5 min at 100 °C, transferred into a new tube, and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Total S. cerevisiae RNA was extracted from a 500-μl aliquot of the initial cell homogenate when isolating mitochondria (see below). The suspension was adjusted to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) SDS, and extracted twice with water-saturated phenol (24.Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Large RNAs were eliminated by selective precipitation in the presence of 1 m NaCl. The tRNA fraction was finally ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in water. S. cerevisiae enzyme extracts for aminoacylation assays were prepared from 800 ml of log phase cultures (A 600 nm = 1.5–2.0). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and resuspended in chilled two times concentrated enzyme buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmPMSF, 1 mm DIFP, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture). The suspension (about 1 ml) was completed with one volume of chilled acid-washed 0.5-mm glass beads and cells were disrupted by shaking for 6 min in a vibrating homogenizer (Vibrogen Zellmühle, E. Bühler, Tübingen, Germany). Protein extracts were subsequently enriched by centrifugation followed by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75 chromatography as described previously (24.Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations (usually 2–15 mg/ml) were estimated according to Bradford (25.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial enzyme extracts were obtained by the same procedures following disruption of the organelles (the equivalent of 5–10 mg proteins as estimated according to Ref. 25.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar, see below for the isolation protocol) by sonication for twice 30 s in 500–800 μl of the above enzyme buffer. Aminoacylation assays were conducted at 37 °C in the presence of limiting amounts of S. cerevisiae total or mitochondrial enzyme extracts or of aliquots from hydroxyapatite chromatography fractions (see below). The aminoacylation reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm glutathione, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1–100 μm l-[3H]amino acid (NEN Life Science Products) at 1–74 Ci/mmol, 3 mg/ml total yeast tRNA, and appropriate amounts of proteins. S. cerevisiae mitochondria were isolated from 1 l of end log phase cultures (A 600 nm = 12–15) grown in the presence of 3% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (v/v) ethanol, essentially following procedures described previously (13.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,26.Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with water and once with breakage buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.6 m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), resuspended in 10 ml of breakage buffer and disrupted by shaking for 5 min in a vibrating homogenizer (Vibrogen Zellmühle). A 500-μl aliquot was withdrawn from the suspension for total RNA extraction (see above), and mitochondria were isolated through two cycles of low and high speed centrifugation followed by a 0.6 m/1.85 mstepwise sucrose gradient. Upon washing and resuspension in a small volume of breakage buffer, two-thirds of the mitochondria were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.1 μg/μl RNase A and 2 units/μl RNase T1 and recovered by centrifugation. Mitochondrial RNA was obtained from RNase-treated mitochondria by resuspension in extraction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) SDS), phenol extraction (twice) and ethanol precipitation. The remaining third of the mitochondria was treated for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.1 μg/μl proteinase K and recovered by centrifugation upon addition of 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DIFP, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture. Mitochondrial protein samples for Western blotting were extracted by resuspending proteinase K-treated mitochondria in 70 μl of denaturing sample buffer (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm PMSF. 10–50 μg of total or mitochondrial proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting following classical protocols (6.Dietrich A. Small I. Cosset A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). The antisera against S. cerevisiae or A. thaliana AlaRS were used at a 1:10000 dilution. The antiserum against the yeast enzyme was a gift from A. Tzagoloff (Columbia University, New York, NY). The antiserum against the A. thaliana enzyme was prepared previously (18.Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Binding of the primary antibody was revealed by chemoluminescence using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antiserum and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). S. cerevisiae mitochondrial enzyme extracts were fractionated by medium pressure chromatography on a 0.8-ml Bio-Scale Ceramic hydroxyapatite Type I (CHT-I) column driven by a BioLogic integrated system (Bio-Rad). The samples (2 mg of proteins in 1 ml) were loaded at 0.5 ml/min on the CHT-I column equilibrated with a 75 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmPMSF, 0.5 mm DIFP. After washing with the same buffer (3 ml), elution was carried out at 0.75 ml/min with a linear potassium phosphate gradient (8 ml, 75–350 mm). Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected, and aliquots were submitted to aminoacylation assays and Western blot analyses. Total and mitochondrial RNA samples were run on 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (27.Green G. Maréchal L. Weil J.H. Guillemaut P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 10: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and then transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern analysis was essentially as described in Ref. 28.Small I. Maréchal-Drouard L. Masson J. Pelletier G. Cosset A. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. The 32P-labeled probe for A. thaliana cytosolic tRNAAla(UGC) was obtained by in vitro antisense transcription of the corresponding gene with T7 RNA polymerase using a previously described construct in pBluescript SK(+) (17.Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Carneiro V. Cosset A. Small I. Plant J. 1996; 10: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides, 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, were used as probes for S. cerevisiae tRNAs: 5′-GGTGGACG(C/A)(G/A)(A/T)CCGGAATCG-3′ (degenerated oligonucleotide complementary to both S. cerevisiae tRNAAlaisoacceptors), 5′-CCAAGCATGGGTTGCTTAAAAGAC-3′ (complementary toS. cerevisiae mitochondrially encoded tRNALys), and 5′-GGTGAAACGGACAGGAA-3′ (complementary to S. cerevisiaecytosol-specific tRNATrp). An amber codon was introduced in place of an alanine codon at position 114 of the S. cerevisiae cox2 gene by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pJM2 (29.Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the Mutagene kit (Bio-Rad) and the oligonucleotide 5′-GCTTTAATAGTTATCTATGGTGAAATAACTTC-3′ (the codon complementary to the amber mutation is indicated in bold type). TheS. cerevisiae HM4 strain containing this mutantcox2 allele was constructed in a two-step scheme. First, the plasmid bearing the cox2 amber allele was transformed into the mitochondria of the MCC123ρ 0 strain by high velocity microprojectile bombardment as described previously (30.Wiesenberger G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transformant strains harboring the mutant plasmid were identified by screening for marker rescue of the cox2 amber allele after mating to the strain HMD3. In the second step, the amber mutation was integrated into the mitochondrial genome by cytoduction of theρ − mitochondria into the NB40–16B strain. Recombinant ρ+ progeny were identified by their ability to marker rescue the cox2-103 mutation after crossing to the HMD13 strain. The presence of the amber mutation was verified by sequencing the relevant region of the cox2 gene of theρ + mitochondrial DNA. The genotypes of the strains used are given in Table I. A. thaliana AlaRS cDNAs with or without the region encoding the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the enzyme were cloned, together with an A. thalianatRNAAla(UGC) gene, into a derivative of the yeast expression vector pFL61 (21.Minet M. Dufour M.-E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The resulting constructs (p61L-1WT2m/tR and p61L-2WT/tR in Fig. 1) were transformed into S. cerevisiae, and their expression was tested by Western blot analysis using anti-A. thaliana AlaRS antibodies (18.Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to probe total proteins (data not shown). The strain carrying the complete cDNA including the region encoding the targeting sequence produced significant amounts of the A. thaliana AlaRS, which migrated as expected on denaturing gels (apparent molecular mass of about 105 kDa). On the contrary, we saw no sign of significant expression of the A. thaliana AlaRS upon transformation of yeast with a cDNA encoding the cytosolic form of the enzyme, despite the abundant accumulation of the corresponding mRNA in transformed cells (data not shown). To validate these results and confirm that the mitochondrial A. thaliana AlaRS expressed in S. cerevisiae was functional, i.e. still capable of aminoacylating tRNAAla, total enzyme extracts were prepared from the strains transformed with the AlaRS gene (p61L-1WT2m/tR and p61L-2WT/tR in Fig. 1) and from a control strain transformed with a construct lacking the AlaRS gene (p61L-tRNAAla in Fig. 1). The extracts were tested for aminoacylation activity in the presence of [3H]alanine and S. cerevisiae total tRNA, which is a good substrate for both plant and yeast AlaRS. In agreement with the Western blot results, no increase in AlaRS activity was measured with the strain expressing the cytosolic form of plant AlaRS (Fig. 2 A), further suggesting the instability of this form of the plant enzyme in yeast. Conversely, an approximately 2-fold increase in AlaRS activity, as compared with the control, was observed in the case of the S. cerevisiaestrain expressing the plant mitochondrial AlaRS (Fig. 2 A). Leucyl-tRNA synthetase activity was unchanged between the control strain and the strains transformed with the plant AlaRS gene (Fig.2 B), showing that the observed increase in aminoacylation activity was specific to AlaRS and did not result from differences in the overall efficiency of the extracts. These data imply that functional A. thaliana mitochondrial AlaRS is produced inS. cerevisiae. Mitochondria were purified from untransformed S. cerevisiae and fromS. cerevisiae strains transformed with construct p61L-1WT2m/tR, carrying the A. thaliana genes for tRNAAla(UGC) and mitochondrial AlaRS or with construct p61L-tRNAAla, carrying only the A. thalianatRNAAla(UGC) gene. Western blot experiments were carried out to probe the proteins extracted from these samples with the anti-A. thaliana AlaRS antibody. A strong, specific signal corresponding in size to the A. thaliana AlaRS was detected only with the mitochondrial protein extracts from the S. cerevisiae strain expressing the plant mitochondrial AlaRS (Fig.3). This implies that the plant AlaRS presequence is functional in S. cerevisiae and promotes efficient import of the enzyme into yeast mitochondria, despite the probable instability of the cytosolic form of the protein in this organism. That no signal was observed when the plant AlaRS gene was not present indicated that the antibodies against the A. thaliana AlaRS did not significantly cross-react with the endogenous yeast mitochondrial AlaRS. Conversely, there was no evidence for cross-recognition of the plant enzyme when probing similar Western blots with antibodies against the S. cerevisiaemitochondrial AlaRS, which enabled us to show that the level of the endogenous enzyme was not significantly affected by the presence of the plant AlaRS (Fig. 3). To test whether the A. thalianaAlaRS imported into S. cerevisiae mitochondria was functional, mitochondrial enzyme extracts were prepared from the strains transformed with the A. thaliana genes for tRNAAla(UGC) and mitochondrial AlaRS or with the A. thaliana tRNAAla(UGC) gene alone. These extracts were tested for aminoacylation with [3H]alanine, usingS. cerevisiae total tRNA as substrate. In yeast as in plants, the mitochondrial and cytosolic AlaRSs are likely to be encoded by the same gene (31.Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 2S. Li and A. Tzagoloff, unpublished results. so yeast cytosolic tRNAsAla are appropriate substrates for both the plant and yeast mitochondrial enzymes. The AlaRS activity was roughly 20-fold higher in mitochondrial extracts of the strain expressing the plant mitochondrial AlaRS, as compared with extracts from the control strain transformed only with the plant tRNAAla gene (Fig.4 A). Mitochondrial histidyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetase activities were unchanged between the control strain and the strain transformed with the plant AlaRS gene (Fig.4 B), showing that the observed increase in aminoacylation activity was specific to AlaRS and did not result from differences in the overall efficiency of the extracts. For histidyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetase, as for AlaRS, the same gene encodes both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial form of the enzymes in yeast (32.Chiu M.I. Mason T.L. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1992; 132: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which again enabled the use of total S. cerevisiae tRNA for testing mitochondrial extracts. To confirm that the observed increase in AlaRS activity was due to the presence of the plant enzyme, and not to a stimulation of the endogenous enzyme, the mitochondrial extracts were fractionated by chromatography on a hydroxyapatite column, and the individual fractions were tested for aminoacylation with alanine. The plant and the yeast AlaRS appeared to elute from the column as two distinct peaks, with an activity ratio similar to that obtained when testing the unfractionated mitochondrial extracts (Fig.5 A). The identity of each peak was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the individual fractions with the AlaRS antiserum (Fig. 5, B and C). Considering all the data, it appears that functional A. thaliana mitochondrial AlaRS accumulates at a high level in mitochondria of the S. cerevisiae strain transformed with the corresponding gene. Putative mitochondrial import of tRNAAla was analyzed in the S. cerevisiaestrains transformed with the A. thalianatRNAAla(UGC) gene alone, combined with the gene for theA. thaliana cytosolic AlaRS, or combined with the gene for the A. thaliana mitochondrial AlaRS. Total RNA and mitochondrial RNA were extracted from the S. cerevisiaetransformants and analyzed by Northern blotting. The absence of any hybridization signal with a probe specific for the cytosolic tRNATrp proved the absence of significant cytosolic contamination of the mitochondrial tRNA samples (Fig.6, panel a). Hybridization with a probe recognizing the two endogenous S. cerevisiaecytosolic tRNAAla isoacceptors also gave signals only with total RNA samples, which proved the absence of significant contamination of the mitochondrial RNA preparations with cytosolic tRNAAla (Fig. 6, panel b). Moreover, this result showed that expression of the A. thaliana AlaRS had no effect on the expression level of the endogenous cytosolic tRNAsAla and, more pertinently, did not lead to import of these tRNAs into mitochondria. Similarly, we could only detect a specific hybridization signal corresponding to the A. thaliana tRNAAla from the S. cerevisiaetotal tRNA samples (Fig. 6, panel c). Considering the hybridization signal observed, compared with that of the endogenous tRNAsAla and tRNATrp, it seems unlikely that the expression level of the A. thaliana tRNAAlain transformed S. cerevisiae was a limiting factor for putative mitochondrial import of this tRNA. The identity and integrity of the mitochondrial tRNAs was verified by using a probe for theS. cerevisiae mitochondrially encoded tRNALys(Fig. 6, panel d). A functional test for the import of the A. thalianatRNAAla into S. cerevisiae mitochondria was pursued by creating a yeast mitochondrial mutant in which an alanine codon of the cox2 gene was mutated to an amber codon (strain named HM4, see “Materials and Methods”). The presence of the premature stop codon prevents the mutant strain from synthesizing a full-length COX2 protein and thus prevents respiration (Fig.7). The amber mutation could potentially be suppressed by mitochondrial import of an amber suppressor tRNAAla(CUA) from the cytosol. Such a suppressor tRNA, derived from the A. thaliana tRNAAla(UGC) (16.Carneiro V.T.C. Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Pelletier G. Small I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was subcloned into pFL61, and its expression and function in S. cerevisiae were tested by the ability to suppress the amber mutation of the lys2 nuclear gene present in the YPH102 strain (data not shown). The HM4 strain was then transformed with a plasmid encoding the A. thaliana amber suppressor tRNAAla(CUA) alone or with a plasmid encoding both the tRNAAla(CUA) and either the cytosolic or the mitochondrialA. thaliana AlaRS. The mitochondrial import of the A. thaliana tRNAAla(CUA) was tested by transferring the different transformants to plates containing a nonfermentable carbon source. None of the strains was able to grow under such conditions (Fig. 7). This inability of the different transformants to respire implies that little or no A. thalianatRNAAla(CUA) was entering mitochondria in each strain. This test should be very sensitive because the presence of very low levels of COX2 protein are known to support detectable growth in this assay (29.Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results show that the A. thalianatRNAAla is correctly expressed in S. cerevisiaebut is not imported into the mitochondria of this organism, even when the A. thaliana AlaRS is targeted to mitochondria in the same transformants. Following the initial observations of tRNA import intoTetrahymena mitochondria (34.Suyama Y. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2829-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35.Suyama Y. Hamada J. Büchner T. Genetics and Biogenesis of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1976: 763-770Google Scholar), it was suggested that import might occur as co-import of a tRNA/mitochondrial aaRS precursor complex. Since these early experiments, some evidence has been accumulated that aaRSs are indeed involved in mitochondrial tRNA import, at least in plants and yeast (14.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17.Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Carneiro V. Cosset A. Small I. Plant J. 1996; 10: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although ironically this does not seem to be the case in Tetrahymena (36.Rusconi C.P. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2870-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) nor inLeishmania (12.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. SA. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the exact role that aaRSs might play in the plant tRNA import mechanism has not been elucidated, and at least three hypotheses are quite plausible: (i) The true import factor(s) require(s) aminoacylated tRNA, hence the requirement for the corresponding aaRS. The cytosolic LysRS clearly plays this role inS. cerevisiae, because it is no longer necessary for mitochondrial import of tRNALys(CUU) in vitroif charged tRNALys is used for the assay (14.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (ii) tRNAs are imported through the mitochondrial protein import channel in a complex with the cognate aaRS. Evidence for the involvement of a complex between tRNALys(CUU) and the precursor to theS. cerevisiae mitochondrial LysRS (pre-MSK) prior to import of the tRNA and for the importance of a functioning protein import channel is quite strong in yeast (13.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14.Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (iii) The aaRS acts as a specificity factor, singling out specific tRNAs for import but does not actually participate in the transfer of the tRNA through the mitochondrial membrane, which occurs separately (perhaps through a still-to-be-identified RNA import channel). In eukaryotes, all the mitochondrial aaRS precursors are imported from the cytosol, and yet only in a few cases does this import correlate with tRNA import. In these special cases, it has been unclear until now whether the aaRS precursor has some unusual intrinsic ability to promote mitochondrial tRNA import or whether other factors are involved. The experiments described here address the fundamental point of whether a mitochondrial aaRS precursor implicated in tRNA import is still capable of directing its cognate tRNA to mitochondria when expressed in a different host. To be a fair test, the experimental system should meet several criteria. First, one should use a homologous aaRS/tRNA pair known to be imported in their natural host. Second, the enzyme and the tRNA must be expressed correctly and in sufficient amounts in the transformed strains. Third, the enzyme produced from the transgene must be shown to be active and imported efficiently into mitochondria. Finally, the mitochondria from the host organism should be competent for tRNA import, i.e. they should be known to import tRNAs other than the one being tested. We believe that the experiments described here meet these criteria. It is clear from our results that the A. thalianamitochondrial AlaRS precursor is not sufficient to direct tRNAAla to yeast mitochondria. Plant cells must therefore contain at least one other factor missing from yeast cells that is necessary for mitochondrial import of tRNAAla. Following the hypotheses put forward above, the possibilities include a factor that requires aminoacylated tRNAAla (hence the necessity for aminoacylation shown previously (17.Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Carneiro V. Cosset A. Small I. Plant J. 1996; 10: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), a factor that acts to stabilize a putative pre-AlaRS/tRNAAla complex, or an RNA import channel lacking from yeast mitochondria. A great deal of further experimentation will be required to identify which of these possibilities is nearest to being correct. We thank Ivan Tarassov for many fruitful discussions and for help in isolating S. cerevisiaemitochondria, Heather Dunstan and Nathalie Bonnefoy for supplying strains and plasmids, Alexander Tzagoloff for providing us with an antiserum against S. cerevisiae AlaRS and with unpublished experimental information about this enzyme, and Gérard Keith for the gift of specific oligonucleotides."

However, the molecular mechanism of damage recognition by these proteins is still not well understood. In this work we analyzed the interaction between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) labeled with a fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and Thermus thermophilus HB8 UvrA (ttUvrA) and UvrB (ttUvrB) proteins. TMR-labeled ssDNA (TMR-ssDNA) as well as UV-irradiated ssDNA stimulated ATPase activity of ttUvrB more strongly than did normal ssDNA, indicating that this fluorescent ssDNA was recognized as damaged ssDNA. The addition of ttUvrA or ttUvrB enhanced the fluorescence intensity of TMR-ssDNA, and the intensity was much greater in the presence of ATP. Fluorescence titration indicated that ttUvrA has higher specificity for TMR-ssDNA than for normal ssDNA in the absence of ATP. The ttUvrB showed no specificity for TMR-ssDNA, but it took over 200 min for the fluorescence intensity of the ttUvrB-TMR-ssDNA complex to reach saturation in the presence of ATP. This time-dependent change could be separated into two phases. The first phase was rapid, whereas the second phase was slow and dependent on ATP hydrolysis. Time dependence of ATPase activity and fluorescence polarization suggested that changes other than the binding reaction occurred during the second phase. These results strongly suggest that ttUvrB binds ssDNA quickly and that a conformational change in ttUrvB-ssDNA complex occurs slowly. We also found that DNA containing a fluorophore as a lesion is useful for directly investigating the damage recognition by UvrA and UvrB.

To avoid these alterations, living organisms possess DNA repair systems (1.Friederg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 is one of the most important repair systems, and it is conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes (2.Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The most important feature of NER system is its broad substrate specificity. It excises a wide variety of DNA lesions as follows: pyrimidine dimers, abasic sites, and more bulky adducts, such as benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) andN-2-acetylaminofluorene. In prokaryotic NER systems, recognition and excision of DNA lesions is mediated by UvrABC excinuclease (2.Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The properties of the component proteins (UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC) have been studied for Escherichia coli. UvrA recognizes a lesion in DNA and forms UvrA2B complex at the site of the lesion. After UvrA dissociation from damaged DNA, a stable UvrB-DNA preincision complex forms. Then UvrC binds to the UvrB-DNA preincision complex, and UvrBC makes incisions at the fourth or fifth phosphodiester bond from the 3′ side of a lesion and subsequently at the eighth bond from the 5′ side of a lesion. After the incision event, UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase complete the repair process by carrying out excision of the oligonucleotide containing the lesion, repair synthesis, and DNA ligation, respectively. The molecular mechanism of recognition of the damage site by UvrA and UvrA2B is still not fully understood. The UvrA2dimer, which can be formed in solution (4.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), has a higher affinity for damaged double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) than for normal/undamaged dsDNA (5.Seeberg E. Steinum A.L.

However, it has been suggested that UvrB is not merely loaded by UvrA but actively participates in damage recognition (9.Zou Y. Walker R. Bassett H. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). UvrB binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and has a higher affinity for damaged ssDNA in the absence of UvrA (8.Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas UvrA shows no preference for ssDNA containing a lesion (5.Seeberg E. Steinum A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that dsDNA in UvrB-DNA preincision complex is sharply bent (10.Shi Q. Thresher R. Sancar A. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and has one or more DNase I-hypersensitive sites (7.Van Houten B. Gamper H. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol.

The dsDNA in UvrB-DNA preincision complex is supposed to be partly unwound (13.Lin J.J. Philips A.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17693-17700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although extensive unpairing may not occur (14.Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This conformational change is required for binding of UvrC to UvrB-DNA preincision complex (15.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysee M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), it is proposed that a single-stranded region may be formed in UvrB-DNA preincision complex. In addition, it has been shown that UvrAB complex binds to bubble or loop regions in dsDNA with an affinity similar to that for damaged DNA (17.Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21462-21470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the importance of interaction of UvrA and UvrB with ssDNA or ssDNA portion of the dsDNA in the repair process of NER. Spectroscopic analysis using fluorescent DNA is a useful method to examine directly the DNA-protein interaction in solution (18.Hill J.J. Royer C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 390-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, certain bulky fluorophores attached to DNA, such as BPDE, can be recognized as the lesions by UvrABC (19.Zou Y. Bassett H. Walker R. Bishop A. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the fluorescence spectrum can detect with sensitivity changes in a microenvironment around a fluorophore, such fluorescent adducts may also be used for studying a local conformational change subsequent to binding of UvrA or UvrB to the damaged DNA. These reflections prompted us to employ a bulky fluorophore attached to DNA for studying the interaction of UvrA and UvrB with the damaged DNA. We have studied several repair systems including NER by using an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8 (20.Kato R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol.

J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We have already cloned and sequenced uvrA (23.Yamamoto N. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and uvrB (21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) genes ofT. thermophilus. Amino acid sequences of T. thermophilus UvrA (ttUvrA) and UvrB (ttUvrB) show homology with those of other prokaryotes including E. coli, which suggests that the mechanism of NER in T. thermophilus is similar to that in E. coli. However, ttUvrB differs from E. coli UvrB in terms of its ability to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of UvrA and DNA (21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, ttUvrB is stable up to 80 °C at neutral pH and between pH 6 and 11 at 25 °C (21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These properties are suitable not only for physicochemical studies, including x-ray crystallographic analysis, but also for functional analysis. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of ttUvrA and ttUvrB with damaged ssDNA by employing an oligonucleotide modified with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). This fluorescent ssDNA, TMR-ssDNA, was as efficient as UV-damaged ssDNA for the stimulation of ttUvrB ATPase activity, suggesting that TMR-ssDNA can be recognized as a damaged DNA by ttUvrB. This TMR-ssDNA enabled us to analyze the interaction of ttUvrA and ttUvrB with ssDNA spectroscopically. We also show that the change of the interaction of ttUvrB with fluorescent DNA occurs over a long period. On the basis of these results, we discuss the binding of ttUvrA and ttUvrB proteins to the damaged DNA and, especially, the conformational transition in the UvrB-DNA complex. ttUvrA and ttUvrB were purified as described previously (21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23.Yamamoto N. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and their concentrations were determined using ε values of 7.4 × 104 and 6.0 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 277 nm, respectively. Enzymes and reagents were purchased as follows: rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (type II) from Sigma; pig heart lactate dehydrogenase (grade II) from Toyobo; ATP, ADP, and creatine kinase from Life Technologies, Inc.; AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; [γ-32P]ATP from ICN; poly(dT) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) from Molecular Probe. The concentration (nucleotide molar, M) of poly(dT) was determined using an ε value of 8.52 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 264 nm (26.Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 26: 7666-7676Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Damage-containing poly(dT) was prepared by irradiating poly(dT) in a quartz cuvette with UV light (mainly 254 nm). All of the other chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources. An unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide of 30-mer (N-ssDNA, Fig.1 A), was synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. For synthesis of fluorescent ssDNA, TMR-ssDNA (Fig. 1 B), an oligodeoxynucleotide with a modified thymine residue which contains an amino group (27.Ozaki H. Nakamura A. Arai M. Endo M. Sawai H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1995; 68: 1981-1987Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was synthesized and purified in the same manner. The resultant modified ssDNA was allowed to react with tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate and isolated by gel filtration and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The isolated compound was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column and lyophilized. The molar extinction coefficients for the unmodified and fluorescent DNA were calculated to be 2.82 × 105 and 3.14 × 105m−1cm−1 at 260 nm, respectively (28.Fasman C.D. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. I. CRC Press, Inc., Cleveland1975Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP was measured at 25 °C by an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (29.Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change of absorbance at 340 nm was measured with a Hitachi spectrophotometer, model U-3000. ATP was reacted with 0.2 μm ttUvrB in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.32 mm NADH, 25 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, pH 7.5. The fluorescence emission of TMR-ssDNA was measured with a Hitachi spectrofluorometer, model F-4500. All measurements were taken with an excitation wavelength of 543 nm in a 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Measurements of fluorescence polarization were performed in a manner similar to that described above, except that the spectrofluorometer was equipped with polarizers, model 250-0394 (Hitachi). Fluorescence polarization was measured at the maximum emission wavelength of 571 nm. In the presence of ATP, 25 mm creatine phosphate and 25 units/ml creatine kinase were added for regeneration of ATP. The fluorescence titration was carried out by measuring the emission intensity at 571 nm. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 μm TMR-ssDNA, and various concentrations of ttUvrA or ttUvrB, pH 7.5. In the presence of 10 mm ATP, 25 mm creatine phosphate and 25 units/ml creatine kinase were further added for regeneration of ATP. We assumed the following Equation 1 for the interaction between ttUvrA or ttUvrB (E) and TMR-ssDNA (S), KdE+S⇔ESEquation 1 where K d is the dissociation constant defined by Equation 2.Kd=[E][S]/[ES]Equation 2 The parentheses denote concentration. The total concentrations of ttUvrA or ttUvrB ([E]0) and TMR-ssDNA ([S]0) are related to the respective free concentrations ([E] and [S]) as shown in Equations 3 and 4.[E] 0=[E]+[ES]Equation 3 [S] 0=[S]+[ES]Equation 4 The concentration of protein-TMR-ssDNA complex is obtained from Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 to give Equation 5.[ES]=[[S] 0+[E] 0+Kd−[([S] 0+[E] 0+Kd) 2−4[E] 0[S] 0] 1/2]/2Equation 5 Then, [S] and [E] are calculated from Equations 3and 4. The observed change of fluorescence intensity (ΔF 571 in Fig. 5) is expressed as Equation6.ΔF571=(fS[S]+fES[ES])−fS[S] 0=(fES−fS)[ES]Equation 6 where f S andf ES are the molar fluorescence intensities of the TMR-ssDNA alone and the protein-TMR-ssDNA complex, respectively. The parameters K d and fwere determined by fitting Equation 6 to the observed changes at various concentrations of [E]0. Competition experiments for ttUvrA and ttUvrB using TMR-ssDNA and N-ssDNA were carried out by fluorescence titration as mentioned above except for the presence of N-ssDNA at two different concentrations, 0.5 and 1.0 μm. In competition experiments, we assumed the simple competition between TMR-ssDNA (S) and N-ssDNA (I) for binding to the protein (E). The inhibition constant (K i) is defined by EquationsEquation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9.Ki=[E][I]/[EI]Equation 7 [I] 0=[I]+[EI]Equation 8 [ES]=[E] 0−Kd[ES]/([S] 0−[ES])−(Kd[ES][I] 0−Ki[S] 0Equation 9 +Ki[ES])/([S] 0−[ES]+Kd[ES])By using the values of K d and fdetermined as described above, K i was determined by fitting Equation 9 to the observed changes at various concentrations of [E]0. We planned to employ TMR-labeled ssDNA as a fluorescent ssDNA probe to study the interactions between ssDNA and ttUvrA and ttUvrB (Fig.1). This was because the fluorescence of TMR fluctuates with the polarity of its immediate environment, offering the possibility to study the kinetics of protein-ssDNA interactions by measuring the changes in fluorescence that are expected to occur when protein interacts with the labeled ssDNA. Before making such an analysis, however, we needed to examine whether the complex of ttUvrA or ttUvrB with such fluorescent ssDNA was similar in character to those of lesion-containing ssDNA. It was shown that E. coli UvrB (ecUvrB) binds ssDNA specifically and has a higher affinity to ssDNA with a lesion than to normal ssDNA (8.Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We previously reported that ttUvrB has ATPase activity even in the absence of ttUvrA and DNA, and this activity is stimulated by the presence of ssDNA (21.Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it was uncertain whether ssDNA with a lesion can activate ATPase activity of UvrB more strongly than do normal ssDNAs. To investigate the effect of DNA lesions on the ATPase activity of ttUvrB, we measured the activity in the presence of UV-irradiated poly(dT). The irradiation of poly(dT) with UV light causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers, including a cyclobutane-type thymine dimer, which is typical of a DNA lesion (1.Friederg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, increasing concentration of UV-irradiated poly(dT) as well as normal poly(dT) stimulated the ATPase activity of ttUvrB. However, the maximum level of ATPase activity in the presence of UV-irradiated poly(dT) was significantly higher than that in the presence of normal poly(dT). In the presence of excess poly(dT), all ttUvrB molecules are considered to be bound by poly(dT) regardless of UV irradiation. This suggests that UV-irradiated poly(dT) activated the ATPase activity of ttUvrB more strongly than did unirradiated poly(dT). This leads to the notion that there is a qualitative difference between the ttUvrB-ssDNA complexes containing unirradiated ssDNA and those containing irradiated ssDNA. This result also suggests that the level of stimulation of the ATPase activity can be used to indicate the presence of DNA lesions on the ssDNA bound to ttUvrB. Based on this finding, we investigated the effect of the TMR moiety on ttUvrB-ssDNA complex by measuring the ATPase activity of ttUvrB in the presence of TMR-ssDNA and unmodified ssDNA (N-ssDNA, Fig.1 A). Although both ssDNAs could stimulate ATP hydrolysis by ttUvrB, TMR-ssDNA stimulated the ATPase activity more strongly than did N-ssDNA (Fig. 2 B). The effect of TMR modification to ATPase stimulation was similar to that of UV irradiation. Therefore, we supposed that the complex of ttUvrB with TMR-ssDNA has a similar property to the complex with UV-irradiated ssDNA. In addition, TMR-ssDNA stimulated ttUvrB ATPase nearly two times higher than N-ssDNA, whereas UV-irradiated poly(dT) stimulated ttUvrB ATPase only 20% higher than unirradiated poly(dT). These results suggest that the activation of ttUvrB ATPase activity depends on the kind of lesion contained on the ssDNA; TMR moiety is a bulky adduct (Fig.1 B), whereas pyrimidine dimer is not. This finding might be consistent with those of previous reports (30.Routledge M.N. Allan J.M. Garner R.C. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which suggested that the stability of the complex of ecUvrB with damaged DNA depends on the bulkiness of the adduct (see “Discussion”). To discern the specific binding of ttUvrA and ttUvrB to TMR-ssDNA, fluorescence polarizations were measured. As shown in Fig.3, the fluorescence polarization of TMR-ssDNA was increased by titrating TMR-ssDNA with ttUvrA or ttUvrB. These results confirmed the specific interaction of these proteins with TMR-ssDNA. To examine whether ttUvrA and ttUvrB bind TMR moiety itself nonspecifically or not, the fluorescence polarization was measured using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Fig. 1 C), as a model compound for TMR moiety in ssDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, no change in the fluorescence polarization of TMRE was observed after addition of ttUvrA or ttUvrB to the assays. These results confirmed that neither ttUvrA nor ttUvrB directly binds TMR moiety. Therefore, we concluded that TMR-ssDNA could be served as a useful model to study the interactions that normally take place between lesions containing ssDNA and the proteins ttUvrA and ttUvrB. In an aqueous solution, TMR-ssDNA shows the fluorescence emission spectrum with an emission maximum at 571 nm upon excitation at 543 nm, as can be seen in Fig.4 A (dotted line). In the presence of ttUvrA, its fluorescence emission was considerably enhanced (broken line). This enhancement occurred in the instant of addition of ttUvrA and did not change after that. The presence of both ttUvrA and ATP resulted in even further enhancement of the fluorescence emission (solid line). In the presence of ATP, as that seen without ATP, the fluorescence intensity changed instantly and did not change after that. Also, enhancement of the fluorescence intensity was observed in the presence of ttUvrB (Fig. 4 B), and this fluorescence was further enhanced by the addition of ATP, like in the case of ttUvrA. However, it should be mentioned that the fluorescence intensity took a long time to reach saturation in the presence of ATP (Fig.6 A). For this reason, the spectral data in the presence of ttUvrB and ATP were collected after incubation for more than 200 min. It should be noted that the measurement in the presence of ATP was performed associated with an ATP regeneration system, as ttUvrA and ttUvrB has an ATPase activity. A slight blue wavelength shift of the maximum fluorescence was observed for ttUvrB in the presence of ATP, whereas little shift was observed for ttUvrA. This might represent a difference in protein-DNA interaction between ttUvrA-TMR-ssDNA and ttUvrB-TMR-ssDNA complexes. The fluorescence titration of TMR-ssDNA with ttUvrA and ttUrvB is shown in Fig. 5. The titration curves at saturation for each protein were hyperbolic both in the absence and presence of ATP. From these data, we determined the dissociation constants (K d) of ttUvrA and ttUvrB for TMR-ssDNA (Table I), assuming bimolecular reaction between these proteins and TMR-ssDNA (see under “Experimental Procedures” for details). The K d values showed a slightly higher affinity of ttUvrA for TMR-ssDNA in the presence of ATP than in the absence of ATP. In addition, it should be noted that the addition of ATP caused further enhancement of the fluorescence intensity, suggesting that ATP elicits changes in the interaction of ttUvrA with TMR-ssDNA.Table IThe dissociation constants of ttUvrA and ttUvrB to TMR-ssDNA or N-ssDNAK dssDNAttUvrAttUvrB−ATP+ATP−ATP+ATPμmTMR-ssDNA0.43 ± 0.100.10 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.141.32 ± 0.17N-ssDNA>300.12 ± 0.010.56 ± 0.140.92 ± 0.12A 0.1 μm sample of TMR-ssDNA was incubated with ttUvrA or ttUvrB in the absence and presence of ATP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dissociation constants to N-ssDNA were determined as the inhibition constants from competition experiments. Open table in a new tab A 0.1 μm sample of TMR-ssDNA was incubated with ttUvrA or ttUvrB in the absence and presence of ATP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dissociation constants to N-ssDNA were determined as the inhibition constants from competition experiments. To compare the affinity of ttUvrA and ttUvrB for TMR-ssDNA with that for normal ssDNA, we performed competition experiments using N-ssDNA. We performed measurements in two different concentrations of N-ssDNA. For ttUvrA, no inhibition by N-ssDNA was observed in the absence of ATP, whereas considerable inhibition was observed in the presence of ATP. These results indicate that ATP drastically affects the affinity of ttUvrA to N-ssDNA. In contrast, significant inhibition by N-ssDNA was observed for ttUvrB, irrespective of the presence of ATP. Assuming that N-ssDNA is competitive with TMR-ssDNA for binding to the proteins, the inhibition constants (K i) were determined in each case, except for ttUvrA without ATP (Table I). Based on the obtained values, we deduced that ATP exerted no significant effect on the interaction of ttUvrB with N-ssDNA. As shown in Fig. 6 A, it took over 200 min before the fluorescence intensity reached saturation after the addition of ttUvrB and ATP. We used UvrB from the extreme thermophileT. thermophilus and measured its binding activity at 25 °C. This raised the possibility that the observed slow change was due to the measurement at a lower temperature than the optimal growth temperature. Thus, we performed the same experiments at higher temperatures, 37 and 50 °C, and observed the similar slow change of fluorescence (Fig. 6 C). The ordinate of Fig.6 C was represented by (F −F 0)/F 0 to correct the differences of fluorescence intensities at different temperatures. At 50 °C the fluorescence intensity reached saturation within an hour. This relatively rapid saturation was considered to be due to the lack of ATP because ATP regeneration system became inactivated during incubation at high temperature. Two phases could be recognized during the increase in fluorescence. The first phase, which took place within a minute, was characterized by a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity above that of TMR-ssDNA alone, and the second phase was characterized by a slower increase following again by a rapid increase. In this second slow phase, the rate constant was obtained 0.023 min−1 at 25 °C by assuming the single molecular reaction. Change of fluorescence intensity can be considered to reflect alteration of the environment around the fluorophore. The fluorescence polarization also showed two phases for the interaction of ttUvrB with TMR-ssDNA (Fig. 6 B). The extent of the enhancement of fluorescence polarization in the first rapid phase was greater than that in the second slow phase, whereas in the case of fluorescence intensity the extent of the increase in the first phase was smaller than that in the second phase. These results suggest that the first and second phases reflect different events during the interaction of ttUvrB with TMR-ssDNA. Fluorescence polarization reflects mobility or dynamics of the molecule containing a fluorophore. Generally, binding of a small fluorescent molecule to a large molecule, like a protein, leads to an increase in the fluorescence polarization (18.Hill J.J. Royer C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 390-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), so the binding reaction itself of TMR-ssDNA to ttUvrB should cause an increase in the fluorescence intens"

Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, the existence of a TRP in adult hepatocytes has yet to be demonstrated (6.Garcia R.L. Schilling W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ca2+-mobilizing hormones stimulate45Ca uptake in hepatocytes (7.Keppens S. Vandenheede J.R. DeWulf H. Biochim. Biophys.

Ca2+ entry pathways, such as Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ currents (I crac) (12.Hoth M. Fasolato C. Penner R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), present in hepatocytes (13.Carini R. Bellomo G. Paradisi L. Dianzani M.U. Albano E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) may contribute to the sustained plateau phase observed in response to Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. The store-operated Ca2+ currents (14.Penner R. Matthews G. Neher E. Nature. 1988; 334: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) are much smaller than the currents associated with the Ca2+-dependent conductances in guinea pig hepatocytes (15.Capiod T. Ogden D.C. Proc. R. Soc. B. 1989; 236: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), rendering them undetectable in normal physiological conditions. Guinea pig hepatocytes possess a Ca2+-dependent K+conductance that has proved useful for monitoring the variations in [Ca2+]i near the plasma membrane (15.Capiod T. Ogden D.C. Proc. R. Soc. B. 1989; 236: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16.Capiod T. Ogden D.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 409: 285-295Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This conductance has been well characterized and is a good alternative to whole cell Ca2+ measurements with fluorescent Ca2+ dyes. It shows no voltage dependence and no desensitization for Ca2+, and it is not directly activated by InsP3 itself (17.Ogden D.C. Capiod T. Walker J.W. Trentham D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 422: 585-602Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, in voltage clamped guinea pig hepatocytes, voltage steps to positive membrane potentials can be used to test the dependence of the K+ current on external calcium because store-operated Ca2+ entry is almost abolished at +40 mV (12.Hoth M. Fasolato C. Penner R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18.Lewis R.S. Advances Second Messengers Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the discharge of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in physiological conditions occurs after agonist stimulation, the depletion of Ca2+ stores can be achieved using specific blockers of the intracellular Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPases such as 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) (19.Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E.N. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and thapsigargin (20.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2976) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the effect on Ca2+ entry of depleting internal Ca2+ stores in single hepatocytes using InsP3 release from caged InsP3 if InsP3-dependent agonists did not mobilize internal Ca2+ in Ca2+-free solutions. We found that InsP3 and store depletion have additive effects to activate Ca2+ influx in single guinea pig hepatocytes. This suggests that there is a direct functional interaction between InsP3 receptors and Ca2+channels in the plasma membrane (5.Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), although the nature of these Ca2+ channels in hepatocytes is unknown. Guinea pig (males of the Hartley strain) liver cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and mechanical dispersion (21.Capiod T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 795-805Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thirty min after preparation, hepatocytes were plated in 35-mm diameter Falcon plastic Petri dishes at a density of approximately 400,000 cells in 2 ml of Earle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (200,000 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The dishes were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for at least 2 h and were then used within 8 h. Recordings were made at a temperature of 32–34 °C. Standard tight seal whole-cell recording techniques were used (22.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15060) Google Scholar). Patch pipette resistances were typically 5 megaohms. Whole-cell currents and potentials were measured with a RK300 patch clamp amplifier (Biologic, Grenoble, France). Signals from whole-cell recordings were digitized using a CED 1401 interface (CED Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom), and traces were treated with the VCAN package supplied by J. Dempster (University of Strathclyde, UK). Experiments were carried out in chloride-free conditions with gluconate used to replace chloride. The external solution contained 145 mm sodium gluconate, 5.6 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm CaSO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 8 mm Hepes (pH 7.3). Patch pipettes contained 153 mm potassium gluconate; 3 mm ATPNa2, 3 mm MgSO4, 8 mm Hepes (pH 7.3). For the extracellular Ca2+-free solution, CaSO4 was omitted, MgSO4 concentration was increased to 2.5 mm, and 40 μm EGTA was added to the perfusing solution. The dish was perfused continuously, and hormones or drugs were added to the external medium. All solutions were 0.22-μm Millipore-filtered. Caged InsP3 or caged 5-thio-InsP3 was introduced into the cell via the patch pipette as described previously (17.Ogden D.C. Capiod T. Walker J.W. Trentham D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 422: 585-602Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Photolysis was achieved using a 1-ms pulse from a xenon arc flashlamp (23.Rapp G. Guth K. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) focused on an area of about 2 × 3 mm around the cell from an incident angle of 38° to the horizontal. This arrangement minimized (about 8%) energy loss due to reflection from the fluid surface. Light was band pass-filtered (300–350 nm) with a UG 11 filter. Photolytic conversion of caged ATP was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, and the value was used to calculate the photolytic conversion of caged InsP3 and caged 5-thio-InsP3 as described previously (17.Ogden D.C. Capiod T. Walker J.W. Trentham D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 422: 585-602Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24.Wootton J.F. Corrie J.E.T. Capiod T. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Ogden D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2601-2607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Pure caged InsP3 and caged 5-thio-InsP3 were kindly provided by Dr. D. R. Trentham (Division of Physical Biochemistry, NIMR, London). Collagenase was obtained from Worthington, thapsigargin from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel), 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone from Aldrich-Chemie, and all other reagents from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The perfusion of a single guinea pig hepatocyte with tBuBHQ (50 μm) or thapsigargin (3 μm) led to a slow rise in Ca2+-dependent K+ permeability (Fig. 1), even in the absence of external Ca2+. The response to the Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitors rapidly decreased to the resting levels in the absence of external Ca2+ but remained at an intermediate level in the presence of external Ca2+ (data not shown). After the initial response to tBuBHQ or thapsigargin in the absence of external Ca2+, norepinephrine (5 μm) was still able to induce a large rise in Ca2+-dependent K+permeability (Fig. 1). The signal was often larger in amplitude than that evoked by the Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitors alone, indicating that the maximal concentrations of the inhibitors did not release all the Ca2+ present in the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores in these cells. We investigated whether the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+stores were completely depleted after the decline of the response to norepinephrine in cells incubated in the presence of the Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitors and calcium-free solutions by photoreleasing InsP3 from a caged precursor loaded into the cell via the patch pipette. In these conditions, the release of InsP3 induced a large rise in Ca2+-dependent K+ permeability in 10 of 15 cells tested (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, the internal Ca2+ stores were not yet completely depleted in two-thirds of the cells tested, even after 10 min of treatment with Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitors in the absence of external calcium and after the decline of the noradrenaline-evoked response. However, the photolytic release of InsP3 was sufficient to empty the intracellular Ca2+ stores. We investigated whether store-activated calcium entry occurred in guinea pig liver cells. Incubation of the cells in the absence of external Ca2+ for up to 10 min did not increase Ca2+ entry upon the addition of Ca2+ to the perfusing solution (all seven cells tested) (Fig. 2 A). This clearly indicates that the removal of extracellular Ca2+ alone does not activate Ca2+ entry if Ca2+ is added back to the perfusing solution. The effect on Ca2+ entry of store depletion was tested on guinea pig hepatocytes. To empty intracellular Ca2+ stores completely, cells were treated with tBuBHQ (50 μm) and norepinephrine (5 μm) as in Fig. 1. After the norepinephrine-evoked response, the agonist was washed out, and the extent Ca2+ store depletion was assessed by photolytic release of InsP3. The current responses to voltage steps from 0 mV to −40 or +40 mV in the absence of external Ca2+were identical (data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of external Ca2+, a large outward current developed (15 of 24 cells tested) if cell potential was held at −40 mV (Fig.2 B). At this potential, the Ca2+ driving force is increased and a higher level of Ca2+ entry, as shown by the large K+ current, was observed. Voltage step from −40 to +40 mV resulted in the biphasic behavior of the outward K+ current (Fig. 2 B). An initial and transient increase in K+ current was observed due to an approximate tripling of the K+ driving force at +40 mV. The amplitude of the K+ current then decreased due to a decrease in Ca2+ entry at +40 mV concomitant with a large reduction in free Ca2+ concentration close to the membrane as Ca2+ was extruded from the cell by the plasma membrane Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase. Since the current/voltage relationship of the Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance is linear (15.Capiod T. Ogden D.C. Proc. R. Soc. B. 1989; 236: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16.Capiod T. Ogden D.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 409: 285-295Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a reduction in K+ current between −40 mV and +40 mV and the calculated reverse potential for Ca2+ in our recording conditions can only reflect a decrease in Ca2+ entry. This was confirmed by an experiment showing that adding 1.8 mmCa2+ back to the external solution if the membrane potential was first held at +40 mV had no effect (Fig. 2 C). No activation of the K+ current was observed after the photolytic release of 2 μm InsP3, indicating that the stores remained empty. Voltage step to −40 mV evoked a high level of Ca2+ entry, since the Ca2+ driving force was much greater. These results show that the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in hepatocytes is essential to trigger the opening of a Ca2+-permeant pathway through the plasma membrane. The effects of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists on store-operated Ca2+entry were investigated. Assuming that Ca2+ store depletion was complete after treatment with tBuBHQ (50 μm) and norepinephrine (5 μm) in cells that did not respond to photoreleased InsP3, we compared the effects of reintroducing Ca2+ to the external medium in the presence or the absence of a Ca2+-mobilizing agonist (Fig.3). Norepinephrine (5 μm) consistently had no effect until 1.8 mm Ca2+was added back to the external medium, resulting in a large activation of K+ conductance, reflecting a high level of Ca2+ entry. The K+ conductance declined to initial levels if Ca2+ and norepinephrine were washed away. The same applications were then tested in reverse order on the same cell. The reintroduction of extracellular Ca2+ alone resulted in a Ca2+ entry that was greatly increased by the addition of 5 μm norepinephrine (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained in 10 experiments. Since norepinephrine increases Ca2+ entry, we tested the effects of InsP3 on store-operated Ca2+ influx. Prolonged application of maximal concentrations of norepinephrine in the presence of Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPases inhibitors was not always sufficient to totally deplete Ca2+ from the internal stores. We therefore used externally applied monohydroxylated bile acids such as taurolithocholate sulfate (TLC-S) to deplete internal stores. These bile acids are more effective than InsP3 for mobilizing the entire Ca2+ contents of the ER (25.Combettes L. Dumont M. Berthon B. Erlinger S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were successively treated with 10 μm norepinephrine and 200 μm TLC-S in the presence of Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitors and in the absence of external Ca2+. In these conditions, the photolytic release of 2 μm InsP3 did not evoke any rise in Ca2+-dependent K+conductance in any of the seven cells tested (data not shown). To test the involvement of InsP3 in activation of the Ca2+ influx in Ca2+-depleted cells, it was necessary to release InsP3 before the reintroduction of Ca2+. However, in guinea pig liver cells, InsP3is actively metabolized, and the response to the photolytic release of InsP3 is short lived (10–20 s) in guinea pig liver cells in normal conditions (17.Ogden D.C. Capiod T. Walker J.W. Trentham D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 422: 585-602Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This problem was overcome by means of photolytic release of a stable analog of InsP3, 5-thio-InsP3, which is resistant to InsP35-phosphatase but not to InsP3 3-kinase (26.Safrany S.T. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Strupish J. McBain J. Cooke A. Potter B.V.L. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar). 5-thio-InsP3 was photolytically released from a caged precursor introduced into the cell via the patch pipette. The intracellular Ca2+ stores were emptied by successive applications of norepinephrine (10 μm) and TLC-S (200 μm) in the presence of either 50 μm tBuBHQ or 3 μm thapsigargin in Ca2+-free solutions. In these conditions, the reintroduction of Ca2+ ions to the external medium induced Ca2+ entry (Fig.4). Ca2+ ions were then washed away, but, since Ca2+ could have refilled the stores during this first application, TLC-S was reapplied for 1 min (not shown). Twenty μm 5-thio-InsP3, a concentration that has been shown to evoke a high level of Ca2+ release in normal nondepleted guinea pig liver cells (24.Wootton J.F. Corrie J.E.T. Capiod T. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Ogden D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2601-2607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was then photolytically released in the absence of external Ca2+. After a delay of 5 s without response, perfusion of the cell with a regular Ca2+-containing solution induced a much larger and faster increase in Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance, reflecting a higher level of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 4). All four cells tested showed an enhanced response in the presence of 5-thio-InsP3. This provides evidence for a strong link between the activation of InsP3 receptors and Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ store depletion is believed to be a crucial step for Ca2+ influx. Most of the experiments described here were performed with Ca2+ stores totally depleted, but in preliminary experiments, even partial Ca2+ depletion triggered a Ca2+ influx in 62% of the cells tested (n = 24). Indeed, we found that total depletion of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores was essential for observation of the potentiating effect of InsP3 on this type of Ca2+ entry. Since InsP3 is unlikely to directly open a Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane, our results are consistent with recent reports showing a direct coupling between InsP3 receptors and TRP (3.Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4.Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z.

Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). It has been known for several years that the plasma membrane and internal Ca2+ stores are tightly associated (27.Guillemette G. Balla T. Baukal A.J. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4541-4548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Pietri F. Hilly M. Claret M. Mauger J.P. Cell.

Dissociation of this tight link by the stimulation of actin polymerization seems to prevent capacitative Ca2+ entry in A7r5 smooth muscle cells (30.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that vasopressin and Ca2+depletion activated two distinct pathways of Ca2+ entry in rat hepatocytes (10.Llopis J. Kass G.E.N. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that InsP3 is involved in this process. In light of recent studies (3.Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4.Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M.

Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), we suggest that InsP3 is required to open Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, although it does not do this by direct interaction. The reintroduction of Ca2+ to the external medium had an immediate effect on activation of the Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance, providing additional evidence for the existence of store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. We cannot draw firm conclusions about the nature of the channels involved in this type of Ca2+ entry, since reports have shown TRP to be absent in the adult liver (6.Garcia R.L. Schilling W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that this tissue may have a specific as yet uncharacterized TRP subtype. The transient nature of the responses to 5-thio-InsP3may reflect its partial degradation by InsP3 3-kinase (26.Safrany S.T. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Strupish J. McBain J. Cooke A. Potter B.V.L. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar), desensitization of the InsP3-evoked response as observed at constant InsP3 concentration (24.Wootton J.F. Corrie J.E.T. Capiod T. Feeney J. Trentham D.R. Ogden D.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2601-2607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), rapid inactivation ofI crac (31.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), or the periodic store-independent inactivation of store-operated Ca2+ channels (32.Missiaen L. de Smedt H. Pary J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5817-5823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of store depletion on Ca2+ permeability was sustained. Therefore, the transient nature of activation by InsP3 probably reflects either degradation or desensitization. Direct evidence that inositol phosphates affect the activation of Ca2+ influx is rare. The presence of InsP3-activated Ca2+ channels was first shown in the excised plasma membrane of T lymphocytes (33.Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the involvement of InsP4 in the responses observed, since it has been shown that 5-thio-InsP3 may act as a substrate for InsP3 3-kinase (26.Safrany S.T. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Strupish J. McBain J. Cooke A. Potter B.V.L. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar). InsP4 also activates Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane of A431 endothelial cells (34.Lückhoff A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although they are more active at high [Ca2+]i, the activity of these InsP4-sensitive Ca2+ channels at resting [Ca2+]i may be sufficient to evoke the increase in Ca2+ influx observed in our experiments. The photolytic release of InsP4 from caged InsP4 should allow us to test this specific point."
