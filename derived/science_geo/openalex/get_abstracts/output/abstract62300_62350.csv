https://openalex.org/W1542827378,"Abstract The biosynthesis of GTP and ATP is inhibited during amino acid starvation of RC+ cells. This inhibition is a specific consequence of RC function and cannot be accounted for on the basis of feedback inhibition. The pattern of incorporation of radioactive adenosine into intracellular purine nucleotides suggests that the blocks imposed by the RC function lie before GMP and AMP. The regulatory nucleotide ppGpp (originally designated MS I), whose rapid accumulation in response to amino acid starvation is governed by the RC gene product, inhibits IMP dehydrogenase and adenylosuccinate synthetase, which are the first enzymes of the guanylate and adenylate pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1504228646,"Abstract T4 bacteriophage mutant am B22 (gene 43), an amber mutant in the gene for DNA polymerase, produces a protein which lacks the polymerase but retains the nuclease function of the wild type enzyme. The am B22 nuclease is shown to be a fragment of the wild type polymerase by comparing the tryptic peptides of the two proteins. The wild type and mutant enzymes each consist of a single polypeptide chain. The molecular weight of the mutant enzyme is consistent with the position of the am B22 mutation within the gene. The only other gene 43 amber mutants producing a similar nuclease map at or very close to the site of the am B22 mutation. Both the mutant and wild type enzymes are exonucleases which hydrolyze denatured DNA from the 3' terminus in a random rather than processive fashion. The mutant enzyme differs from the wild type in its markedly decreased affinity for DNA and oligonucleotides. A higher concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates is required to inhibit the nuclease activity of the mutant enzyme. The am B22 protein will not polymerize deoxynucleotides under any conditions which have been tested."

https://openalex.org/W1513115448,"Abstract Twenty-five highly purified protein preparations were tested for their ability to accept leucine or phenylalanine in the reaction catalyzed by leucyl, phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase. Three were identified as true acceptors on the basis of their capacity to accept nearly molar equivalents of amino acid. These three were modified bovine serum albumin to which arginine had been enzymatically added at the NH2-terminal position, αs1-casein, and β-casein. The latter are also known to possess arginine as their NH2-terminal residue. Acceptor specificity was similar for the transfer of leucine and phenylalanine. Although phenylalanine could be almost quantitatively transferred from phenylalanyl-tRNA to protein, no transfer was observed from the 3'-pentanucleotide fragment of E. coli tRNAphe, suggesting that an internal portion of the tRNA molecule functions in the reaction. Phenylalanine but not valine was transferred from E. coli tRNAval, and no transfer occurred from N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA, indicating a specificity for the aminoacyl residue of aminoacyl-tRNA. However, p-fluorophenylalanyl-tRNA was found to replace phenylalanyl-tRNA as substrate. The results suggest that an NH2-terminal arginine residue of the protein acceptor as well as both the aminoacyl and tRNA moieties of aminoacyl-tRNA participate in the reaction catalyzed by leucyl,phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase."

https://openalex.org/W20841869,"Abstract Bisulfite (2 m, pH 6, 20°) converted 6 of the 27 cytidine residues in Escherichia coli glutamate transfer RNA to uridine residues within 24 hours; no more were modified in the following 72 hours. Radioactive bisulfite and chromatographic analysis of the T1 ribonuclease digest showed that each of the 6 residues reacted to completion. Five of the 21 nonreactive cytidines are in non-hydrogen-bonded sections of the tRNA in the cloverleaf arrangement, leading to the conclusion that these sections are not as exposed as this arrangement might, a priori, indicate, but are buried in the three-dimensional structure existing in the modification medium. The modified tRNA (six cytidines converted to uridines) had diminished melting temperatures, an increased hyperchromicity, and a decreased retention volue on gel columns, indicating conformational changes. It also had no glutamate acceptance activity under normal assay conditions, probably as a result of the changes in conformation observed."

https://openalex.org/W2028741856,"I HAVE suggested that teratocytes, the giant cells which develop from the trophamnion of many parasitoid Hymenoptera, serve as a means of resistance to the defence reactions of insect hosts1. These cells are relatively small when they dissociate from the embryonic membrane, but as they become distributed in the blood of the host they expand to as much as 3,000 times their original volume. Their growth is achieved by the absorption of nutrients from the host's blood and I suggested that the consequent depletion of materials in the haemolymph would impede or inhibit haematopoiesis and prevent an effective haemocytic reaction to the young parasitoid."
https://openalex.org/W1489418158,"Abstract Mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium that lack Enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system cannot take up several sugars either by group translocation or by facilitated diffusion. A second mutation, which resulted in a 25-fold enhancement of the ATP-dependent manno(fructo)kinase activity, partially restored the ability of the cells to take up the sugars that this enzyme phosphorylates. It is suggested that phosphorylation of these sugars is required for their release from a membrane carrier into the cytoplasm. Preliminary evidence indicates that the mutation affecting the constitutively synthesized manno(fructo)kinase results in increased levels of the protein, rather than in a structural change affecting catalytic activity. The mutation may represent one of few known examples suggesting that the levels of constitutive enzymes are under genetic regulation."

The rate of synthesis was negligible from aggregation until late in the culmination process. At that time, a 100-fold burst of synthetic activity was observed, amounting to 0.04 µmole of trehalose per min per ml of packed cells. In the course of these studies radioactive maltose was also identified as a product of [14C]glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1504293307,"Abstract T4 DNA was transcribed in vitro by the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli. When the termination factor, rho, was present, all of the RNA made was 2000 nucleotides in length and was completely immediate early. When rho was absent, the entire early region of the T4 chromosome was transcribed as a series of polycistronic messengers, either 4300 nucleotides or 7100 nucleotides long. The product made, in the absence of rho, was 40% immediate early and 60% delayed early. Transcription of the delayed early cistrons, in the absence of rho, was due to continued transcription past the point at which rho causes release. Experiments were done at 18° at which initiation alone was allowed to proceed for several minutes by adding only ATP and GTP. The reaction mixture was then completed and rifampicin was added to inhibit further initiation. RNA synthesis continued for 1400 sec after the brief period of initiation. During the initial 400 sec of reaction, only immediate early sequences were synthesized. Delayed early sequences alone were made at later times. Transcription of the e and rII cistrons was studied. The e cistron was transcribed between 1300 and 1400 sec after initiation. The rII A and B cistrons were transcribed sequentially. Transcription of the rII A cistron occurred between 700 and 1100 sec after initiation but the B cistron was not transcribed until 1100 to 1400 sec of reaction. The e and rII transcripts were parts of RNA molecules that were 7100 nucleotides in length. The rII region was transcribed solely as a polycistronic messenger in vitro but only 20 to 30% of the rII transcripts made in vivo were polycistronic."

https://openalex.org/W1565008764,"Abstract α1-Acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), a human plasma globulin, is known to possess two major genetically transmitted variants. In this investigation the specific genetically determined amino acid substitution responsible for the occurrence of these proteins was localized to two heptapeptides by the peptide mapping technique. The variant peptides were subsequently isolated and purified from a peptic digest of the pooled desialyzed glycoprotein by column chromatography, and their sequences were established. It was found that 1 glutamine residue replaces 1 arginine residue, which is consistent with the difference in electrostatic net charge noted between the two aforementioned proteins and represents a single point mutation. The methods of investigation developed in this study will facilitate the identification of the specific amino acid substitutions responsible for the occurrence of the genetic variants of other highly conjugated glycoproteins."

In the absence of any information on the host's reaction to tetramisole given for 30 to 40 days, an experiment was designed with the primary objective of testing the acceptance of daily doses of the drug by dogs from pounds. A secondary objective was to detect any therapeutic activity against adult Dirofilaria immitis."

Amino acid incorporation experiments showed that [14C]lysine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-tungstate-precipitable material from [14C]lysine-tRNA of yeast was stimulated significantly by poly(A,G) but not by poly(A) as the source of messenger."
