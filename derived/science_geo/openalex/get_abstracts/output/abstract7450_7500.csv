This ""vigilance decrement"" results from a decrement in perceptual sensitivity only if (i) target discrimination loads memory and (ii) stimulus events occur rapidly; otherwise, the decrement reflects temporal changes in response criteria. These results provide a basis for distinguishing between the perceptual and response processes underlying the vigilance decrement that may be generalized across a range of tasks."

https://openalex.org/W2089135923,"Bitter taste thresholds for 6-n-propylthiouracil are bimodally distributed, dividing subjects into tasters and nontasters. Their taste worlds differ with regard to the sweetness of sucrose and saccharin and to the bitterness of saccharin. These differences suggest that nontasters tend to perceive less bitterness in saccharin at concentrations used in beverages."

https://openalex.org/W2092787661,"The role of exteroceptive and interoceptive aversive stimuli in rats 2 to 14 days old was investigated according to an odor aversion paradigm. Amyl acetate odor was paired with eigher peripheral shock, intraperitoneal shock, or lithium chloride poisoning. Intraperitoneal shock was an effective unconditioned stimulus at all ages and produced odor aversions comparable to lithium chloride poisoning; peripheral shock, however, was effective only in rats 10 days of age or older. Interoceptive control of aversively motivated behaviors thus seems to develop before exteroceptive control, and the failure of previous studies to find reliable learning and retention of shock-motivated behaviors before 8 to 10 days of age may be attributable to the site to which shock was applied rather than to insensitivity to shock per se."

These sugar chains were released from the polypeptide backbone by hydrazinolysis and labeled by reduction with NaB[3H]4. Most of these sugar chains contain N-acetylneuraminic acid and can be separated by paper electrophoresis. By combination of sequential exoglycosidase digestion and methylation study, their structures were elucidated as Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6 or 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 4 or 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6[NeuAc alpha 2 4Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3]-Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6[NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3]man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc."

https://openalex.org/W2072646838,A significant cytotoxicity index was obtained when human ovarian cancer cells in a microcytotoxicity assay were exposed during the S (DNA-synthesizing) phase of the cell cycle to purified fractions of testis exhibiting high Müllerian inhibiting substance bioactivity. The same effect was not observed when these fractions were tested against human glioblastoma or fibroblast lines. Most human ovarian cancers are said to resemble Müllerian tissues histologically. Müllerian inhibiting substance may thus deserve further study as a potential chemotherapeutic agent.

https://openalex.org/W1903270425,"The following compounds were tested as early intermediates in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxymandelonitrile by a microsomal preparation from dark grown sorghum seedlings: p-hydroxyphenylacetamide, 1-nitro-2-p-hydroxyphenylethane, p-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvic acid oxime, tyramine, N-hydroxytyramine, and N-hydroxytyrosine. Of these, only N-hydroxytyrosine was metabolized to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. N-Hydroxytyrosine was produced from L-[U-14C]tyrosine in tracer experiments when unlabeled N-hydroxytyrosine was added as a trap. These data indicate N-hydroxytyrosine as the first intermediate in the biosynthesis of dhurrin, the cyanogenic glucoside of sorghum, and represent the first demonstration of the formation of an alpha-N-hydroxy-amino acid in a biological system. The enzyme system involved in this reaction was partially characterized with respect to substrate specificity and the effect of various inhibitors. The enzyme was shown to have properties different than those reported for the mammalian enzyme system(s) involved in the N-hydroxylation of amine drugs. The possible involvement of N-hydroxyamino acids in the biosynthesis of other secondary plant products is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1503512579,"11-cis-Retinal-binding protein from bovine retina has been purified to apparent homogeneity by gel filtration ion exchange, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 33,000. A value of 36,000 was obtained by gel filtration. With 11-cis-retinal bound to the protein a bleachable spectral peak with maximum absorption at 425 nm was observed. When isolated without addition of exogenous retinal the purified binding protein displayed absorbance maxima at 340 and 425 nm, indicating the occurrence of two ligands in addition to the typical protein absorbance. The endogenous ligands responsible for these maxima were tentatively identified as 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinal, respectively. The binding protein did not cross-react with antibodies prepared against bovine opsin, and its amino acid composition was distinct from that of opsin. The amount of retinal-binding protein extracted was approximately 1 nmol/retina or 1 mol of binding protein/20 mol of opsin. Its specificity and relative abundance suggest that the 11-cis-retinal-binding protein may play a major role in the visual cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2064565368,"Viroids are nucleic acid species of relatively low molecular weight and unique structure that cause several important diseases of cultivated plants. Similar nucleic acid species may be responsible for certain diseases of animals and humans. Viroids are the smallest known agents of infectious disease. Unlike viral nucleic acids, viroids are not encapsidated. Despite their small size, viroids replicate autonomously in cells of susceptible plant species. Known viroids are single-stranded, covalently closed circular, as well as linear, RNA molecules with extensive regions of intramolecular complementarity; they exist in their native state as highly base-paired rods."

A genetically controlled abnormality in lithium-sodium transport, the mechanism that determines the lithium ratio, may play a role in the etiology of some forms of affective disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2082053239,"A new quantitative assay for studying the kinetics of vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo is reported. The assay was used to determine the specific activity of DNA from rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated to grow by removal of the endothelial layer. The specific activity of the DNA was correlated with the rate of tritiated thymidine incorporation as measured by autoradiography and with the rate of DNA synthesis as estimated by direct measurement of cellular proliferation. Smooth muscle cells exhibit a 24-hour latent period in vivo prior to DNA synthesis; the synthesis peaks at 48 hours and then rapidly declines. The decline in DNA synthesis is not related to endothelial regrowth, and may be of homeostatic significance in limiting luminal stenosis. The assay offers a rapid and reliable alternative to autoradiographic and morphometric techniques for evaluating growth kinetics and growth regulation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1521666984,"Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase has been purified from lymphoblasts of leukemic patients. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 62,000 as determined by gel filtration and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and is not dissociated into subunits by sodium dodecyl sulfate. In contrast, the terminal transferase enzyme from calf thymus has a molecular weight of 42,000 as determined by gel filtration, and is dissociated into 2 subunits of Mr 30,000 and 8,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of 8.2 and kinetic characteristics which are similar to those of calf thymus terminal transferase. The apparent Km for purine nucleotide polymerization at saturating initiator concentration with Mg2+ is 0.2 mM and with Mn2+ is 0.05 mM. Like calf terminal transferase, the reaction velocity is higher in the presence of Mg2+ than Mn2+. ATP inhibits the reaction catalyzed by terminal transferase isolated from human lymphoblasts due to mutual recognition of ATP and dATP by a common site on the enzyme. Preliminary experiments indicate that human terminal transferase may contain a small amount of carbohydrate. This report represents the first purification to near homogeneity of terminal transferase from a tissue source other than calf thymus."
https://openalex.org/W1511087419,"The site of synthesis of 1,2-disaturated-(diacyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Sat2PC) in mouse alveolar type II cell adenomas has been studied by conducting pulse-chase experiments. Isolation of microsomal and lamellar body fractions from adenomas after a 20-min pulse with [methyl-3H]choline demonstrates that Sat2PC first appears in the microsomal fraction, and after a short lag subsequently appears in the lamellar body fraction. The kinetics of labeling of Sat2PC are consistent with the microsomal membranes functioning as the subcellular site of synthesis for this pulmonary surfactant phospholipid. Short term labeling experiments with [9,10-3H]palmitate demonstrate that this fatty acid is incorporated into the sn-2 position of Sat2PC at a faster rate than its incorporation into the sn-1 position. This finding indicates that the synthesis of Sat2PC occurs by a deacylation-reacylation mechanism."

A proposed activation mechanism for this promutagen involves sulfoxidation followed by [2,3] sigmatropic rearrangement and 1,2-elimination reactions. A portion of the highly reactive intermediate, diallate sulfoxide (proximate mutagen), is attacked by glutathione in a reaction which competes with its transformation to the ultimate mutagen, 2-chloroacrolein."

Under ordinary circumstances, most obese patients have normal insulin binding despite very high concentrations of serum insulin. These results show that insulin does not necessarily regulate its own receptor in vivo--as it does in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1545043563,"Pseudomonas citronellolis contains a single variety of pyruvate kinase regardless of the substrate on which the organism is grown. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and shown by cross-linking and gel electrophoretic studies to be a tetramer of M/sub r/ = 225,000 to 240,000. Unlike pyruvate kinases from yeast, liver, kidney, and red cells, the Pseudomonas enzyme is not affected by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. However, it is activated by 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG), an intermediate of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway which is utilized for glucose catabolism by this organism. The Pseudomonas enzyme is also activated by ribose-5-P,5'-AMP, and fructose-6-P. Kinetic studies suggest that this group of metabolites may act at a single site with KDPG activation occurring at a separate site. All of the activators function by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for P-enolpyruvate. The latter substrate shows a strong positive cooperativity with the enzyme which is lowered or abolished by the presence of the activators. A strong synergistic effect exists between KDPG and ribose-5-P as exhibited by a mutual lowering of the concentrations required for activation as well as by a more than additive effect on the enzyme's affinity for P-enolpyruvate. Pyruvate kinase from P. citronellolis also differs from most varietiesmore » of the enzyme in that it is not activated by K/sup +/ orNH/sub 4//sup +/, requires high concentrations of Mg/sup 2 +/ and is relatively nonspecific with respect to its nucleoside diphosphate substrate.« less"
