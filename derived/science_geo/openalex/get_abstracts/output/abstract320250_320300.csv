https://openalex.org/W2004304948,"Of the planets, Venus and Earth are by far the most similar in primary properties, yet they differ markedly in secondary properties. A great impact into Earth is believed to have created its moon and removed its atmosphere; the lack of such an impact into Venus apparently led to a greatly differing atmospheric evolution. The lack of an ocean on Venus prevents the recycling of volatiles and inhibits subduction, so that its crust is probably more voluminous than Earth's, although distorted and quite variable in thickness. Venus's upper mantle appears to be depleted in both volatiles and energy sources because, in addition to the lack of volatile recycling, melts of mantle rocks are more dense than their solid matrix at pressures above 8 gigapascals and hence sink if they occur at depths below 250 kilometers. Appreciable energy sources persist at great depths to sustain the few great mountain complexes. The greatest current problem is reconciling the likelihood of a voluminous crust with indications of considerable strength at shallow depths of 20 to 100 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W1970728693,"A standard notion of quantum mechanics is that all particles, elementary or composite, must fall into one of two fundamental categories: fermions or bosons. However, it has recently been discovered that there can be quantum particles which are neither fermions nor bosons. Such particles (anyons) can only occur in two spatial dimensions-yet this does not rule out their existence, for they are found as elementary excitations in confined, quasi-two-dimensional condensed-matter systems and may occur in other systems as well. An overview of the argument for the existence of anyons is presented, along with a discussion of their role in condensed-matter physics."
https://openalex.org/W2010532016,"The rotation rates of the interiors of the outer planets are normally derived from their periodic radio emissions. However, recent observations of both Jupiter and Saturn have revealed surface features with periods close to those derived for the interiors. In the study reported here, this process is carried one stage further, with the derivation of a rotation rate for the spot associated with Saturn's polar hexagon, which is simultaneously within and more accurate than the Saturnian radio period."

https://openalex.org/W4233905447,"The cover caption for the issue of 9 February 1990 should have described the molecule on the cover as VPI-5 (Dow and Virginia Polytechnic Institute), not as ALPO-5 (Union Carbide). The first sentence of the caption should have read, ""Superlattices of p-nitroaniline molecules self-assemble and orient within the polar, greater than 10 angstrom wide channels of VIP-5, a molecular sieve."" The preferred orientation of the polar molecules occurs in both materials."
