https://openalex.org/W1980046499,"The decline in the high incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinsonism, and Alzheimer-type dementia among the Chamorro population of the western Pacific islands of Guam and Rota, coupled with the absence of demonstrable viral and hereditable factors in this disease, suggests the gradual disappearance of an environmental factor selectively associated with this culture. One candidate is seed of the neurotoxic plant Cycas circinalis L., a traditional source of food and medicine which has been used less with the Americanization of the Chamorro people after World War II. Macaques were fed the Cycas amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a low-potency convulsant that has excitotoxic activity in mouse brain, which is attenuated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. These animals developed corticomoto-neuronal dysfunction, parkinsonian features, and behavioral anomalies, with chromatolytic and degenerative changes of motor neurons in cerebral cortex and spinal cord. In concert with existing epidemiological and animal data, these findings support the hypothesis that cycad exposure plays an important role in the etiology of the Guam disease."

When chicks were raised with white translucent occluders over their eyes so that either the nasal half, the temporal half, or all of the retina was visually deprived, the resulting myopia (median = -15 diopters) was limited to the deprived part of the retina, regardless of which half of the retina was visually deprived; the nondeprived part remained nearly emmetropic. Correspondingly, the vitreous chamber was elongated only in the region of the visual deprivation, resulting in eyes with different asymmetric shapes depending on which retinal region was deprived. These results argue for a local regulation of ocular growth that is dependent on vision and suggest a hypothesis to explain the epidemiological association of myopia in humans with large amounts of reading. Because most nonfoveal retinal neurons have large receptive fields, they cannot resolve the individual letters on the printed page; this may lead to their activity being less during reading than during most other forms of visual stimulation. Thus, the impoverished stimulus situation of reading may lead to myopia, as do other types of visual form deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W1992260178,"The sperm histone H2B-1 gene of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris contains two octamer sequences (ATTTGCAT) and two CCAAT motifs upstream of its TATA box. The CCAAT-binding factors present in nuclear extracts from testis and from blastula and gastrula embryos are indistinguishable by mobility shift and methylation interference analysis. However, there is a testis-specific octamer-binding factor in addition to the ubiquitous form. In DNAase I protection experiments, the CCAAT-binding factor of only the testis extract is able to interact with the sperm H2B promoter. In the two embryonic extracts a novel factor binds with high affinity to sequences overlapping the proximal CCAAT element, thus preventing the DNA interaction of the CCAAT-binding factor in the embryo where the sperm H2B gene is not expressed. This CCAAT displacement protein may therefore act as a repressor of sperm H2B gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2051393924,"Regenerating sensory axons in the dorsal roots of adult mammals are stopped at the junction between the root and spinal cord by reactive astrocytes. Do these cells stop axonal elongation by activating the physiological mechanisms that normally operate to stop axons during development, or do they physically obstruct the elongating axons? In order to distinguish these possibilities, the cytology of the axon tips of regenerating axons that were stopped by astrocytes was compared with the axon tips that were physically obstructed at a cul-de-sac produced by ligating a peripheral nerve. The terminals of the physically obstructed axon tips were distended with neurofilaments and other axonally transported structures that had accumulated when the axons stopped elongating. By contrast, neurofilaments did not accumulate in the tips of regenerating axons that were stopped by spinal cord astrocytes at the dorsal root transitional zone. These axo-glial terminals resembled the terminals that axons make on target neurons during normal development. On the basis of these observations, astrocytes appear to stop axons from regenerating in the mammalian spinal cord by activating the physiological stop pathway that is built into the axon and that normally operates when axons form stable terminals on target cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013629751,"The genetics of spirochetes, a division of eubacteria, has been little studied. Double-stranded linear plasmids were found in Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. A 49-kilobase linear plasmid contained the ospA and ospB genes, which encode the major outer membrane proteins of strain B31. Molecules of the 49-kilobase plasmid rapidly reannealed after alkaline denaturation; rapid renaturation was prevented if the 49-kilobase plasmids were first treated with S1 nuclease. When denatured plasmid molecules were examined directly, single-stranded circles of approximately 100-kilobase circumference were seen. These studies provide direct visual evidence that the linear plasmids have covalently closed ends. This form of DNA occurs in some animal viruses, but it has not heretofore been described in prokaryotic organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1990794432,"The nuclear cyt-18 mutants of Neurospora crassa are defective in splicing a number of group I introns in mitochondria. Here, cloning and sequencing of the cyt-18 gene show that it contains an open reading frame having significant homology to bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases. Biochemical and genetic experiments lead to the conclusions that the cyt-18 gene encodes mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, that mutations in this gene inhibit splicing directly, and that mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase or a derivative of this protein is related to the soluble activity that functions in splicing the mitochondrial large rRNA intron and possibly other group I introns. Analysis of partial revertants provides direct evidence that the cyt-18 gene encodes a protein or proteins with two activities, splicing and aminoacylation, that can be partially separated by mutation. Our findings may be relevant to the evolution of introns and splicing mechanisms in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2138122506,"The expression of a subset of homologous genes of the AS-C is required during embryogenesis and metamorphosis for proper neural development. Here we study the expression of three of these genes (T3, T4, and T5) and show that their transcripts accumulate at the blastoderm stage in periodic patterns coincident with the dorsoventral extent of the neuroectoderm. Subsequent expression is in partially overlapping patterns that correlate with the segregation of neuroblasts. These genes are not transcribed in neurons. We also show that a deficiency for the AS-C prevents the appearance of at least one identified class of neuroblasts. We propose that the AS-C is part of a network of genes responsible for the segregation of neuroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2091895871,"Removal of the representation of a specific body part in the postcentral cortex of the macaque resulted in the somatic deactivation of the corresponding body part in the second somatosensory area. In contrast, removal of the entire second somatosensory area had no grossly detectable effect on the somatic responsivity of neurons in the postcentral cortex. This direct electrophysiological evidence for serial cortical processing in somesthesia is similar to that found earlier for vision and, taken together with recent anatomical evidence, suggests that there is a common cortical plan for the processing of sensory information in the various sensory modalities."
https://openalex.org/W1976248874,"The ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient sparse fur mouse is an excellent model to study the most common human urea cycle disorder. The mutation has been well characterized by both biochemical and enzymological methods, but its exact nature has not been revealed. A single base substitution in the complementary DNA for ornithine transcarbamylase from the sparse fur mouse has been identified by means of a combination of two recently described techniques for rapid mutational analysis. This strategy is simpler than conventional complementary DNA library construction, screening, and sequencing, which has often been used to find a new mutation. The ornithine transcarbamylase gene in the sparse fur mouse contains a C to A transversion that alters a histidine residue to an asparagine residue at amino acid 117."

https://openalex.org/W2017943437,"A laser photolysis technique has been developed to assess the quantitative significance of the delay time of hemoglobin S gelation to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Changes in the saturation of hemoglobin S with carbon monoxide produced by varying the intensity of a photolytic laser beam were used to simulate changes in the saturation of oxyhemoglobin S produced by variations in oxygen pressure. The presence of polymer at steady-state saturation with carbon monoxide was determined by measurement of the kinetics of gelation after complete photodissociation. The kinetics are a very sensitive probe for polymer since small amounts of polymerized hemoglobin increase the rate of nucleation sufficiently to eliminate the delay period. First, the equilibrium gelation properties of partially photodissociated carbonmonoxyhemoglobin S were shown to be the same as partially oxygenated hemoglobin S, and the method was then used to determine the effect of saturation on the formation and disappearance of polymers in individual sickle cells. The saturation at which polymers first formed upon deoxygenation was much lower than the saturation at which polymers disappeared upon reoxygenation. The results indicate that at venous saturations with oxygen, gelation takes place in most cells at equilibrium, but is prevented from occurring in vivo because the delay times are sufficiently long that most cells return to the lungs and are reoxygenated before polymerization has begun."
https://openalex.org/W2040052703,Abnormal accumulation of connective tissue in blood vessels contributes to alterations in vascular physiology associated with disease states such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Elastin synthesis was studied in blood vessels from newborn calves with severe pulmonary hypertension induced by alveolar hypoxia in order to investigate the cellular stimuli that elicit changes in pulmonary arterial connective tissue production. A two- to fourfold increase in elastin production was observed in pulmonary artery tissue and medial smooth muscle cells from hypertensive calves. This stimulation of elastin production was accompanied by a corresponding increase in elastin messenger RNA consistent with regulation at the transcriptional level. Conditioned serum harvested from cultures of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells isolated from hypertensive animals contained one or more low molecular weight elastogenic factors that stimulated the production of elastin in both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and altered the chemotactic responsiveness of fibroblasts to elastin peptides. These results suggest that connective tissue changes in the pulmonary vasculature in response to pulmonary hypertension are orchestrated by the medial smooth muscle cell through the generation of specific differentiation factors that alter both the secretory phenotype and responsive properties of surrounding cells.
https://openalex.org/W2076066188,"One of the crucial issues in biological electron transfer is the determination of the role of spatially intermediate amino acid residues in controlling or directing the electronic tunneling interaction between redox sites. A quantum path integral Monte Carlo method is developed for the analysis of electronic tunneling pathways in a highly structured environment. This path integral method is applied to intramolecular electron transfer in a ruthenium-modified myoglobin that contains a tryptophan in the ""line-of-flight."" A principal result is the identification of the relevant cylindrical zone swept out by the tunneling electron."
https://openalex.org/W2005097302,"A general transcription factor (BTF3) has been purified from HeLa whole cell extracts and shown to be required for accurate initiation of transcription from the adenovirus-2 major late promoter (Ad2MLP) and other RNA polymerase class B promoters. We show that purified BTF3 (27 kd) binds to RNA polymerase B (II), forming a complex that is transcriptionally active. We found no evidence that purified BTF3 interacts with DNA or is required for the formation of the stable preinitiation complex."

https://openalex.org/W2071684896,"Apparent motion was used to explore humans' ability to perceive the direction of motion in the visual field. A marked qualitative difference in this ability was found between short- and long-range motion. For short-range motion, the detection of the direction of motion is characterized by parallel operation over a wide visual field (that is, detection performance is independent of the number of objects in an array). When the positional displacement is large relative to an object's size, the direction of motion is detected in a serial manner. The process of detection is limited in this case by the ability to detect other events, such as appearance and disappearance of an object, and the ability to compute their spatio-temporal relations. The results are consistent with a previously suggested division of the motion detection system into short- and long-range processes. The direction of short-range motion can be perceived in parallel (preattentively), whereas long-range motion is attentive and requires more complicated computations. It seems that the detection of long-range motion is a conjunction task, combining the detection of disappearance and appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2088181810,"The cerebellar cortex is perhaps the best characterized structure in the mammalian central nervous system. Although the major cerebellar cell classes are well known, a new class of cerebellar cortical neuron has now been identified with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) generated by a procedure for rapid immunization and selective immunosuppression of antibody responses. This procedure generates a high frequency of immunoglobulin G-class antibodies of desired specificity, and has allowed the generation of two antibodies that recognize subsets of cerebellar cortical neurons. One of these antibodies defines a previously unrecognized class of cerebellar neuron. The distribution and antigenic characteristics of this neuron suggest that it has a distinct role in cerebellar circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W1982578078,"Fragile X syndrome is a common form of mental retardation associated with a fragile site on the human X chromosome. Although fragility at this site is usually evident as a nonstaining chromatid gap, it remains unclear whether or not actual chromosomal breakage occurs. By means of somatic cell hybrids containing either a normal human X or a fragile X chromosome and utilizing two genes that flank the fragile site as markers of chromosome integrity, segregation of these markers was shown to be more frequent if they encompass the fragile site under appropriate culture conditions. Hybrid cells that reveal marker segregation were found to contain rearranged X chromosomes involving the region at or near the fragile site, thus demonstrating true chromosomal breakage within this area. Two independent translocation chromosomes were identified involving a rodent chromosome joined to the human X at the location of the fragile site. DNA analysis of closely linked, flanking loci was consistent with the position of the breakpoint being at or very near the fragile X site. Fragility at the translocation junctions was observed in both hybrids, but at significantly lower frequencies than that seen in the intact X of the parental hybrid. This observation suggests that the human portion of the junctional DNA may contain part of a repeated fragility sequence. Since the translocation junctions join heterologous DNA, the molecular cloning of the fragile X sequence should now be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2025415842,"In the past, the damage patterns produced on the papilla of the chick by loud pure tones of different frequencies have been used to study the development of sound analysis by the hair cells of the basilar papilla. One conclusion from these data was that the best response frequency of individual hair cells changes substantially with age. However, this method has been criticized as unreliable. Now experiments have been performed in which single characterized nerve fibers were stained with horseradish peroxidase to permit the unequivocal localization of specific frequency responses in the papillae of chicks of different ages (2 and 21 days after hatching). There was no statistically significant change in the tonotopic organization of the papilla between the two groups of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2040008847,"The function and morphology of retinal ganglion cells in the adult mammalian visual system has been well studied, but little is known about how the adult state is achieved. To address this question, the morphological changes that retinal ganglion cells undergo during development were studied. Ganglion cells were first identified by retrograde labeling with rhodamine latex microspheres deposited in retinorecipient targets in fetal and early postnatal cats. The structure of ganglion cells was then revealed by intracellular injection of Lucifer yellow in living retinas removed and maintained in vitro. As early as 2 weeks before birth, a morphologically diverse assortment of ganglion cells is present, some of which resemble the alpha, beta, and gamma classes found in the adult. However, in contrast to the adult, developing ganglion cells exhibit several transient features, including excessive axonal and dendritic branching and exuberant somatic and dendritic spines. These morphological features indicate that there is a transient network of connectivity that could play an important role in the final determination of retinal ganglion cell form and function."
https://openalex.org/W2101413272,"The mammalian visual system has a hierarchic structure with extensive reciprocal connections. A model is proposed in which the feedback pathways serve to modify afferent sensory stimuli in ways that enhance and complete sensory input patterns, suppress irrelevant features, and generate quasi-sensory patterns when afferent stimulation is weak or absent. Such inversion of sensory coding and feature extraction can be achieved by optimization processes in which scalar responses derived from high-level neural analyzers are used as cost functions to modify the filter properties of more peripheral sensory relays. An optimization algorithm, Alopex, which is used in the model, is readily implemented with known neural circuitry. The functioning of the system is investigated by computer simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2034543768,"Quantitative autoradiography of brain glucose metabolism has been combined with digital image processing to represent the brain as a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of brain energy use. Autoradiographs contain enormous amounts of potentially useful data, but conventional analyses, based on tedious manual methods, can sample and analyze only a small portion of this information. Computer 3-D reconstruction provides a mechanism for observing and analyzing all the data; therefore, a system of computer programs was developed for this purpose. The programs use digital imaging methods for image registration, superimpose whole brain data sets, and allow resampling of the 3-D data in arbitrary planes for pixel-by-pixel comparisons among multiple 3-D sets. These programs operate on the mathematical properties of the images alone, obviating the need for manual image alignment. Various statistical analyses can be applied to the data directly to study the patterns of metabolic changes in different experiments. The system is applied to data from experiments on the influence of injectable anesthetics on cerebral glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2007085241,"Thirty years have elapsed since Wald and his colleagues showed that 11-cis retinal was isomerized to all-trans when rhodopsin was bleached, yet little has been understood about the reverse process that generates 11-cis retinal for rhodopsin regeneration. It is not known whether the isomerization is enzyme-mediated, whether it occurs in the pigment epithelium or in the retina, or whether retinal, retinol, or a retinyl ester is the vitamin A compound that is isomerized. Radiolabeled all-trans retinol and high-performance liquid chromatography have now been used to demonstrate the existence of an eye-specific, membrane-bound enzyme (retinol isomerase) that converts all-trans to 11-cis retinol in the dark. Retinol isomerase is concentrated in the pigment epithelium; this localization clarifies the role of this tissue in rhodopsin regeneration and explains the need to transfer all-trans retinol from the rod outer segments to the pigment epithelium during the visual cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2007543173,"Factors that regulate synaptic specificity were investigated with Aplysia buccal and bag cell neurons in primary cell culture. In the presence of fetal calf serum electrical synapses are formed between buccal-buccal or bag-bag cell pairs, but not between buccal-bag cell pairs. Instead, buccal neurons make inhibitory chemical synapses on bag cells. However, in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of the lectin concanavalin A this pattern changes, such that more than 75 percent of buccal-bag pairs exhibit electrical synapses and the frequency of occurrence of buccal-bag chemical synapses is reduced. Such changes in synaptic specificity may be important in determining the types of synapses formed during neuronal development and neurite regeneration."

Several unanswered questions were made much clearer by a visit to the decontaminated and operating power plant at Chernobyl and by discussions with Soviet scientists. The visit gives us insights into the way the Soviets design their technology, the consequences of the accident, and the magnificent way they coped with the disaster. Although there are general conclusions to be drawn for the rest of the world, such as the realization that operators of technological systems can and will deliberately cut out safety systems, the primary specific conclusion is to be grateful that the West did not follow the Soviet route in its development of nuclear power."
