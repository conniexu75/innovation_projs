https://openalex.org/W1992095148,"A great deal of data has been amassed suggesting that cationic peptides are able to translocate into eucaryotic cells in a temperature-independent manner. Although such peptides are widely used to promote the intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules, the mechanism by which this cell-penetrating activity occurs still remains unclear. Here, we present an in vitro study of the cellular uptake of peptides, originally deriving from protegrin (the SynB peptide vectors), that have also been shown to enhance the transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier. In parallel, we have examined the internalization process of two lipid-interacting peptides, SynB5 and pAntp-(43–58), the latter corresponding to the translocating segment of the Antennapedia homeodomain. We report a quantitative study of the time- and dose-dependence of internalization and demonstrate that these peptides accumulate inside vesicular structures. Furthermore, we have examined the role of endocytotic pathways in this process using a variety of metabolic and endocytosis inhibitors. We show that the internalization of these peptides is a temperature- and energy-dependent process and that endosomal transport is a key component of the mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest that SynB and pAntp-(43–58) peptides penetrate into cells by an adsorptive-mediated endocytosis process rather than temperature-independent translocation.

A large number of hydrophilic molecules such as peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides are poorly internalized by cells because they cross the lipid matrix of the plasma membrane rather inefficiently. This is considered to be a major limitation for their use as therapeutic agents in biomedical research and the pharmaceutical industry. However, it has been reported that the use of short (10–30 amino acids) cationic peptides may provide a solution by enhancing the intracellular delivery of such intractable molecules, both in vitro and in vivo (see reviews in Refs. 1Lindgren M.

Hällbrink M. Zorko M. Langel U. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), model amphipathic peptide (MAP) (8Oehlke J. Scheller A. Wiesner B. Krause E. Beyermann M. Klauschenz E.

Biol. 1998; 162: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, the SynB peptides constitute a distinct family of vectors that derive from protegrin 1 (PG-1), an antimicrobial peptide (11Kokryakov V.N. Harwig S.S. Panyutich E.A. Shevchenko A.A. Aleshina G.M. Shamova O.V. Korneva H.A. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). As reported previously, PG-1, the amphipathic structure of which is stabilized by two disulfide bridges (12Aumelas A. Mangoni M. Roumestand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy G. Calas B. Chavanieu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is believed to exert its antibiotic action by forming pores in the lipid matrix of bacterial membranes (13Mangoni M.E. Aumelas A. Charnet P. Roumestand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy G. Calas B. Chavanieu A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Sokolov Y. Mirzabekov T. Martin D. Lehrer R.I. Kagan B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1420: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that this pore formation depends critically on a cyclic, disulfide-bonded structure (13Mangoni M.E. Aumelas A. Charnet P. Roumestand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy G. Calas B. Chavanieu A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we designed two analogs, SynB1 and SynB3, that lack the cysteine residues. We then investigated whether these linear peptides, which possess the multiple positive charges of PG-1, were able to penetrate into eukaryotic cells without disrupting the cell membrane. This was shown to be the case, with SynB1 and SynB3 efficiently promoting the transport of various drugs such as doxorubicin and benzylpenicillin (15Rousselle C. Clair P. Lefauconnier J.M. Kaczorek M. Scherrmann J.M. Temsamani J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 16Rousselle C. Clair P. Temsamani J. Scherrmann J.M. J. Drug Target. 2002; 10: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) across the blood-brain barrier of in vivo models. An unexpected benefit of the “vectorization” of the PG-p substrate doxorubicin was that its accumulation and potency in resistant K562 cells was improved drastically (17Mazel M. Clair P. Rousselle C. Vidal P. Scherrmann J.M. Mathieu D. Temsamani J. Anticancer Drugs. 2001; 12: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Understanding the mode of entry of the SynB peptides and defining their intracellular localization are of particular interest for the design of conjugates which, once internalized in target cells, may efficiently release an attached drug in its native state. Several previous studies have proposed that the penetration of CPPs (such as pAntp-(43–58), Tat-(48–60), MAP, and Transportan) into eukaryotic cells occurs in a temperature-independent manner (4Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1414: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using various metabolic or endocytosis inhibitors, it has been suggested that the cell-penetrating ability of some CPPs is likely to be an energy-independent, non-endocytotic process (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar, 7Pooga M. Hällbrink M. Zorko M. Langel U.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Additional studies showed that the cell penetration of enantio or inverso forms of peptides such as MAP or pAntp-(43–58) was as efficient as that of the parent peptides (8Oehlke J. Scheller A. Wiesner B. Krause E. Beyermann M. Klauschenz E. Melzig M. Bienert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 19Scheller A. Oehlke J. Wiesner B.

Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), suggesting that their internalization is not dependent on a chiral receptor. To explain these observations, it has been mainly proposed that the hydrophobicity and amphipathicity of CPPs confers on them the ability to interact with and pass through the lipid matrix of the plasma membrane via an energy-independent process termed translocation (1Lindgren M. Hällbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 7Pooga M. Hällbrink M. Zorko M. Langel U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In accord with this model, biophysical studies have indicated that pAntp-(43–58), Transportan, or MAP can interact with lipid vesicles while adopting a helical structure (21Berlose J.P. Convert O. Derossi D. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 372-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Dathe M. Schümann M. Wieprecht T. Winkler A. Beyermann M. Krause E.

Acta. 2001; 1512: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on several reports indicating that amphipathic anti-microbial and venom peptides are able to cross lipid bilayers (see review in Ref. 25Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), we measured the ability of pAntp-(43–58) to pass from the outer to the inner leaflet of a phospholipid membrane. However, our data revealed an absence of spontaneous translocation despite the lipid-binding ability of this CPP (26Drin G. Déméné H. Temsamani J. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In a similar biophysical study, we demonstrate that PG-1 is able to cross the membrane of phospholipidic vesicles but that a linear analogue, SynB5, is not able to do this despite having a similar lipid-binding activity. This suggested, and was subsequently borne out, that similar linear vectors may also lack the translocation property of the protegrins (27Drin G. Temsamani J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1559: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Having said that, artificial phospholipid bilayers may not be an ideal, realistic experimental model in which to investigate CPP passage across the plasma membrane. Therefore, it seemed important to directly examine in cells whether the uptake of diverse SynB peptides was related to the translocation mechanism described for others CPPs or depended on a metabolic cellular process. In this study, we examine the cell uptake of the SynB1 and SynB3 peptides (Table I) compared with that of pAntp-(43–58). We also examine the internalization of SynB5, for which we have also measured its translocation activity in lipid vesicles (27Drin G. Temsamani J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1559: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because these four cationic peptides differ in terms of hydrophobicity and/or helical amphipathicity (Table I), this study could also indicate whether their individual physicochemical properties conferred on them specific mechanistic preferences.Table IName, sequence and physicochemical features of cell-penetrating peptidesPeptideSequenceaThe basic residues are indicated in boldfaced type.LengthNet Charge〈H〉bThe mean hydrophobicity H and mean helical hydrophobic moment μH of each peptide was calculated following the Eisenberg formula (31) with the hydrophobic scale of Fauchère and Pliska, based on the octanol/water partition of individual N-acetyl amino acid residues (32).〈μH〉bThe mean hydrophobicity H and mean helical hydrophobic moment μH of each peptide was calculated following the Eisenberg formula (31) with the hydrophobic scale of Fauchère and Pliska, based on the octanol/water partition of individual N-acetyl amino acid residues (32).SynB1RGGRLSYSRRRFSTSTGR186-0.10.158SynB3RRLSYSRRRF105-0.1240.361SynB5RGGRLAYLRRRWAVLGR1860.2380.213pAntp-(43-58)RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK1670.1930.33a The basic residues are indicated in boldfaced type.b The mean hydrophobicity H and mean helical hydrophobic moment μH of each peptide was calculated following the Eisenberg formula (31Eisenberg D.

Open table in a new tab We have measured time- and dose-dependence of the CPPs uptake into K562 cells and examined the influence of various metabolic and endocytosis inhibitors on the internalization. We have also carried out complementary experiments to measure the diffusion of pAntp-(43–58) through a lipid bilayer and examined the effect of cell fixation on the intracellular localization of CPPs. Our results indicate that SynB and pAntp-(43–58) peptides penetrate into cells via an adsorptive-mediated endocytosis process rather than a temperature-independent translocation mechanism. Materials—Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS (High Load) and Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Perseptive Biosystems (Hamburg, Germany). Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included N,N′-diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIPCDI, Fluka), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, Fluka), dimethylformamide (DMF, Perseptive Biosystems), 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD-Cl, Fluka), and 5-(and-6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sodium dithionite, sodium azide, N-ethylmaleimide, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, vinblastine, nocodazole, cytochalasin D, bafilomycin A1, chloroquine, nystatin, digitonin, Lucifer Yellow (LY), poly-l-lysine, valinomycin, Triton X-100, and trypsin were supplied by Sigma. Calcein-AM, FITC-transferrin (Tf), Texas Red-Tf, and DiSC3 (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Reagents for cell biology including Opti-MEM, RPMI 1640, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. The lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescent Labeling—All peptides were synthesized according to the Fmoc-tert-butyl strategy using an AMS 422 multiple peptide synthesizer (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany). Labeling of the N terminus of peptides with the NBD or TAMRA probe was achieved as follow. Briefly, resin-bound peptide was treated with piperidine (20% (v/v) in dimethylformamide) in order to remove the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group. NBD-Cl or TAMRA was added in dry dimethylformamide (5-fold molar excess) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA; 2-fold molar excess) for 6 h under agitation in the dark to selectively label the N-terminal amino group. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and treated with deprotecting mixture to cleave the peptides from the resin and deprotect the side chains. For labeling the CoxIV peptide, the deprotected peptide was S-alkylated with N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylene-diamine (IANBD) amide (Molecular Probes) on cysteine residues in dimethylformamide. Peptide purification was carried out by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Water-prep LC 40, Waters) using a 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient. Purity, as assessed by reverse phase analytic chromatography (Beckman Gold equipped with a diode array detector), was >95% for all peptides by the criterion of relative UV absorbencies at 220 nm and at either 460 (for NBD-labeled peptides) or 540 nm (for TAMRA-labeled peptides). The molecular masses were validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDITOF MS; Voyager Elite, Perseptive Biosystems). The peptide concentration of unlabeled peptide was determined by absorption spectroscopy, considering the extinction coefficient of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine equal to 5680, 1270, and 260 m–1 cm–1, respectively, at 280 nm. For NBD- and TAMRA-labeled peptides, the extinction coefficients provided by the probe manufacturer were used. Cell Culture—K562 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (Invitrogen) without antibiotics. Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Quantification of Internalized NBD-labeled Peptides—K562 cells were diluted to 3 × 105 cells·ml–1 in culture medium 1 day before the experiment. Cell association and internalization of peptides were measured by flow cytometry using a FACSCaliber (BD Biosciences) driven by the CellQuest software. The flow cytometer was periodically calibrated using fluorescent beads (Calibrite3, BD Biosciences). The day of the experiment the cells were counted, centrifuged, and resuspended in pre-warmed Opti-MEM (37 °C) to obtain a suspension at 6 × 105 cells·ml–1. After a 1-h incubation, the NBD-labeled peptides were incubated with K562 cells in the same medium at 37 °C (final volume was 0.5 ml). Thereafter, the cells were washed twice and resuspended in 0.5 ml (final volume) of ice-cold PBS for flow cytometry analysis. Cell-associated fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 525 nm. A cytogram (1 × 104 counts) was acquired, and the cells exhibiting a normal morphology (∼95% of the total, unless otherwise specified) were taken into account to obtain a histogram of fluorescence intensity per cell. The calculated mean of this distribution was considered as representative of the amount of cell-associated peptides. A stock solution of dithionite (1 m) was freshly prepared in 1 m Tris solution (pH 10). Following flow cytometry analysis, 5 μl of dithionite stock solution was added to cells maintained at 4 °C, and the fluorescence of internalized peptides was measured after 5 min. Peptide and Endocytosis Marker Visualization—TAMRA-labeled peptides (1–3 μm) were incubated with K562 cells in an Opti-MEM medium at 37 °C for 90 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 20 μl (final volume) in the same buffer. Suspensions were plated on glass slides and observed immediately without fixation. For visualizing the intracellular localization of Tf or LY, the cells were incubated with either Texas Red-Tf (incubated for 30 min at 25 μg·ml–1)orLY(90minat1mg·ml–1), washed with ice-cold PBS, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 45 min, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min, washed, and mounted with PermaFluor® (CML). Confocal images were obtained with a DMR-B Leica microscope equipped with a argon-krypton ion laser with the excitation line at 488 nm or 568 nm (the emission filter was at 525 and 600 nm, respectively) and fitted with a PerkinElmer Ultraview module (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were observed with a 100× oil immersion PL AZO HCX lens. The images were captured with a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) at 696 × 520 pixel resolution. The whole set was controlled with the Meta-Morph software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Quantification of Receptor-mediated and Fluid Phase Endocytosis— K562 cells were incubated in Opti-MEM at 37 °C with FITC-Tf (25 μg·ml–1) for 30 min or LY (1 mg·ml–1) for 90 min at 37 °C in Opti-MEM. The uptake was stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold PBS (the final volume was 0.5 ml). Cell-associated fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 525 nm. A histogram was generated, and the calculated mean of the distribution of fluorescence intensity per cell (104 counts) was considered as representative of the amount of markers associated with the cells. Calcein-AM Release Assay—The cells were incubated with 2.5 μm calcein-AM for 60 min in Opti-MEM, washed, resuspended in the same volume of calcein-free Opti-MEM, and incubated with peptide for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and the calcein content of cells was determined by flow cytometry. Digitonin (100 μg·ml–1) induced the complete lysis of K562 cells after an incubation of 90 min. The apparent percent leakage value was calculated according to the equation 100 × (F – F 0)/(F max – F 0). F 0 and F max correspond to the mean fluorescence intensity associated with normal cells and digitonin-treated cells, respectively. F represents the fluorescence of the calcein-loaded cells incubated with the peptides. Metabolic and Endocytosis Inhibitor Studies—For experiments at a low temperature, the cells were maintained for 30 min on ice before peptide incubation and throughout the experiment. To induce ATP depletion, the cells were incubated for 60 min with 0.1% sodium azide and 50 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) in Opti-MEM prior to the addition of peptide. The ATP cellular concentration was determined using the bioluminescent assay kit from Sigma according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luminescent signal was measured in a 96-well plate with a Tecan Spectrafluor reader. The inhibition of microtubule polymerization was induced by treating cells with vinblastine or nocodazole at 10 μm or 20 μm, respectively, 1 h prior to the addition of peptide. Cytochalasin D was added at 10 μm for 1 h prior to the addition of peptide to block actin polymerization. For NEM treatment, cells were exposed to NEM (10 μm) in Opti-MEM for 5 min and then washed in a NEM-free medium containing the peptide. The neutralization of pH in intracellular acidic compartments was achieved by pre-incubating cells with 10 mm NH4CL for 10 min or with 50 μm chloroquine or 200 nm bafilomycin A1 for 30 min before peptide addition. For the nystatin treatment, cells were exposed to the reagent at 25 μg·ml–1 for 30 min before the addition of the peptide. Inhibition assays with poly-l-lysine were performed by incubating the peptide for 15 min with cells in the absence or presence of the compound (300 μm). Prior to these experiments, we made sure that the various inhibitors were used at a concentration that maintained the plasma membrane integrity by performing a calcein-AM assay. Measure of Peptide Translocation in Lipidic Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by drying a lipid film of POPC and POPG (at a 3:1 molar ratio) for 3 h and then resuspending the lipids in buffer (20 mm Tris and 100 mm KCl, pH 7). The lipid suspension was freeze-thawed for five cycles and then extruded through polycarbonate filters (0.1-μm pore size) 21 times. Valinomycin (22.5 μm in ethanol) was added to the large unilamellar vesicles at a lipid-to-valinomycin molar ratio of ∼10,000. The lipid concentration was determined in duplicate by phosphorus analysis as described previously (28Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed in 3-ml quartz cells at 25 ± 0.1 °C under constant magnetic stirring using a SLM AB-2 spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). For measuring the NBD-labeled peptide translocation, excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 460–485 nm and 530–540 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission band pass values were set at 4 nm for both cases. In the translocation assays, the membrane potential was generated by diluting 100-fold valinomycin-containing vesicles in KCl-free buffer (20 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7). The presence of the negative potential was assessed in a separate assay by measuring the fluorescence of DiSC3 (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar) probes (λex = 622 nm; λem = 670 nm) as described previously (29Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C. Hoffma J.F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Time Course—In previously published studies, we have described a method based on the chemical quenching of the NBD fluorophore by the membrane-impermeant dithionite, allowing direct measurement of the amount of internalized NBD-labeled peptide (30Drin G. Mazel M. Clair P. Mathieu D. Kaczorek M. Temsamani J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To obtain information about the time course of the internalization of the SynB peptides and the pAntp-(43–58) peptide (Table I), we have applied the NBD/dithionite assay to K562 cells incubated with each NBD-labeled peptide for different incubation times (from 0 to 120 min). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the cell uptake of the SynB and pAntp-(43–58) peptides takes place in the first minutes and reaches a maximum after ∼1 h. Fig. 1A also demonstrates that the d-amino acid analogs of SynB1 and SynB3 penetrate into cells as efficiently as their l-amino acid counterparts for the first hour. Furthermore, it can be seen that, over the 2-h period of exposure, the cumulative amounts of internalized d-SynB1 and d-SynB3 were higher than those of the l-counterparts. We believe this may arise from retention of the d-peptides within the endosome compartment, partly due to their resistance to proteolysis. Concentration Dependence of Peptide Internalization and Cell Lytic Activity—The dependence of the initial rate of cellular uptake on peptide concentration (0–40 μm) was examined in K562 cells over a period of 15 min. To control for cell integrity, we used a calcein-AM retention assay in which we observed that unlabeled SynB1 and SynB3 did not significantly increase plasma membrane permeability (>90% of the cell population retained calcein). In contrast, the SynB5 and pAntp-(43–58) peptides at 40 μm started inducing the cell-lysis (Fig. 2A). The amount of internalized SynB peptides increased linearly with concentration (Fig. 2B), implying the absence of saturation in their cellular accumulation. Both the l- and d-forms of SynB1 and SynB3 showed similar behavior. At low concentrations, we observed a higher level of internalization of pAntp-(43–58) and SynB5 than SynB1 and SynB3. However, the lytic activity of SynB5 and pAntp-(43–58) at concentrations above 12 μm and 30 μm, respectively, prevented an investigation of the full range of concentrations for these peptides.

We show that during this phase, AIF is selectively released from the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and that Bax undergo conformational change, relocation to mitochondria, and insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane, in a Bid-independent manner. We analyzed the subcellular distribution of cathepsins (Cat) B, D, and L, in a search for caspase-independent factors responsible for Bax activation and AIF release. All were translocated from lysosomes to the cytosol, in correlation with limited destabilization of the lysosomes and release of lysosomal molecules in a size selective manner. However, only inhibition of Cat D activity by pepstatin A inhibited the early apoptotic events and delayed cell death, even in the presence of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar type H+-ATPase, which inhibits acidification in lysosomes. Small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing was used to inactivate Cat D, Bax, and AIF gene expression. This allowed us to define a novel sequence of events in which Cat D triggers Bax activation, Bax induces the selective release of mitochondrial AIF, and the latter is responsible for the early apoptotic phenotype.

If activated primary T lymphocytes are exposed to apoptotic stimuli that do not rely on death receptors (such as anti-CD2 and staurosporine), they undergo a definitive sequence of apoptotic events (1Dumont C.

Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 371Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This sequence begins with an early phase of commitment to apoptosis, characterized by cell shrinkage, peripheral chromatin condensation, and the partial efflux of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 1The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; Baf A1, bafilomycin A1; Cat, cathepsin; Cox II, cytochrome c oxydase subunit II; EndoG, endonuclease G; IL, interleukin; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; siRNA, small interfering RNA; STS, staurosporine; tBid, truncated Bid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; fmk, fluoromethylketone. from mitochondria to the cytosol and the nucleus. No caspase activation is observed and thus, internucleosomic DNA fragmentation does not occur. Cytochrome c is subsequently released from mitochondria, and the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) is simultaneously dissipated. These two events constitute a “point of no-return” coinciding with amplification of the caspase cascade and achievement of the apoptotic phenotype. AIF is an apoptogenic flavoprotein, which resides in the intermembrane space of mitochondria and is translocated, in a caspase-independent manner, to the cytosol and the nucleus in response to apoptotic stimuli (3Susin S.A.

In the nuclei, it stimulates peripheral chromatin condensation and large-scale 50-kb DNA fragmentation (5Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F.

The partial release of mitochondrial AIF, but not of cytochrome c, observed in T cells after their commitment to apoptosis, suggests that only limited permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) occurs at this time. In neurons treated with camptothecin, AIF release is dependent on Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family (7Cregan S.P. Fortin A. MacLaurin J.G. Callaghan S.M. Cecconi F. Yu S.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Park D.S. Kroemer G. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, the mitochondrial release of WAH-1, a homolog of AIF, is promoted by the BH3-domain protein, EGL-1 (8Wang X. Yang C. Chai J. Shi Y. Xue D. Science. 2002; 298: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We therefore thought that Bax might cause AIF relocation in the cells of our system. Bax is present as an inactive monomer in the cytosol. Upon the induction of apoptosis, it is translocated to mitochondria, and becomes inserted via its C terminus into the OMM, where it forms homo-oligomers, provoking membrane permeabilization (9Wolter K.G.

These events require Bax to undergo a conformational change leading to the exposure of cryptic epitopes at the N terminus of the molecule (10Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Formation of the active conformation of Bax can be promoted by Bid, a BH3-only protein, present in its full-length inactive form in the cytosol. Bid is activated by proteolytic cleavage to generate a truncated molecule, tBid, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Although tBid is also translocated from the cytosol to become an integral mitochondrial membrane protein, it can induce formation of the active Bax configuration in the cytosol by direct Bid/Bax interaction (15Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). There are also Bid-independent pathways of Bax insertion into the mitochondria as demonstrated by the use of Bid –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts treated with anti-TNFα (16Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G.

Bax translocation/membrane insertion and cell death may also occur following pH modifications (17Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of mitochondrial perturbation in activated T lymphocytes entering the caspase-independent phase of commitment to apoptosis, and to identify the upstream molecular effectors responsible. We found that Bax was indeed activated, and this led us to analyze the role of noncaspase proteases in this process. We focused in particular on lysosomal proteases, given that these proteases are able to substitute for caspases in a number of apoptotic models (reviewed in Refs. 19Johnson D.E. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungercar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oreic K. Turk V. Biol.

Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsins (Cat) and the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing (22McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) to target Cat D, Bax, and AIF mRNAs, demonstrated that Cat D, which is translocated from lysosomes to the cytosol upon apoptotic signaling, is the earliest event triggering a rapid change in Bax conformation together with insertion of this protein to the OMM. These events, which are independent of Bid cleavage/translocation, result in mild OMM permeabilization, the effects of which are limited to AIF release. AIF triggers in turn the early apoptotic phenotype induced by staurosporine (STS) in activated T lymphocytes. T Lymphocyte Isolation, Culture Conditions, and Cell Death Induction—Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from blood bank leukophoresis packs obtained from healthy volunteers (Etablissement Français du Sang). Adherent cells were removed by incubation on plastic dishes and passage over nylon wool columns. T lymphocytes were stimulated for 4 days with 2 μg/ml of the mitogenic GT2+T111 CD2 mAb pair kindly given by Dr. A. Bernard (U 343, Nice, France) plus 100 units/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2). Primary discontinuous density Percoll gradients (Amersham Biosciences) were used to isolate large activated T cells as previously described (1Dumont C. Durrbach A. Bidere N. Rouleau M. Kroemer G. Bernard G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Susin S.A. Senik A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bidere N. Briet M. Durrbach A. Dumont C. Feldmann J.

These cells were exposed to 100–350 nm staurosporine (Sigma) for 90 min. Shrunken cells resulting from this treatment were isolated on a second density Percoll gradient. In some experiments, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were separated prior to stimulation by immunomagnetic selection using anti-CD8 or anti-CD4-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn). To evaluate changes in inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential ΔΨm, cells were stained for 15 min at 37° with 40 nm of the potential sensitive fluorescent dye DiOC6 (3,3′-diethyloxacarbocyanine) from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Cells with complete ΔΨm loss were obtained by a-10 min incubation with 5 μm m-ClCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, from Sigma). Condensed nuclei were examined after incubation of the cells for 5 min with 5 μm DAPI (Molecular Probes). Synthetic Inhibitors, Enzymatic Substrates, and Other Chemicals— The pan-caspase inhibitor, BAF (Boc-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone), and the Cat B and L inhibitor, Z-FA-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone), were from Enzyme Systems Products. The Cat B inhibitor, CA-074-Me, was from Calbiochem (France Biochem, Meudon, France). The Cat D inhibitor, pepstatin A, the Cat B substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-βNA (z-RR-βNA), the Cat l substrate, Phe-Arg-βNA (FR-βNA), the Cat d substrate, hemoglobin, the β-hexosaminidase substrate, p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, and the inhibitor of vacuolar type H+-ATPase, bafilomycin A1, were from Sigma. Enzyme Assays—Cat B and Cat L were assayed by hydrolysis of their respective specific substrates z-RR-βNA and FR-βNA as described (24Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Cat D activity was determined as described by Barret and Kirschke (24Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar), with some modifications (25Kagedal K. Johansson U. Ollinger K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1592-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), by using hemoglobin as substrate. To measure Cat D activity in cytosolic fractions, cells were permeabilized with digitonin as described below. Hexosaminidase activity was assayed according to the protocol of Ref 26Stinchcombe J.C. Barral D.C. Mules E.H. Booth S. Hume A.N. Machesky L.M. Seabra M.C. Griffiths G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar. Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, washed 3 times with PBS. For the detection of the active form of Bax, they were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.0125% of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS in PBS to avoid artificial activation of Bax (27Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (444) Google Scholar). They were then incubated for 45 min with rabbit anti-Bax polyclonal antibodies raised against amino acids 1–21 of human Bax (Bax-NT, Upstate Biotechnology, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) together with goat anti-Hsp60 (N-20, Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) to localize mitochondria. The cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG and tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure mouse anti-goat IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Immunotech, Luminy-Marseille, France). For the detection of other molecules, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. We used a rabbit anti-AIF antiserum (kindly given by Dr. S. Susin, Institut Pasteur, France) together with a mouse anti-cytochrome c (6H2.B4, from BD Pharmingen, sold by Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France). The cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. For Cat B, D, and L stains, we used an anti-human Cat B mAb (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem), a rabbit anti-human Cat D antiserum (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Stockholm, Sweden), and a rabbit anti-human Cat L antiserum (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA). The lysosomal-cytoplasmic pH gradient was monitored by incubating the cells for 1 min with 50 nm LysoTracker red (Molecular Probes). Lysosomal destabilization was estimated by using FITC-dextrans of different molecular weights from Sigma. In brief, cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml FITC-dextrans for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed, chased with culture medium for 2 h, and then exposed to STS. The cells were examined by conventional or confocal fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystèmes, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Immunoblots—Preparation of cellular lysates were performed as described previously (23Bidere N. Briet M. Durrbach A. Dumont C. Feldmann J. Charpentier B. de Saint-Basile G. Senik A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32339-32347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg and 5 μg of cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford). Antibodies used in immunoblotting were as follow: rabbit antiserums against AIF (from Dr. Susin), EndoG (Apotech Corporation, Epalinges, Switzerland), Smac/DIABLO (Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem), Bid (Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France), Bax (BD Pharmingen), and actin (Sigma); mouse mAb against Cat D (mAb 49, Transduction Laboratory, Becton Dickinson), cytochrome oxydase II (12C4, Molecular Probes), cytochrome c (7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen), Bcl-2 (mAb 124, Dako, denmark), and goat polyclonal antibodies against Cat B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary reagents from Amersham Biosciences. When necessary, the blots were stripped with a Western blot recycling kit (kit Chemicon, from Euromedex). Subcellular Fractionation—15 × 106 cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended for 30 min at 4 °C in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture “Complete” (Roche Applied Science). They were then subjected to 80 pestle strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer (VWR, Strasbourg, France). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 760 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to recover the heavy membrane pellets enriched for mitochondria and the S10 supernatants. The latter were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for1h at 4 °C to pellet the light membrane, and the resulting (S100) supernatants were stored as cytosolic fractions. The protein concentration in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was determined using the micro BCA kit (Pierce). For alkali extraction, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended (0.25 mg/ml) in freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The membranes were then pelleted in an airfuge (Beckman) operating 10 min at 30 psi. Cytosolic extracts free of lysosomes were prepared by a selective digitonin-based permeabilization technique according to Ref 28Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar. In short, the cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated with extraction buffer (20 μg/ml digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with the mixture “Complete” for 5 min on ice. In these conditions, the cell membranes were permeabilized without lysosome integrity being affected as assayed by measuring hexosaminidase activity in the cytolytic fractions. siRNAs and T Lymphocyte Transfection—Silencing of cat D, bax, and aif gene expression in primary T lymphocytes was achieved by the siRNA technique that has recently been used to study gene function in mammalian cells (22McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). Duplexes of 21-nucleotide siRNA with two 3′-overhanging TT were synthesized by Proligo (Paris, France). The sense strand of the siRNA used to silence the Cat D gene (Cat D-siRNA) was GCUGGUGGACCAGAACAUC, corresponding to the position 666–684 relative to the start codon of the Cat D mRNA. The sense strand of the siRNA silencing bax gene corresponded to the position 384–402 (GGUGCCGGAACUGAUCAGA) relative to start codon of the Bax-α mRNA (Bax-siRNA). The Bax-siRNA sequence is present in six different Bax isoforms. The sense strand of the siRNA silencing aif gene (AIF-siRNA) was CUUGUUCCAGCGAUGGCAU (position 111–129 relative to start codon). Mock transfections were performed with buffer alone. An inefficient CD9 oligo (given by Dr. C. Boucheix, Inserm U268), corresponding to the GCCAUCCACUAUGCGUUGAAC sequence (position 334–354 relative to the start codon) was also used as a negative control of transfection (referred to as control-siRNA). Transfection of purified resting T cells was carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection® system (Amaxa, Köln, Germany), according to the protocols proposed by the furnisher. Briefly, 4 × 106 T cells were resuspended in 100 μl of T cell nucleofector solution (Human T Cell Nucleofector kit) containing 75–150 pmol of double-stranded siRNAs. After electroporation, 400 μl of prewarmed cultured medium were added to the cuvette, and the cells were transferred into cultures plates containing prewarmed culture medium. After a 16 h rest, T cells were activated as described above, and the expression of the targeted genes was monitored by Western blot at different times. At the optimal time of gene silencing (usually 96-h post-transfection), apoptosis was induced by STS. Selective Mitochondrial Release of AIF during the Early Phase of Commitment to Apoptosis in Activated Primary T Lymphocytes—We have established an experimental system suitable for the isolation of a homogeneous population of activated T lymphocytes located in the early phase of commitment to apoptosis following a brief exposure to a low dose of STS (1Dumont C. Durrbach A. Bidere N. Rouleau M. Kroemer G. Bernard G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Susin S.A. Senik A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD2- and IL-2-activated T cells, homogeneous in size, were first isolated as large cells in the low buoyant density fraction of discontinuous density Percoll gradients. These cells are referred to hereafter as control cells. Following exposure to 100 nm STS for 90 min, most of these cells (82 ± 7%, n = 5) displayed an increase in density and a decrease in volume (Fig. 1A, panel a). This made it possible to recover the shrunken cells on a second Percoll density gradient. As previously shown (1Dumont C. Durrbach A. Bidere N. Rouleau M. Kroemer G. Bernard G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Susin S.A. Senik A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most of these cells maintained a high ΔΨm (85–90% DIOC6high cells) but displayed peripheral chromatin condensation (panel b). They also displayed diffuse immunostaining of AIF, which spread into the cytoplasm and the nucleus, contrasting with the punctate immunostaining of cytochrome c seen on confocal (panel c) or conventional (panel d) microscopy. These changes occurred in the presence of BAF, a cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor, corroborating our previous observation that caspases are not involved at this stage (1Dumont C. Durrbach A.

Like AIF and cytochrome c, the apoptogenic proteins Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, and endonuclease G (EndoG) reside in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, awaiting efflux in response to apoptotic stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 30van Loo G.

Subcellular fractionation of the cells into P10 heavy membrane pellets (enriched in mitochondria) and cytosolic S100 fractions, followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, B and C), indicated that STS readily provoked the partial release of AIF from mitochondria into the cytosol but did not significantly induce the release of other apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lane b). In T lymphocytes at more advanced stages of apoptosis (lane c, exposure to 350 nm STS for 90 min, resulting in ≥30% ΔΨmlow cells), mitochondrial apoptogenic factors displayed a higher level of release into the cytosol (AIF and Omi/HtrA2) or even complete redistribution (cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and EndoG). Thus, AIF was selectively translocated to the cytosol during the early phase of commitment to apoptosis in our system. Bid-independent Activation of Bax—Untreated and STS-treated cells were stained with rabbit antibodies directed against amino acids 1–21 of Bax (Bax-NT, green fluorescence) and examined by confocal microscopy, using an anti-Hsp60 antibody (red fluorescence) as a mitochondrial marker. No green fluorescence was detected in control cells whereas, after 90 min of STS treatment, such fluorescence was clearly visible and was almost completely co-localized with Hsp60-associated fluorescence (yellow staining, Fig. 2A). Conventional immunofluorescence microscopy showed that at least ≥70% of STS-treated T cells exhibited the Bax N terminus, irrespective of whether BAF was present. Bax conformational change occurred in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, to similar extents (Fig. 2, B and C). We further investigated the subcellular distribution of Bax by immunoblotting, after fractionation of the cells into cytosolic and heavy membrane fractions. Bax disappeared from the cytosol of STS-treated cells and was translocated to the mitochondria, with no change in molecular weight (Fig. 2D). Some of the Bax protein was integrated into the OMM, as shown by its resistance to alkaline extraction, like the transmembrane mitochondrial Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 2E). Note that in healthy control T lymphocytes, the Bax protein was not only found in the cytosol, but was also loosely associated with mitochondria. It was not actually integrated into the OMM, consistent with observations made in previous studies, in specific cell models (9Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J.

In cells treated with 100 nm STS, Bid remained entirely confined to the cytosol of STS-treated cells as a full-length p21 protein (Fig. 3A). In cells treated with 350 nm STS, p21 Bid was not proteolytically activated to generate p15 tBid, but was nonetheless relocated to the mitochondria (Fig. 3B). A recent study also showed that in HeLa cells treated with STS, only p21 Bid is translocated to the mitochondria, with very little p15 tBid generated (18Tafani M. Cohn J.A. Karpinich N.O. Rothman R.J. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49569-49576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In our hands, the appearance of tBid coincided with caspase activation at later stages of apoptosis (not shown). We conclude that during the early phase of commitment to apoptosis triggered by STS at a concentration of only 100 nm, Bid was not activated in our system, and therefore could not serve as a death ligand stimulating Bax immunoreactivity and relocation. Lysosomal Cathepsins B, D, and L Are Translocated to the Cytosol upon STS Apoptotic Signaling—Lysosomal cathepsins have been shown to be readily translocated to the cytosol and to mediate apoptosis in response to various stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 20Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungercar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oreic K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the subcellular distribution of Cat B and L, both cysteine proteases, and of Cat D, an aspartic protease, all three of which are abundant in lysosomes. In control activated T cells, immunostaining of cathepsins B, D, and L displayed a punctate distribution on immunofluorescence microscopy, consistent with a lysosomal location. In contrast, in cells treated with STS for 90 min, these cathepsins displayed a mixed punctate/diffuse distribution, indicating that only part of them was translocated to the cytosol (Fig. 4A, see also the Western blot of Fig. 7A). No cathepsin was found in the nucleus, as assessed by confocal microscopy (not shown). The cytosol-lysosome pH gradient seemed to be preserved in STS-treated cells because LysoTracker-Red, an acidic organelle-specific probe, still accumulated in granular cellular structures. In cont"

Previously, it was reported that PKBα-deficient mice are small with increased neonatal mortality (Cho, H., Thorvaldsen, J. L., Chu, Q., Feng, F., and Birnbaum, M. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 38349–38352 and Chen, W. S., Xu, P. Z., Gottlob, K., Chen, M. L., Sokol, K., Shiyanova, T., Roninson, I., Wenig, W., Suzuki, R., Tobe, K., Kadowaki, T., and Hay, N. (2001) Genes Dev. 15, 2203–2208). Here we show that PKBα is widely expressed in placenta including all types of trophoblast and vascular endothelial cells. Pkbα–/– placentae display significant hypotrophy, with marked reduction of the decidual basalis and nearly complete loss of glycogen-containing cells in the spongiotrophoblast, and exhibit decreased vascularization. Pkbα–/– placentae also show significant reduction of phosphorylation of PKB and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase. These defects may cause placental insufficiency, fetal growth impairment, and neonatal mortality. These data represent the first evidence for the role of PKBα and endothelial nitricoxide synthase in regulating placental development and provide an animal model for intrauterine growth retardation.

Recent evidence indicates that many downstream events of PI3K signaling are mediated by the serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) (6Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 7Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. TiBS. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three known PKB isoforms: PKBα/Akt-1, PKBβ/Akt-2, and PKBγ/Akt-3 encoded by separate genes. These proteins have a similar domain structure with about 80% amino acid identity (7Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. TiBS. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). PKB promotes or inhibits many cellular and physiological processes through phosphorylation of numerous substrates. Around 30–40 proteins are phosphorylated by PKB. These proteins are involved in glucose metabolism, transcription, cell cycle regulation, survival, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Overexpression of PKBα/Akt-1 in mouse pancreatic β cells substantially increased both cell size and total islet mass (8Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J-P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S.

In a mouse model for ovarian carcinoma, expression of any two of the three oncogenes c-myc, K-ras, and Pkbα is sufficient to induce ovarian tumor formation in a p53-deficient background (12Orsulic S.

These animal models indicate that increased PKBα activity promotes both cell growth and proliferation. To study the physiological roles of PKB, we generated PKBα–deficient mice by targeted gene disruption. We found that inactivation of PKBα caused hypotrophy and structural abnormalities of the placenta that probably contribute to placental insufficiency and subsequent impairment of fetal growth. Our results suggest a novel role for PKBα in the regulation of placental development and fetal growth. Total RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted and purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and an RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen). Primer pairs and N-(3-fluorany)maleimide/carboxytetramethylrhodamine-labeled TaqMan probes for real time PCR were designed using the Primer Express, version 2.0 program (ABI PRISM; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For the quantitative real time PCR reaction, 50 ng of total RNA was mixed with 5′ and 3′ primers (T-forward, the sequences are as follows: for α, 5′-GGCAGGAAGAAGAGACGATGG-3; for β, 5′-GAGGACGCCATGGATTACAAG-3′; for γ, 5′-CAGAGGCAAGAGGAGGAGAG-G-3′ and T-reverse, the sequences are as follows: for α,5′-CCATCTCTTCAGCCCCTGAG-3′; for β, 5′-GACAGCTACCTCCATCATCTCAGA-3′; for γ, 5′-TGTAGACGCATCCATCTCTTCTTC-3′;10 μm each), TaqMan probe (the sequences are as follows: for α, 5′-CTTCCGATCA-GGCTCACCCAGTGACA-3′; for β, 5′-TGGCTCCCCCAGTGACTCTTCCAC-3′; for γ, 5′-TGAATTGTAGCCCAACCTCACAG-ATTGATAATATAGG-3′; 5 μm each), murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (6.25 units; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), RNase inhibitor (10 units; Invitrogen), and the components of the TaqMan PCR reagent kit (Eurogentec) in a total volume of 25 μl following the TaqMan PCR reagent kit protocol (Eurogentec). Reverse transcription and real time PCR was performed in a GeneAmp Sequence Detector 5700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as follows: 2 min reverse transcription at 50 °C, 10 min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing and elongation for 1 min at 60 °C. The relative quantitation of gene expression was calculated as described by the manufacturer (47PerkinElmer Life Sciences (1997) ABI PRISM 7700 User Bulletin Number 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar). Mouse Pkbα Gene Disruption—We isolated one positive clone from 129/SvJ BAC genomic library (Genome Systems Inc.) using a mouse Pkbα cDNA probe and subcloned three BamHI fragments of 6.5, 2.8, and 10 kb and a 5-kb XbaI fragment containing all 14 exons. These subcloned fragments were completely sequenced and assembled. To construct the Pkbα targeting vector, we generated a 1.9-kb left arm using PCR and fused it in-frame to the 5.5 kb of lacZ/Neo. A 6.7-kb right arm was ligated to the 3′ end of the Neo cassette, and the whole fragment was subcloned to pBluescript KS–– (Stratagene). The linearized vector (SalI) was introduced into 129/Ola ES cells, and G418-resistant clones (96) were analyzed for homologous recombination using PCR. The primers were as follows: (a) P684265–2, 5′-CCCACGACAGAAAGTTGTGCG-3′; (b) LacZ-2, 5′-CGTCTGGCCTTCCTGTAGCC-AG-3′. Positives clones (5Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar) were further characterized by Southern blot. Two male chimeras gave germ-line transmission. The progeny from Pkbα+/– intercrossing have 129/Ola and C57BL/6 mixed background. Mice with a 129/Ola/Sv background were also generated. Genotyping of progeny was done by multiplex PCR with the following three primers: (a) Pkbα 5′, 5′-AGACTCTGAGCATCATCCCTGGG-3′; (b) LacZ-2 (sequence as above); (c) Pkbα 3′, 5′-TGAAGCAGGCCTAGAGCCCCATG-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Tissues lysates were prepared by homogenization in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR). Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Protein (50 μg) was fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A polyclonal antibody against PKBα was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids of human PKBα (15Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence for generation of mouse PKBα-specific antibody was VADGLKRQEEETMDFRSGSPSDNSGA. Antibodies for phospho-PKB (Ser473), p70S6K, and phospho-p70S6K, GSK3, phospho-GSK3, phospho-TSC2, and phospho-eNOS were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. eNOS antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Histological Studies—Placentae and organs from adult mice were dissected and fixed in formalin solution (10%, v/v) overnight at 4 °C and then processed as follows: 30 min in PBS at 4 °C, 30 min in 0.85% NaCl (in H2O) at room temperature, 2 × 20 min in 50% ethanol (in 0.85% NaCl) at room temperature, and 2 × 20 min in 70% ethanol (in PBS) at room temperature. The samples were then embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 and 10 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Genotype of embryos was determined by PCR as above using DNA from yolk sac or from embryonic tissues. For immunohistochemistry, placentae from overnight formalin fixation were embedded in carbowax (OCT compound; Tissue Tek), cryosectioned at 20 μm, and treated with methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase at room temperature. Sections were blocked for 30 min in 5% normal goat serum in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with PKB antibody. The sections were then processed as described in the protocol from Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). For alkaline phosphatase staining, 20-μm cryo-sections were bathed in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase color reagents A and B (Bio-Rad). Periodic acid Schiff's staining was performed with paraffin sections. Measurement of Fetal Vessels in Placenta—Digital pictures of wild-type and mutant placentae were taken under similar conditions with a Nikon digital camera (Nikon D1X). Vessel area and total vessel length in each placenta were measured with Image-Pro Plus software. The data were then processed for statistical analysis. The results are presented as arbitrary units. Expression of PKB Isoforms in Mouse Tissues—The expression profile of the mRNA encoding the three PKB isoforms was determined by quantitative PCR using total RNA obtained from three male and three female wild-type mice. For this comparative analysis, the level of PKBα in the brain was set at 100%, and all other tissues were compared with this value for each isoform (Fig. 1A). PKBα was expressed in all organs and tissues examined, but the levels in pancreas and skeletal muscle were very low. However, in most tissues and organs, PKBβ levels were the highest, and PKBγ levels were the lowest. Notably, PKBβ mRNA was highly abundant in the insulin-responsive tissues such as fat, skeletal muscle, and liver as reported previously (16Altomare D.A. Lyons G.E. Mitsuuchi Y. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1998; 7: 2407-2411Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thoryladsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). PKBγ levels were high in the brain and testis, lung, mammary gland, and fat but were extremely low in other tissues. The amount of PKBα protein was also investigated by Western blot with an isoform-specific antibody (Fig. 1B). PKBα protein was most abundant in brain, thymus, and testis, with slightly lower levels observed in heart, lung, pancreas, spleen, and fat. Significantly, the lowest levels of PKBα protein were found in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney. Similar results were obtained with a second α-specific antibody directed against residues 106–131 of mouse PKBα. 2Z.-Z. Yang, O. Tschopp, and B. A. Hemmings, unpublished data. There were marked differences between the mRNA and protein levels of PKBα in some tissues, which may be because of mRNA translation differences and/or protein turnover. Pkbα Gene Structure and Disruption—We sequenced ∼24 kb of the mouse Pkbα locus that contains 13 coding exons (18Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar) and found a non-coding exon (termed exon 0) and the promoter region of the gene (Fig. 2A). To ablate the Pkbα gene, a targeting vector (Fig. 2B) was constructed by insertion of a lacZ/Neo cassette into exon 1 to replace its coding segment, which encodes the first 15 N-terminal amino acids, thereby disrupting its transcriptional organization (19Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones were identified using a PCR-based strategy (Fig. 2C). One of the clones possessing the correctly targeted allele was used for blastocyst aggregation, and germ-line transmission was achieved. Heterozygous (Pkbα+/–) mice were mated to produce homozygous (Pkbα–/–) offspring that were genotyped by PCR and characterized by Southern analysis (Fig. 2, D and E). Western blot analysis using an isoform-specific antibody confirmed the absence of PKBα protein (Fig. 2F). Using several different PKB antibodies we did not find any evidence for truncated protein products in heart, thymus, and spleen confirming that our targeted disruption strategy led to a null phenotype (data not shown). These mice have 129/Ola and C57BL/6 mixed genetic background. The phenotype described in this article is similar between mice with the 129/Ola/Sv or 129/Ola/C57BL/6 mixed background. Increased Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality with Pkbα–/– Mice—We genotyped by PCR ∼600 pups from Pkbα+/– intercrosses at 2–4 weeks after birth. The percentage of Pkbα–/– offspring obtained was ∼17% (Table I), indicating that about 40% of Pkbα–/– mice were already lost. Therefore, embryos were isolated at different stages of gestation and genotyped using PCR. The number of Pkbα–/– embryos from embryonic ages of E14 to E18 was consistent with the expected Mendelian ratio, excluding early embryonic lethality as a cause of decreased Pkbα–/– progeny (Table I). Pkbα–/– intercrosses (homozygous intercrosses) revealed that Pkbα–/– mice were fertile but produced markedly smaller litters compared with Pkbα+/– intercrosses (6.7 ± 2.5, n = 40 versus 9.7 ± 3.3, n = 40, respectively; p < 0.01). Furthermore, increased mortality, mainly within the first 3 days after birth, was observed in litters generated from Pkbα–/– intercrosses (62 of 268 mice; 23.1%) compared with litters from Pkbα+/– intercrosses (30 from 389 mice; 7.7%). Pkbα–/– newborns appeared small, weak, and pale, and frequently the majority of pups from Pkbα–/– intercross litters died within 10 days. The precise cause of death was not determined. Intercrosses of +/– males with Pkbα–/– females revealed an intermediate phenotype in terms of litter size at birth (7.5 ± 2, n = 22) and postnatal mortality of the pups (18 from 166 mice; 10.8%).Table IFrequency of progeny from Pkbα +/- intercrossesStageGenotypeTotal numberPkbα +/+Pkbα +/-Pkbα -/-E1423 (21%)58 (53%)29 (26%)110E1526 (21%)69 (54%)32 (25%)127E1639 (32%)62 (51%)21 (17%)122E1720 (21%)53 (56%)22 (23%)95E1823 (28%)36 (45%)22 (27%)812-4 weeks166 (28%)323 (55%)100 (17%)589 Open table in a new tab Pkbα–/– Mice Exhibit Reduced Body Weight and Delayed Growth—At birth, Pkbα–/– mice (from heterozygous intercrosses) were distinguishable from their wild-type littermates by their smaller size (data not shown) (see Supplemental Material). The body weight of mutant newborns was ∼70% of wild-type littermates (body weight: wild-type, 1.49 ± 0.16 g, n = 15 versus mutant, 1.1 ± 0.11 g, n = 12; p < 0.01). Surviving Pkbα–/– mice grew slowly after birth, and some of these mice were extremely stunted and lean. One litter of mice (11 pups) from a Pkbα+/– intercross was observed from birth until 13 months of age. The growth curve indicated that Pkbα–/– mice maintained their small size from birth to adulthood. At 13 months, two Pkbα–/– males weighed 32.5 and 32.7 g, respectively, whereas a wild-type male littermate weighed 48.5 g; one Pkbα–/– female and one wild-type female littermate weighed 26 and 34.1 g, respectively. The major organs and tissues, including brain, heart, liver, spleen, thymus, skin, bone marrow, pancreas, testis, ovary, lung, kidney, fat, skeletal muscle, and stomach, from five wild-type and five Pkbα–/– mice (two males and three females of each genotype) were dissected and examined at 2 months of age. Organ weight reduction, with the exception of the brain and pancreas, in Pkbα–/– mice was proportional to the body weight reduction. Histological examination did not reveal any major difference between wild-type and Pkbα–/– mice apart from a modest reduction in the subcutaneous fat in the Pkbα–/– mice.2 In addition, biochemical examination of metabolites, enzymes, and electrolytes did not reveal any significant difference between wild-type and Pkbα–/– mice.2 Placental Hypotrophy and Fetal Growth Impairment in Pkba –/– Mutant Mice—Following dissection of E14.5 embryos, we found that the mutant embryos were 20% smaller than their wild-type littermates (embryo weight: wild-type, 291 ± 45 mg, n = 15 and Pkbα–/–, 235 ± 49 mg, n = 12; p < 0.01) (see Fig. 3A). In addition, we found that the placental weight of mutant embryos was 24% lower than that of wild-type littermates (placenta weight at E14.5: wild-type, 121 ± 18 mg, n = 15 and Pkbα–/–, 92 ± 17 mg, n = 12; p < 0.01) (see Fig. 3A). Macroscopically, the placentae from mutant embryos were not only small but also thin. These differences were also observed at later embryonic stages; at E16.5 the weight of wild-type embryos was 707 ± 86 mg (n = 16) and that of mutants was 586 ± 67 mg (n = 12) (Pkbα–/–/wild-type = 83%; p < 0.01) (see Fig. 3B); the weight of wild-type and mutant placentae was 142 ± 18 mg (n = 16) and 94 ± 17 mg (n = 12), respectively (Pkbα–/–/wild-type = 66%; p < 0.01) (see Fig. 3B). From E14.5 to E16.5, the wild-type placentae increased in weight (mean weight from 121 to 142 mg) whereas the weight of mutant placentae did not change (mean weight from 92 to 94 mg). It thus appears that the growth and development of both mutant placenta and embryo were impaired. Altered Development of Pkbα Mutant Placentae—Next, we performed histological analysis to study the structure of wild-type and mutant placentae. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that all three major layers of placenta, decidua, spongiotrophoblast, and labyrinth, were smaller in mutant placentae compared with the wild-type (Fig. 4A). In addition, the decidua was disproportionately decreased or apparently missing in some mutant placentae (Fig. 4A). Periodic acid Schiff's staining showed a marked reduction of glycogen-containing cells in the spongiotrophoblast in mutant placentae (Fig. 4, B and C). We also performed alkaline phosphatase staining to display these cells to study fetal vascular structure. We found that the outline of labyrinth was easily discerned after staining and observed that fetal vasculature was disordered with fewer vessels (Fig. 4, D–F). Expression and Subcellular Distribution of PKBα in Placentae—Disruption of the Pkbα gene apparently causes severe hypotrophy and developmental changes of placenta, suggesting that PKBα is required for normal placental development. To test this, we first examined the protein levels of PKBα in placenta compared with brain where its levels are high. Western blot with a PKBα-specific antibody showed that, in three wild-type placentae from one litter of E14.5 embryos, the amount of PKBα was similar and significantly higher than that in brain (Fig. 5A). We performed immunohistochemical staining with a PKBα-specific antibody to study its localization in E14.5 wild-type placenta. The results show that PKBα was present in all types of trophoblast cells and vessel endothelial cells except in the decidua where the amount was relatively low. In contrast, with mutant placenta we could not detect any PKBα (Fig. 5, B–D). This was consistent with the immunoblot analysis that revealed an absence of PKBα from mutant placenta from heterozygous intercrosses (Fig. 5E). In this type of mating, the decidua in the mutant mice was derived from the Pkbα+/– maternal uterus (whereas the other parts of the placenta are derived solely from the embryo). Indeed we also set up matings between homozygous males and females and collected data for placentae and embryos. We found that placentae and embryos from homozygous matings were smaller than those from heterozygous matings (data not shown). This suggests that the genotype of the mother contributes to the phenotype. Significant Reduction of Phosphorylation of PKB and eNOS in Mutant Placentae with Decreased Vascularization—The status of the other two PKB isoforms, β and γ, from wild-type placenta was analyzed by Western blot using isoform-specific antibodies. We found that both were expressed in mature wild-type placenta, with no apparent up-regulation in mutant placenta at the protein level.2 Furthermore, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of PKB using an antibody specific for the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation site (Ser473 in PKBα) that recognizes all three phosphorylated isoforms. Three wild-type and three mutant placentae from one litter were examined for this purpose. We found that the phosphorylation levels of PKB at Ser473 in all three mutant placentae were reduced markedly (84% decrease) compared with wild-type indicating that PKBα represents the major phosphorylated (active) isoform in placenta (Fig. 6, A and B). Phosphorylation levels of TSC2 and p70S6K were slightly increased in mutant placentae compared with wild-type (Fig. 6A). However, the phosphorylation status of eNOS on Ser1177 were reduced substantially (59% decrease) in mutant placentae (Fig. 6, A and B). Because eNOS by PKB is important for angiogenesis (20Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), we analyzed the vasculature on the fetal side of placenta from E14.5 wild-type and mutant embryos. Microscopically, we found that in mutant placentae there were significantly less blood vessels, and the vessels were smaller and shorter compared with wild-type. The vascular branching was scarce, and the microvessel-covering area was also decreased markedly in mutant placentae (Fig. 7A). To compare the difference quantitatively, digital pictures of placentae were taken and used to measure the vessels with image-processing software. Two parameters were measured to analyze the vascularization of wild-type and mutant placentae: total visible vessel length and the vessel-covering area. In total, we examined five mutant and 11 wild-type placentae from five litters of embryos of heterozygous crosses. The results revealed significant differences between wild-type and mutant placenta (total vessel length per placenta: mutant, 894 ± 654; wild-type, 1848 ± 817 (mutant/wild-type = 48%); p < 0.05 and vessel-covering area per placenta: mutant, 84912 ± 41131; wild-type, 163846 ± 26264 (mutant/wild-type = 52%); p < 0.01) (see Fig. 7B). The percentage decrease of total vessel length (52%) and vessel-covering area (48%) was greater than that of weight reduction of the placenta (29%). Thus, the vascular decrease is more severe than the weight reduction.Fig. 7Reduced vascularization in Pkbα–/– placentae. A, a representative picture showing vascular decrease of a mutant placenta. B, quantitation of vessel length and vessel area in mutant placenta (*, p < 0.05 for vessel length and p < 0.01 for vessel area).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results suggest that PKBα is a major component of the signal transduction apparatus responsible for placental development and fetal growth in mice. Loss of PKBα results in a marked reduction of total phosphorylation levels of PKB leading to a defect in the growth and development of placenta and suggest that fetal growth retardation of PKBα null mice is apparently because of defects in placental function and subsequent insufficiency. The results also suggest that the β and γ isoforms of PKB can only partially compensate for the loss of the α. In early mouse embryo development, the differentiation of trophoblast into trophectoderm parallels the formation of the inner cell mass in the blastocyst by E3.5. The inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo itself plus extra-embryonic membranes, such as the allantois and the amnion, whereas the trophectoderm develops into the ectoplacental cone, which eventually becomes the placenta (21Ihle J.N. Cell. 2000; 102: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). PKBα can be detected in murine ES cells derived from the inner cell mass (23Rathjen J. Rathjen P.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Williams M.R. Arthur J.S.C. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).2 This indicates that PKBα may also be expressed in trophoblasts during early embryogenesis. Our findings that PKBα is highly expressed in the mature placenta with widespread distribution in all type of trophoblast cells reinforce this possibility. Coincidentally, both IGF-1 and IGF-2 are expressed during early embryogenesis (25Lopez M.F. Dikkes P. Zurakowski D. Villa-Komaroff L.

Recently, Kamei et al. (27Kamei T. Jones S.R. Chapman B.M. McGonigle K.L. Dai G. Soares M.J. Mol.

PKBβ knockout mice are insulin-resistant and display diabetes mellitus-like symptoms, indicating that PKBβ is essential for glucose metabolism and insulin signal transduction, but apparently does not affect fetal growth (17Cho H.

Recently, several members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) subfamily of ion channels have been identified that can be gated by increases in temperature into the warm (TRPV3 and TRPV4) or painfully hot (TRPV1 and TRPV2) range. In rodents, TRPV3 and TRPV4 proteins have not been detected in sensory neurons but are highly expressed in skin epidermal keratinocytes.

Both TRPV3 and TRPV4 are expressed in 308 cells. However, the warmth-evoked responses we observe most closely resemble those mediated by recombinant TRPV4 on the basis of their electrophysiological properties and sensitivity to osmolarity and the phorbol ester, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate. Together, these data support the notion that keratinocytes are capable of detecting modest temperature elevations, strongly suggest that TRPV4 participates in these responses, and define a system for the cell biological analysis of warmth transduction.

In mammals, the skin is extremely important for the transduction of thermal information and its transmission to the central nervous system. Cutaneous thermosensation has been largely attributed to the sensory nerves that innervate the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin. Recent reports, however, have suggested the possibility that other skin components, most notably keratinocytes, might also participate in temperature sensation. TRPV1 and TRPV2 are highly expressed in distinct subsets of sensory neurons (2Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In humans, TRPV3 is also expressed in sensory neurons (5Smith G.D. Gunthorpe M.J. Kelsell R.E. Hayes P.D. Reilly P. Facer P.

In addition, although peripheral sensory neurons cultured from TRPV1 knockout mice exhibit profound deficits in heat-evoked activation, the deficits observed in the intact knockout mice or in skin-nerve explants derived from these animals are considerably more modest (15Caterina M.J.

These findings suggest that TRPV3 and/or TRPV4 might mediate warmth detection and, possibly, painful heat detection at the level of the epidermal keratinocyte. The objectives of this study were to determine whether keratinocytes in vitro exhibit responsiveness to innocuous warmth and, if so, whether these responses are mediated by one or more heat-sensitive TRPV family members. We found that in the mouse 308 keratinocyte cell line (17Yuspa S.H. Kulesz-Martin M. Ben T. Hennings H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81 (suppl.): 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), mild heating evokes a rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) as well as a transmembrane cationic current, with a threshold of ∼33 °C. Moreover, the pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of these responses suggest that they are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of TRPV4. Cell Culture—The 308 cell line is a papilloma-derived keratinocyte cell line from 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-treated adult BALB/c mouse skin (17Yuspa S.H. Kulesz-Martin M. Ben T. Hennings H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81 (suppl.): 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 308 cells were maintained at 37 °C in keratinocyte medium, which contains a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2 × 10–9m 3,3–5′triiodo-l-thyroxine, 10–10m cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin (17Yuspa S.H. Kulesz-Martin M. Ben T. Hennings H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81 (suppl.): 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin with 1 mm EDTA and replated onto glass coverslips 24–32 h prior to each experiment. Medium additives and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Ca2 + Imaging—Normal bath solution (290 mOsm) used for Ca2+ imaging contained 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.45 with NaOH. To test the effect of osmolarity, 250 mOsm solution was made by reducing the concentration of NaCl to 105 mm. Mannitol was added to achieve 290 or 330 mOsm. Osmolarity was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT). For Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was replaced with 10 mm EGTA. Cells were loaded with 10 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in normal bath solution containing 0.02% pleuronic acid (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 32 or 24 °C for 40 min. Coverslips containing Furaloaded cells were continuously superfused with bath solution unless otherwise indicated. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY), excitation filter changer (Sutter, Novato, CA), and cooled CCD camera (Roper, Tucson, AZ). Paired images (340- and 380-nm excitation, 510-nm emission) were collected every 2 s with RatioTool software (ISee Imaging, Raleigh, NC). Fura ratios (emission at 340 nm excitation/emission at 380 nm excitation) were converted to absolute [Ca2+]i following system calibration (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Heat stimuli were delivered using an in-line heater (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), monitored with a thermocouple (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) placed within 4 mm of the microscopic field, and recorded using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Drugs were applied by perfusion using an automated valve manifold (Warner Instruments). Data Analysis—[Ca2+]i was calculated for ∼40–100 randomly selected cells/coverslip, with equal numbers of cells selected in each matched set of control and experimental coverslips. To compare responses among treatment groups, we calculated the [Ca2+]i change by subtracting background [Ca2+]i (average of 5 [Ca2+]i measurements immediately prior to heat stimulation) from all observations. For determination of the fraction of responding cells, a [Ca2+]i change histogram generated using a given heat stimulation protocol was used to calculate a “response level” in each 2 °C bin from 28 to 40 °C. Cells showing a [Ca2+]i change greater than the response level, defined as the level two S.D. values above the mean of the nonresponsive cell peak in each temperature bin, were classified as responsive. Throughout this work, data are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = number of observations). Unless otherwise indicated, statistical comparisons were made with an unpaired Student's t test or one-way ANOVA. PCR Analysis—308 cells were grown to 50% confluence and scraped into TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) for total RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 μg of total RNA, 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer, 1 nmol of each dNTP, 200 nmol of dithiothreitol, 2 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 200 units of SuperScript II RNase H (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 50 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. TRPV mRNA species were amplified via PCR by denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (53 °C, 30 s), and elongation (72 °C, 20 s) over 30 cycles. Primers used for PCR were as follows: TRPV1, 5′-ACACCAACGTGGGCATCATC-3′ and 5′-TGGTTAGATTCACAGCTCGCTTC-3′; TRPV2, 5′-GGATGGTATACCTGATGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAATTCCCTACTCTACCCTGC-3′; TRPV3, 5′-ACGGTGGAGAACGTCTCC-3′ and 5′-TGTCCGTCTTATGGGTCC-3′; and TRPV4, 5′-ACCAGTACTATGGCTTCTCC-3′ and 5′-AATTCCCTACTCTACCCTGC-3′. Products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and sequence-verified. Molecular Biology—Mouse TRPV1 and TRPV2 cDNAs were amplified using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on polyadenylated RNA purified from mouse dorsal root ganglion and brain, respectively (Trizol reagent; Invitrogen) and subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: mouse TRPV1, 5′-CACTTGCTCCATTCGGAGTGTG-3′ and 5′-TGGTTAGATTCACAGCTCGCTTC-3′; mouse TRPV2, 5′-GGACGATACAGAGAAAGCTACGGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAATTCCCTACTCATACCCTGC-3′. Mouse TRPV3 cDNA was amplified from DRG and spinal cord polyadenylated RNA using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy (GeneRacer; Invitrogen). A full-length TRPV3 cDNA was obtained by the ligation of rapid amplification of cDNA ends products and subcloned into pCDNA3. The mouse TRPV4 cDNA was a generous gift of Veit Flockerzi, (Universität des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany). Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 308 cells were washed with PBS, scraped, collected by centrifugation, and homogenized in ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h on ice. Solubilized proteins were separated by centrifugation (5 min, 20,000 × g). 37.5 μg of supernatant was loaded in each well. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 carboxyl-terminal rabbit antibodies have been described (2Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D.

An antiserum specific for the C terminus of mouse TRPV3 was generated by conjugating the following peptide: NH2-KTTLYAFDELDEFPETSV-COOH to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, followed by immunization of rabbits (Strategic Biosolutions, Newark, DE) and affinity purification on an antigenic peptide column. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-TRPV1, anti-TRPV2, anti-TRPV3, or anti-TRPV4 at 1:1000 dilutions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a dilution of 1:5000. For control, the TRPV3 and TRPV4 antibodies were blocked by preincubating with antigenic peptide at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. Protein concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). For immunostaining, 308 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and treated with the appropriate affinity-purified anti-TRPV antibodies in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100, followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as described (2Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Staining specificity was confirmed by signal ablation after incubation of antibodies with antigenic peptide or peptide-conjugated resin. Samples were imaged using an Ultraview laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon). Electrophysiology—For whole-cell recording, the recording pipette was filled with internal solution containing 120 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH, 295 mOsm adjusted with mannitol). Cells were initially superfused with a solution containing 130 mm sodium aspartate, 6 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, 305 mOsm adjusted with mannitol). After the establishment of whole-cell mode, the solution was exchanged with a recording solution containing 130 mm sodium aspartate, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, 305 mOsm adjusted with mannitol). To minimize contamination from Ca2+-activated currents and other background currents, we omitted Ca2+ from the external solution and reduced Cl– concentration on both sides of the membrane. For the evaluation of cationic selectivity, a solution containing 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-aspartate, 12 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4 adjusted with NMDG, 305 mOsm adjusted with mannitol) was used. To test Ca2+ permeability, we used a solution containing 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm calcium aspartate, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with aspartic acid, 305 mOsm adjusted with mannitol). For single-channel recordings, pipette contained a solution composed of 130 mm sodium aspartate, 12 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH, 295 mOsm with mannitol). Cells were superfused with a solution containing 130 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH, 305 mOsm with mannitol) in cell-attached recordings. This perfusate was changed to internal solution (described above for whole-cell recording) just prior to patch excision for inside-out recordings. Because of their extremely flat morphology, cells were treated briefly with trypsin-EDTA just before the experiment to facilitate seal formation and measurement of single-cell membrane capacitance in whole-cell recordings. Cell-attached and inside-out recordings were performed without prior trypsinization. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) connected to a Digidata 1322A analog/digital converter (Axon Instruments) was used. pClamp 8.0 software was used to acquire and analyze data. Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and had a tip resistance of 1.5–2 megaohms for whole-cell measurement and 2–5 megaohms for single-channel recording when filled with pipette solution. We recorded the whole-cell current only when the series resistance was less than 5 megaohms without compensation. An agar salt bridge containing 3 m KCl or NaCl was used throughout the experiment. Data were corrected for liquid junction potential calculated using pClamp. Membrane capacitance was measured using a capacitance neutralization circuit. Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz in single-channel recordings and 3.3 kHz in whole-cell recordings. Warm Temperatures Evoke a Rise in [Ca2 + ] i in Mouse 308 Keratinocytes—We performed microscopic Ca2+ imaging on the mouse 308 keratinocyte cell line to determine whether these cells would respond to a heat stimulus with a change in [Ca2+]i. Rapid but modest increases in bath temperature (from 25 to 38°C in 10 s) (Fig. 1A) elicited substantial increases in [Ca2+]i (5.7 ± 1.2-fold, from 38 ± 5 nm to 189 ± 17 nm, p < 10–6, n = 6 coverslips) in 27% of cells. Over the entire population, the mean [Ca2+]i increased by 2.8 ± 0.4-fold (from 33 ± 3 to 87 ± 8 nm, p < 0.001, n = 6). In nearly all responsive cells, restoration of bath temperature to 25 °C caused [Ca2+]i to return to values at or near the initial baseline within 30–60 s. By applying extracellular bath solution at various peak temperatures to parallel sets of cells (Fig. 1B), we determined that these responses were temperature-dependent and that their threshold was ∼34 °C, regardless of whether it was calculated on the basis of percentage of responsive cells or mean response amplitude. Application of slower temperature ramps from 25 to 40 °C over 2 min (Fig. 1C) also produced reversible increases in [Ca2+]i in many cells. Despite the monotonic shape of these temperature ramps, responses appeared only once the ambient temperature exceeded 32 °C (a threshold just slightly lower than that observed in the rapid heating experiments) and increased in prevalence and size thereafter. At 39 °C, 46 ± 6% of cells exhibited a significant change in [Ca2+]i, with an increase among responders from 33 ± 2 to 140 ± 10 nm and an overall population increase from 31 ± 1 to 108 ± 6 nm. Sustained heat stimuli (from 25 to 37 ± 1 °C within 10 s, followed by a 50-s plateau) (Fig. 2A) produced prolonged [Ca2+]i responses, many of which commenced during the first 20–30 s of the heat stimulus, with others appearing later. The averaged population response decreased only slightly during the sustained phase of heating. However, some cells exhibited marked desensitization of heat-evoked [Ca2+]i responses during this period. In addition, when we applied several brief heat stimuli at intervals of 3 min (Fig. 2B), responses observed during the second and third stimuli were diminished in amplitude by ∼40 and ∼60%, respectively.Fig. 2Responses of 308 cells to prolonged or repetitive heat stimuli.

Under these conditions (Fig. 3A), the heat-evoked change in [Ca2+]i was extremely small (19% of control, n = 6, p < 10–4), suggesting that Ca2+ influx, rather than Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, was primarily responsible for the effects we observed. Further support for this notion comes from the observation that depletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores by pretreatment of cells with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor, thapsigargin (1 μm, 15 min) failed to inhibit the heat-evoked Ca2+ responses (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that warm temperatures evoke Ca2+ influx in 308 keratinocytes. Mouse Keratinocytes Express Both TRPV3 and TRPV4 — Given the results described above and previous demonstrations of TRPV channel expression in keratinocytes in vivo (3Peier A.M. Reeve A.J.

Ther. 2003; 304: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we explored whether any of the four known heat-sensitive TRPV subtypes were expressed in 308 cells. After isolation of poly(A)+ RNA, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using primers specific for mouse TRPV1–4 (Fig. 4A). DNA bands of the appropriate size and sequence for each subtype could be amplified from these samples, indicating the expression of all four at the mRNA level. Immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified polyclonal peptide antibodies specific for each subtype (Fig. 4B) revealed that TRPV3 and TRPV4 proteins were both expressed at readily detectable levels in 308 keratinocytes. Curiously, the distribution of immunoreactivity for both TRPV3 and TRPV4 was most prominent in apparently intracellular compartments, especially structures in the perinuclear area. However, TRPV4 immunoreactivity was also detected on or near the plasma membranes of many cells. In contrast, immunoreactivity for TRPV2 or TRPV1 was much less convincing, despite the presence of mRNA encoding these species; whereas very weak TRPV2 immunoreactivity could be detected in some cells, no clear evidence of specific TRPV1 immunoreactivity was observed (data not shown). To verify the specificity of the TRPV3 and TRPV4 antibodies used in these experiments and their ability to recognize the corresponding mouse orthologs, we performed immunoblot analysis on whole-cell extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding mouse TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, or TRPV4 (Fig. 4C). Both antibodies recognized the correct recombinant mouse protein, whereas neither exhibited cross-reactivity with other subtypes. Similarly, antibodies against mouse TRPV1 and TRPV2 recognized only the appropriate subtype (not shown). Finally, we sought to confirm the expression of TRPV3 and TRPV4 in 308 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4D). Both anti-TRPV3 and anti-TRPV4 antibodies recognized protein bands with apparent molecular weights similar to those of recombinant TRPV3 and TRPV4. The high molecular weight band marked with an asterisk in the TRPV3 blot may represent a multimeric form of this protein. The TRPV4 antibody recognized a doublet in the 308 cell extracts. A similar TRPV4 doublet has been described by others, with the higher molecular weight band proposed to represent a glycosylated form (22Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J.

TRPV4 Probably Mediates the Heat-evoked [Ca2 + ] i Increase Observed in Mouse Keratinocytes—To further examine whether one or more member(s) of the TRPV family might be responsible for the influx of Ca2+ evoked by exposure to warmth, we tested the effect of ruthenium red (RR), a channel blocker that has been shown to potently inhibit heat responses mediated by all four TRPV subtypes (1Caterina M.J.

To gain insight into how EBNA1 fulfills these functions, we have profiled cellular protein interactions with EBNA1 using EBNA1 affinity chromatography and tandem affinity purification (TAP) of EBNA1 complexes from human cells (TAP-tagging). We discovered several new specific cellular protein interactions with EBNA1, including interactions with HAUSP/USP7, NAP1, template-activating factor-Iβ/SET, CK2, and PRMT5, all of which play important cell regulatory roles. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 is a known target of herpes simplex virus, and the USP7-binding region of EBNA1 was mapped to amino acids 395–450. A mutation in EBNA1 that selectively disrupted binding to USP7 was found to cause a 4-fold increase in EBNA1 replication activity but had no effect on EBNA1 turnover and cell-surface presentation. The results suggest that USP7 can regulate the replication function of EBNA1 and that EBNA1 may influence cellular events by sequestering key regulatory proteins.

As part of its latent infectious cycle, EBV immortalizes the host cell and, in doing so, predisposes the cell to malignant transformation. As a result, EBV is associated with several types of cancer. EBV genomes are maintained in latently infected replicating cells as circular DNA episomes that replicate once per cell cycle and segregate stably during cell division (reviewed in Refs. 1Kieff E. Rickinson A.B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2511-2573Google Scholar and 2Frappier L. Funnell B.E. Phillips G. The Biology of Plasmids. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein required to maintain the EBV genomes in proliferating cells, which it does by binding to recognition sites in the FR (family of repeats) and DS (dyad symmetry) elements of the latent origin of DNA replication, oriP (3Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 4Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). EBNA1 binding to the DS element is necessary to initiate DNA replication from this element (5Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EBNA1 binding to the FR element is important for the partitioning of the EBV episomes during cell division and also activates the expression of other viral latency genes (6Reisman D. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3838-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition to its functions at oriP, EBNA1 has been shown to repress its own transcription (7Sample J. Henson E.B. Sample C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to promote the development of B-cell lymphomas in transgenic mice, suggesting a direct role for EBNA1 in cell transformation (8Wilson J. Bell J. Levine A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).While fulfilling all of its functions, EBNA1 avoids detection by host cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. This ability to hide from the immune system is biologically important, as it enables the persistence of latently infected cells that express EBNA1 in the absence of other EBV antigens. The failure of EBNA1 to elicit a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response is due to lack of proteasomal processing, which prevents the presentation of EBNA1 by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the cell surface (9Levitskaya J. Coram M. Levitsky V. Imreh S. Steigerwald-Mullen P.M. Klein G. Kurilla M.G. Masucci M.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This property of EBNA1 has been attributed to the central Gly-Ala repeat, which varies in length in different EBV isolates and is not required for any of the EBNA1 functions measured in tissue culture (10Levitskaya J.

However, few of these cellular protein interactions have been identified. To date, only yeast one- and two-hybrid approaches have been used to screen for EBNA1-interacting proteins; these screens have identified importin-α (also called karyopherin-α2 or Rch1), karyopherin-α1, p32/TAP, and EBP2 as EBNA1-binding proteins (12Kim A.L.

Since importin-α and karyopherin-α1 are known nuclear transport factors, their interaction with EBNA1 may be important for EBNA1 entry into the nucleus. p32/TAP (also called gC1q-R) is predominantly a mitochondrial protein, but has been found to bind to a wide variety of proteins with diverse functions (Refs. 13Wang Y.

Thus, the significance of the interaction of EBNA1 with p32/TAP remains unclear. The interaction of EBNA1 with EBP2 seems to be important for the segregation function of EBNA1. EBP2 is a component of the cellular mitotic chromosomes, and EBNA1 appears to attach to EBP2 to partition EBV plasmids (15Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F.J. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J.

In addition to the EBNA1-binding proteins identified by screening, studies that have specifically tested for interactions of EBNA1 with replication protein A and the origin recognition complex have detected these interactions, suggesting that they might be important for the replication function of EBNA1 (23Zhang D.

Using affinity chromatography and tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagging approaches, we have identified novel EBNA1-interacting proteins, including the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 (also known as HAUSP).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of EBNA1 and Δ325–376 —EBNA1 (lacking most of the Gly-Ala repeat region) was expressed as a hexahistidine fusion from a baculovirus.

Δ325–376 (lacking amino acids 325–376 in addition to most of the Gly-Ala repeat) was expressed as a hexahistidine fusion from pET15b in Escherichia coli and purified as described for EBNA1.EBNA1 Affinity Columns—HeLa S3 cells (10 g; National Cell Culture Center) were lysed in 11 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.26 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.6 mm EDTA, and 75% glycerol was added, and the lysate was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. After 30 min on ice, the extract was clarified by centrifugation for3hat 64,000 × g and then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm KCl. Prior to loading onto affinity columns, CaCl2 was added to 4 mm, and lysates were incubated with RNase A and DNase I (1.4 μg/mg of lysate) for 30 min at 25 °C to remove nucleic acid.Purified EBNA1 or Δ325–376 was covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) by incubating 2 ml of protein/ml of Affi-Gel in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 m NaCl) and blocked as described previously (26Sopta M.

Coupled resin was washed with buffer A and equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl (buffer B) before pouring into 40-μl microcolumns. 400 μl of HeLa lysate (at 14 mg/ml) was applied to the columns. Columns were washed with 400 μl of buffer B and 160 μl of buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 and then sequentially eluted with buffer A and 1% SDS. For rechromatography assays, the buffer A eluates from three columns were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl, and reapplied to an EBNA1 affinity column. This column was washed and eluted as described above. Column eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.Mass Spectrometry—Gel slices containing the protein bands were identified by reduction in DTT, alkylation in iodoacetamide, and then subjection to in-gel trypsin hydrolysis. The peptides were purified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Sigma) on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems) (27Mann M. Hojrup P.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of the dried gels.TAP-tagging Experiments—The DNAs coding for EBNA1, Δ395–450, and Δ325–376 were PCR-amplified from plasmids containing these EBNA1 mutants and cloned between the XhoI and NotI sites of pMZI. pMZI expresses proteins with C-terminal TAP tags (31Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells under the control of an ecdysone-inducible promoter. The pMZI vector and the pMZI-LacZ construct, which encodes TAP-tagged β-galactosidase, will be described elsewhere. 3M. Zeghouf, J. Li, G. Butland, A. Borkowska, V. Canadien, D. Richards, B. Beattie, A. Emili, and J. Greenblatt, submitted for publication. 293T cells at 60% confluence in 150-mm dishes were cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 8 μg of pMZI expressing EBNA1 or an EBNA1 mutant and 8 μg of pVgRxR (Invitrogen), which encodes the ecdysone receptor heterodimer. The precipitate was removed 15 h post-transfection, and expression of the EBNA1 proteins was induced by adding medium containing 3 μm Ponasterone A (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 22–48 h later, and a whole cell extract was prepared from 4 × 107 cells as described by Xiao et al. (32Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the extract was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 m potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The extract was mixed with 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose 6 beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C, and bound TAP-tagged protein was released by incubation overnight with 30 units of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Invitrogen) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Eluted protein was further purified on a 40-μl column of calmodulin-Sepharose 4B. Protein complexes were eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100; concentrated by lyophilization; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Protein bands were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.EBNA1 Functional Assays—The construction of pc3oriPEBNA1 and pc3oriP, which contain the EBV oriP sequence and express EBNA1 or no protein, respectively, has been described previously (15Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F.J. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pc3oriPΔ395–450 was constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis of pc3oriPEBNA1. Transient replication, plasmid maintenance, and transcriptional activation assays were performed as described previously (33Wu H. Kapoor P. Frappier L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2480-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For replication assays, C33A cells were transfected with 10 μg of pc3oriP plasmids; and 72 h post-transfection, plasmids were recovered, linearized, digested with DpnI, and analyzed by Southern blotting. For plasmid maintenance assays, C33A cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid; and after 14 days of selection in G418, plasmids were linearized, digested with DpnI, and analyzed by Southern blotting. Plasmid bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For transactivation assays, C33A cells were transfected with 5 μg of pc3oriP plasmids and 2 μg of the pFRTKCAT reporter construct (kindly provided by Bill Sugden). 24 h later, cell lysates were prepared, and 50 μg of each was assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity using several reaction times as described previously (34Ceccarelli D.F. Frappier L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reaction products at each time point were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis and used to determine the acetylation rate.Protein Turnover Assays—2 × 106 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pc3oriPEBNA1 or pc3oriPΔ395–450 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were grown for 1 week under selection for the plasmid (400 μg/ml G418) before blocking the cells in 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were harvested at various times after blocking by resuspending in 9 m urea and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Lysates were clarified by sonication and centrifugation, and 50 μg of each was separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted using anti-EBNA1 antiserum R4 (raised against EBNA1-(452–641)). The same lysates were also probed with anti-interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) antibody (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—C33A cells expressing EBNA1 were generated by transfecting C33A cells with pc3oriPEBNA1 and growing the cells under selection for the plasmid. The cells were then grown on coverslips to 60% confluence, fixed with formaldehyde (5% (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% sucrose), and permeabilized with acetone/methanol (70:30) at –20 °C. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 1 h in 10% bovine serum albumin. The cells were stained with anti-EBNA1 monoclonal antibody OT1x (kindly supplied by Jaap Middeldorp) at a 1:150 dilution and rabbit anti-USP7 antibody r201 (kindly provided by Roger Everett) at a 1:200 dilution, followed by staining with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies (at 1:200 and 1:30 dilutions, respectively). Cells were then counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The slides were mounted in 5 μl of antifade solution and observed at a magnification of ×400 using a Leica DMR microscope and Openlab software. For microscopy of Raji cells, cells were allowed to adhere to coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine before fixing with paraformaldehyde (3% in phosphate-buffered saline), permeabilizing in 1% Triton X-100 and phosphate-buffered saline, and blocking as described above. Staining and microscopy were performed as described for C33A cells, except that rabbit anti-USP7 antiserum r2b2, raised against full-length USP7, was used (at a dilution of 1:200).RESULTSEBNA1-interacting Proteins Identified by Affinity Chromatography—EBNA1-binding proteins were isolated from a HeLa cell extract by retention on columns containing purified EBNA1. Elution profiles were compared for EBNA1 columns and negative control columns (with no protein coupled) in four separate experiments, and typical results are shown in Fig. 1A. Proteins found to be specifically and reproducibly retained on the EBNA1 columns were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Two of these proteins, importin-α and p32/TAP, were previously identified as EBNA1-interacting proteins in two-hybrid screens (12Kim A.L. Maher M. Hayman J.B. Ozer J. Zerby D. Yates J.L.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, previously unknown interactions were detected with USP7, karyopherin-β3, karyopherin-β2 (not obvious in Fig. 1A, but shown in Figs. 1B and 2), importin-β, NAP1 (nucleosome assembly protein-1), template-activating factor (TAF)-Iα, TAF-Iβ, CK2α (casein kinase-2α), CK2α′, and pp32. USP7 is a ubiquitin-specific protease that has been found to interact with the ICP0 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 (30Everett R. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Karyopherin-β2 and karyopherin-β3 are nuclear import factors (35Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). NAP1 is a histone chaperone that facilitates the proper spacing of nucleosomes (36Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). TAF-Iα and TAF-Iβ form the template-activating factor, which can activate replication and transcription from chromatin templates through histone interactions (37Okuwaki M. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34511-34518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, TAF-Iβ, also known as SET, has been found to regulate p21Cip1 (38Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M.

CK2α and CK2α′ are two of the three subunits of the CK2 serine/threonine kinase (39Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 369: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). pp32 is an acidic nuclear protein that forms part of the INHAT complex (40Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We noted that EBP2, which was found to bind EBNA1 by other methods (15Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F.J. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not among the proteins retained on the EBNA1 column. However, Western blot analysis of the soluble HeLa lysate fraction applied to the column indicated that EBP2 was not present in this extract, but rather had pelleted with the insoluble cellular material. The EBNA1 affinity column experiment was also performed with a B-cell lysate and resulted in the same panel of EBNA1-binding proteins as was isolated from the HeLa lysate (data not shown).Fig. 2Comparison of EBNA1 and Δ325–376 affinity column profiles. HeLa cell lysate was applied to columns containing EBNA1, Δ325–376, or no protein (None). The retained proteins were eluted and analyzed as described for Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since EBNA1 is a highly basic protein (pI 11), we expected that some cellular proteins containing acidic regions would interact with EBNA1 through nonspecific ionic interactions. To identify these proteins, we compared the cellular proteins eluted from the EBNA1 column with those eluted from a column containing TATA box-binding protein (TBP), which has a pI similar to that EBNA1. The elution profile from the TBP column shows that the EBNA1-binding proteins importin-β, TAFI-α, p32/TAP, and pp32 were also retained on the TBP column, suggesting that they interact nonspecifically with basic proteins (Fig. 1A). We also excised bands from the TBP elution profile that migrated at positions similar to those of NAP1, importin-α, and USP7, but MALDI-TOF analyses of these bands indicated that NAP1, importin-α, and USP7 were not present in the TBP eluate. We conclude that USP7, NAP1, importin-α and TAF-Iβ interact specifically with EBNA1. Karyopherin-β and CK2 bands were not observed on the TBP column; however, since they are close to the limit of detection in the EBNA1 profile, we cannot be certain that they are not present in the TBP profile.We next tested the relative affinity of the EBNA1-binding proteins for EBNA1 by rechromatography of EBNA1 column eluates on a second EBNA1 column. Eluates from three EBNA1 columns were pooled, dialyzed to lower the salt to 100 mm, and then reapplied to another EBNA1 column. When the high salt elution profiles were compared from the first- and second-pass EBNA1 columns, bands corresponding to USP7, importin-α, CK2α, CK2α′, and p32/TAP were all observed to be enriched upon rechromatography relative to the other bands (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these proteins bind EBNA1 with higher affinity than the other proteins. Two bands corresponding to NAP1 were identified in this experiment; the lower band is a proteolytic fragment of the full-length protein.We have previously shown that EBNA1 amino acids 325–376 are essential for both the transcriptional activation and partitioning functions of EBNA1, suggesting that these residues mediate interactions with cellular proteins involved in these processes (15Shire K. Ceccarelli D.F.J. Avolio-Hunter T.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ceccarelli D.F. Frappier L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To uncover cellular proteins that interact with this functionally important region of EBNA1, we constructed affinity columns using an EBNA1 mutant lacking amino acids 325–376 (Δ325–376) and compared the profile of cellular proteins retained on this column with that on an EBNA1 column (Fig. 2). In each of three experiments, importin-α and NAP1 were not detected on the Δ325–376 column, indicating that residues 325–376 are important for importin-α and NAP1 binding. No other consistent differences were observed between the EBNA1 and Δ325–376 profiles.Mapping of the USP7-interacting Region of EBNA1—The EBNA1-USP7 interaction had not been previously identified and passed all of our criteria for a bona fide interaction, viz. reproducibility, specificity, and strength of binding. To further verify this interaction and to determine whether it is direct or mediated by another human protein, we coexpressed both proteins in insect cells using baculoviruses, metabolically labeled the cells, and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-EBNA1 antibody (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitates from cell lysates expressing both EBNA1 and USP7 contained labeled bands corresponding to EBNA1 and USP7 (lanes 5 and 14). USP7 also immunoprecipitated with a version of EBNA1 containing a longer Gly-Ala repeat region (EBNA1GA) (lane 13). The USP7 band was not detected in anti-EBNA1 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing either USP7 alone or EBNA1 alone (lanes 8 and 15). Thus, the EBNA1-USP7 interaction does not require other human proteins.Fig. 3Mapping of the USP7-binding region of EBNA1 by co-immunoprecipitation.

One type comprises the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2). The other type comprises the activating transcription factors 6 (ATF6α and ATF6β), which are activated in response to ER stress. It was shown previously that both SREBP and ATF6 are cleaved sequentially first by the Site-1 protease (serine protease) and then by the Site-2 protease (metalloprotease) (Ye, J., Rawson, R. B., Komuro, R., Chen, X., Dave, U. P., Prywes, R., Brown, M. S., and Goldstein, J. L. (2000) Mol. Cell 6, 1355–1364). In this study, we examined various protease inhibitors and found that 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), a serine protease inhibitor, prevented ER stress-induced cleavage of ATF6α and ATF6β, resulting in inhibition of transcriptional induction of ATF6-target genes. AEBSF also inhibited production of the mature form of SREBP-2 that was induced in response to sterol depletion, and appeared to directly prevent cleavage of ATF6α and ATF6β by inhibiting Site-1 protease. As the Site-1 protease is localized in the Golgi apparatus, both SREBP and ATF6 must relocate to the Golgi apparatus to be cleaved. We showed here that AEBSF treatment had little effect on ER stress-induced translocation of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, but blocked nuclear localization of ATF6. These results indicate that the transport of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and that from the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus are distinct steps that can be distinguished by treatment with AEBSF.

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar) or the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (2Kaufman R.J.

These intracellular signaling pathways from the ER to the nucleus culminate in the activation of transcription of appropriate genes whose products are required to cope with the disturbance, leading to the maintenance of homeostasis. Sterol depletion activates certain basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper-type transcription factors, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2), by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Thus, the precursor forms of SREBPs synthesized as transmembrane proteins in the ER are cleaved in response to sterol depletion so that the soluble N-terminal fragments of SREBPs released from the membrane (mature forms) enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins from plasma (6Yokoyama C.

Cells cope with unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER under ER stress conditions primarily by transient attenuation of translation and by transcriptional induction of genes encoding ER-resident molecular chaperones (BiP/GRP78, GRP94 etc.) and folding enzymes (protein-disulfide isomerase, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, etc.), leading to augmenting the folding capacity in the ER. These processes are collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 3Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 4Urano F. Bertolotti A. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 21: 3697-3702Google Scholar, 5Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). ER chaperones commonly contain in their promoter regions a unique cis-acting element designated as the ER stress response element (ERSE), whose consensus sequence is CCAAT-N9-CCACG; the ERSE is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone genes (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 11Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As the general transcription factor NF-Y (CBF) constitutively occupies the CCAAT part of the ERSE (12Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of ER stress response factor(s) to the ERSE requires a component that is capable of binding to the CCACG part of the ERSE and that is specifically activated during the UPR. We previously identified the basic leucine zipper proteins ATF6α (encoded by the ATF6 gene) and ATF6β (encoded by the G13/cAMP response element-binding protein-related protein gene) as CCACG-binding proteins (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 13Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both ATF6α and ATF6β are constitutively synthesized as type II transmembrane glycoproteins that are anchored in the ER and are activated by proteolysis in response to ER stress (13Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragments thereby released from the membrane (mature forms of ATF6α and ATF6β) enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of their target genes via direct binding to the CCACG part of the ERSE in a manner dependent on the binding of NF-Y to the CCAAT part (15Yoshida H.

In this study, we used a pharmacological approach to gain insight into the mechanism of activation of ATF6α and ATF6β by ER stress, and found that the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) inhibits ER stress-induced proteolysis of both ATF6α and ATF6β, resulting in inhibition of transcriptional induction of ATF6-target genes by ER stress. While this was in progress, Ye et al. (18Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) showed by transient transfection experiments that upon ER stress ATF6α is cleaved sequentially by the Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P), which are known to process SREBP sequentially in response to sterol depletion. S1P, also called subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (19Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chretien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Thus, two intracellular signaling systems from the ER to the nucleus (the SREBP and ATF6 pathways) share molecular machinery that connects events in the ER to those in the nucleus. This observation led to the prediction that ATF6 would need to relocate from the ER to the Golgi apparatus to be cleaved, similarly to SREBP, as S1P is localized in the Golgi apparatus (8DeBose-Boyd R.A.

It was recently demonstrated by transient transfection experiments that this is the case (20Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 21Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev.

We show here for the first time that endogenous ATF6 was translocated from the ER to the nucleus via the Golgi apparatus in response to ER stress and that AEBSF blocked the nuclear translocation of ATF6 without affecting its movement from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that AEBSF inhibited S1P directly. Cell Culture and Protease Inhibitors—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. Various protease inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and dissolved in H2O or dimethyl sulfoxide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of Plasmids and Transfection—Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To express the wild-type (WT) or enzymatically inactive mutant version (H249A) of human S1P/subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 in the ER forcedly, a series of plasmids were constructed as follows. A double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for the ER retention signal KDEL flanked by the 5′ XhoI site and 3′ stop codon and ApaI sites (5′-TCGAGAAAGACGAACTCTGAGGGCC-3′ plus 5′-CTCAGAGTTCGTCTTTC-3′) was inserted between the XhoI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA-KDEL-stop. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the c-Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) flanked by 5′ BamHI and 3′ XhoI sites (5′-GATCCGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGC-3′ plus 5′-TCGAGCAGGTCCTCCTCTGAGATCAGCTTCTGCTCG-3′) was inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA-KDEL-stop to create pcDNA-c-Myc-KDEL-stop. The amino acid region 1–997 of the WT or H249A mutant of human S1P/subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (23Elagoz A. Benjannet S. Mammarbassi A. Wickham L. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11265-11275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR together with the 5′ NheI site (set in the 5′-untranslated region) and 3′ BamHI site (set immediately after the amino acid 997), and inserted between the NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA-c-Myc-KDEL-stop to create pcDNA-S1P(ΔTMD)-KDEL(WT) or pcDNA-S1P(ΔTMD)-KDEL(H249A) after their sequences had been confirmed. HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells) were transfected with these plasmids using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunoblotting—ATF6α and ATF6β were detected with anti-ATF6α (14Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) and anti-ATF6β (13Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) antibodies, respectively. Mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody (clone 10C3) was obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Mouse anti-c-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) and rabbit anti-ATF4 (cAMP-response element-binding protein 2) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa cells cultured until ∼70% confluency were treated in the experiments as described in the text. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Okada T. Yoshida H. Akazawa R. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and analyzed by the standard procedure (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was detected using an LAS-1000plus LuminoImage analyzer (Fuji Film, New York). PERK was first immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells with anti-PERK antibody (a kind gift of Dr. David Ron, New York University School of Medicine) and then detected by immunoblotting with the same antibody as described previously (25Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). To study the processing of SREBP-2 in response to sterol depletion, HeLa cells were cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, antibiotics, 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (Sigma), 50 μm pravastatin (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor), and 50 μm sodium mevalonate. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and examined by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody (RS004) against amino acids 1–481 of human SREBP-2 (27Inoue J. Kumagai H. Terada T. Maeda M. Shimizu M. Sato R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Ten-microgram aliquots of RNA were subjected to electrophoresis using 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and analyzed by standard Northern blotting procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using an Alk-Phos direct labeling kit (Amersham Bioscience). Chemiluminescence was detected using an LAS-1000plus LuminoImage analyzer. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on Lab-tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International K.K., Rochester, NY). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline one time, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. They were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline with rabbit anti-ATF6α antibody (1:50 dilution) or mouse anti-GM130 antibody (1:50 dilution) obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies bound to the cells were visualized by further incubation of the cells for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) or 20 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), followed by confocal microscopy performed using an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). Inhibition of ER Stress-induced Proteolysis of ATF6α and ATF6β by AEBSF—We employed various types of protease inhibitors to determine the nature of the protease responsible for the conversion of ATF6α and ATF6β from the precursor forms (designated pATF6α(P) and pATF6β(P), respectively) to the mature forms (designated pATF6α(N) and pATF6β(N), respectively) in response to ER stress. HeLa cells were pretreated for 1 h with each of the 13 chemicals tested at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and then treated for 2 h with 300 nm thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by inhibiting ER Ca2+-ATPase (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). As a result, only AEBSF, a serine protease inhibitor, was found to block the production of pATF6α(N) and pATF6β(N) (Fig. 1, lane 3). The inhibitory effect of AEBSF was dependent on its dose, and pretreatment with 300 μm AEBSF was required to eliminate subsequent thapsigargin-induced proteolysis of ATF6α and ATF6β completely (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6). It should be noted that this concentration of AEBSF was comparable with those used to inhibit Myc-mediated apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts (200 μm) (28Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or to inhibit the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced differentiation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (190 μm) (29Bestilny L.J. Riabowol K.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, other serine protease inhibitors such as p-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and chymostatin showed no effect even at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 2, lanes 7–18). Time course experiments indicated that pretreatment with 300 μm AEBSF did not delay the processing but abolished the production of both pATF6α(N) and pATF6β(N) in response to thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the protease(s) responsible for cleaving ATF6α and ATF6β in ER-stressed cells are sensitive to AEBSF.Fig. 2Dose dependence of the effects of various serine protease inhibitors on the processing of ATF6α and ATF6β induced by thapsigargin. HeLa cells in 60-mm dishes were pretreated for 1 h with one of the four serine protease inhibitors at the indicated concentrations and then treated with (+) or without (–) 300 nm thapsigargin (Tg) without removal of inhibitors. Two hours later, whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

A, HeLa cells were pretreated with (+) or without (–) 300 μm AEBSF for 1 h and then treated with 300 nm thapsigargin (Tg) without removal of AEBSF for the indicated periods. Whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-ATF6α or anti-ATF6β antibodies as well as anti-KDEL antibody, which recognizes BiP. The positions of pATF6α(P), pATF6α(N), pATF6β(P), and pATF6β(N) as well as BiP are marked. The migration positions of full-range rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) are indicated on the left. B, HeLa cells were treated as in A (lanes 1–8) or incubated with 300 μm AEBSF alone for the indicated periods (lanes 9–11). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using a cDNA probe specific to BiP, Asn-S, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of AEBSF Pretreatment on the UPR—We next determined the effects of AEBSF pretreatment on the UPR by measuring the level of BiP/GRP78, a major target of the UPR, which was strongly induced by thapsigargin treatment at both the protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6) and mRNA levels (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). When cells were pretreated with AEBSF prior to the addition of thapsigargin, induction of BiP was not observed at either the protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12) or mRNA levels (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8), indicating that AEBSF functions as an inhibitor of the UPR. We also examined the effects of AEBSF pretreatment on ER stress inducers other than thapsigargin; namely, tunicamycin and 2-deoxyglucose, inhibitors of protein N-glycosylation (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), and dithiothreitol, which causes malfolding of proteins by disrupting disulfide bonds (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). As expected from our previous results (13Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar), the proteolysis of both ATF6α (Fig. 4A) and ATF6β (data not shown) was triggered by dithiothreitol (Fig. 4A, lane 5), tunicamycin (lane 7), and 2-deoxyglucose (lane 9), as well as thapsigargin (lane 3). Importantly, pretreatment of cells with 300 μm AEBSF efficiently blocked the proteolysis of ATF6α in response to subsequent treatment with thapsigargin (Fig. 4A, lane 4), tunicamycin (lane 8), or 2-deoxyglucose (lane 10). Although the inhibitory effect of AEBSF on the processing of ATF6α induced by 1 mm dithiothreitol was not complete (lane 6), we found that AEBSF pretreatment completely inhibited the cleavage of ATF6α and ATF6β and the subsequent induction of BiP by 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). These results suggested that the proteolytic processing of ATF6α and ATF6β mediated by a protease(s) sensitive to AEBSF is a key regulatory step in the UPR.Fig. 5Time course of dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced processing of ATF6α/β and induction of BiP and Asn-S in cells pretreated with or without AEBSF. HeLa cells were pretreated with (+) or without (–) 300 μm AEBSF for 1 h and then treated with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol without removal of AEBSF for the indicated periods. Whole cell extracts and total RNA were prepared and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3, A and B, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nonetheless, it remains possible that AEBSF pretreatment inhibited the proteolysis of ATF6α and ATF6β and subsequent induction of BiP mRNA and BiP protein in response to ER stress by somehow preventing accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. We therefore examined the effects of AEBSF pretreatment on ER stress-induced activation of PERK, a key mediator of translational attenuation that occurs immediately in response to ER stress (30Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 31Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Because PERK is a transmembrane protein kinase activated by oligomerization and autophosphorylation, its activation status can be monitored by its mobility on SDS gels (25Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar); phosphorylated (i.e. activated) PERK migrates more slowly than inactive PERK as shown Fig. 4A (compare lane 1 with lane 3 for example). AEBSF pretreatment did not inhibit the activation of PERK induced by thapsigargin (compare lane 4 with lane 3) or dithiothreitol (compare lane 6 with lane 5), indicating that unfolded proteins were accumulated under these conditions even in the presence of AEBSF. In contrast, AEBSF pretreatment did block the activation of PERK induced by tunicamycin (compare lane 8 with lane 7) or 2-deoxyglucose (compare lane 10 with lane 9). Consistent with these observations, the deglycosylated form of pATF6α(P), pATF6α(P*), produced in cells treated with tunicamycin (lane 7) or 2-deoxyglucose (lane 9) was not detected in the presence of AEBSF (lanes 8 and 10, respectively). Thus, AEBSF pretreatment antagonized the effects of ER stress inducers that promote accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER by inhibiting protein N-glycosylation; the reason for these unexpected results is currently not known. ER stress-induced activation of PERK results in phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, leading to general translational attenuation (30Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 31Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, this attenuation induces translation of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF4, causing transcriptional induction of ATF4-target genes such as the basic leucine zipper transcription factor CHOP in response to ER stress (32Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). We recently reported evidence suggesting that the asparagine synthetase (Asn-S) gene is also a target of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α-ATF4 pathway (24Okada T. Yoshida H. Akazawa R. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATF4 was rapidly induced in cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6) or dithiothreitol (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–6), and Asn-S mRNA was induced in cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4) or dithiothreitol (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–4) accordingly. Unexpectedly, however, we found that the induction of ATF4 by thapsigargin or dithiothreitol was attenuated or delayed, respectively, in cells pretreated with AEBSF (Fig. 4, B, lanes 7–12, C, lanes 7–12, respectively"

Cell death in physiological K+ parallels the developmental expression of the TASK-1 and TASK-3 subunits that encode the pH-sensitive standing outward K+ current IKso. Genetic transfer of the TASK subunits in hippocampal neurons, lacking IKso, induces cell death, while their genetic inactivation protects cerebellar granule neurons. Neuronal death of cultured rat granule neurons is also prevented by conditions that specifically reduce K+ efflux through the TASK-3 channels such as extracellular acidosis and ruthenium red. TASK leak K+ channels thus play an important role in K+-dependent apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons in culture.

In the present report, we investigated whether K+ channels might be involved in in vitro K+-dependent granule neuronal apoptosis. A novel family of mammalian K+ channel subunits which comprise four transmembrane segments and two P domains in tandem has recently been discovered (25Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). So far, 15 human 2P domain K+ channel subunits have been identified. These subunits dimerize to form functional K+ channels (29Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Lopes C.M. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

The TASK 2P domain K+ channels are characterized by a typical leak or background activity and are open at rest. By contrast, the TREK/TRAAK 2P domain K+ channels require either a physical (stretch, heat, intracellular acidosis) or chemical (poly-unsaturated fatty acids, lysophospholipids, inhalational anesthetics, riluzole, membrane crenators) stimulation to open (25Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Patel A.J. Honoré E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 2: 422-426Google Scholar). The 2P domain K+ channels are resistant to the classical K+ channel blockers including tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (25Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Patel A.J. Honoré E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 2: 422-426Google Scholar). TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels (KCNK3 and KCNK9) are reversibly inhibited by extracellular acidosis with a pK value of about 7.3 and 6.7, respectively (30Lopes C.M. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), while TASK-3 is blocked by ruthenium red in the micromolar range (38Czirjak G. Enyedi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The TASK channels are additionally down-modulated by the activation of Gq-coupled receptors including the m3 muscarinic receptor (39Talley E.M. Lei Q. Sirois J.E. Bayliss D.A.

Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Rat GN express high levels of an outwardly rectifying K+ current, termed IKso (standing outward K+ current), which shares all the biophysical, pharmacological, and regulation characteristics of the TASK-1 and TASK-3 two-pore domain K+ channels (41Millar J.A. Barratt L. Southan A.P. Page K.M. Fyffe R.E.W. Robertson B. Mathie A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 48Watkins C.S. Mathie A. J.

In this study, we demonstrate that TASK-3 channels contribute to IKso and are involved in K+-dependent rat granule neuronal death in culture. Neuronal Cell Cultures—Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from 7–8-day-old Wistar rats (Iffa Credo, France). Neurons were seeded on poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated dishes or coverslips at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/cm2 and cultured in Eagle's basal medium (EMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 25 mm KCl, 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. To prevent growth of glial cells, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (10 μm) was added to the cultures 24 h following plating. GN were similarly prepared from 5–6-day-old OF1 mice. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from 18–19-day fetal Wistar rats (Iffa Credo, France). Neurons were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/cm2 and cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum (Sigma) and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. After 48 h, the serum-supplemented medium was replaced by EMEM containing B27 supplement, and cells were used for viral infection experiments after 1 week. Electrophysiological Recordings—The electrophysiological procedure has been previously described in detail elsewhere (31Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 37Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 44Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded in the perforated configuration with amphotericin B (240 μg/ml). The standard external solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES pH 7.2 with KOH. Cells were continuously superfused with a microperfusion system during the time course of the experiments (0.1 ml/min). Experiments were performed at room temperature. The K+-rich solution contained 120 mm KCl instead of NaCl. pH of the external solution was adjusted with HCl. Staurosporine (Sigma) stock solution was made in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm. Methanandamide was provided as an ethanol solution (BioMol). VDM11 (a gift of V. Di Marzo) and AAOCF3 (BioMol) were disolved in ethanol at a concentration of 100 mm. Muscarine (Sigma) stock solution was made in water at a concentration of 100 mm. 4-Diphenylacetoxyl-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) (RBI), tetraethylammonium (TEA, Sigma), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and ruthenium red (Sigma) were directly dissolved in the external medium. Solvents were routinely included in the control solutions when needed, and pH was always carefully adjusted. Induction of Apoptosis—Unless otherwise stated, the GN were maintained for the first 8 days in vitro (8 DIV) in a standard medium (S+, 25K) (EMEM, Sigma) containing 10 μm cytosine arabinoside. Hereafter, the cells were washed once and then switched to a serum-free medium containing 5 mm K+ and 20 mm NaCl instead of KCl (S–, 5K). Sister cultures were washed identically and maintained in serum-free medium containing 25 mm KCl (S–, 25K). In control experiments, the effect of short term serum deprivation was determined on cell survival. Hydrolyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) was used in the S+ conditions, because addition of fresh normal calf serum is known to be toxic to mature GN (50Eldadah B.A. Yakolev A.G. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Daniels M. Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During a 15-h treatment (maximal time window used in the present report), serum deprivation did not significantly alter cell survival in either 5 mm or 25 mm KCl-treated cultures. Both the S– 5 K and 25 K media lacked cytosine arabinoside that has been previously shown to be toxic to cerebellar granules after K+ withdrawal (51Daniels M. Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this model of culture, neuronal death is thus mainly due to K+ withdrawal (51Daniels M. Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 19: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the complete absence of cytosine arabinoside in the culture medium, both glial cells and GN survive up to 10 days in the S+, 25K medium, whereas only glial cells survive in the S+, 5K medium. Cell death in the 5K medium was therefore independent of the presence or the absence of cytosine arabinoside, i.e. of glial cells. pH was buffered using either: 1/increasing concentrations of HCO3- in the EMEM(osmotic compensation with NaCl); 2/HEPES 10 mm titrated with NaOH (2 m in EMEM). Osmolarity of the culture medium was checked with a Knauer automatic osmometer. In experiments with pharmacological agents, solvents were always included in the control solutions when needed. Assessment of Cell Death—Neuronal injury was quantitatively assessed by the measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the medium or by staining the nuclei with the cromatin-fixing dyes propidium iodide (PI) or 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For staining purposes, cells were fixed with freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4%. For nuclear staining with PI, cells were permeabilized with 70% ethanol and incubated in phospate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (5 μg/ml during 10 min). The nuclei of dying cells were highly fluorescent and condensed compared with live cells. Neuronal cell death was scored by counting in at least 6 randomly chosen subfields with a 25× objective for each sample. Results are mean ± S.E. of counting in three independent experiments. Staining with DAPI was performed using a ready-to-use mounting medium containing DAPI (Vectashield, Vector). Further assessment of apoptosis was performed as described below. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription PCR—Cells grown in (S+, 25K) in 60-mm dishes were recovered for RNA analysis at distinct days in vitro (DIV 1, 3, 5, and 8). For comparison, cerebellum was isolated from 7-, 10-, 14-, and 21-day-old rats. Total RNAs were extracted by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) for cerebellum and by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) for cultured granule neurons. Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg of total mRNA, treated for 30 min with DNaseI (Roche Applied Science), and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transciptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR analysis (SYBR Green Mastermix Plus, Eurogentec) was performed to estimate the level of expression of both TASK-1 and TASK-3 in cerebellum and cultured granule neurons. Real-time PCR assays for each gene target were performed on cDNA samples in 96-well optical plates on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection system (PE Biosystems). PCR data was captured using Sequence Detector Software. The data were analyzed using the comparative CT method where the amount of target is normalized to an endogenous reference (cyclophylin D) (User Bulletin N°2 Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed in triplicate. The following primers were used for PCR: rTASK-1, for: 5′-CGGCTTCCGCAACGTCTAT-3′ and rev: 5′-TTGTACCAGAGGCACGAGCA-3′; rTASK-3, for: 5′-GACGTGCTGAGGAACACCTACTT-3′ and rev: 5′-GTGTGCATTCCAGGAGGGA-3′; cyclophilin D, for: 5′-GGCTCTTGAAATGGACCCTTC-3′ and rev: 5′-CAGCCAATGCTTGATCATATTCTT-3′. Standard curves were generated for each set of primers using serial dilutions of rat brain cDNA to ensure a similar efficiency of amplification. DNA Fragmentation Analysis—Cells (60-mm culture plates) were lysed in extraction buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 200 μg/ml proteinase K) at 37 °C overnight. DNA was subsequently extracted with phenol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and analyzed on an agarose gel (1.2% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using a UV light source. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling (TUNEL) labeling, the in situ cell death detection kit (fluorescein) from Roche Applied Science was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of Caspase Activity—After incubation of GN in low K+ media for 4 h (at distinct pH: 6.4, 6.8, and 7.2), cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer, and caspase activity was determined using the Neosystem kit. Results are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate values. Generation of Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) Vectors—The mutant vector SFV(PD) carries two point mutations in the non-structural protein 2 gene (S259P and R650D) and is characterized by a lack of cellular toxicity and an increased level of transgene expression, as compared with the wild-type SFV vector. To express the EGFP reporter gene (Clontech) separately from any gene of interest, we transformed pSFV(PD) into a double-subgenomic RNA promoter vector, termed pSFV(PD)-Sub-GFP. Briefly, using pSFV-GFP as a template, we amplified by PCR the cDNA encompassing the 26 S subgenomic RNA promoter region (including the 19 nucleotides upstream from the 26 S subgenomic RNA), and the EGFP gene with primers containing a NotI and an ApaI site (forward and reverse primer, respectively). The resulting PCR fragment was then inserted into the NotI/ApaI sites of pSFV(PD), yielding pSFV(PD)-Sub-GFP. This vectors retains in the multiple cloning site the following unique restriction sites to insert genes of interest under the control of the first 26 S subgenomic RNA promoter: RsrII-BssHII-XmaI-SmaI-XhoI-SpeI-NotI (5′- to 3′-end). We used pSFV(PD)-Sub-GFP to insert the following cDNAs: mTREK-1, mTREK1E306A, rTASK-1, rTASK-3, rTASK-1G95E, and rTASK-3G95E. In vitro transcribed vector RNA was introduced with RNA from pSFV-Helper2 into baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK) cells by electroporation. Recombinant SFV particles were harvested after 24 h, activated with α-chymotrypsin, centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 2 h, and resuspended in neuronal medium. TASK-1 and TASK-3 viruses were generated in a culture medium containing 25 mm KCl. TASK Viral Overexpression in Cerebellar Granule and Hippocampal Neurons—Hippocampal neurons 6 DIV were infected as indicated above, but the media were replaced by freshly pH-adjusted EMEM after 2 h of incubation. After 16–24 h, cells were rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and used for DAPI and TUNEL staining. For TUNEL labeling we used the in situ detection kit (TMR-red) from Roche Applied Science. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Channel-expressing cells were visualized by green fluorescence, TUNEL-labeled cells by red fluorescence, and DAPI-colored nuclei were visualized by blue fluorescence. Apoptotic cells were scored by counting 80 green cells from each culture dish, two dishes per condition. The results were pooled from four separate experiments. In each case, cell viability/death were estimated by both DAPI and TUNEL labeling. 5 DIV GN cultures were infected by addition of virus into the culture medium. The viruses were left for 36 h, because of a weaker efficiency of infection compared with hippocampal neurons, then GN were transferred to virus-free media containing 5 mm KCl. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde after 6 h. After fixation, cells were mounted in DAPI-containing mounting medium, and the number of dead (pyknotic or fragmented nuclei) or alive green fluorescent cells were counted by fluorescence microscopy. Non-neuronal cells, which were bigger and less bright after the DAPI staining were not counted. The results were pooled from four separate experiments. Developmental Expression of IKso and TASK Channel Subunits in Rat Cerebellar Granule Neurons—IKso was present at a very modest level in young neurons (DIV 1–3), whereas there was a gradual and substantial increase in its amplitude in older cultures (Fig. 1, A–E). The current density of IKso and the resting membrane potential reached a maximum at about 9–10 DIV (Fig. 1, E–F). IKso displayed a typical background activity, which was inhibited at acidic extracellular pH (Fig. 1, B–C). The effect of external acidosis was dose-dependent and half-maximal inhibition was observed at a pH value of 6.7 (Fig. 1D). In 9 DIV GN, decreasing external pH to"

Binding of the competitive inhibitor 5-n-heptyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole to the Qo site of the cytochrome bc 1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed by x-ray crystallography. This alkylhydroxydioxobenzothiazole is bound in its ionized form as evident from the crystal structure and confirmed by spectroscopic analysis, consistent with a measured pK a = 6.1 of the hydroxy group in detergent micelles. Stabilizing forces for the hydroxyquinone anion inhibitor include a polarized hydrogen bond to the iron-sulfur cluster ligand His181 and on-edge interactions via weak hydrogen bonds with cytochrome b residue Tyr279. The hydroxy group of the latter contributes to stabilization of the Rieske protein in the b-position by donating a hydrogen bond. The reported pH dependence of inhibition with lower efficacy at alkaline pH is attributed to the protonation state of His181 with a pK a of 7.5. Glu272, a proposed primary ligand and proton acceptor of ubiquinol, is not bound to the carbonyl group of the hydroxydioxobenzothiazole ring but is rotated out of the binding pocket toward the heme b L propionate A, to which it is hydrogen-bonded via a single water molecule. The observed hydrogen bonding pattern provides experimental evidence for the previously proposed proton exit pathway involving the heme propionate and a chain of water molecules. Binding of the alkyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole is discussed as resembling an intermediate step of ubiquinol oxidation, supporting a single occupancy model at the Qo site.

The observed hydrogen bonding pattern provides experimental evidence for the previously proposed proton exit pathway involving the heme propionate and a chain of water molecules. Binding of the alkyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole is discussed as resembling an intermediate step of ubiquinol oxidation, supporting a single occupancy model at the Qo site. Ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc 1 complex, EC 1.10.2.2 (bc 1 complex)) is a multisubunit membrane protein complex, which is one of the fundamental components of respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains. The enzyme catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and couples this process to electrogenic translocation of protons across the membrane (1Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Berry E.A. Guergova K. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Each functional unit of the homodimeric complex consists of three catalytic subunits: cytochrome b with two b type hemes, cytochrome c 1 with one c type heme, and the Rieske protein containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Mitochondrial bc 1 complexes contain up to eight additional subunits. Structures of vertebrate and yeast bc 1 complexes were determined, providing a breakthrough in understanding the enzyme mechanism and structure-function relationships within the enzyme (3Xia D.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The 2.3-Å resolution structure from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has the highest resolution available so far. It allowed a detailed description of substrate and inhibitor binding sites, elucidating parts of the enzyme mechanism and suggesting pathways for proton transfer. The mechanism of the enzyme known as the protonmotive Q cycle (8Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) involves separate catalytic sites for ubiquinol oxidation (Qo site) and ubiquinone reduction (Qi site). Protons are taken up from the matrix side when ubiquinone is reduced and released to the intermembrane side when ubiquinol is oxidized. The key reaction, ubiquinol oxidation, involves a bifurcated electron transfer. One electron is passed via the [2Fe-2S] cluster to heme c 1, subsequently reducing the substrate cytochrome c. The electron transfer to cytochrome c 1 involves a large scale domain movement of the extrinsic part of the Rieske protein (4Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The second electron from ubiquinol is transferred via the low and the high potential b type hemes to ubiquinone. The resulting stable semiquinone is fully reduced after a second ubiquinol molecule is oxidized at the Qo site. Whereas the main features of catalysis are understood, the molecular mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation is not clear. Also, pathways for proton uptake and release are hypothetical (7Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9Berry E.A. Zhang Z. Huang L.S. Kim S.H. Biochem. Soc.

A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the divergent transfer of electrons into thermodynamically different pathways (see Ref. 2Berry E.A. Guergova K. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The double occupancy model suggests synergistic interaction between two quinone molecules that occupy the Qo site simultaneously (11Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L.

Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35231-35234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The protongated charge transfer mechanism proposes that the activation barrier is a function of the deprotonation of ubiquinol (14Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but this mechanism is not supported by other kinetic studies (15Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova K. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Single occupancy models include simultaneous as well as sequential electron transfer to the acceptors. For the latter, a proton-gated affinity change mechanism claims the presence of a relatively stable intermediate in the transition state with the rate-limiting step at the second electron transfer (16Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since a semiquinone radical has not been detected at the Qo site, this has been explained by an EPR silent anti-ferromagnetically coupled semiquinone-[2Fe-2S]reduced pair (16Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Junemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the undetectable semiquinone is provided by Crofts et al. (10Crofts A.R. Hong S. Ugulava N. Barquera B. Gennis R. Guergova K. Berry E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova K. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), who suggest rapid dissociation of the product after the first electron transfer and movement of the semiquinone within the bilobal Qo binding pocket to allow rapid reduction of heme b L. Recent kinetic data show that the midpoint potentials of b type hemes control the rate of cytochrome c 1 reduction. This is consistent with the view that ubiquinol oxidation is a concerted reaction (19Snyder C.H. Gutierrez C. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Inhibitors are important tools to analyze the molecular mechanism of Qo site catalysis. Three types of inhibitors can be distinguished: ligands binding at the proximal domain and therefore perturbing the spectroscopic properties of heme b L (Qo-I; e.g. myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene), those binding to the distal domain and affecting the Rieske [2Fe-2S] EPR line shape (Qo-II; e.g. UHDBT), 1The abbreviations used are: UHDBT, 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole; HHDBT, 5-n-heptyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole; THDBT, 5-n-tridecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole; UM, n-undecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; UQ6, coenzyme Q6; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. or compounds exhibiting both effects (Qo-III; e.g. stigmatellin) (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Kinetic data indicate that occupation of these inhibitors at the Qo site is mutually exclusive, suggesting overlapping binding sites. This was observed in crystal structures where these inhibitors are found to bind in different but overlapping domains of the bilobal Qo site, termed distal and proximal to heme b L (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Analysis of anomalous scattering data indicated a high occupancy of the catalytic Rieske domain in the b-position in the presence of inhibitors that bind to the distal domain, such as stigmatellin and UHDBT (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, in previous crystallographic studies on UHDBT binding (18Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova K. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the inhibitor could not be refined, and high resolution structural information about UHDBT binding at the active site has not been available up to now. The substrate ubiquinol has not been detected in the Qo site by x-ray structural analysis. Therefore, the analysis of structural analogs of the substrate that function as competitive inhibitors is important. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of a UHDBT analog, HHDBT-inhibited bc 1 complex from the yeast S. cerevisiae at 2.5-Å resolution. This hydroxyquinone binds in its ionized form, and its binding is discussed as resembling an intermediate step of ubiquinol oxidation. Conformational changes at the binding site confirm the previously postulated proton transfer pathway and reveal plasticity at the active site. Protein Purification and Crystallization—The bc 1 complex from the yeast S. cerevisiae was purified, and a co-complex with the antibody fragment Fv18E11 was formed and crystallized as previously described with the following minor modifications (6Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 21Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Schagger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2003: 191-203Crossref Google Scholar). The buffer volume for detergent exchange in the second DEAE anion exchange chromatographic step was reduced by 5-fold. HHDBT was added at a final concentration of 100 μm to the purified bc 1 complex-Fv co-complex after size exclusion chromatography (TSK4000; TosoHaas) prior to crystallization. The final purification step was performed at pH 7.5. The crystals were obtained using a microseeding and vapor diffusion technique against polyethylene glycol 4000 at 4 °C. The protein solution (50 mg/ml) was mixed with precipitation agent (5% polyethylene glycol 4000, Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (adjusted at room temperature), 0.05% n-undecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, 10 μm HHDBT), resulting in a pH of 8.0 at 4 °C; i.e. 0.5 pH unit lower than the structure of the stigmatellin-inhibited enzyme (6Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Crystals grew within a few days to a size suitable for x-ray analysis (∼0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 mm). Total protein determination was performed with a modified Lowry procedure, using the BC Assay protein quantitation kit (Uptima) (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18708) Google Scholar). The bc 1 complex content was estimated as half the amount from spectroscopic quantification of the two b-type hemes using an extinction coefficient of 28.5 mm–1 cm–1 for the dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectra (262–275 nm). Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring cytochrome c reduction in a spectrophotometric assay at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm–1 cm–1 for cytochrome c. Turnover numbers refer to mol of cytochrome c reduced mol–1 of bc 1 complex s–1 under conditions of continuous turnover, where the catalytic reaction is zero order with respect to decyl ubiquinol and cytochrome c. A detailed description is reported elsewhere (21Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Schagger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2003: 191-203Crossref Google Scholar). pK a Determination of Hydroxydioxobenzothiazoles—For determination of the pK a in detergent micelles, the longer tridecyl side chain analog was used to retain partitioning of the inhibitor into the micelle. THDBT was dissolved at 5 μm in a buffered mixture containing 20 mm MES, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm TAPS, 100 mm NaCl, and 400 μm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, pH 3.5. The pH was adjusted by increments of 0.2–0.5 pH units from pH 3.5 to 8.5 by adding 5 m KOH. Optical spectra were recorded from 250–350 nm with a slit width of 1.5 nm on a computerized DW2a dual wavelength spectrophotometer controlled by OLIS software (On-Line Instruments Systems, Bogart, GA). Determination of the Apparent K m of Yeast bc 1 Complex for Ubiquinol in the Absence and Presence of UHDBT—The reaction mixture consisted of 25 μm cytochrome c in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 200 μm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20. Prior to the reaction, the complex was diluted to 15 μm in the same buffer and incubated for ∼45 min on ice. The concentration of decyl ubiquinol was varied, and the activity was measured in the absence or presence of UHDBT. Determination of the Ionization State of Bound THDBT—The bc 1 complex was diluted to a concentration of 2.84 μm in a buffer at pH 6.0 (50 mm MES, 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm TAPS, 250 mm sucrose, 200 μm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 0.1% Tween 20). The complex had an absorbance at 280 nm = 2.7 and a 280:414 absorbance ratio of 3. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 350 nm on the DW2a dual wavelength spectrophotometer. In order to obtain maximum illumination, the slit was set at 6 nm, and the UV filter, quartz diffuser and beam scrambler were removed from the spectrophotometer. Data Collection and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 4 °C at the synchroton beamline ID14EH3 at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), using a charge-coupled device detector (marCCD; Mar USA, Evanston, IL). Data were processed with the program DENZO and merged using SCALEPACK from the HKL package (HKL Research, Charlottesville, NC) (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group C2, with unit cell parameters a = 215.0 Å, b = 165.1 Å, c = 147.5 Å, and β = 117.3°. The structure was refined using the coordinates of the stigmatellin-inhibited enzyme as a model (Protein Data Bank code 1KB9) after excluding all nonprotein molecules (7Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Energy minimization and B-factor refinement were performed using the CNS program package (version 1.0) (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse K. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood function was used as the target for refinement. The model was improved based on F o – F c and 3F o – 2F c electron density maps, using the program O (version 8.0.4) (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Amino acid displacements were manually adjusted, followed by stepwise inclusion of the energy-minimized structure of the inhibitor HHDBT, UQ6, phospholipids, and UM and finally manually repositioning a displaced loop. Each step of model building was followed by a refinement cycle. Topology and parameter files were generated using the program Xplo2d and torsion data blocks prepared with the program Moleman2 (X-UTIL package; available on the World Wide Web at x-ray.bmc.uu.se/usf/) (26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The difference electron density map (F o – F c) indicated the presence of several additional phospholipids, manifested as elongated hairpin-like features. One phospholipid bound close to the Qo site was identified and refined in addition to the previously assigned phospholipids (7Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Finally, water molecules were included according to peaks observed in the F o – F c electron density map contoured at 3σ. Their positions were refined yielding 326 molecules of which 203 are the same as in the original model (1KB9), and their numbering was kept. New water molecules were numbered as starting from Wat500. Refinement resulted in final R factor and free R factor of 22.8 and 25.2%, respectively (Table I). Coordinates of the HHDBT-inhibited enzyme have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank data base (entry 1P84).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueSpace groupC2a,b,c [Å]215.0 165.1 147.5β (degrees)117.3No of nonhydrogen atoms in the modelAtoms18,069Amino acid residues2169Nonprotein molecules13Solvent molecules326Data collectionResolution range (outer shell) [Å]25.0-2.50 (2.56-2.50)Measured reflections372,220 (19,194)Unique reflections149,103 (9128)Completeness (%)92.4 (84.6)R merge (%)aR merge = ΣhΣi|Ii (h) - 〈I(h)〉|/Σh Σi I i(h), where Ii (h) is intensity of ith measurement, 〈I(h)〉 is average intensity of a reflection.6.6 (37.3)I/σ(I) < 113.4 (1.2)RefinementResolution range (outer shell) (Å)25.0-2.50 (2.52-2.50)R factor (%)bR factor = Σh∥F(h)obs| - |F(h)calc ∥/Σh|F(h)|.22.8 (41.0)R free (%)cR free calculated for 2.5% of reflections.25.2 (41.1)B wilson [Å2]dB wilson was calculated using TRUNCATE, CCP4 package (53).

Open table in a new tab For comparison, stigmatellin-inhibited bc 1 complex was crystallized at the same pH as the HHDBT-containing enzyme. The control data set was collected with 2.8-Å resolution, 93% completeness, and R sym of 5.8%. Refinement resulted in final R factor of 20.8% and R free of 24.5%. Lowering the pH by 0.5 units does not affect the structure of the catalytic subunits of the stigmatellin-inhibited enzyme, as judged by positional root mean square deviation (rmsd; Å) of superimposed atoms with LSQMAN yielding rmsdall/rmsdCα of 0.142/0.098, 0.175/0.118, and 0.204/0.133 for cytochrome b, cytochrome c 1, and the Rieske protein, respectively (Dejavuu package; available on the World Wide Web at x-ray.bmc.uu.se/usf/). Comparison between the HHDBT- and the stigmatellin-inhibited enzyme was therefore based on the recently published 2.3-Å resolution structure (1KB9) (6Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The structures were superimposed using the explicit least squares option in LSQMAN and inspected in the program O. By-residue analysis of root mean square deviation in Cα trace position and orientation was performed using the McLachlan algorithm as implemented in the program ProFit version 2.2 (available on the World Wide Web at bioinf.org.uk/software/profit). Analysis of neighboring atoms and hydrogen bond interactions was performed using the program HBPlus (27McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar) and contact analysis from CNS. Accessibility was estimated, and buried surface calculations were performed using the program NACCESS (28Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. Naccess, Version 2.1.1. Department of Biochemistry, University College, Londoncular Biology1993Google Scholar). PROCHECK (version 3.2) analysis verified the stereochemical quality of the coordinates (Table I) (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds were assigned according to appropriate distance and geometry. For analysis of weak hydrogen bonds, an estimation of hydrogen atom position was made by generating a structural model with hydrogens added using CNS (version 1.0). Criteria for identifying weak hydrogen bonds were extracted from Ref. 30Desiraju G.R. Steiner T. The Weak Hydrogen Bond. Oxford University Press, NY1999Google Scholar. Hydrogen bond angle is denoted as θ (X-H···A), and the bending angle at acceptor atom is shown as ϕ (H···A-C). Figures were prepared using the programs O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Crystallization of HHDBT-inhibited bc 1 Complex—The optimized purification of yeast bc 1 complex resulted in a pure and more active membrane protein complex with a higher turnover number of 82 s–1 compared with the previously reported activity of 64 s–1 (21Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Schagger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2003: 191-203Crossref Google Scholar). The increase is most likely due to higher phospholipid content of the modified protein preparation (Fig. 1) (35Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5715-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Schagger H. Hagen T. Roth B. Brandt U. Link T.A. von J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Effective inhibition of the complex has been shown for 5-n-alkyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazoles containing 7–15 carbon alkyl side chains (37Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the shorter heptyl side chain analog of UHDBT was used for crystallization in order to avoid nonspecific binding that might occur with the longer alkyl side chains at the high concentrations used. The inhibitory efficacy of UHDBT was shown to depend on the oxidation-reduction poise of the catalytic subunits, demonstrated by enhanced binding when the Rieske protein is reduced (37Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified bc 1 complex used in this study has a partially reduced Rieske and is fully inhibited by the applied amount of HHDBT (results not shown). A pK a of 6.5 has been determined for the weakly acidic hydroxy group of UHDBT, which was measured in phosphate buffer containing 1% ethanol, and deprotonation of the hydroxy group is manifested by a color change from yellow to rose-violet (38Trumpower B.L. Haggerty J.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, the complex was crystallized at pH 8.0 as a protein-detergent complex; therefore, the acidity of the hydroxy group was measured in detergent micelles by monitoring the blue shift in the optical spectrum upon ionization. The pK a determined by spectrophotometric titration in detergent micelles was 6.1 (results not shown). This suggests that 98% of the inhibitor is ionized in the crystallization mixture, demonstrated by the violet color of the solution and finally a purple tint of the crystals. A difference spectrum of bc 1 complex with bound inhibitor versus the complex alone shows that the inhibitor is ionized when bound to the enzyme, when the pH of the buffer is close to the pK a of the unbound inhibitor (Fig. 2). The difference spectrum of the complex at pH 6.0 with inhibitor bound at a substoichiometric amount is similar to that of the inhibitor alone at pH 8.7. As inhibitor is added in molar excess, the mixture consists of bound and unbound inhibitor, and the absorbance maximum shifts to longer wavelengths. Analysis of HHDBT Binding at the Q o Site—The difference electron density map (F o – F c) calculated prior to inclusion of HHDBT clearly showed the localization of the bound inhibitor at the Qo site (Figs. 1 and 3). The clear cut and asymmetric form of the difference density for the head moiety allowed unambiguous orientation of the hydroxydioxobenzothiazole ring. Furthermore, the position of the alkyl side chain was defined in the full length. The inhibitor binds in the distal domain of the Qo site, located between the two electron acceptors of ubiquinol oxidation, namely heme b L and the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Rieske protein. The catalytic domain of the latter is docked onto cytochrome b (i.e. in the b-position). The hydroxydioxobenzothiazole head group is stabilized by a network of weak and strong hydrogen bonds and numerous van der Waals interactions with neighboring residues (Table II). Importantly, the oxygen atom of the ionized 6-hydroxy group (O6) is in close con"

In this work, we report that the volutin granules of Agrobacterium tumefaciens possess properties similar to the acidocalcisomes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that each intracellular granule was surrounded by a membrane. X-ray microanalysis of the volutin granules showed large amounts of phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Calcium in the volutin granules increased when the bacteria were incubated at high extracellular calcium concentration. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, using antisera raised against peptide sequences conserved in the A. tumefaciens proton pyrophosphatase, indicated localization in intracellular vacuoles. Purification of the volutin granules using iodixanol density gradients indicated a preferential localization of the pyrophosphatase activity in addition to high concentrations of phosphate, pyrophosphate, short- and long-chain polyphosphate, but lack of markers of the plasma membrane. The pyrophosphatase activity was potassium-insensitive and inhibited by the pyrophosphate analogs, amynomethylenediphosphonate and imidodiphosphate, by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and by the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide. Polyphosphate was also localized to the volutin granules by 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole staining. The organelles were acidic, as demonstrated by staining with LysoSensor blue DND-167, a dye especially used to detect very acidic compartments in cells, and cycloprodigiosin, a compound isolated from a marine bacterium that has been shown to uncouple proton pyrophosphatase activity acting as a chloride/proton symport. The results suggest that acidocalcisomes arose before the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages diverged.

Intracellular membranous structures have been reported in several bacterial species (1Shively J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1974; 28: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Simon R.D.

One group is formed by the abundant membrane-bound vesicles of photosynthetically grown cells of several purple bacteria, such as Rodospirillum rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas spheroides (4Cohen-Bazire G. Gest H. San Pietro A. Vernon L.P. Bacterial Photosynthesis. The Antioch Press, Yellow Spring, OH1963: 89-110Google Scholar). These vesicles are usually designated as chromatophore membranes because of their similarity to particulate fractions known as chromatophores that could perform photophosphorylation in vitro, and that are obtained after sonication of these bacteria (4Cohen-Bazire G. Gest H. San Pietro A. Vernon L.P. Bacterial Photosynthesis. The Antioch Press, Yellow Spring, OH1963: 89-110Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria possess sac-like membranes (thylakoids) with the same function (5Jensen T.E. Berner T. Ultrastructure of Microalgae. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 7-50Google Scholar). Another group of intracellular membranous structures is formed by a number of inclusions, such as the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-containing granules of several bacteria, the sulfur globules of the Thiorhodaceae, the gas vacuoles of aquatic bacteria, the chlorophyll-containing Chlorobium vesicles, the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase-rich carboxysomes of cyanobacteria, nitrifying bacteria, thiobacilli, and the related polyhedral bodies or enterosomes of Salmonella enterica (1Shively J.M.

These are not considered to be equivalent to the organelles found in the eukaryotes (2Simon R.D. Fay P. Van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria. Elsevier Science Publishers, Biomedical Division, Amsterdam1987: 199-225Google Scholar). They usually consist, with the exception of carboxysomes and perhaps enterosomes, of a material lacking enzymatic function. They are surrounded by a non-unit membrane apparently composed entirely of protein (1Shively J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1974; 28: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Simon R.D. Fay P. Van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria. Elsevier Science Publishers, Biomedical Division, Amsterdam1987: 199-225Google Scholar). Other, more recently described intracytoplasmic membranes found in Planctomycetales are the pirellulosome, which surrounds the cell DNA in Pirellula species, and the anammoxosome of Candidatus species (6Lindsay M.R. Webb R.I. Strous M. Jetten M.S.M. Butler M.K. Forde R.J. Fuerst J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The anammoxosome is a dedicated intracytoplasmic compartment where the anammox process (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) takes place (6Lindsay M.R. Webb R.I. Strous M. Jetten M.S.M. Butler M.K.

All of these membranous structures are different from the mesosomes described initially in Gram-positive bacteria and that were shown to arise as a fixation artifact (8Dubochet J. McDowall A.W. Menge B. Schmid E.N. Lickfeld K.G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 381-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to all of these membrane-bound compartments, a number of apparently non-membrane bound inclusions are also present in several bacterial species, such as the multi-l-arginyl-poly(l-aspartic acid)-containing cyanophycin granules of cyanobacteria, the polyglucoside granules containing polymers of glucose, and the volutin granules (1Shively J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1974; 28: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Simon R.D. Fay P. Van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria.

Volutin or metachromatic granules were the first subcellular entities to be recognized in bacteria (9Meyer A. Bot. Zeit. 1904; 62: 113-152Google Scholar). Their metachromatic nature is attributable to the reaction of the polyphosphate (polyP) 1The abbreviations used are: polyP, polyphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate, H+-PPase, proton pyrophosphatase; LB, Luria Bertani; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; AMDP, aminomethylenediphosphonate. present in the granules with certain basic dyes, such as toluidine blue, which induces a characteristic shift in their absorption spectrum to a higher wavelength (10Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). They have been described as devoid of internal structure or limiting membrane (11Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have also been found in unicellular eukaryotes (12Wiame J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1947; 1: 234-255Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Hase E. Miyachi S. Mihara S. Plant Cell Physiol. (Tokyo). 1963; 4: 619-626Google Scholar, 14Rosenberg H. Exp.

Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a number of human pathogens, including malaria parasites, Toxoplasma gondii, and trypanosomatids (19Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), were found to be surrounded by a membrane with a number of pumps and exchangers and were named acidocalcisomes. Acidocalcisomes are characterized by their acidic nature, their high electron density, and their high concentration of calcium, magnesium, and other elements in addition to pyrophosphate (PPi) and polyP. It has been postulated that acidocalcisomes may have important roles as energy stores and in intracellular pH, calcium, and osmotic regulation (19Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because volutin granules in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes are morphologically similar, we investigated whether the bacterial volutin granules are also surrounded by a membrane and have similar characteristics to the acidocalcisomes. We chose for our initial studies the α-protobacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is known to possess a H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) (20Goodner B. Hinkle G. Gattung S. Miller N. Blanchard M. Qurollo B. Goldman B.S. Cao Y. Askenazi M. Halling C. Mullin L. Houmiel K. Gordon J. Vaudin N. Iartchouk O. Epp A. Liu F. Wollam C. Allinger M. Doughty D. Scott C. Lappas C. Markelz B.

Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation and biochemical properties of volutin granules of A. tumefaciens and demonstrate that, as the acidocalcisomes, they are surrounded by a membrane, acidic because of the presence of the H+-PPase in their membrane, rich in PPi and polyP, and able to accumulate calcium and other elements. Acidocalcisomes are therefore the first organelles described in prokaryotes that are also present in eukaryotes. Cell Cultures—A. tumefaciens (strain C58) was provided by Stephen K. Farrand (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Cells were grown in liquid Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 28 °C with agitation. Cells were cultured overnight and harvested at the stationary phase. Isolation of Volutin Granules—Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and incubated with a solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% N-lauroyl-sarcosine, to disrupt the bacterial capsule, for 20 min at room temperature. Bacteria were then centrifuged at 3,900 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (125 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm K-Hepes, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and 10 μm Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pH 7.2) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 30 min. Benzonase® (Novagen) (1 μl/ml) was added, and bacteria were passed through a French press (SLM-Amico, Spectrometric Instruments) two times at 1,000 psi. The lysate was incubated on ice under agitation for 1 h with an equal volume of 0.5× silica (silicon dioxide) and 0.5× silicon carbide solution to remove fragments of DNA and RNA. The lysate was then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and washed two times under the same conditions. The supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer with the aid of a 22-gauge needle. The suspension was diluted 1:1 in OptiPrep (60% iodixanol) and applied as the 30% step of a discontinuous gradient of OptiPrep, with 4-ml steps of 24, 28, 30, 35, and 40% iodixanol, diluted in lysis buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 60 min. The volutin granule fraction pelleted at the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. Gradient fractions and markers were assayed as described previously (21Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analytical Methods and Immunoblotting—Bacteria were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and PPi, and long-chain and short-chain polyPs were extracted as described before (22Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphatase activity was assayed by measuring released phosphate using the EnzChek phosphate assay as described before (21Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The apparent K m for PPi was calculated by using a computerized nonlinear regression program (Sigma Plot 1.0, Jandel Scientific) using the Hill equation. Protein determination was done with the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, using 10% gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus by standard techniques. Subsequent processing steps were done in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk, washed three times, and incubated with polyclonal antibody against Trypanosoma cruzi H+-PPase (24Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed three times, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000), washed three times, and processed for chemiluminescence detection as per the manufacturer's (Amersham Biosciences) instructions. Molecular weights were calculated using prestained molecular weight markers. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For subcellular localization of H+-PPase, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed in 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and 50 min at 4 °C, attached to poly l-lysine-treated glass slides, and permeabilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 5 min. Samples were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% cold fish gelatin, and 50 mm NH4Cl and first incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the polyclonal antibody against the T. cruzi H+-PPase (24Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) diluted 1: 20 in 1% cold fish gelatin. Bacteria were subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS plus 1% cold fish gelatin. Coverslips were mounted in glass slides with Vectashield® media and sealed. Images were collected with an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope or an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. For polyP localization, bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in the same buffer and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde. 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with the fluorescence microscope. For localization of LysoSensor blue DND-167 (9,10-bis(N-morpholinomethyl)anthracene), bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in prewarmed (28 °C) LB medium containing 1 μm LysoSensor. Bacteria were incubated for 1 h at 28 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh prewarmed LB medium. Bacteria were mounted on a slide and observed with the fluorescence microscope using UV excitation. For cycloprodigiosin detection, bacteria were centrifuged, resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS containing 100 nm cycloprodigiosin, and incubated for 30 min. Bacteria were mounted on a slide and observed with the fluorescence microscope using a red emission filter. Bacteria resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS or LB medium, but without cycloprodigiosin or LysoSensor, respectively, were used as controls. Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis—For routine electron microscopy, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed for 1 h with 2.5% grade II glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 0.03% CaCl2, and 0.03% picric acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Bacteria were post-fixed with OsO4 for 45 min and then for 15 min with potassium ferricyanide, washed, and treated with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min. Subsequently, samples were dehydrated by successive incubations of 6 min with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) at room temperature. Epoxy embedding was carried out by resuspending the sample once in 1:1 ethanol/acetonitrile, twice in 100% acetonitrile, and then 30 min in 1:1 epoxy/acetonitrile, 1.5 h in 3:1 epoxy/acetonitrile, and 4 h in 100% epoxy. Embedded samples were polymerized for 20 h at 85 °C. Epoxy blocks were ultrathin-sectioned, sections were deposited on 300-mesh copper grids, and grids were stained with uranyl acetate for 30 min and triple lead stain (lead citrate, lead nitrate, and lead acetate) for 1 min. For immunocytochemistry, bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS, fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in a solution containing 0.5% grade I glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, and 1% picric acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Fixed bacteria were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and dehydrated by successive incubations of 6 min with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 25, 50, 75, 95, 100, and 100%) at –20 °C. Samples were embedded in Unicryl at 4 °C by incubation with 1:1 ethanol/Unicryl for 1 h and 100% Unicryl for 1, 16, and 8 h. Embedded samples were polymerized under UV irradiation at –20 °C for 48 h. Thin sections were collected on 300-mesh nickel grids and blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.5% cold fish gelatin (PBS-TW-FG). Grids were incubated for 3 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody against T. cruzi H+-PPase (24Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) diluted 1:10 in PBS-TW-FG. After washing in PBS-TW-FG, grids were incubated for 1 h with a 5-nm gold-conjugate goat anti-mouse antibody. Subsequently, grids were washed with PBS, then in distilled water, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Routine and immunocytochemistry samples were observed in a Hitachi H 600 electron microscope. For imaging whole bacteria and electron-dense vacuole fractions, the preparations were washed in 0.25 m sucrose, and a 5-μl sample was placed on a Formvar-coated, 200-mesh copper grid, allowed to adhere for 10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly with a Hitachi H 600 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV (18Marchesini N. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis was done at the Electron Microscopy Center (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL). Specimen grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Fine probe sizes were adjusted to cover the electron-dense vacuoles (or a similar area of the background), and x-rays were collected for 100 s by using a thin-window (Norvar) detector. Analysis was performed by using a Noran Voyager III analyzer with a standardless analysis identification program. Volutin granules are recognized by their high electron density when the cells are observed by transmission electron microscopy without fixation and staining (5Jensen T.E. Berner T. Ultrastructure of Microalgae. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 7-50Google Scholar). A. tumefaciens typically shows a large granule toward one of the cellular poles (Fig. 1A, arrows) and additional smaller granules in different regions of the cells (Fig. 1A, arrowheads). The large granules have a diameter of about 210 ± 18 nm. X-ray microanalysis was performed on these granules (Fig. 1B). The spectrum shown was the one that yielded the most counts in 100 s (of 10 spectra obtained from granules of different bacteria), but all other spectra taken from volutin granules were qualitatively similar; counts for phosphorus were about 4-fold greater than counts for magnesium, which were about the same as counts for potassium. Counts for calcium were much lower. Counts for oxygen and phosphorus were about the same. Peaks for phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and calcium were not present in spectra taken from the background (Fig. 1C). Peaks for copper, and in part for carbon and oxygen, arise from the grid. Examination of cells in thin sections showed a round vacuole of about 210 nm in one of the poles of the cell, corresponding to the location of the large granules in Fig. 1A. An electron-dense inclusion partially (Fig. 1, D and E, arrows) or completely (Fig. 1E, arrowhead) occupied its interior. Each intracellular granule appeared to be surrounded by a membrane (Fig. 1, E and F, arrow and arrowhead, respectively). The determination of the membrane was made difficult because of the so-called “phase” or “out of focus” effect often accompanying electron-dense particles of bacteria visualized by transmission electron microscopy (25Glasauer S. Langley S. Beveridge T.J. Science. 2002; 295: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A better identification of the surrounding membrane was achieved with isolated volutin granules. As has been observed in acidocalcisomes of unicellular eukaryotes (19Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a ring of electron-dense material was observed below the membrane of the isolated volutin granules (Fig. 1, G and H). To purify the volutin granules and investigate their chemical and enzymatic content, we adapted the purification procedure used for the isolation of acidocalcisomes from T. cruzi (21Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The utility of the method was assessed by assaying marker enzymes (Fig. 2). The yield of pyrophosphatase activity (a marker of acidocalcisomes) in the volutin granule fraction (fraction 12) was 80% (Fig. 2A), whereas the yield of protein in the same fraction was only 3% (Fig. 2H), a 27-fold purification. Plasma membrane (marked by succinate cytochrome c reductase) was not enriched in this fraction (Fig. 2B). The volutin granule fraction (fraction 12) contained around 20% of the total amount of PPi (Fig. 2D) and short chain polyP (Fig. 2E), and >35% of the total amount of Pi (Fig. 2C) and long chain polyP (Fig. 2F). Levels of PPi of 274 ± 77 nmol/mg protein and of polyP of 315 ± 79 and 217 ± 19 nmol/mg protein (in terms of Pi residues) in chains of <50 residues long and in chains of about 700–800 residues long, respectively, were found in total extracts of A. tumefaciens. Electron microscopy of the volutin granule fraction (fraction 12), by observation of air dried samples (Fig. 3A), showed the presence of granules with the same appearance as the granules observed in preparations of whole cells (Fig. 1A). When submitted to the electron beam, changes in their internal structure led to the appearance of a sponge-like structure, which has been described before in acidocalcisomes of T. cruzi (26Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), T. brucei (27Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell.

The results of x-ray microanalysis of the isolated granules were similar to those of whole cells, except that proportionally less potassium and calcium were detected (Fig. 3B), probably because of ionic changes occurring during the fractionation procedure. This phenomenon has also been described after isolation of acidocalcisomes of unicellular eukaryotes (17Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol.

Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we used fluorescence microscopy and x-ray microanalysis methods to detect their ability to accumulate H+ and calcium and their polyP content. Fig. 3D shows that incubation of whole bacteria with LysoSensor Blue DND-167, a dye especially used to detect very acidic compartments in cells (28Lin H.-J. Herman P. Kang J.S. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), stained granules located at one pole of the cells (arrowheads), at the same position where the large volutin granules were located by direct transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1A). Cycloprodigiosin is a compound isolated from a marine bacterium that has been shown to uncouple H+-PPase activity acting as a chloride/proton symport (29Maeshima M. Nakayasu T. Kawauchi K. Hirata H. Shimmen T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 439-442Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that has been shown to stain acidocalcisomes of T. cruzi (21Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 3E (arrowheads) shows that cycloprodigiosin-stained granules located at the same position as those stained by LysoSensor (Fig. 3D, arrowheads). DAPI has been shown to shift its maximum emission fluorescence from 426 to 525 nm in the presence of polyP, this change being specific for polyP and not produced by PPi or other anions (22Ruiz F.A.

https://openalex.org/W2087747384,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling and defense molecule in biological systems. The bactericidal effects of NO produced, for example, by macrophages are resisted by various bacterial NO-detoxifying enzymes, the best understood being the flavohemoglobins exemplified by Escherichia coli Hmp. However, many bacteria, including E. coli, are reported to produce NO by processes that are independent of denitrification in which NO is an obligatory intermediate. We demonstrate using an NO-specific electrode that E. coli cells, grown anaerobically with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, generate significant NO on adding nitrite. The periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase (Nrf) is shown, by comparing Nrf+ and Nrf– mutants, to be largely responsible for NO generation. Surprisingly, an hmp mutant did not accumulate more NO but, rather, failed to produce detectable NO. Anaerobic growth of the hmp mutant was not stimulated by nitrate, and the mutant failed to produce periplasmic cytochrome(s) c, leading to the hypothesis that accumulating NO in the absence of Hmp inactivates the global anaerobic regulator Fnr by reaction with the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (Cruz-Ramos, H., Crack, J., Wu, G., Hughes, M. N., Scott, C., Thomson, A. J., Green, J., and Poole, R. K. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 3235–3244). Fnr thus failed to up-regulate nitrite reductase. The model is supported by the inability of an fnr mutant to generate NO and by the restoration of NO accumulation to hmp mutants upon introducing a plasmid encoding Fnr* (D154A) known to confer activity in the presence of oxygen. A cytochrome bd-deficient mutant retained NO-generating activity. The present study reveals a critical balance between NO-generating and -detoxifying activities during anaerobic growth.

Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide, NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; carboxy-PTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; DAN, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Nrf, periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase; Nir, cytoplasmic siroheme-dependent nitrite reductase; NNR, nitrite and nitric-oxide reductase regulator. is a molecule of major importance in biological systems where it plays signaling, vasodilatory, and cytotoxic roles. Recent attention has focused on NO synthesis from the sequential oxidation of l-arginine by NO synthases in eukaryotic cells (1Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), their mitochondria (2Elfering S.L. Sarkela T.M. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38079-38086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and certain bacteria (3Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NO is also an obligate intermediate in denitrification, the process by which certain bacteria sequentially reduce nitrate ion to dinitrogen (4Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 253-264Crossref Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 5Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 456-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, several representatives of the “non-denitrifying” Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, grown anaerobically with nitrate, were shown to produce up to one-twentieth of the NO produced by denitrifiers. NO production from nitrite, measured by the nitrosation of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) (6Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed to involve enzymatic reduction of nitrite to NO followed by oxygen-dependent DAN nitrosation. NO production has also been shown in Serratia marcescens (7Anderson I.C. Levine J.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 51: 938-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bacillus cereus (8Kalkowski I. Conrad R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 82: 107-112Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), three species of methanotrophic bacteria (9Ren T. Roy R. Knowles R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3891-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the green micro alga Scenedesmus obliquus (10Mallick N. Mohn F.H. Soeder C.J. J. Plant. Physiol. 2000; 157: 40-46Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ji and Hollocher (11Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Arch. 1989; 5: 61-66Google Scholar) concluded that nitrite-dependent NO production by E. coli was due to the activity of the membrane-associated (dissimilatory) nitrate reductase. Nitrate reductase exhibited at all stages of its purification a nitrite reductase activity, which was strongly inhibited by nitrate and azide. More recent evidence for NO production by E. coli has come from expression of the Paracoccus denitrificans transcription factor NNR in E. coli. This protein is activated by NO, and transcription of a target melR-lacZ promoter in E. coli was attributed to formation of NO (or related species) from nitrate by molybdenum-dependent nitrite reductase (12Hutchings M.I. Shearer N. Wastell S. van Spanning R.J.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6434-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). NO production from nitrite, however, was not dependent on molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Since the initial reports of NO production by E. coli (6Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), advances have been made that prompt a reinvestigation. First, sensitive NO electrodes with markedly improved selectivity have been developed (14Zhang X. Broderick M. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 160-165Google Scholar). Second, several proteins have functions firmly linked to the stresses imposed by NO and nitrosation (15Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 16Gardner P.R. Martin L.A. Hall D. Gardner A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23664-23669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yet the potential physiological stresses imposed by endogenously generated NO have not been assessed. The best understood is the flavohemoglobin, Hmp, of E. coli, encoded by a gene that is inducible under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by nitrate, but especially nitrite and NO (18Poole R.K.

NO consumption by Hmp aerobically generates nitrate (19Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Third, certain bacteria (e.g. Nocardia (24Chen Y.J. Rosazza J.P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5122-5128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have been shown to possess nitric-oxide synthases similar to those reported in certain plants (25Huang X. Kiefer E. von Rad U. Ernst D. Foissner I. Durner J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 40: 625-631Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and mammalian systems, suggesting a role for NO in bacterial physiology. These findings suggest an interplay between NO-producing and NO-consuming activities of physiological relevance in non-denitrifying bacteria. In this report, we provide direct and sensitive measurements of NO production by E. coli cells from nitrite and explore the roles of Hmp and of cytochrome bd (previously shown to react with and reduce nitrate (26Hubbard J.A.M. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Hubbard J.A.M. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Poole R.K. Dow C.S.

We demonstrate the involvement of the nrfA-encoded cytochrome c nitrite reductase in generating NO and the lack of NO generation in mutants lacking the flavohemoglobin Hmp, the narG-encoded nitrate reductase, or the global regulator Fnr.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), supplemented as appropriate with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) or ampicillin (200 μg/ml). KNO3 was added as a filter-sterilized solution to LB at a final concentration of 40 or 100 mm, as indicated. Aerobic cultures were grown with shaking (200 rpm) in side-arm flasks containing 1/20th of their own volume of medium. Anaerobic cultures (for NO evolution experiments) were grown in screw-cap glass tubes filled to the brim and containing a glass bead (∼1-mm diameter) to aid resuspension of cells that had sedimented during static culture. Anaerobic cultures (for cytochrome c 552 assays) were grown in 500-ml Duran bottles, filled to the brim (total volume 620 ml), for 24 h to stationary phase of growth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, then suspended in PBS to a final volume of 1.0 ml. Strains JCB352 and JCB387 were washed and resuspended in LB. A Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter (Klett Manufacturing Co., New York, NY) equipped with a no. 66 (red) filter was used to monitor turbidity of cultures grown in screw-cap glass tubes or side-arm flasks. Culture optical density at 420 nm (A 420) was measured using a Jenway 6100 spectrophotometer in cells of 1-cm pathlength. Preparation of Periplasmic and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Periplasmic and cytoplasmic extracts were made using a modified version of earlier protocols (33Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Pittman M.S. Corker H. Wu G. Binet M.B. Moir A.J.G. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49841-49849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Aerobic cultures (200 ml in a 1-liter conical flask, 200 rpm) were grown to an A 420 of 0.5–0.6 (∼4 h after inoculation) and then conditioned for osmotic shock by the addition of NaCl and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.3) to a final concentration of 30 mm each. Cells from 400 ml of culture were resuspended in 6 ml of a buffer containing (final concentrations) 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 20% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 mm sodium EDTA. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, cells were collected by centrifugation at room temperature and then rapidly resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold water. After mixing for 45 s on ice, Mg2+ was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the suspension was mixed on ice for 45 s, then left on ice for a further 10 min. This suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant fraction (periplasm) was stored on ice prior to use. The remaining pellet was resuspended in a buffer that contained (final concentrations) 20% sucrose, 1 mm sodium EDTA, and 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Sonication (5 × 15-s bursts with 30-s intervals) was followed by high speed centrifugation (1.57 × 105 g for 70 min), yielding a cytoplasmic fraction, which was also stored on ice. Purified Hmp was obtained as described before (21Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Søballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Enzyme and Protein Assays—Assays of β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities were used to determine the purity of periplasmic and cytoplasmic samples produced. Assays were carried out at ambient room temperature, ∼20 °C. β-Galactosidase (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase (35Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 36Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) activities were measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl phosphate, respectively, and measuring A 420. β-Galactosidase activities are expressed in Miller units (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activities are expressed as (ΔA 420 × 1000)/min/ml of sample. The protein content of all samples was measured using the protocol of Markwell et al. (37Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Analyt. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Each sample was assayed a minimum of six times. Nitrite Reductase Assay (Cytochrome c 552 )—Cytochrome c 552 concentrations in periplasmic and cytoplasmic bacterial extracts were determined spectroscopically (38Pope N.R. Cole J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1279-1284PubMed Google Scholar) except that an SDB-4 dual-wavelength scanning spectrophotometer was used (University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Instrumentation Group, and Current Designs Inc., Philadelphia, PA) (39Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). Dithionite-reduced minus persulfate-oxidized difference spectra were computed. Spectral data were analyzed and plotted using Soft SDB (Current Designs Inc.) and CA-Cricket Graph III software. The absorbance coefficient (ϵ422–410) for cytochrome c 552 (reduced minus oxidized) was taken to be 61.4 mm–1 cm–1, deduced from the data of Fujita (40Fujita T. J. Biochem. 1966; 60: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NO Evolution and O 2 Measurements—Concentrations of dissolved oxygen and NO were measured in a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode system (Rank Bros., Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) modified to accommodate a World Precision Instruments ISO NOP sensor (2-mm diameter) (21Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Søballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell suspension was diluted in the chamber with PBS buffer. Sodium formate was added, giving a working volume of 2.0 ml. A close-fitting lid, with a fine hole for injections using a Hamilton syringe, was inserted. After oxygen had reached undetectable levels, the suspension was further supplemented with NaNO2 (final concentrations stated in text) and NO evolution was measured. The O2 electrode was calibrated using air-equilibrated PBS and the addition of sodium dithionite (a few grains) to achieve anoxia. The NO electrode was calibrated using S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine as described by the manufacturer. Additions of anoxic, NO-saturated solutions, NaNO2 and 10 mm carboxy-PTIO were made using Hamilton syringes. NO was generated exactly as in Poole et al. (18Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernández J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A stock solution of 0.5 m NaNO2 was freshly made each day. A suba-seal (VWR International) was added to the mouth of the bottle, making an airtight seal. Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution for 20–30 min, making it anoxic. Carboxy-PTIO was purchased from Calbiochem. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of a 10 mm aqueous solution were stored at –20 °C for up to 1 month. Evolution of NO from Wild-type E. coli—To measure N2O and NO, Ji and Hollocher (6Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of headspace gases. In the present work, NO evolution and O2 consumption were measured in solution using specific electrodes (21Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Søballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Addition of formate to cells harvested from anaerobic, nitrate-supplemented cultures resulted in rapid O2 consumption in the closed reaction vessel. After reaching anoxia (Fig. 1A), the O2 concentration remained undetectable for the duration of the experiment. The NO electrode traces in Fig. 1B show that wild-type E. coli strain AN2342 produced NO, and that the amount of NO produced increased with the concentration of NaNO2 added (Fig. 1C). Thus, 2.5 mmNO2- generated 10 nmol of NO/mg of protein and 5 mmNO2- elicited 31 nmol NO/mg of protein. Even at high NO2- concentrations (25 mm), NO evolution did not exceed 44 nmol of NO/mg of protein. To verify the selectivity of the electrode response, we used the imidazolineoxyl N-oxide, carboxy-PTIO, a stable radical compound that reacts stoichiometrically with NO to form either nitrate or nitrite and imidazolineoxyls in neutral solution (41Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Addition of carboxy-PTIO to the electrode chamber rapidly decreased the electrode response in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), confirming that cells were producing NO. However, higher concentrations of carboxy-PTIO were required for diminution of the NO signal than would have been anticipated from the equistoichiometric reaction of carboxy-PTIO and the NO concentration determined by calibration of the electrode (see, for example, trace a, Fig. 1B). This might be due to loss of carboxy-PTIO owing to the lipophilicity and incorporation into bacterial membranes. Addition to the reaction chamber of deoxymyoglobin also quenched the NO signal (not shown). Cells cultured aerobically in the presence or absence of 100 mm KNO3 failed to produce NO (results not shown). Evolution of NO from Nitrite Reductase Mutants—Previous work on NO evolution by E. coli has suggested that a nitrate reductase is responsible for the production of NO. Ji and Hollocher (6Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Arch. 1989; 5: 61-66Google Scholar, 13Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) concluded that NO production by E. coli is due to the reduction of nitrite to NO as a secondary activity of the membrane-bound respiratory nitrate reductase. Nitrosation reactions have also been genetically and biochemically linked to nitrate reductase genes (42Calmels S. Ohshima H. Rosenkranz H. McCoy E. Bartsch H. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Calmels S. Ohshima H. Bartsch H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 221-226PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ralt D. Wishnok J.S.

Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) correlated nitrous oxide production with nitrate reductase activity in E. coli. However, Hutchings et al. (12Hutchings M.I. Shearer N. Wastell S. van Spanning R.J.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6434-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that the nitrate reductases of E. coli (all of which are molybdoenzymes) are not directly responsible for NO production from nitrite. Activation of NNR (an NO-responsive transcription factor of P. denitrificans) was abolished in an E. coli mobAB::Km mutant, defective in Mo cofactor biosynthesis, when nitrate, but not nitrite, was provided. The ability of certain nitrite reductases to reduce nitrite to NO (3Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) makes them strong candidates for the NO evolution observed here and by Hutchings et al. (12Hutchings M.I. Shearer N. Wastell S. van Spanning R.J.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6434-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), particularly because E. coli lacks NO synthase. E. coli possesses two nitrite reductases, namely a periplasmic cytochrome c enzyme (Nrf) that generates predominantly ammonium ion, and a cytoplasmic siroheme-dependent reductase (Nir) (46Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Richardson D. Cole J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 45: 51-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the NO evolution capacity of nir, nir nrf, and wild-type strains. Both the nir mutant JCB387 and the wild-type AN2342 produced NO, and use of carboxy-PTIO confirmed the presence of NO in both cases (Fig. 2A). The level of NO accumulated by the nir mutant (6.6 nmol/mg of cell protein, mean of two measurements) was approximately a third of that produced (17 nmol/mg of protein) by the wild-type strain. However, the nir nrf double mutant produced no detectable NO (Fig. 2A). The nrfA gene, implicated in NO production by this result, encodes a 52-kDa periplasmic pentaheme cytochrome c 552, which acts as a nitrite reductase in association with the NrfB cytochrome c as redox partner. Therefore, we tested for the presence of cytochrome c in periplasmic and cytoplasmic extracts of the above strains. Dithionite reduced minus persulfate-oxidized spectra (Fig. 2B) revealed the presence of cytochrome c 552 with a γ-peak at 422 nm in both the wild-type strain AN2342 and the nir mutant JCB387 (0.10 and 0.11 nmol of cytochrome c 552 per mg of protein, respectively). Weaker signals at 552 nm are due to the α-band but were not used for quantification. The NrfA protein has absorbance maxima in the reduced state (absolute spectrum) at 420.5 (γ), 523.5 (β), and 552 nm (α) (48Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Purified NrfB protein, in its reduced state, has a sharp absorbance peak at 551 nm. Unlike NrfA, however, NrfB has no charge transfer band at ∼630 nm. 2D. Richardson, personal communication. However, cytochrome c 552 was undetectable in the nir nrf double mutant. As expected, cytoplasmic fractions (not shown) from all three strains showed no detectable levels of cytochrome c 552 but the presence of b-type cytochrome(s) (not shown). Effects of an hmp Mutation on NO Production—Hmp plays a key role in protecting cells against nitrosative stress by catalysis of either the oxygen-dependent formation of nitrate ion or the anaerobic reduction of NO to nitrous oxide (15Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an hmp mutant would produce significantly higher levels of NO compared with an isogenic wild-type strain, due to an inability to detoxify any NO formed. However, the results obtained were quite the opposite, as shown in Fig. 2C. The wild-type strain VJS676 produced NO (35 nmol of NO/mg of protein) at levels higher than wild-type strain AN2342 (23 nmol of NO/mg of protein; both means of two values). The hmp mutant strain RKP4545 produced no detectable NO, regardless of growth conditions (0–100 mmNO3- in the medium) and the concentration of NaNO2 (in the range 2.5–25 mm) added to the electrode chamber. Given the demonstration (Fig. 2B) that nrf mutants lacking periplasmic cytochrome c 552 were unable to generate NO from nitrite, we assayed cytochrome c 552 in periplasmic and cytoplasmic extracts of wild-type and hmp mutant strains. Dithionite reduced minus persulfate-oxidized spectra (Fig. 2D) revealed the presence of cytochrome c 552 with peaks at 422 and 552 nm in the periplasm of the wild-type strain AN2342 (0.15 nmol of cytochrome c 552 per mg of protein). The somewhat higher levels of cytochrome c in this strain correlate with higher levels of NO evolution (see above). However, cytochrome c 552 was undetectable in the α-region of reduced minus oxidized spectra of the periplasm of the hmp mutant strain RKP4545, but a weak γ-spectral signal at 422 nm was observed. As expected, cytoplasmic fractions (not shown) from both strains showed no detectable levels of cytochrome c 552, but one or more b-type cytochromes were present. An Hmp-overproducing strain (RKP4717) also produced NO under these experimental conditions, but quadruplicate assays failed to show any significant differences from wild-type levels. One explanation of the failure of an hmp mutant to generate NO might be that the flavohemoglobin Hmp itself is able to reduce nitrite ion to NO; indeed, Hmp possesses a broad spectrum of reductase activities (49Wu G. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, purified Hmp protein was unable to produce NO anoxically from nitrite. Briefly, 730 ng of purified Hmp protein was added to the electrode chamber, with 1.5 ml of PBS (pH 7.0). Oxygen levels were reduced to zero following addition of NADH, then 25 mmNO2- was added. In duplicate experiments, no NO evolution was observed (not shown). Effects of an fnr Mutation on NO Production—The absence of NrfA or NrfB cytochromes in the hmp mutant prompted study of the link between Hmp, NO metabolism, and nitrite reductase. Recently we have demonstrated that the O2-responsive regulator Fnr, which represses hmp gene transcription, also senses NO (23Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of Fnr reacts anaerobically with, and is inactivated by, NO. Active Fnr is a positive activator of the nrf operon, nirB, narG, and other genes involved in anaerobic nitrite and nitrate dissimilation (46Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.

https://openalex.org/W2064293764,"H-Ras and N-Ras become activated both at the plasma membrane and in endomembrane structures such as the Golgi apparatus. This compartmentalized activation is relevant from a signaling standpoint, because effector molecules can become activated differently depending on the region of the cell where Ras proteins are activated. An unsolved question in this new regulatory mechanism is the understanding of how Ras proteins become activated in endomembranes. To approach this problem, we have studied the subcellular distribution and activities of a number of Ras guanosine nucleotide exchange factors. Our results indicate that Ras activation at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum is an unspecific process that can be achieved by most Ras activators. In contrast, GTP loading of Ras at the Golgi is only induced by members of the Ras guanosine nucleotide releasing protein family. In agreement with these observations, Ras guanosine nucleotide releasing proteins are the only Ras activators showing localization in the Golgi. These results indicate that the compartmentalized activation of effector pathways by Ras proteins depends not only on the specific localization of the GTPases but also in the availability of GDP/GTP exchange factors capable of activating Ras proteins in specific subcellular compartments. H-Ras and N-Ras become activated both at the plasma membrane and in endomembrane structures such as the Golgi apparatus.

These results indicate that the compartmentalized activation of effector pathways by Ras proteins depends not only on the specific localization of the GTPases but also in the availability of GDP/GTP exchange factors capable of activating Ras proteins in specific subcellular compartments. The Ras GTPase subfamily is composed of four highly related members (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-RasA, and K-RasB) that play key roles in mitogenic and differentiation decisions of most cell types (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar, 2Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite this apparent simplicity in the number of family members and molecular structures, the signaling properties of these GTPases are highly complex (2Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a feature that has helped its involvement in a plethora of different biological responses. One point of complexity is their ability to engage several signal transduction pathways at the same time, such as the Raf/Erk cascade, the Ral GDP dissociation stimulator pathway, or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt route (2Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (1131): 1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because of this, a single Ras molecule can promote the stimulation of disparate biological effects such as proliferation, cytoskeletal change, or cell survival. This property may also confer some signaling specificity to the different Ras subfamily members, a point that is well exemplified by the lack of functional redundancy between K-ras and H-/N-ras genes demonstrated by recent knockout experiments (4Esteban L.M. Vicario-Abejon C. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fernandez-Medarde A. Swaminathan N. Yienger K. Lopez E. Malumbres M. McKay R. Ward J.M. Pellicer A. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 5Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Another point of complexity in the signaling of these GTPases is established at the level of their subcellular localization (2Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been shown that K-Ras is found exclusively at the plasma membrane, whereas H- and N-Ras are also present in endomembrane compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (6Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This differential property was traditionally considered irrelevant from a signaling point of view, because it was seen as a mere reflection of the different biosynthetic routes followed by each Ras family member during its maturation and transfer to plasma membrane areas. However, this scenario has changed recently after the demonstration that the localization of Ras GTPases in different subcellular regions represents a signaling stratagem to ensure the compartmentalized activation of signal transduction cascades (7Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated that H-Ras and N-Ras are activated in endomembrane areas during cell signaling and, perhaps more importantly, that Ras proteins localized in plasma membrane, reticulum, and Golgi can signal differently (7Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). For instance, Jnk and Erk/Akt activation seems to occur more efficiently in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, respectively (7Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that different biological effects can be generated by cells in function of the type of Ras protein activated, the type of effector molecules available during the stimulation period, and the subcellular localization where such activation occurs. One important question arising from these observations is the mechanism by which Ras proteins get activated in those subcellular compartments. The stimulation of these GTPases during signal transduction is induced by the exchange of GDP by GTP molecules, a process that triggers a conformational change in the switch regions that makes the GTPases accessible to effector molecules (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To proceed at physiological speeds, the GDP/GTP exchange in Ras proteins has to be catalyzed by a specialized group of enzymes known as guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GRF, guanosine nucleotide releasing factor; GRP, guanosine nucleotide releasing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; RBD, Ras binding domain of c-Raf1; Sos, son-of-sevenless; ZF, zinc finger; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GRF, guanosine nucleotide releasing factor; GRP, guanosine nucleotide releasing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; RBD, Ras binding domain of c-Raf1; Sos, son-of-sevenless; ZF, zinc finger; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three main families of GEFs have been described for Ras proteins, Son-of-sevenless (Sos) proteins (Sos1 and Sos2), Ras guanosine nucleotide releasing factors (GRF) (RasGRF1 and -2), and Ras guanosine nucleotide releasing proteins (GRP) (RasGRP 1 to 4) (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GEF proteins share in common a Cdc25 domain capable of stimulating GDP/GTP exchange in either Ras and/or Rap GTPases (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these catalytic domains trigger GDP/GTP exchange on Ras proteins has been recently elucidated at the structural level (9Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Ras GEF families are specialized in the activation of Ras through specific signal transduction pathways. Sos and RasGRP proteins are involved in linking the activation of membrane or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases with the stimulation of Ras GTPases (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Sos proteins, this connection is made possible through Grb2, an adaptor molecule that can bind simultaneously to the activated receptors and Sos proteins. The Grb2-dependent translocation of Sos protein to the activated receptor upon cell activation ensures its localization in juxtamembrane areas and the physical proximity with Ras proteins (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of most RasGRP proteins is mediated by the phospholipase Cγ-dependent generation of diacylglycerol. This second messenger binds to the zinc finger (ZF) region of RasGRP proteins, making it possible the translocation of RasGRPs to membranes and its association with GTPases (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these GEF families, RasGRF proteins are coupled to membrane receptors associated with heterotrimeric G-proteins. In this process, the receptors modulate the activity of the RasGRF protein by promoting their translocation to membranes (via generation of Ca2+) and by stimulating their basal enzyme activity (via phosphorylation on serine residues) (8Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the activation of Ras proteins in endomembranes should be achieved by some of the above Ras GEF proteins. To identify them, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of the subcellular localization and biological activities of representative members of the three families of Ras GEF toward Ras proteins localized in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Our results indicate that the activation of H-Ras in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum is a rather unspecific process that can be achieved by most Ras GEF tested (Sos, RasGRFs, and RasGRPs). In contrast, we show that only specific members of the RasGRP family can promote the activation of Ras in the Golgi apparatus. Plasmids—Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged versions of RasGRP1 (pCXN2-RasGRP1), RasGRP2 (pCXN2-RasGRP1), RasGRP3 (pCXN2-RasGRP1), and RasGRF2 (pCEFL-FLAG-RasGRF2) were obtained from Dr. P. Crespo (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain). The EGFP-RasGRP1-encoding vector (pMJC40) was generated by PCR using pCXN2-RasGRP1 as template. The PCR product was digested and subcloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 mammalian expression vector (Clontech). Deletion mutants of RasGRP1 were generated by PCR using pCXN2-RasGRP1 as template using the appropriate set of primers and subcloned into the pCEFL-FLAG expression vector. The RasGRP1Y549S and RasGRPF221S/Δ607–795 mutants (pMJC33 and pMJC28, respectively) were generated from pCXN2-RasGRP1 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The EGFP-RBD-encoding plasmid (pMJC36) was generated by PCR amplification of the human c-Raf1 RBD domain (amino acid residues 51–131) using the pXRB38 plasmid as template. After digestion, the cDNA fragment was subcloned inframe into the pEGFP-C1 vector. Plasmids encoding HA-tagged Sos1 isoforms 1 and 2 were obtained from Dr. J. M. Rojas (Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain). The pcDNA-FLAG-RasGRF2 was provided by Dr. M. F. Moran (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The expression vectors encoding the HA-tagged versions of H-Ras, K-Ras, H-RasC181S/C184S, and M1-H-RasC181S/C184S were obtained from Dr. P. Crespo. The KDELR-H-Ras expression vector (pMJC50) was generated by PCR amplification of the KDEL receptor 1 from a human leukemia cDNA library (Clontech) using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCATGAATCTCTTCCGATTCCTGGGA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCCGGCAAACTCAACTTCTTCCC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). After amplification, the PCR product was digested, purified, and ligated in-frame upstream to the HA-H-Ras coding sequence present in the pCEFL-HA-H-Ras plasmid. The detailed cloning and mutagenesis approaches are available upon request. All cDNA sequences were verified by automated sequencing. Tissue Culture and DNA Transfections—COS1 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C and a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) plus 100 units ml–1 of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). COS1 cells were transfected with liposomes (FuGENE 6, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence experiments, 1 μg of the Ras GEFs encoding vectors and 50 ng of the pMJC36 were used for transfections. For Ras activation assays, cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmids (see figure legends). Transfections were supplemented with empty vectors to normalize the amount of transfected DNA in each plate. Focus formation assays were performed as described (10van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Biochemical Detection of Ras Activation—COS1 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin, and 10 units ml–1 aprotinin. For lysis of cells expressing KDELR-HA-H-Ras, Nonidet P-40 was replaced with 25 mm CHAPS to favor the release of the protein out of the Golgi. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RBD immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation, beads were collected and washed with lysis buffer three times. Proteins were then eluted from the beads using 2× SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies (Babco). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Analysis—COS1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected as indicated above. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were washed, fixed with formaldehyde (Sigma), and subjected to immunostaining. Immunological reagents used were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Babco), anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-calreticulin (Calbiochem), and Cy5-, Cy3-, and Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs). When appropriate, photobleaching of the selected regions of interest was carried out by scanning them four times with a 480 nm argon laser at full power (100% intensity, 100% transmission). Recovery of fluorescence was observed at 37 °C by scanning the whole cell at imaging intensity settings (25% intensity, 8–10% transmission) at the times indicated after the bleach until recovery was judged complete. Cells were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). Imports of confocal images were made using the LSM510 software (Zeiss). Final processing of images was done with the Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems) program. The average of cells (in %) showing a specific subcellular distribution is given in the appropriate figure legend. 100 expressing cells were scored in each experiment (each performed in duplicate at least three independent times). RasGRP Family Proteins Are the Only Ras GEF Localized in the Golgi Apparatus—To identify the possible activators of Ras GTPases in endomembrane compartments, we first analyzed the subcellular localization of representative members of three families of Ras protein activators (Sos, RasGRF, and RasGRP). To this end, we transfected COS1 cells with mammalian expression vectors encoding epitope-tagged versions of two Sos1 isoforms, of RasGRF2, and of three RasGRP family members (RasGRP1, -2, and -3). The two Sos1 proteins (isoforms 1 and 2) differ on the presence of a 15-amino acid stretch located adjacent to the first proline-rich region required for Grb2 binding (11Rojas J.M. Subleski M. Coque J.J. Guerrero C. Saez R. Li B.Q. Lopez E. Zarich N. Aroca P. Kamata T. Santos E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After transfection with those plasmids, cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with the appropriate combination of antibodies. These experiments indicated that Ras GEF have distinct subcellular localizations. The Sos1.1 isoform and RasGRP2 display a uniform distribution through the cytoplasm of the transfected cells (Fig. 1A, first and fifth panels). The Sos1.2 isoform and RasGRF2 show also cytosolic localizations, although they are also found present in microtubular and reticular areas, respectively (Fig. 1A, second and third panels). In contrast to these GEFs, RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 proteins display in the majority (87–97%) of the transfected cells intense reticular and perinuclear localizations while showing negligible amounts in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, fourth and sixth panels). A minority of transfected cells expressing these GEFs showed a cytoplasmic distribution for these molecules. 2M. J. Caloca, J. L. Zugaza, and X. R. Bustelo, unpublished observations. We performed co-staining experiments utilizing markers specific for these two cellular compartments to confirm the localization of RasGRP1 in the reticulum and Golgi areas. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, RasGRP1 shows a perfect co-localization with markers for both cellular structures. Similar results were obtained with RasGRP3. 2M. J. Caloca, J. L. Zugaza, and X. R. Bustelo, unpublished observations. Under the same experimental conditions, RasGRF2 does not localize in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1C, lower panels). These results indicate that some RasGRP family members are the only Ras GEFs with localization in the Golgi apparatus. To get further information about the RasGRP molecules in endomembranes, we studied the stability of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-RasGRP1 fusion protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi using the fluorescent recovery after the photobleaching technique. In these experiments, the fluorescent proteins present in a small area are irreversibly photobleached by an intense laser flash and the fluorescence recovery through the exchange of bleached for nonbleached protein is then measured using an attenuated laser beam. These experiments revealed a rapid diffusional mobility of the EGFP-RasGRP1 protein present in endomembranes, with t ½ of fluorescence recovery ranging from 89.7 ± 28 to 114.7 ± 11sin bleached reticulum and Golgi, respectively (see Supplementary Materials, Fig. S1). By comparing the ratio of fluorescence intensities before photobleaching and after recovery in two regions of interest (one within the bleaching zone and the other one outside), we estimated that the mobile fraction of the EGFP-RasGRP1 population was 89.4 ± 3.9 and 87.8% ± 2.1 for reticulum and Golgi, respectively. These results indicate that nearly all of the EGFP-RasGRP1 proteins are freely diffusing rather than being associated with immobile protein components or membrane subdomains of those endomembranes. The Zinc Finger Region of RasGRP Is Responsible for the Subcellular Localization of This Exchange Factor—To identify the molecular determinants of the specific localization of RasGRP1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of a wide collection of RasGRP1 mutants in COS1 cells (Fig. 2A). RasGRP1 molecules lacking serial deletions of the C-terminal tail (residues 737–795 and 607–795) conserve the reticular and Golgi distribution (Fig. 2B, panels b and c, respectively). Likewise, the subcellular localization of RasGRP1 is unaffected when a catalytically inactive version of this protein (F221S mutant) is used in these experiments (Fig. 2B, panel d). In contrast, the reticular and Golgi localization of RasGRP1 was lost upon deletion of C-terminal regions containing the ZF domain (Fig. 2B, panel e), suggesting that this structural motif is responsible for the specific subcellular localization of RasGRP1. To confirm these results, we expressed in COS1 cells truncated versions of RasGRP1 containing exclusively its C-terminal region (residues 462–795 and 501–895, Fig. 2A). These proteins display the same subcellular distribution that the wild type protein despite the absence of all N-terminal domains (Fig. 2B, panels f and g). The distribution of these truncated proteins in the Golgi was also demonstrated using co-staining experiments with GM130, a Golgi-specific marker (Fig. 2C). Because RasGRP2 protein is not localized in the reticulum and Golgi despite sharing a ZF region with the other RasGRP family members, we investigated the possible structural cues within the ZF that confer the specificity toward the endomembrane compartments. To this end, we looked for common residues in the ZF region of RasGRP1 and -3 that were not conserved in RasGRP2. The alignment of the RasGRP ZF regions indicated that most of those residues were concentrated in the N-terminal region of the RasGRP2 ZF (residues 505 to 517) (Fig. 3A). Of those residues, we focused our attention on the serine residue at position 506 of RasGRP2, a surface-exposed amino acid that is replaced by a tyrosine residue in the case of the ZF regions of RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 (Fig. 3A, arrow). To verify whether this was one of the residues involved, we generated a Tyr to Ser mutation in the equivalent position of RasGRP1 (Y549S) (Fig. 3A, arrow). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that this mutation abrogates the specific localization of RasGRP1 in the endomembrane compartments (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the subcellular localization of RasGRP1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi is due to of localization signals present in its ZF region. RasGRP1 Activates Ras Proteins in the Golgi Apparatus— The localization of RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi suggested to us that these GEFs could be in charge of the specific activation of Ras in those subcellular localizations. To test this possibility, we first evaluated the ability of different Ras GEF proteins to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange on the endogenous Ras proteins in vivo. To this end, we made use of a fluorescent reporter protein composed of an EGFP molecule and the Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 (RBD, amino acid residues 51–131). This protein distributes to cell areas enriched in GTP-loaded Ras, thus allowing the study of Ras activation dynamics in vivo (7Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The EGFP-RBD fusion protein was expressed in exponentially growing COS1 cells either alone or in the presence of the indicated members of the Sos, RasGRF, and RasGRP family members. After expression, its subcellular localization was visualized by immunofluorescence. As previously described (7Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), EGFP-RBD localizes in the cytosol and the nucleoplasm when expressed alone (Fig. 4, lower panel). However, the fluorescent reporter protein redistributes to the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus when co-expressed with RasGRP1 (Fig. 4, top panels). This effect is dependent on the RasGRP1 ZF region, because the removal of this domain abolishes the translocation of the EGFP-RBD fusion protein to those cellular areas (Fig. 4, second row of panels from top). The EGFP-RBD does not change its localization in the presence of RasGRP2 (Fig. 4, third row of panels from top), a result probably derived from the lack of activity of this GEF on H-Ras (12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The co-expression of RasGRF2 induces the re-localization of the EGFP-RBD reporter protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and, to a lower extent, the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, fourth row of panels from top). Expression of the two Sos1 isoforms induces less apparent changes in movement of the EGFP-RBD protein within the cell, although a particular enrichment of this protein in dorsal membrane ruffles is observed in the presence of the first isoform of Sos1 protein (Fig. 4, fifth and sixth panels from top). This may be because of the higher Grb2 binding affinity of the Sos1.1 isoform (11Rojas J.M. Subleski M. Coque J.J. Guerrero C. Saez R. Li B.Q. Lopez E. Zarich N. Aroca P. Kamata T. Santos E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). No re-localization of EGFP-RBD was detected toward the Golgi apparatus in the presence of either RasGRF2 or Sos1 proteins (Fig. 4). This result suggests that RasGRP1 induces the activation of the endogenous Ras proteins in the Golgi apparatus as well as in other cellular compartments. The activation of Ras proteins by GEFs in the different subcellular regions was verified further by detecting GTP-Ras using pull-down experiments with a GST-RBD fusion protein (14de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Because both H- and N-Ras are distributed in the reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membrane, we decided to use versions of Ras proteins artificially targeted to different subcellular localizations to make possible the separate analysis of the activation of Ras in each subcellular compartment. The mutant versions of Ras used included a palmitoylation deficient mutant of H-Ras (C181S/C184S mutant) that localizes in both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, a H-RasC181S/C184S protein fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the first transmembrane domain of avian bronchitis virus M protein (M1-RasC181S/C184S) that is localized exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum, and a version of H-RasC181S/C184S fused to the C-terminal region of the KDEL receptor (KDELR-H-RasC181S/C184S), which is highly enriched in the Golgi apparatus and nuclear membrane (7Chiu V.K.

The subcellular localization of these Ras proteins was verified by immunofluorescence studies in COS1 cells (see Supplementary Materials, Fig. S2). These versions of Ras were expressed in COS1 alone or in combination with the indicated GEFs and, after transfection, their GTP levels were evaluated by pull-down experiments with a GST-RBD fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 5A, the activation of wild type H-Ras, H-RasC181S/C184S, and M1-H-Ras RasC181S/C184S is induced at similar levels upon the expression of RasGRP1, RasGRF2, and Sos1. As negative control, no GTP levels are induced in any of those H-Ras proteins upon co-expression of RasGRP2 (Fig. 5A), a Ras/Rap GEF inactive on H-Ras (12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S.

Here we examine and compare signaling events that are necessary for ERK1/2 activation by glucose and other stimuli in β cells. We find that agents that interrupt Ca2+ signaling by a variety of mechanisms interfere with glucose- and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1)-stimulated ERK1/2 activity. In particular, calmodulin antagonists, FK506, and cyclosporin, immunosuppressants that inhibit the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, suppress ERK1/2 activation by both glucose and GLP-1. Ca2+ signaling from intracellular stores is also essential for ERK1/2 activation, because thapsigargin blocks ERK1/2 activation by glucose or GLP-1.

Insulin is produced by β cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans in mammals. It is the key hormone that promotes the utilization and storage of glucose. Glucose, on the other hand, is the most important regulator of the secretion and biosynthesis of insulin by β cells, creating a deceptively simple primary loop controlling sugar metabolism. Signals from Ca2+, inositol phospholipids, and cAMP are believed to mediate glucose effects on β cells, but detailed knowledge of the pathways that control β cell function is limited (1Antinozzi P.A.

MAP kinases, also known as ERKs, are components of kinase cascades important for transmitting extracellular information to coordinate cellular responses.

Experiments with chelators and with artificially low glucose suggest that ERKs are activated to a small but significant extent even at subthreshold glucose concentrations, because the activity in the presence of chelators or at 0–1 mm glucose is lower than activity at 2.8–3 mm glucose in the absence of chelators (8Khoo S.

As confirmation that agents that stimulate insulin secretion via an effect on Ca2+ influx also activate ERKs, effects of the oral hypoglycemic drugs glyburide and tolbutamide, which cause closure of the ATP-dependent potassium channel in the β cell plasma membrane, were also examined (8Khoo S.

Efforts to elucidate the mechanism of ERK1/2 activation have suggested a role for several signaling molecules as intermediates in the pathway. Notable among these is protein kinase C (PKC), which is implicated in one report but discounted by others (11Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem.

PKC causes activation of ERK1/2 downstream of G protein-coupled receptors that act through Gq and is also involved in prolonged activation caused by some other ligands (18Robbins D.J. Cheng M.

In this study we have examined regulation of ERK1/2 by several extracellular cues, including glucose, GLP-1, and insulin. Our goals were to determine to what extent these agents shared common mechanisms for ERK1/2 activation and to begin to define essential components of the pathways. Our studies reveal that glucose and GLP-1 converge on a common mechanism for ERK1/2 regulation that is distinct from that used by insulin. The mechanism we propose has significant differences from those previously suggested to control ERK1/2 in β cells; we find a dependence on the natural release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and a sensitivity to inhibition by immunosuppressants that block the calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin.

The membranes were washed twice in 0.05% Tween-TBS and twice in TBS. After detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 bands (43 and 41 kDa, respectively) by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography, the membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C, rinsed with 0.05% Tween-TBS, and immunoblotted as above with 1:5000 Y691 anti-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (26Boulton T.G.

Upstream Components of the Glucose-stimulated ERK1/2 Pathway in INS-1 Cells—To examine upstream components of the glucose-dependent MAP kinase cascade, we infected INS-1 cells with adenoviruses expressing kinase-defective or interfering mutants of proteins viewed as core components of the ERK1/2 pathway in other cell types (Ras, Raf, MEK1, and ERK2) (14Chen Z.

In these experiments ERK1/2 activity was monitored in cell lysates with antibodies that selectively recognize the doubly phosphorylated, active forms of the kinases. Total ERK1/2 immunoreactivity demonstrated that equal amounts of the two proteins were present in each lane. Consistent with its inhibitory action, the kinase-defective mutant K52R ERK2 reduced phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1/2. We previously showed that MEK1 but not MEK2 was activated by glucose in INS-1 cells (9Xu S. Khoo S. Dang A. Witt S. Do V. Zhen E. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1618-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), consistent with the finding that the phosphorylation-defective mutant S217A MEK1 blocked ERK2 activation by glucose (Fig. 1B). The effects of the inhibitory Ras mutant and the Raf N-terminal fragment support the conclusion that a small GTP-binding protein, either a Ras isoform or another GTPase that uses a common guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is required for ERK1/2 activation in INS-1 cells. Tyrosine kinases often participate in ERK1/2 activation, and glucose has been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation in β cells (15Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Burke T.R.J. Quon M.J. Reed B.C. Dikic I. Noel L.E. Newgard C.B. Farese R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40817-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Konrad R.J.

We examined the potential roles of two tyrosine kinases, Src and PYK2, in inducing ERK1/2 activation. We found no evidence of glucose-induced changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in INS-1 cells (data not shown), suggesting that it is not involved. Src inhibitors including PP2 (27Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) caused a partial but significant reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to glucose (Fig. 1D), suggesting a role for a Src-like kinase. Calmodulin Is the Calcium-dependent Effector Required for Stimulation of ERK1/2 by Glucose in INS-1 Cells—We previously showed that extracellular Ca2+ was required for glucose-dependent ERK1/2 activation (8Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the effects of inhibitors that block calcium-dependent signaling molecules. First, we tested PKC inhibitors (27Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) because PKC is required in several systems for ERK1/2 activation, and it has been suggested that this is also the case in β cells (11Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). None of the inhibitors tested, including bis-indoylmaleimide (GF109203X), blocked glucose-induced ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 2A), although phorbol ester-stimulated activity was blocked (not shown). On the other hand, W7, a calmodulin antagonist, was a very effective inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation by glucose (Fig. 2B). To probe the site of action of calmodulin, we tested the involvement of two important calmodulin targets, Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (27Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar, 29Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. Neurochem.

Not only did the CaMK inhibitors KN62 and KN93, which inhibit interaction of the kinases with calmodulin, both suppress glucose-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2C), the immunosuppressant FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, also prevented ERK1/2 activation by glucose (Fig. 2D). To determine the specificity of action of FK506, we examined the effects of other immunosuppressants. Supporting an involvement of calcineurin, cyclosporin A and FK520, both of which are also calcineurin inhibitors, prevented ERK1/2 activation by glucose (Fig. 3A and not shown). In contrast, the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) not calcineurin, had no effect on glucose-induced ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 3B). Expression of myocyte-enriched calcineurin-interacting protein, a calcineurin inhibitory protein (39Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), also prevented ERK1/2 activation by glucose (Fig. 3C), providing an independent line of evidence implicating calcineurin in ERK1/2 activation by glucose. To determine whether calcineurin inhibitors influence activation of ERK1/2 in other systems, HEK293 cells were treated with epidermal growth factor or NaCl to stimulate ERK1/2 activity in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (Fig. 3D). The calcineurin inhibitor had no effect on ERK1/2 activity induced by either stimulus in 293 cells. The Calmodulin/Calcineurin-dependent Mechanism Is Not Common to All Agents That Stimulate ERK1/2 in INS-1 Cells— Because we had clear evidence that calmodulin/calcineurin were required for ERK1/2 activation by glucose, we wished to determine whether other agents that activate ERK1/2 also employ a mechanism dependent on these factors. We examined the potential involvement of calmodulin/calcineurin in ERK1/2 activation by phorbol ester, which has not generally been found to use these signal transducers (Fig. 4A). Consistent with an independent mechanism of action, phorbol ester-stimulated activity was not affected by calcineurin inhibitors. Hormones that stimulate adenylyl cyclase including GLP-1 (Fig. 4, B and C) and PACAP (not shown) activate ERK1/2 (Refs. 12Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48146-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Ehses J.A. Pelech S.L. Pederson R.A. McIntosh C.H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 432: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and this study). Although the extent of activation was usually less than with either glucose or forskolin, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected within 2–5 min and persisted for at least 10 min with either GLP-1 or PACAP. The effect on kinase activity was greater if 2 mm glucose was present in the medium. Activation of ERK1/2 by GLP-1 was sensitive to inhibition by W7 but like glucose largely insensitive to wortmannin (Fig. 4B). Although activity stimulated by forskolin alone was apparently less sensitive to the phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 2B and not shown), activity stimulated by glucose plus GLP-1 or glucose plus forskolin was blocked by FK506 (Fig. 4C). In each of these cases, rapamycin did not reduce ERK1/2 activity. Because insulin stimulates ERK1/2 in many tissues and the agents above that trigger ERK1/2 also enhance insulin secretion, we wished to determine whether induction of ERK1/2 activity by insulin in β cells uses a calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent mechanism and is involved in their activation by glucose. Insulin and IGF-1 (not shown) stimulated ERK1/2 in INS-1 cells, but to a much reduced extent compared with glucose (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, activation of ERK1/2 by insulin was not blocked by wortmannin (lower panel), which inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a major mediator of insulin action (41Summers S.A. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Int. J. Obes. Relat Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: S67-S70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although activation of Akt was inhibited (not shown). Wortmannin also had little effect on glucose-stimulated ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 4B). Stimulation of ERK1/2 by insulin, in contrast to glucose, was not reduced by W7 or cyclosporin A (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that glucose and insulin use distinct mechanisms to trigger ERK1/2. Source of Ca2 + Required for Glucose-dependent ERK1/2 Activation—Ca2+ was shown to be required in the earliest studies of this response (7Frödin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To explore this requirement further, we first depolarized cells by exposing them to 25 mm KCl (Fig. 5A). KCl caused a rapid but transient increase in ERK1/2 activity, which had returned to control values by 10 min; glucose activated ERK1/2 more following a 30-min incubation in the presence of KCl than in its absence (not shown). Like activation by glucose, activation of ERK1/2 by KCl was blocked by calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 5A). We next examined the source of calcium required for ERK1/2 activation. Nifedipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (42Mitterdorfer J. Grabner M. Kraus R.L. Hering S. Prinz H. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), partially blocked glucose stimulation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5B), as was reported (11Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48146-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with the related blockers nisoldipine and nitrendipine (not shown). Under no condition was a complete blockade produced with these agents. Diazoxide is a thiazide, which maintains ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the open state, and is used therapeutically to inhibit insulin release from insulin-secreting tumors. This agent at millimolar concentrations blocked glucose activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C); high micromolar diazoxide caused a modest reduction in ERK1/2 activity (not shown). These results indicate that Ca2+ influx is important for ERK1/2 activation. The Ca2+ that is necessary to trigger the kinase cascade could be that resulting from the influx of extracellular Ca2+ or that released from intracellular stores. To determine the impact of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores on activation of ERK1/2 by glucose, cells were pretreated with 1 mm thapsigargin for 15 min, a time sufficient for this ATPase inhibitor to exhaust the intracellular Ca2+ pool (43Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Luo X. Bera A.K. Muallem S. Adv. Dent. Res. 2000; 14: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin itself did not increase ERK1/2 activity following 5, 10, or 15 min of exposure (not shown). However, activation of ERK1/2 by glucose was completely blocked by thapsigargin (Fig. 6A), suggesting that glucose causes release of intracellular Ca2+ to promote ERK1/2 activation. To compare the effects of glucose to membrane depolarization induced by KCl, we determined whether the effects of KCl were also blocked by thapsigargin. Thapsigargin significantly reduced but did not completely block ERK1/2 activation by KCl (Fig. 6B), consistent with the idea that the Ca2+ that activates ERK1/2 is the intracellular pool. For comparison, we also examined the effects of thapsigargin on stimulation of ERK1/2 by insulin (Fig. 4D) and GLP-1 (Fig. 6C). No blockade of insulin-increased ERK1/2 activity was detected, but GLP-1-induced activity was inhibited. Ca2+ influx can induce the release of this pool through ryanodine receptors, and glucose-induced production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) may activate IP3 receptors (44Lemmens R. Larsson O.

NatB is composed of the interacting Nat3p and Mdm20p subunits, both of which are required for acetyltransferase activity. The phenotypes of nat3-Δ and mdm20-Δ mutants are identical or nearly the same and include the following: diminished growth at elevated temperatures and on hyperosmotic and nonfermentable media; diminished mating; defective actin cables formation; abnormal mitochondrial and vacuolar inheritance; inhibition of growth by DNA-damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate, bleomycin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea; and inhibition of growth by the antimitotic drugs benomyl and thiabendazole. The similarity of these phenotypes to the phenotypes of certain act1 and tpm1 mutants suggests that such multiple defects are caused by the lack of acetylation of actin and tropomyosins. However, the lack of acetylation of other unidentified proteins conceivably could cause the same phenotypes. Furthermore, unacetylated actin and certain N-terminally altered actins have comparable defective properties in vitro, particularly actin-activated ATPase activity and sliding velocity.

The two cotranslational processes, cleavage of N-terminal methionine residues and N-terminal acetylation, are by far the most common modifications, occurring on the vast majority of proteins. Eukaryotic cytosolic proteins initiate with methionine that is cleaved from nascent chains of most proteins. Subsequently, N-terminal acetylation occurs on certain of the proteins, either containing or lacking the methionine residue. This N-terminal acetylation occurs on over one-half of soluble eukaryotic proteins but seldom on prokaryotic proteins (1Driessen H.P.C. de Jong W.W. Tesser G.I. Bloemendal H. CRC Crit. Rev.

We have established that Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three major NATs, NatA, NatB, and NatC, with catalytic subunits Ard1p, Nat3p, and Mak3p, respectively, and that each is required for acetylating different groups of proteins (4Polevoda B.

In addition, a special subclass of NatA substrates with Ser-Glu-, Ser-Asp-, Ala-Glu-, or Gly-Glu- termini, designated NatA′, are only partially acetylated in nat3-Δ or mak3-Δ mutants (6Arnold R.J.

Sherman F. Hirano H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All of these proteins have Ac-Met-Asp- or Ac-Met-Glu-N-termini. Furthermore, all Met-Asp- or Met-Glu- eukaryotic proteins that have undergone N-terminal analysis were shown to be N-terminally acetylated (5Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that all Met-Asp- or Met-Glu- yeast proteins are NatB substrates. The essential protein, tropomyosin, which contains a Met-Asp-Lys-Ile-Arg- terminus, was recently shown to be a NatB substrate. 2Singer, J. M., and Shaw, J. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nat1 and ard1 mutants were unable to N-terminally acetylate in vivo the same subset of 24 normally acetylated proteins, including those with Ala- and Ser- termini (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition to lacking NAT activity, both nat1-Δ and ard1-Δ mutants exhibited slower growth, derepression of the silent mating type gene HMLα, and failure to enter Go. Overexpression of both Ard1p and Nat1p subunits is required for increased NAT activity in vivo (10Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently another protein, Asc1p, was found to be associated with the complex when Nat1p was used as bait in a genome-wide screen by tandem affinity purification (TAP) protocol (12Gavin A.C. Bosche M.

Furthermore, Asc1p, together with Eno1p, Mis1p, Myo1p, and YGR090w, was detected in the complex when Ard1p was tagged (yeast.cellzone.com).Tercero and Wickner (13Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) described the MAK3 gene that encodes a catalytic subunit of NatC, which is required for the N-terminal acetylation of the viral major coat protein, gag, with an Ac-Met-Leu-Arg-Phe- terminus. The copurification of Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p suggests that these three subunits form a complex (15Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein-protein interactions between Mak3p and Mak10p as well as between Mak31p and Mak10 were detected in a two-hybrid screen (16Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 1999; 403: 623-627Crossref Scopus (3896) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that each of the Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p subunits are required for acetylation of the NatC-type N-terminal sequences in vivo (17Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20154-20159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, we found that deletion of any of the corresponding genes leads to the lack of acetylation of NatC-type altered iso-1-cytochromes c but not to the lack of acetylation of NatA, NatB, or NatA′ substrates. In addition, all three deletion strains showed similar phenotypes, including slower growth on nonfermentable carbon sources at elevated temperature. Although biological functions of Mak31p and Mak10p are unknown, Séraphin (18Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) pointed out the sequence similarity of Mak31p to Sm proteins.We identified previously (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H.

In the present study, we have used the TAP protocol with Nat3p as the bait to identify Mdm20p as the other subunit of NatB, and to demonstrate that both proteins, Nat3p and Mdm20p, are required for acetylation of the NatB substrates. The corresponding deletion mutants showed similar if not identical phenotypes, including the following: slow growth; temperature and salt sensitivity; osmotic sensitivity; calcium and caffeine sensitivity; deficiency in utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources; reduced mating efficiency; sensitivity to the mitotic drugs thiabendazole and benomyl; and susceptibility to many DNA-damaging agents, including methyl methansulfonate, bleomycin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea. Furthermore, the phenotypes of act1, tpm1, and rnr4 mutants altered in the N-terminal region indicate that the nat3-Δ and mdm20-Δ phenotypes are due primarily, if not entirely, to the lack of Act1p (actin), Tpm1p, and Tpm2p (tropomyosins) acetylation. We have also demonstrated that unacetylated actin and actin altered in the N-terminal region have similar defective properties in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains—The strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table I. The analysis of N-terminal acetylation was carried out with several isogenic series, which were derived from the following parental strains: B-7687 (CYC1-853 MAT a cyc7-67 ura3-52 lys5-10); B-13233 (MATα tub2-201::ACT1::HIS3 ade4 his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 ura3-52); B-11679 (MATα ura3-52); B-14819 (MAT a his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 Spo–); and B-14276 (MATα his3-Δ0 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0).

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Other media contains 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and either 2% ethanol (YPE) or 2% galactose (YPGal). Unless stated otherwise, yeast strains were grown at 30 °C. Certain phenotypes of the nat3-Δ and mdm20-Δ strains were determined with YPD medium containing the following amounts of different agents: 1 m sodium chloride (NaCl); 1 m potassium chloride (KCl); 0.3 m calcium chloride (CaCl2); 1.5 m sorbitol; 1.2 m mannitol; 15 and 30% glycerol; 6.0% ethylene glycol; 6.7% diethylene glycol; 0.05% EGTA; 0.15% caffeine; 50–75 μg/ml thiabendazole; 25–50 μg/ml benomyl; 0.02–0.1% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS); 0.02–0.1% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS); 3 μg/ml bleomycin. Other phenotypes were determined with synthetic complete medium containing the following: 75 or 100 mm hydroxyurea (HU) and 4 or 10 μg/ml camptothecin in media containing 0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO).Mating Efficiencies—Quantitative matings were determined as described earlier (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).The ρ+ → ρ– Mutation Rate—The method for estimating ρ+ → ρ– mutation rates was based on the method of Ogur et al. (20Ogur M. St. John R. Ogur S. Mark A.M. Genetics. 1959; 44: 484-496Crossref Google Scholar), in which the relative mutant frequency equals the mutation rate when the culture is grown in a medium that totally prevents growth of the mutant cells. The strains were grown in YPG medium, and the frequencies of ρ– cells were estimated from the number of small colonies on YPDG medium (19Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar).Construction of Deletion Mutants—Standard molecular biological procedures were performed as described (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The NAT3 and MDM20 genes were disrupted by replacing portions of the genes with the kanMX4 gene produced by PCR and then using the appropriate fragment for yeast transformation as described earlier (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For the nat3-Δ::kanMX4 disruption, primers Oligo1 and Oligo2 (Table II) were used to prepare the PCR fragment for transformation, and the correct disruption was identified by PCR, using the set of primers Oligo3 and Oligo4. Similarly, the fragment required for producing the mdm20-Δ::kanMX4 disruption was prepared with Oligo5 and Oligo6 and yeast genomic DNA made from a mdm20-Δ::kanMX4 deletion strain (Invitrogen) as template.Table IIOligonucleotides used in the construction and testing of the disrupted genesORFOligo.Sequence (5′ → 3′)NAT3Oligo1(-70) GCAAAAAACATAGCGGTGGGCGCACGTTGGTGGGCCTGG GAAGAACAGCTGAAGCTTCGNAT3Oligo2(+814) TGAATAGCACAGAGGTTCATTATTATGTTCTGAGTATG AGGACGAAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTGNAT3Oligo3(-142) TTCCAATGCGGTAGTGCTTAGCNAT3Oligo4(+906) TATATCATTCAGTATGTACATACMDM20Oligo5(-140) CAGTCACCTTTAACGAAAATCGMDM20Oligo6(+2554) CCTCAAAAATCATATACTACTTTTTCNAT3Oligo7(+705) CGGCCGGATGGAAGAAGCCATAAATGCTATAAATGCTA TCCACATGATGTAAGATTTTCCATGGAAAAGAGAAGATNAT3Oligo8(+863) ATAGTCCGCGCCTCTGGATAGTATTATTTTAGTGCGTAT CGCAAAATTAAGTTGGGTAAGGCCAGNAT3Oligo9(+908) AGTATATGATTCAGTATGTAGANAT3Oligo10(+667) GCTATGGCTAGGGACAGGAACANAT3Oligo11(+2310) GTTGGAATAT CATAATCACT1Oligo12(-200) ATTCATTTATATCACGCTCTCACT1Oligo13(+1938) CAGTTTTGATTTGGTTCCCAGTPM1Oligo14(-170) TCAGCACACCATAGCACGATCTPM1Oligo15(+748) ATACAGATGTATAGTCTAAGCTPM1Oligo16(-11) P-TTTGTGTGTATGGGGTGTGAGTPM1Oligo17(-10) AAAGGCAACAATGCACAAAATCAGAGAAATPM1Oligo18(-11) AAAGGCAACAATGTCCAAAATCAGAGAAAARNR4Oligo19(-122) GCCTTGTCTCGAAACAGAAAGRNR4Oligo20(+1121) GTTTAGTTATACTGTACCTAGGRNR4Oligo21(-11) TTAGTTATTACAATGCATGAAGCACATAACCAATTTRNR4Oligo22(+21) AAATTGGTTATGTGCTTCATGCATTGTAATAACTAARNR4Oligo23(-11) TTAGTTATTACAATGTCTGAAGCACATAACCAATTTRNR4Oligo24(+21) AAATTGGTTATGTGCTTCAGACATTGTAATAACTAA Open table in a new tab Gene Cloning and Mutagenesis—Cloning of the wild type ACT1 and TPM1 genes as well as cloning of the ACT1-203, TPM1-4 and TPM1-5 alleles was performed using PCR with oligonucleotides Oligo12 and Oligo13 for ACT1, Oligo14 and Oligo15 for both TPM1 alleles, and genomic DNAs prepared from the corresponding strains B-11679, B-14443, B-14444, and B-14445, respectively. The resulting PCR products were inserted in a TA TOPO pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the appropriate fragments were subsequently inserted in the yeast CEN URA3 vector pAA625 (pRS316). The yeast strain B-11852 (Table I) was transformed with the resulting plasmids to produce strains B-14464, B-14465, and B-14466 as well as control strain B-15073 (vector only) which were used to test the suppressor phenotypes.Oligo16, Oligo17, Oligo18, and the ExSite™ PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for making site-directed mutations in TPM1 gene. The resulting TPM1 alleles were sequenced with Oligo14 to confirm the correct nucleotide replacements. Subsequently, strain B-14821 was transformed with the TPM1-101 (D2H), TPM1-101 (D2S), and TPM1 plasmids and vector alone, and the phenotypes of the resulting strains (Table I) were analyzed by 1/10 serial dilutions on different media.Similarly, wild type RNR4 was cloned by PCR using normal yeast genomic DNA, Oligo19, Oligo20, and the TA TOPO vector; the appropriate fragment was subsequently transferred to the pAA625 yeast vector. The RNR4-101 (D2H) and RNR4-101 (D2S) alleles were produced with the QuickChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using Oligo21 and Oligo22 for the D2H replacement and Oligo23 and Oligo24 for the D2S replacement. The rnr4-Δ deletion strain, B-15086 (Table I), was transformed with the resulting plasmids.Purification of Iso-1 and the Analysis of Its Acetylation Status by Mass Spectrometry—Iso-1 proteins were purified as described previously (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) by using two subsequent rounds of weak cation-exchange BioRex70 column chromatography, 100–200 mesh and 200–400 mesh (Bio-Rad), respectively, in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with a 0–1.0 m potassium chloride linear gradient. MS analysis was carried out with iso-1 proteins dialyzed against H2O. MALDI-TOF MS samples were prepared and analyzed in Voyager-DE STR linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at the MicroChemical Protein/Peptide Core Facility, University of Rochester, as described (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Purification and Characterization of the Yeast Nat3p Complex—The Nat3p protein complex was purified by TAP method (15Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). NAT3 was fused to the TAP tag by PCR-based tagging, using plasmid pAB2629 (originally designated pBS1479 and obtained from B. Séraphin, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) as template with Oligo7 and Oligo8 (Table II). Neither of the tags, ProtA and CBP, impaired protein function. The eluted complex was concentrated with the Centricon-3 (Millipore, Bradford, MA), and the subunits were separated by electrophoresis in a 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel, and the protein bands were visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad).In Situ Gel Tryptic Digests and Peptide MS Analysis—The protein bands after staining were excised from the gel, washed, reduced, alkylated, and then incubated with trypsin essentially as described (15Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by Zip-tip (Millipore) before MALDI-TOF MS analysis in Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer at the MicroChemical Protein/Peptide Core Facility, University of Rochester. Proteins were identified by searching a comprehensive non-redundant yeast protein data base using the program MS-Fit/Prospector (University of California, San Francisco, ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm).Actin-activated S1 ATPase Assay—Yeast actin was isolated from each strain by DNase I affinity chromatography as described before (21Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to the method of Godfrey and Harrington (22Godfrey J.E. Harrington W.F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 894-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Myosin sub-fragment S1 was prepared according to Weeds and Pope (23Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 111: 129-157Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase assays were performed according to Miller et al. (24Miller C.J. Wong W.W. Bobkova E. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16557-16565Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In Vitro Actin Motility Assays—The actin motility assays were performed as described by Doyle et al. (25Doyle T.C. Hansen J.E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heavy meromyosin was prepared according to Kron et al. (26Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the sliding velocities was performed with an ExpertVision System (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa, CA).Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Live or fixed cells were examined with a Eclipse E-600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Cells were grown to early log phase and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, then washed, resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml, and incubated with 20 units/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (this and other reagents for microscopy were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to allow visualization of the F-actin. Vacuoles were visualized by staining live cells with N-(triethylammonium propyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridium dibromide. Mitochondrial staining of live cells was performed with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine.RESULTSPurification of the NatB Complex—The yeast NatB complex was purified by the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method (15Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), which has the advantage of using strains with normal expression of proteins. A NAT3 fusion gene was constructed by the PCR-based tagging procedure using the pBS1479 plasmid as a template and oligonucleotides complementary to the regions corresponding to the C-terminal end of the NAT3 coding region and to the 3′ end of TAP tag-marker cassette (Table I). Both primers contained the appropriate regions of homology with the yeast genome to allow in-frame fusion of the TAP tag downstream of the NAT3 gene. Neither ProtA nor CBP tags impaired protein function as was judged by phenotype analysis of the transformants (data not presented). The resulting yeast strain, B-13396 (Table I), had normal growth rates on YPD and YPG at both 30 and 37 °C, in contrast to nat3-Δ mutants, which had slow growth phenotypes and were ts-sensitive (7Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The expression of the Nat3p fusion protein in strain B-13396 was verified by Western blotting; yeast cell extract was probed with peroxidase anti-peroxidase antibody (Sigma) and a positive signal corresponding to 33-kDa band, and the molecular mass of Nat3p-ProtA-CBP was detected (data not shown).The Nat3p fusion protein and associated components were recovered from yeast cell extracts by TAP affinity chromatography on IgG-agarose beads and by subsequent tobacco etch virus protease cleavage and purification with calmodulin-co"

The C-terminal SOCS box region is thought to regulate SOCS protein stability most likely via an elongin C interaction. In the present study, we have found that phosphorylation of SOCS3 at two tyrosine residues in the conserved SOCS box, Tyr204 and Tyr221, can inhibit the SOCS3-elongin C interaction and activate proteasome-mediated SOCS3 degradation. Jak-mediated phosphorylation of SOCS3 decreased SOCS3 protein half-life, and phosphorylation of both Tyr204 and Tyr221 was required to fully destabilize SOCS3. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of SOCS3, Y204F,Y221F, remained stable in the presence of activated Jak2 and receptor tyrosine kinases. SOCS3 stability correlated with the relative amount that bound elongin C, because in vitro phosphorylation of a SOCS3-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein abolished its ability to interact with elongin C. In addition, a SOCS3/SOCS1 chimera that co-precipitates with markedly increased elongin C, was significantly more stable than wild-type SOCS3. The data suggest that interaction with elongin C stabilizes SOCS3 protein expression and that phosphorylation of SOCS box tyrosine residues disrupts the complex and enhances proteasome-mediated degradation of SOCS3.

Another member of the family, SOCS-3, was initially reported to inhibit signal transduction by binding to the activation loop of the Janus kinases. But SOCS-3 also exerts at least part of its effect by directly binding to specific phosphotyrosine motifs of activated cytokine receptor subunits (12Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N. et al.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Nicholson S.E. De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Corbin J. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Silva A. Asimakis M. Farley A. Nash A.D.

Overexpression studies have implicated SOCS3 in the negative regulation of a number of cytokine signaling pathways. Mice nullizygous for SOCS3 demonstrated embryonic lethality caused by impaired placental development (17Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Analysis of these mice indicated a role for SOCS3 in modulating leukemia inhibitory factor signaling during trophoblast giant cell differentiation. Furthermore, tetraploid rescued SOCS3–/– mice died within 3 weeks of birth because of heart failure. Phenotypically these mice displayed growth retardation and lethargy. Post-mortem analysis revealed cardiac monocyte hypertrophy presumably caused by a loss of SOCS3-mediated inhibition of leukemia inhibitory factor and CT-1 signaling. The presence of a C-terminal SOCS box homology region in all SOCS proteins suggests that this domain can play an essential role in SOCS function. More than 50 proteins have been identified in mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans that possess diverse protein-protein interaction motifs such as SH2 domains, SPRY domains, WD40 motifs, and ankyrin repeats, linked to this common homologous region known as the SOCS box, a C-terminal domain of ∼40 amino acids (5Kile B.T.

It has recently been shown that the SOCS box is a protein-protein interaction domain that mediates complex formation with elongin C (18Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C.

Elongin C is a component of ubiquitin ligases that include elongin B, the ring finger protein Roc1, and one of the scaffold proteins Cul2 or Cul5 (5Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A.

Some recent data suggest that elongin C links SOCS proteins to the proteasome and targets them for degradation. Consistent with this model are the findings that SOCS1 induces the degradation of Jak2, the TEL-Jak2 oncogenic fusion proteins, and IRS-1/2 (21Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J.

In addition, mutations or post-translational modifications of SOCS1 that disrupt the elongin C interaction stabilize the protein and increase its half-life (18Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L.

However, there is also evidence that elongin C can stabilize SOCS protein expression and that disruption of this interaction leads to proteasome-mediated SOCS destruction (19Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc Natl Acad Sci. U.

A well characterized elongin C-binding partner, the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, regulates the stability of a hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-1α. Mutations in the VHL SOCS box that interfere with its interaction with elongin C destabilize the protein result in marked reduction in protein levels and are responsible for the loss of function phenotype in human VHL syndrome (28Kaelin W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 29Ohh M. Tagaki Y. Aso T. Stebbins C.E. Pavletich N.P. Zbar B. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin W.G. J Clin.

Thus, the binding of elongin C to SOCS proteins may regulate protein stability. We have previously demonstrated that SOCS3 is phosphorylated by Jaks and receptor tyrosine kinases at two tyrosine residues, Tyr204 and Tyr221, within the conserved SOCS box region and that phosphorylated Tyr221 interacts with the SH2 domains of the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP (32Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein stability and elongin C interaction. Tyrosine phosphorylation decreased SOCS3 protein half-life by disrupting the interaction between SOCS3 and elongin C. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that a SOCS3/SOCS1 chimera (3/1/3), which bound much more strongly to elongin C, was significantly more stable than wild-type SOCS3. Cell Culture—All of the tissue culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 10 mm HEPES (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). 293T, RAW264, A431, COS-7, and the retroviral packaging cell lines Phoenix A and PlatE (33Grignani F.

The murine B cell line 1881 was a generous gift from Dr. Naomi Rosenberg (Tufts University, Boston, MA) and was grown in RPMI (Mediatech) containing 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). The murine IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 was grown in RPMI supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 units/ml murine IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). LPS (Sigma) was used at 10 ng/ml. Plasmids/Antibodies/Fusion Proteins—C-terminally FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant SOCS3 cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18S have been described previously (32Cacalano N.A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). C-terminally HA-tagged SOCS3 and 3/1/3 chimera were constructed by engineering a ClaI site at the 3′ end of the SOCS3 coding sequence by PCR-based mutagenesis, followed by cloning into pME18S encoding a 5′ in-frame ClaI site followed by the sequence for a hemagglutinin epitope tag. SOCS 3/1/3 and 3/V/3 chimeras were generated using a fusion PCR approach with overlapping (sense and antisense) mutagenic oligonucleotide primers encoding the SOCS1 or VHL BC boxes. The 5′ PCR primer spanned the unique SacII site in the SOCS3 cDNA and the 3′ primer covered the 3′ coding sequence of SOCS3 followed by a NotI restriction site. The PCR product containing the chimeric sequence was swapped with the SacII/NotI fragment from the WT SOCS3 expression vector. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Seqwright, Houston, TX). FLAG-tagged SOCS3 and 3/1/3 chimera were cloned into the retroviral vector pMX-IRES-GFP, which has been described elsewhere (36Staal F.J. Bakker A.Q. Verkuijlen M. van Oort E. Spits H.

GST fusion constructs were produced by cloning the SOCS3, 3/1/3 or 3/V/3 chimeras into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transformation of DH5α competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed according to standard methods. N-terminally FLAG-tagged elongin B and N-terminally Myc-tagged elongin C constructs were generous gifts from Drs. Doug Hilton and Tracy Willson (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Australia). The GST-JAK2-JH1 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Akihiko Yoshimura (Fukuoka, Japan). All of the restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). FLAG antibody for FLAG-SOCS3 immunoprecipitation was purchased from Sigma. Transfections/Infections—293T, COS-7, and PlatE cells were transfected with Effectene lipid-based transfection reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For retroviral infections, 2 ml of supernatant from transfected Phoenix A or PlatE cells was added to 2 ml of A431 or 1881 cells at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once and resuspended in fresh culture medium. Cells stably expressing the SOCS3-IRES-GFP retrovirus were sorted by flow cytometry for green fluorescent protein expression. Immunoprecipitations/GST Pull-down Experiments/Western Blotting—The cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.875% Brij 97 (Sigma), 0.125% Nonidet P-40 (British Drug Houses, Poole, UK), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies as described in the figure legends. Rabbit polyclonal anti FLAG antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Sepharose-conjugated M2 monoclonal was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10, rabbit anti-hemagglutinin tag, rabbit anti-Myc, and rabbit anti-GST antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-RasGAP antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). For GST pull-down experiments, the cells were lysed as described above, and 5 μg of GST, GST-wild-type SOCS3-GST, or GST-3/1/3 were added to the lysates in combination with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The lysates were incubated with the fusion proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed in lysis buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted onto nylon membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bradford, MA). The membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (BioRad). The proteins were detected with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Pulse-Chase Analysis/Cycloheximide Time Course—For pulse-chase analysis, transfected cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in cysteine/methionine-free MEM (ICN) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Serva) for 30 min at 37 °C. Approximately 100 μCi of 35S translabel (ICN) was added per 106 cells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Labeling was chased by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing cysteine and methionine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were harvested at the time points post-chase indicated in the figure legends. For the cycloheximide time course, SOCS3-expressing cells were treated with 25 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 25 μm pervanadate. Aliquots of cells were taken at the time points indicated in the figure legends and immunoblotted as described in the text. Molecular Modeling of the SOCS3 Box Region—For molecular modeling and graphic representation of the protein structures, the programs WHAT IF (53Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 532-556Google Scholar) and pcRibbons were used. Energy minimizations were performed under vacuum conditions with the Gromos program library (W. F. van Gunsteren, distributed by BIOMOS Biomolecular Software B.V., Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, University of Groningen, the Netherlands). The structure of the VHL α-domain (Brookhaven data bank entry code 1VCB) was used as a template for the model structure of the SOCS3 box region (30Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that SOCS3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by several families of kinases, including Jaks and receptor tyrosine kinases (32Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In mutagenesis studies, we have identified Tyr204 and Tyr221 within the conserved SOCS box motif as the major targets of phosphorylation by Jak1, Jak2, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and demonstrated that phosphorylated Tyr221 binds the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP, thus modulating the ERK/MAP kinase pathway (32Cacalano N.A.

LPS is known to induce SOCS3 expression. The murine monocytic cell line RAW264 was treated with LPS to assess whether endogenous SOCS3 protein induced by LPS would become tyrosine-phosphorylated. LPS-induced SOCS3 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1A, top panel), presumably because LPS does not trigger tyrosine kinase activity. In these cells treated with LPS we have observed SOCS3 expression for periods up to 24 h without turnover of SOCS3 (results not shown). However, SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation can be induced by treating cells with LPS in the presence of the proteintyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium pervanadate. RAW264 cells were stimulated with LPS for up to 4 h. The cells were also incubated with or without pervanadate during the final 15–60 min of the experiment. SOCS3 protein levels were markedly increased in cells that had been activated by LPS for 3 h (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lanes 1 and 3), but there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 under these conditions (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 3). In contrast, pervanadate treatment combined with LPS stimulation resulted in SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, SOCS3 protein levels were significantly reduced upon extended treatment with pervanadate (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lanes 3–7). These results suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation can markedly enhance SOCS3 degradation. To demonstrate whether phosphorylation-induced SOCS3 destabilization occurred in a ligand-dependent manner, we used the human tumor cell line A431, which is transformed by the overexpression of EGFR (38Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). Stimulation of A431 cells with EGF after serum starvation results in phosphorylation of known EGFR substrates, such as STAT3, Shc, Grb2, and the EGFR itself (38Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, we stably expressed SOCS3 in A431 cells. To demonstrate that direct phosphorylation of SOCS3 was required to destabilize the protein, we also expressed a phosphorylation-deficient SOCS3 mutant, Y204F,Y221F, which we have previously shown not to be phosphorylated by Jak1, Jak2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (32Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A431 cells were serum-starved for 8 h and incubated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 30 or 60 min, and SOCS3 protein levels as well as tyrosine phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, EGF stimulation of A431 cells resulted in strong tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type SOCS3 (top panel, lanes 4–6), whereas EGF-induced phosphorylation of SOCS3 Y204F, Y221F was barely detectable (lanes 7–9). Interestingly, phosphorylation of wild-type SOCS3 resulted in a marked decrease in SOCS3 protein levels, but protein levels of the phosphorylation mutant remained unchanged after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B, bottom panel, lanes 4–6 and 7–9). To determine the half-life of SOCS3 in the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states, we stably expressed SOCS3 in a murine B cell line, 1881. These cells were treated with cycloheximide in the absence or presence of pervanadate to induce SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1C, the half-life of unphosphorylated SOCS3 in this experiment was 8 h, whereas the half-life of phosphorylated SOCS3 was ∼4 h. Significant amounts of unphosphorylated SOCS3 were detectable at 6 and 8 h following cycloheximide treatment. In pervanadate-treated cells, however, SOCS3 protein was barely detectable 6 h following cycloheximide treatment, and no SOCS3 was present at the 8-h time point. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 in the conserved SOCS box region results in protein destabilization and accelerated degradation. We next examined the half-life of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated SOCS3 in pulse-chase experiments. COS7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type or Y204F,Y221F SOCS3 in combination with wild-type or kinase-inactive (FF) Jak2 catalytic domain (JH1) constructs. After [35S]cysteine-methionine labeling, the cells were lysed at time points from 0–2 h post-chase, and SOCS3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the half-life of SOCS3, phosphorylated by the active Jak2 JH1 domain, was ∼15–30 min (Fig. 2A). In contrast, wild-type SOCS3 co-expressed with the catalytically inactive Jak2 mutant was significantly more stable than phospho-SOCS3 (half-life of 60 min; Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation-deficient Y204F,Y221F SOCS3 mutant had a half-life of >90 min (Fig. 2C), eve"
https://openalex.org/W2025264695,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) have been implicated in regulation of T-cell activation and cytokine-mediated differentiation of T-helper cells. In this study we have characterized the pattern of SOCS expression in naïve and activated primary T-helper cells, examined whether expression of SOCS genes is regulated by cytokine or T-cell receptor signaling, and analyzed the function of SOCS in differentiated T-cells. We show that SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, CIS (cytokine-induced SH2 protein) genes are constitutively expressed in naïve T-helper cells, with SOCS3 being the most abundant. Antigen stimulation of naïve T-helper cells down-regulates SOCS3 expression and concomitantly up-regulates SOCS1, SOCS2, and CIS gene transcription, suggesting that SOCS genes are regulated differentially by T-cell activation. Down-regulation of SOCS3 expression is subsequently followed by gradual increase in SOCS3 level and corresponding decline in interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion. In fact, SOCS3 mRNA levels are inversely correlated with the amount of IL-2 secretion and proliferative responses of differentiating T-helper cells, suggesting mutually antagonistic effects of SOCS3 and IL-2 and feedback regulation of T-cell activation by SOCS3. Furthermore, the degree of SOCS3 inhibition is antigen concentration-dependent and is mediated in part by growth factor independence-1, a T-cell transcription factor that regulates S-phase entry in T-cells. Forced overexpression of SOCS3 inhibits proliferation of T-helper cells, whereas depletion of endogenous SOCS3 by antisense SOCS3 cDNA enhances T-cell receptor- and cytokineinduced proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest a role for SOCS3 in maintaining T-helper cells in a quiescent state. Transient inhibition of SOCS3 by antigen stimulation may therefore be essential in allowing activation of resting T-cells. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) have been implicated in regulation of T-cell activation and cytokine-mediated differentiation of T-helper cells. In this study we have characterized the pattern of SOCS expression in naïve and activated primary T-helper cells, examined whether expression of SOCS genes is regulated by cytokine or T-cell receptor signaling, and analyzed the function of SOCS in differentiated T-cells. We show that SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, CIS (cytokine-induced SH2 protein) genes are constitutively expressed in naïve T-helper cells, with SOCS3 being the most abundant. Antigen stimulation of naïve T-helper cells down-regulates SOCS3 expression and concomitantly up-regulates SOCS1, SOCS2, and CIS gene transcription, suggesting that SOCS genes are regulated differentially by T-cell activation. Down-regulation of SOCS3 expression is subsequently followed by gradual increase in SOCS3 level and corresponding decline in interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion.

Transient inhibition of SOCS3 by antigen stimulation may therefore be essential in allowing activation of resting T-cells.

Th1 cells predominantly secrete interferon γ (IFNγ) and lymphotoxin (tumor necrosis factor β) and induce delayed type hypersensitivity responses whereas Th2 cells produce mainly IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and promote humoral responses (1Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 451-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Uncontrolled activation of naïve T-helper cells can lead to exaggerated Th1 or Th2 responses and may predispose the host to autoimmune or allergic diseases, respectively (1Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 451-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding factors that regulate naïve T-helper cell activation has implications for development of more effective vaccines, as well as immune modulation therapies against allograft rejection and autoimmune and allergic diseases (2Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 451-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Although factors such as the dose of the stimulating Ag and nature of the antigen presenting cell (APC) clearly play important roles in inducing the quiescent naïve T-helper cells to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle, progression through the cycle in response to cytokines and growth factors such as IL-2 is under stringent regulation. Mechanisms involved in this regulation include negative regulatory receptors (CTLA-4 and FAS), cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins (Csk, SHP-1, and SHIP-2) (3Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A.

SOCS proteins are of particular interest because of their critical roles in regulating cytokine and growth factor signaling (6Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Rothman P. Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Recent studies showing that SOCS proteins interact with proteins that play critical roles in T-cell activation (e.g. ZAP70, Gfi-1, and calcineurin) suggest that they may play a role in the regulation of essential aspects of the T-helper cell activation program. SOCS are a newly described family of intracellular cytokine-inducible negative feedback regulators that target cytokine receptors and cytoplasmic signaling adaptor molecules (6Chen X.P. Losman J.A.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The family is comprised of eight members characterized by the presence of an Src homology 2 domain and a carboxyl-terminal conserved domain called the SOCS box (8Kile B.T.

In addition to functioning in a classical feed back regulatory loop, SOCS proteins can also inhibit responses to cytokines that are different from those that induce their expression. Their inhibitory effects derive from direct interaction of the SOCS proteins with cytokine receptors and/or Janus kinases, thereby preventing recruitment of signal transducers and activators of transcription to the signaling complex (11Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 12Narazaki M.

SOCS proteins also regulate protein turnover by targeting proteins for polyubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation (8Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M.

Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) we showed that differentiation of naïve T-helper into mature Ag-specific Th1 or Th2 phenotype is associated with preferential expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, respectively. In this study, we sought to determine whether transcription of SOCS genes is regulated by TCR in primary responses of naïve T-helper cells. We show that SOCS genes are constitutively expressed in naïve cells and differentially regulated by T-cell activation. An early event in the activation of naïve T-helper cell is a transient down-regulation of SOCS3, and the degree of SOCS3 inhibition is inversely correlated with the levels of T-cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion. We further show that the transient down-regulation of SOCS3 may be mediated in part by increased expression of Gfi-1, a positive regulator of T-cell proliferation, and a suppressor of SOCS genes transcription (19Karsunky H. Mende I. Schmidt T. Moroy T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Jegalian A.G. Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2345-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SOCS3 in Th2 cells inhibits T-cell proliferation whereas depletion of endogenous SOCS3 enhances proliferation. These results suggest that SOCS3 may function in concert with other proteins to maintain quiescent state in lymphocytes, and transient inhibition of SOCS3 expression may therefore be essential to allow resting T-cells to respond to growth signals and proliferate. Isolation and Functional Characterization of Naïve and Activated T-helper Cells—CD4+ T-cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific TCR transgenic mice (a gift from Dr. Mark Davis, Stanford University) by a combination of T-cell enrichment columns and magnetic sorting as described previously (17Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). By fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the cells were found to express high levels of CD62L (>95) and low levels of CD25 (<6%), features associated with naïve T-helper cell phenotype. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum and stimulated with 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μg/ml HEL (Sigma) in the presence of 10× irradiated syngeneic splenocytes as APC (Tho condition), or anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml). Stimulation under this condition results in down-regulation of surface CD62L, up-regulation of surface CD25, and IL-2 secretion, indicating that the Ag concentrations used induces T-helper cell activation and not anergy. For propagation under neutral condition (Thn) the Tho condition was supplemented with anti-IL-4 (10 μg/ml), anti-IFNγ (10 μg/ml), and anti-IL-12 (10 μg/ml) Abs (Pharmingen). The D10.G4.1 Th2 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 pg/ml IL-1α (R & D Systems), 10% rat T-STIM factor with concanavalin A (BD Biosciences) as recommended. Cells (2 × 105cells/ml) were stimulated in anti-CD3 Ab-coated T-cell activation plate (BD Biosciences) plus anti-CD28 Ab (5 μg/ml). Cytokine Measurements—Supernatants collected after 48 or 96 h of stimulation of naïve T-helper cells with HEL and APC were assayed for cytokine secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using kits from Endogen (Woburn, MA). Proliferation Assay—Lymphocyte proliferation assay was performed as detailed elsewhere (21Kim S.J. Zhang M. Vistica B.P. Chan C.C. Shen D.F. Wawrousek E.F. Gery I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 758-765PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated CD4+ cells or Th2 D10.G4.1 line cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with HEL (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μg/ml) or anti-CD3/CD28 Abs in the presence of 10× irradiated APC. The proliferation of the D10.G4.1 cells was performed in medium containing 1% rat T-STIM. After 2 or 4 d, the cultures were pulsed with 3H-thymidine (0.5 μCi/10 μl/well) for 12 additional hours. The presented data are mean ΔCPM ± S.E. of responses of five replicate cultures. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from lymphocytes as recommended for the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). All RNA samples were digested with RNase-free DNase 1 (Invitrogen) for 30 min and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and Northern blot analysis was performed with 20 μg of RNA as described (17Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The integrity and comparability of RNA preparations were verified by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis; comparable amounts of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs were detected for all the RNA preparations used. Mouse SOCS1 and SOCS3 cDNAs used as hybridization probes were kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Hilton (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia) and Dr. Howard Young (National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). RT-PCR Analysis—RNA isolation and first strand cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (22Egwuagu C.E. Sztein J. Mahdi R.M. Li W. Chao-Chan C. Smith J.A. Charukamnoetkanok P. Chepelinsky A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 510-517PubMed Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR amplification are as follows: for β-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′ and 5′-TCTTTGCCAATAGTGATGACTTGGC-3′; for SOCS3′, 5′-TGCGCCATGGTCACCCACA GCAAGTTT-3′ and 5′-GCTCCTTAAAGTGGAGCATCATACTGA-3′; for Gfi-1, 5′-CTGCTAC AAGAGGAGGCATCACCTCTTA-3′ and 5′-GGAAGCACAGAACACAGGCTCTAGCTAT-3′; for p27kip1, 5′-ATGTCAAACGTGCGGGTGTCTAACG-3′ and 5′-ACCGTCTGAGACATTTTC-3′; for CD4, 5′-TGTGAGCTGGAGAACCGGAAACAGG-3′ and 5′-CATCTTGGGAGAGGTAG GTCCCATCAC-3′. Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. After the 30th cycle the samples were subjected to a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. First strand cDNA synthesis containing each mRNA sample but no reverse transcriptase was performed to control for possible DNA contamination of mRNAs used as target for PCR amplification. PCR amplified fragments were fractionated on 1 or 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. For SOCS3 and CD4, 10 μm digoxigenin-11–2′-deoxy-uridine-5-triphosphate (Roche Applied Science) was added to the PCR reaction, and the fractionated agarose gels were transferred onto nylon membranes. Amplification products were detected by using anti-digoxigenin-AP conjugate and chemiluminescence substrate, CDP-Star (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—First strand cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously (17Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A negative control reaction without reverse transcriptase was performed for each RNA sample, and RNA samples were normalized to 18 S rRNA using Taqman ribosomal RNA control reagents kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7700 (Applied Biosystems) or ICycler iQ real time PCR sequence detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) as described previously with the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: for SOCS1, 5′-ACCTTCTTGGTGCGCGAC-3′ and 5′-AAGCCATCTTCACGCTGAGC-3′; for SOCS2, 5′-GGTTGCCGGAGGAACAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCCTCTTTTAATTTCTCTTTGGC-3′; for SOCS3, 5′-CCTTCAGCTCCAAAAGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTCCTGCAGCTTGCG-3′; for CIS, 5′-CCAGCCATGCAGCCCTTA-3′ and 5′-CGTCTTGGCTATGCACAGCA-3′. For β-actin, 5′-CAAGTCATCACTATTGGCAACGA-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGA-3′. The fluorogenic probes used for hybridization are as follows: for SOCS1, 6FAM-TCGCCAACGGAACTGCTTCTTCG-TAMRA; for SOCS2, 6FAM-CGCGTCTGGCGAAAGCCCTG-TAMRA; for SOCS3, 6FAM-CCAGCTGGTGGTGAACGCCGT-TAMRA; for CIS, 6FAM-CCCAGAGGAAGTGACAGAGGAGACCCC-TAMRA; for β-actin, 6FAM-CGGTTCCGATGCCCTGAGGCTC-TAMRA. SOCS mRNA levels are presented as SOCS copies/cell and were calculated by extrapolation from standard curves generated using SOCS plasmid cDNAs as described (17Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, or CIS plasmid cDNA was purified by two sequential cesium chloride banding, and triplicate samples of 10-fold serial dilutions of cDNA were used to construct the standard curves. Standard curves generated from the SOCS cDNA dilution series in the real-time PCR analyses presented in this study showed excellent linearity indicating a precise, quantitative relationship between cDNA copy number and fluorescence signal intensity within the dynamic range of the assay. Generation of T-helper Cell Lines Overexpressing Sense or Antisense SOCS3 cDNA—Sense and antisense mouse SOCS3 cDNA fragments flanked by BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were generated from pEF-FLAG-1/SOCS3 plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Hilton (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia) and Dr. Howard Young (National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) by PCR amplification using primer set 1 (5′-CCCGGATCCATGGTCACCCACAGCAAGTTTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCTTAAAGTGGAGCATCATACTGATCC-3′) for SOCS3 and primer set 2 (5′-CCCGAATTCATGGTCACCCACAGCAAGTTTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGATCCTTAAAGTGGAGCATCATACTGATCC-3′) for the antisense SOCS3 construct. The fragments were directionally cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBabe-Puro vector kindly provided by Keith W. C. Peden (Laboratory of Retrovirus Research, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD), and the sequence was verified by double stranded DNA sequencing (ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). For transfection, plasmid cDNAs were prepared by two cycles of CsCl banding. Fifty micrograms of pBabe (empty vector control), pBabe/SOCS3, or pBabe/antisense SOCS3 cDNA in culture medium (400 μl) containing 2 × 107/ml D10.G4.1 Th2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were electroporated at 120 V, 0.2 cm of gap for 20 ms using a square wave electroporator (Genetronics Inc.; San Diego, CA). Stable transfectants were established by selection in 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Western Blotting Analyses—Preparation of whole cell lysates and immunodetection were performed as described (17Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M. Kim S.J. Gery I. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (40 μg/lane) were fractionated on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and anti-SOCS1, SOCS3, Gfi-1, or actin Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as probes. Preimmune serum was used in parallel as controls, and signals were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary F(ab′)2 Ab (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Plasmids used for transfection are as follows: pGL3-basic (empty vector) reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), mouse SOCS3 promoter sequences ligated to the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-basic-SOCS3), Gfi-1 cDNA expression vector (pcDNA3.1-Gfi-1), and pRL-TK (Promega), which encodes Renilla luciferase. pGL3-SOCS3 promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Melmed, (Department of Medicine, UCLA) (23Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and pcDNA-Gfi-1 is the full-length mouse Gfi-1 cDNA cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of mammalian expression vector, pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The D10.G4.1 Th2 cells (0.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were co-transfected with pGL3-SOCS3 (1 μg/ml), pcDNA3.1-Gfi-1 (1 μg/ml), and pRL-TK (0.2 μg/ml) using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities of the cell lysates were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) with the Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The lysates were also evaluated for Gfi-1 gene expression by Western blot analysis. Renilla luciferase activities were used for internal sample normalization, and the indicated relative reporter activities take into account normalized transfection efficiency. SOCS Genes Are Regulated Differentially by T-helper Cell Activation—We examined effects of TCR signaling on regulation of SOCS gene expression in naïve and activated T-helper cells from HEL TCR transgenic (3A9) mice. We show here by real-time quantitative 5′-nuclease fluorogenic RT-PCR analysis that SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, and CIS mRNAs are constitutively expressed in naïve T-helper cells (Fig. 1A, see Day 0), with SOCS3 being the most abundant SOCS member detected (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of the cells for 48 h with HEL (1.0 μg/ml) and APC induces a precipitous drop in SOCS3 mRNA level, whereas substantial increases are observed in the levels of SOCS1, SOCS2, and CIS mRNA transcripts (Fig. 1A). Analysis of cytokine secretion by these cells reveals a dramatic increase in IL-2 secretion, with minimal or no secretion of IFNγ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 (data not shown) at this time point. By day 4 of antigenic stimulation, we begin to observe a steady increase of SOCS3 expression (Fig. 1), and this coincides with a sharp decline in IL-2 (data not shown). The levels of other SOCS members either remain essentially the same (SOCS1 and SOCS2) or experience a modest reduction (CIS) (Fig. 1A), and these temporal changes in the pattern of SOCS expression are accompanied by increases in the levels of secreted IFNγ, IL-5, and IL-10 (data not shown). Comparison of the levels of SOCS expression in naïve cells to those of activated T-helper cells reveals substantial increases in SOCS1 and SOCS2 expression, as well as a modest increase in CIS level (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there is a net diminution in SOCS3 mRNA level (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained from four independent Agprimed naïve T-helper cell experiments. Because of the very high sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR assay, the observed inhibition of SOCS3 and changes in the pattern of SOCS genes expression may merely reflect events occurring in very few cells in our cultures. We therefore verified these results by a less sensitive technique that detects biologically relevant changes in gene expression. As indicated on the Northern blot autoradiogram (Fig. 1C), we detect SOCS3 expression in naïve T-helper cells but not in the cells stimulated with Ag for 48 h. On the other hand, we do not detect significant SOCS1 expression in naïve T-helper cells by this method, but do so after 48 h stimulation (Fig. 1C). Down-regulation of SOCS3 expression following Ag stimulation has been observed in three separate Northern blot experiments and conventional RT-PCR assays (Fig. 1D), clearly recapitulating our real-time quantitative RT-PCR and data. To examine whether the transient inhibition of SOCS3 is mediated by cytokine signaling pathways activated by polarizing cytokines that are secreted by differentiating T-helper cells and APCs, we stimulated naïve cells for 48 h under non-polarizing (Tho) or neutral (Thn) condition. Regardless of whether exogenous neutralizing antibodies are absent (Tho) or present in the culture (Thn; anti-IL-4, anti-IL-12, anti-IFNγ Abs) we observe significant reduction in SOCS3 level following antigenic stimulation, suggesting that neither IL-4, IL-12, nor IFNγ is directly involved in the transient repression of SOCS3 expression (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results indicate that SOCS genes are differentially regulated in Ag-primed T-helper cells. In contrast to other SOCS members, SOCS3 mRNA is transiently down-regulated in response to T-cell activation, and the repression of SOCS3 expression is not mediated by Th1 or Th2 polarizing cytokines. The Degree of SOCS3 Repression Is Ag Dose-dependent and Correlates with T-helper Cell Proliferative Responses—To determine whether the down-regulation of SOCS3 expression is induced by TCR-mediated signals, we stimulated naïve cells with various concentrations of the HEL in the presence of APC and analyzed their effects on SOCS3, as well as SOCS1 expression, by real-time RT-PCR. As shown on Fig. 2A, there is a substantial increase in the SOCS1 mRNA level following antigenic stimulation with each of the HEL concentrations used (Fig. 2A). In contrast to SOCS1, we observe a dramatic decrease in SOCS3 mRNA levels of cells stimulated for 2 days, and diminution in the SOCS3 mRNA levels is highly dependent on the Ag dose, being most striking at the higher Ag concentrations (Fig. 2A). However, in cells stimulated for 4 days we observe an increase in SOCS3 transcripts, suggesting that the inhibition of SOCS3 expression is transient and dependent on both the strength and duration of TCR signaling. These results have also been verified by three independent Northern blot analyses in which stimulation of naïve T-helper cells at the higher concentrations of HEL (1.0 or 10.0 μg/ml) induced transient inhibition of SOCS3 (Fig. 2B). We further show that SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins are constitutively expressed in naïve Th cells (Fig. 2C, lane 1) and that antigenic stimulation induces a transient inhibition of SOCS3 but not SOCS1 (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Thus, in concert with our Northern and RT-PCR results (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, A and B), the antigen dose-dependent alterations in SOCS mRNA levels are also reflected in protein levels (Fig. 2C). Detection of transient repression of SOCS3 expression by the rather insensitive Northern blot assay and by Western blotting suggests that alterations in SOCS3 mRNA levels is a functionally relevant event during naïve T-helper cell stimulation. To study the role of alterations in SOCS3 mRNA levels in T-helper cell activation, we examined whether changes in the level of IL-2 production or in T-cell proliferative response correlate temporally with the degree of SOCS3 repression following stimulation of naïve Th cells with 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μg/ml HEL in the presence of APC. At each time point examined we observe a positive correlation between the Ag dose and proliferative response (Fig. 2D) or ability to produce IL-2 (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, marked increases in proliferative responses and IL-2 production occur within the narrow window (day 2) that coincides temporally with the transient inhibition of SOCS3 expression (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, A and B). By day 4 and thereafter, when SOCS3 and other SOCS members are maintained at relatively high levels, the cells have equilibrated to lower proliferative rates. Moreover, we observe very little or no change in the"
https://openalex.org/W2072343800,"The membrane water channel aquaporin 5 (AQP5) plays an important role in transporting water across the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium and the epithelia of submucosal glands in the upper airway and nasopharynx. It is thus a potentially important target for modulating the fluid content of upper airway and nasopharyngeal secretions in disorders such as cystic fibrosis. Here, we have used an in vitro system to identify a molecular mechanism through which transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of AQP5 is accomplished. In a murine lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12), the addition of chlorophenylthio-cAMP (cpt-cAMP) causes a 4-fold increase in AQP5 mRNA and protein levels and induces translocation of AQP5 to the apical plasma membrane. Treatment with forskolin and isoproternol also caused similar increases in AQP5 expression both in vitro and in mouse lung tissue slices. The addition of actinomycin D abolished the cAMP-mediated increase in AQP5 mRNA and showed that there was no increase in the half-life of AQP5 mRNA, and inhibition of protein kinase A by H-89 blocked the cpt-cAMP-mediated increase of AQP5. Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide blocked the cpt-cAMP-mediated increase of AQP5 mRNA, indicating that de novo protein synthesis is essential for increased AQP5 transcription. Immunofluorescent micrographs of cells treated with cpt-cAMP showed a significantly stronger AQP5 signal at the plasma membrane as compared with untreated cells. These results show that cAMP regulates AQP5 at multiple levels, by increasing synthesis of AQP5 mRNA and by triggering translocation of AQP5 to the plasma membrane.

Targeted deletion of AQP5 in mice results in lethality to 75% of the AQP5–/– embryos (1Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

In the one of four AQP5–/– embryos that survive to adulthood, absence of AQP5 results in a 10-fold decrease in osmotic water permeability of the airspace-capillary barrier (3Bai C. Fukuda N. Song Y. Ma T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Ma T. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), increased bronchoconstriction of the airways in response to cholinergic agonists (5Krane C. Fortner C. Hand A. McGraw D. Lorenz J. Wert S. Towne J. Paul R. Whitsett J. Menon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14114-14119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and greatly reduced membrane water permeability in the epithelia of the submucosal glands of the upper airway and nasopharynx (6Song Y. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41288-41292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Indeed, the crucial role played by AQP5 as the rate-limiting barrier to water movement in the serous epithelial cells of submucosal glands has prompted speculation that modulation of the activity of AQP5 may provide a novel modality for treatment of infections that cause excessive fluid secretion in the upper airway and nasopharynx or provide a potential target for pharmacological intervention in diseases such as cystic fibrosis where gland secretions have decreased fluid content (6Song Y. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41288-41292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In humans, deficiencies in proper expression or localization of AQP5 have also been associated with defects in water handling: for example, mutations in AQP5 that result in incorrect subcellular localization of the channel in the apical plasma membrane have been detected in individuals with Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that includes decreased salivary and lachrymal secretions (7Steinfeld S. Cogan E. King L.S. Agre P. Kiss R. Delporte C. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Tsubota K. Hirai S. King L.S. Agre P. Ishida N. Lancet. 2001; 357: 688-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Sufficient expression and proper subcellular targeting of AQP5 channels are therefore necessary for normal physiological function. Thus, the identification of molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of AQP5 in lung epithelia will likely yield useful insights into the physiological properties of tissue and organ systems in which AQP5 is expressed. Several lines of evidence prompted us to investigate the possibility that one of the mechanisms regulating AQP5 expression might involve cAMP. It has been shown previously that AQP2, the major renal water channel, is regulated by a vasopressin/cAMP pathway in the collecting duct of the kidney. Stimulation of the vasopressin V2-receptor by arginine-vasopressin results in increased AQP2 mRNA levels (9Matsumura Y. Uchida S. Rai T. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 861-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increased translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane (10Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14800-14804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) via a cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway (11Dibas A.I. Mia A.J. Yorio T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Increased expression of AQP1 in Xenopus oocyte membranes in response to cAMP and vasopression has also been demonstrated (12Han Z. Patil R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and more recently, translocation of AQP8 to the plasma membrane of hepatocyte cell lines in response to cAMP has been reported (13Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M.C. Gradilone S.A. Splinter P. LaRusso N.F. Marinelli R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to identify molecular mechanisms that could regulate AQP5 expression. We developed an in vitro system in which the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 mRNA and protein levels could be studied. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to study the effect of cpt-cAMP on subcellular distribution of AQP5 protein. The time course for induction of both AQP5 mRNA and protein expression was determined, and the dose response to different concentrations of cpt-cAMP was studied. The effect of adding inhibitors of RNA transcription, protein synthesis, or phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C on the expression of AQP5 was investigated, as was the effect of forskolin and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproternol. Furthermore, we show that the addition of forskolin to freshly excised slices of mouse lung results in an increased level of AQP5 protein, corroborating the observations in vitro. These findings demonstrate a potentially important role for cAMP in regulating AQP5 at multiple levels and identify components of a molecular mechanism by which this membrane channel is regulated in lung epithelial cells. Experimental Reagents—cpt-cAMP, actinomycin D (ActD), forskolin, and isoproterenol (ISO) were obtained from Sigma. Dihydrochloride (H-89) and cycloheximide were obtained from Calbiochem. ActD, forskolin, and H-89 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). ISO was dissolved in 10–4ml-ascorbic acid. Cycloheximide was dissolved in 70% ethanol, and others were dissolved in double distilled water (ddH2O). RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics-antimycotics were obtained from Invitrogen. The antibody to β-actin was an anti-mouse monoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. Anti-mouse AQP5 polyclonal antibody (LL639, Lofstrand Labratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the mouse AQP5 carboxyl terminus and affinity-purified on a SulfoLink column (Pierce) conjugated with the immunizing peptide (14Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protein assay reagent, 4–15% linear gradient ready gel, and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were purchased from Bio-Rad. Biotin-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody was obtained from Calbiochem, and Cy-2-conjugated streptavidin was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cell Culture—MLE-12 cells were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) (15Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). MLE-12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (with l-glutamine) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics-antimycotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cultures were fed with fresh medium two times weekly. cpt-cAMP and cAMP Activator Treatment—Approximately 48 h before cpt-cAMP, forskolin, and ISO treatments, cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well and were serum-starved 24 h before the treatments by replacing the medium with RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal bovine serum as described by Towne et al. (16Towne J.E. Krane C.M. Bachurski C.J. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18657-18664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After 24 h of starvation, the medium was replaced with normal growth medium, and different concentrations of cpt-cAMP, forskolin, or ISO were added. Cells were then maintained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Every experiment was repeated in its entirety at least twice in either duplicate or triplicate. Actinomycin D Treatment—To determine the stability of AQP5 mRNA with or without cpt-cAMP, MLE-12 cells were treated for 4 h with 200 μm cpt-cAMP, and then 10 μg/ml ActD was added. For the inhibition of transcription, 10 μg/ml ActD was added to the culture medium for 30 min before adding 200 μm cpt-cAMP. Cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points. Cycloheximide and H-89 Treatment—To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with 500 μg/ml cycloheximide, a dose sufficient to block protein synthesis by >98% (17Muller-Taubenberger A. Hagmann J. Noegel A. Gerisch G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar), for 30 min before adding cpt-cAMP. To inhibit PKA activity, H-89 (30 μm) was added to the culture medium for 30 min prior to the addition of cpt-cAMP. Total RNA and protein were isolated from the cells at the indicated times. Total Protein Preparation and Protein Assay—Following each of the treatments described above, medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 500 μl of ice-cold isolation buffer (pH 7.6), containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to each well for three successive freezing and thawing cycles in a dry ice/ethanol bath and 37 °C water bath. Total protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad CB-250 dye binding technique according to the modifications of Stoscheck (18Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Western Blot Analysis—6 μg of total proteins was loaded per well in a 4–15% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1% blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) followed by incubation overnight at room temperature with anti-AQP5 antibody at a dilution of 0.25 μg/ml and anti-β-actin antibody at a dilution of 1:50,000 in 0.5% blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were incubated for1hat room temperature in 0.5% blocking solution. Immunoreactivity was detected by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). The protein in each band was quantified by using an AlphaImager 2000 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Results are expressed as the ratio of AQP5/β-actin. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from MLE-12 cells using TriReagent solution (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was solubilized in Formazol (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), and RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. 10 μg total RNA of each sample was size-fractionated in 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane as described (20Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing were performed as described by Towne et al. (20Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). After probing with AQP5, the membranes were stripped in boiling 0.5% SDS for 30 min and were reprobed with p32-labeled L32, the gene encoded a ribosomal protein, as a control for equal loading of mRNA per well. The generation of mouse AQP5 and L32 probes was described previously (20Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The density of bands from Northern blots probed with either AQP5 or L32 was quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager, and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorimaging results are reported as volume-integrated value. mRNA values are reported as the AQP5/L32 ratio for each sample. Immunofluorescence Studies—MLE-12 cells were seeded onto 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 3 × 104 cells/well in 3% fetal bovine serum/RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Then cells were starved for 24 h by replacing the medium with 1% fetal bovine serum. After starving, the culture medium was replaced by normal growth medium (3% fetal bovine serum), and 200 μm cpt-cAMP was added to the medium. Control wells were only treated with vehicle (ddH2O). 24 h later, cells were fixed for 10 min with 5% neutral buffered formalin and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 3 min. After blocking with 5% normal sheep serum, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Unbound antibody was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin, and then cells were incubated for 45 min with biotin-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) at 37 °C. Following washing, cells were incubated with Cy-2-conjugated Streptavidin (1:150 dilution) for 20 min. Finally, the cells were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong antifade mounting solution (Molecular Probes). The samples were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 upright confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a C-Apochromat ×63, 1.2 water immersion objective. Ex Vivo Studies on Excised Mouse Lung—Approximately 50 mg of lung tissue was excised from euthanized C57/Black 6 mice, rinsed in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and placed in a tissue culture dish containing serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. A bolus of forskolin dissolved in Me2SO was added so that the final concentration of forskolin was 10 μg/ml in medium. The tissue was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, after which it was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for total cellular protein as described earlier. cpt-cAMP Increases AQP5 Protein Expression in MLE-12 Cells—The MLE-12 murine lung epithelial cell line (15Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) is a well characterized cell model for the expression and regulation of epithelial membrane proteins and was therefore chosen to investigate the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 expression. To examine whether the response to cpt-cAMP was in a dose-dependent manner, MLE-12 cells were treated with 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μm cpt-cAMP for 48 h, respectively. Samples were then harvested, and total protein was prepared for immunoblot analysis. AQP5 protein levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with 20–200 μm cpt-cAMP (Fig. 1). AQP5 protein was increased 2- and 4-fold in response to 20 and 50 μm cpt-cAMP as compared with untreated control, and since the physiological range of cAMP concentration in mammals is 0.1–50 μm (21Antoni F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 103-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), our findings suggest a potential physiological regulatory mechanism for AQP5. The lower limit for detection of the cpt-cAMP effect was 20 μm, and the maximal induction of AQP5 (5-fold) was attained at a cpt-cAMP concentration of 200 μm in the medium. To detect the maximal effect, 200 μm cpt-cAMP was used for all subsequent experiments. To examine the time course of the cpt-cAMP effect on AQP5 protein levels, MLE-12 cells were treated with 200 μm cpt-cAMP for 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. A 2-fold increase in AQP5 protein was seen 3 h after treatment with cpt-cAMP, and the effect was maximal (5-fold increase) at 48 h (Fig. 2). Beyond 48 h (72 and 96 h), a decrease in the cpt-cAMP effect (Fig. 2) was observed, but this decrease may be more difficult to interpret, possibly due to cellular adaptation to prolonged exposure to cAMP. cpt-cAMP Increases AQP5 mRNA Level in MLE-12 Cells—To analyze the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 mRNA expression, MLE-12 cells were treated with 200 μm cpt-cAMP for 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. Total RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 3). AQP5 mRNA level was increased 1.5-fold after 1 h of treatment. After 3 or 6 h treatment, AQP5 mRNA level was increased 3-fold as compared with untreated controls. Beyond 24 h, the trend of increasing AQP5 mRNA by cpt-cAMP was saturated, but the levels were still higher than controls. The Increase of AQP5 mRNA Expression by cpt-cAMP Is Not Due to an Increase in mRNA Stability—To determine whether the increased AQP5 mRNA level is due to a decrease of AQP5 mRNA degradation, the stability of AQP5 mRNA was measured in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor ActD. Cells were treated with 200 μm cpt-cAMP or vehicle for 4 h, after which 10 μg/ml ActD was added. Total RNA was isolated at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after the addition of ActD and analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 4). With AQP5 transcription blocked by actinomycin D, the levels of mRNA both with or without cpt-cAMP were decreased as compared with mRNA from the 0 h time point. The mRNA in the cpt-cAMP-treated group did not show lower turnover (which would be reflected in a decreased slope) than in the cpt-cAMP-untreated controls. The degradation of cpt-cAMP-treated mRNA showed a slight, but not statistically significant, increased turnover as compared with the samples that were not treated with cpt-cAMP, showing that increased AQP5 mRNA level in response to cpt-cAMP is not due to an increase in AQP5 mRNA stability. The cpt-cAMP-induced Increase in AQP5 mRNA Levels Is Due to Increased Transcription—Based on the observation that cpt-cAMP did not affect the stability of AQP5 mRNA, we hypothesized that the increased AQP5 mRNA by cpt-cAMP was due to increased transcription of the AQP5 gene. To test this hypothesis, MLE-12 cells were first treated with either ActD (10 μg/ml) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min to inhibit transcription and then with 200 μm cpt-cAMP for 3 h. RNA prepared from these cells was analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 5). In the absence of ActD, cpt-cAMP treatment increased AQP5 mRNA levels about 4–5-fold. Pretreatment with actinomycin D completely blocked the ability of cpt-cAMP to increase AQP5 mRNA. This shows that the increased level of AQP5 mRNA in response to treatment of cpt-cAMP is principally due to increased transcription of the AQP5 gene. Protein Kinase A Inhibitor H-89 Blocks the cpt-cAMP-mediated Increase in AQP5 in Both mRNA and Protein Levels—To determine whether the protein kinase A activity is required for the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 expression, a protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 was used (22Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with H-89 (30 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min before the addition of 200 μm cpt-cAMP. 6 h and 24 h later, cells were harvested for total RNA and protein. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6, A and B) showed that pretreatment with H-89 inhibited about 60% of the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 mRNA. Western blot analysis showed that (Fig. 6, C and D) H-89 completely abolished the effect of cpt-cAMP on increased expression of AQP5 protein. Although H-89 did not completely block the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 at mRNA level, it totally abolished the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 at protein level, indicating that the activity of protein kinase A affects the expression of AQP5 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The action of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 expression is due to increasing the activity of protein kinase A. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not show any effect on the expression of AQP5 protein (data not shown), suggesting that protein kinase C may not be involved in the regulation of AQP5 in lung epithelial cells. The Effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 mRNA Expression Depends on de Novo Protein Synthesis—To investigate whether the new synthesized nuclear factors are required for the effect of cpt-cAMP on the transcription of the AQP5 gene, MLE-12 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (500 μg/ml) for 30 min to inhibit protein synthesis, and 200 μm cpt-cAMP was added. Total RNA was isolated at two time points, 3 or 6 h, after the addition of cpt-cAMP. The expression of AQP5 mRNA detected by Northern blotting (Fig. 7, A and B) showed that cycloheximide inhibited about 70% of the increase of AQP5 mRNA induced by cpt-cAMP in both 3 and 6 h treatments. Cycloheximide alone did not affect the expression of AQP5 mRNA (Fig. 7B) and protein (Fig. 7D). Therefore, the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 requires de novo protein synthesis to stimulate the transcription of the AQP5 gene. The Effect of cpt-cAMP on the Distribution of AQP5 Protein— Since AQP5 has a protein kinase A-binding site in loop D, which is similar in AQP2 (23King L.S. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 619-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that cAMP might influence the distribution of AQP5 protein. To test this hypothesis in MLE-12 cells, immunofluorescence was employed. Cells were treated with 200 μm cpt-cAMP for 24 h, and then immunofluorescent staining was performed, and the samples were examined by a confocal microscope as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells treated with cpt-cAMP exhibited stronger staining of AQP5 in plasma membrane (Fig. 8B) as compared with control cells (Fig. 8A), indicating that AQP5 is translocated to the plasma membrane in response to cpt-cAMP. Both Forskolin and ISO Increase Expression of AQP5 Protein in MLE-12 Cells—Based on the observation that cpt-cAMP was found to increase levels of AQP5 mRNA and protein, we investigated whether an increase of endogenous cAMP stimulated by cAMP activators, such as forskolin and ISO, can also increase AQP5 expression. Forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase (21Antoni F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 103-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and ISO, which activates the adenylyl cyclase through β-adrenergic receptor coupling with G protein (24Bristow M.R. Hershberger R.E. Port J.D. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kaumann A.J. Hall J.A. Murray K.J. Wells F.C. Brown M.J. Eur. Heart J. 1989; 10: 29-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were chosen for these studies. Cells were either treated with forskolin at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml or treated with ISO at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μm. Total protein was prepared and analyzed by Western blots after 48 h. Our results, shown in Fig. 9, A and B, indicate that treatment with forskolin increased AQP5 protein levels 3–4-fold in a dose-dependent manner, and ISO induced a 2-fold increase in AQP5 protein level (Fig. 9, C and D). The expression of β2 adrenoreceptor in MLE-12 cells was confirmed by [125I]cyanopindolol binding assay (data not shown). The combined results from the forskolin and ISO treatments show that an increase of endogenous cAMP induces a similar effect as that elicited by cpt-cAMP, and furthermore, that agonist stimulation of known physiological circuits, such as the β2 adrenoreceptor pathway, are capable of modulating the expression of AQP5 in lung cells. Addition of Forskolin to Mouse Lung Tissue Slices ex Vivo Results in Increased Levels of AQP5 Protein—To determine whether the effects of cAMP on AQP5 that are observed in the MLE-12 cell line are recapitulated in lung tissue, we examined the effect of adding 10 μg/ml forskolin on freshly excised lung tissue slices. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 10, indicate that after incubation in medium containing forskolin for 24 h, the level of AQP5 protein was increased 2-fold, showing that the action of forskolin on AQP5 in the ex vivo lung corroborates its action on AQP5 in vitro. The objective of this study was to identify molecular signaling pathways that regulate the expression of AQP5 in epithelial cells of the lung. Our decision to first investigate mechanisms involving cAMP was prompted by considerable physiological and cell biological evidence showing that stimulation of the V2 vasopressin receptor in the kidney results in translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane via a cAMP mechanism (26Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T. Agre P. Knepper M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). We also noted that the original observation by King and Agre (23King L.S. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 619-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) of a PKA consensus sequence in a cytoplasmic loop of AQP5 at amino acid residues 153–156 (Arg-Arg-Thr-Ser) would likely be consistent with a cAMP mechanism for the regulation of AQP5. Using an in vitro system of mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12), we found that treatment with cpt-cAMP had two distinct effects on AQP5: first, it resulted in a 3-fold increase in AQP5 mRNA and a 5-fold increase in protein levels, and second, it resulted in a significant increase in the density of AQP5 channels in the plasma membrane, detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Our subsequent studies were directed at identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. cpt-cAMP increased AQP5 protein 5-fold in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). Although increased AQP5 levels were detected using as little as 20 μm cpt-cAMP, the maximal effect was observed at 200 μm cpt-cAMP in the cell culture medium. The concentrations of cpt-cAMP (10–50 μm) over which the effect on AQP5 is seen in MLE-12 cells suggests that the action of cpt-cAMP operates within the range of normal variation in cellular concentrations of cAMP. cpt-cAMP also increased AQP5 mRNA expression 3–5-fold (Figs. 3 and 5). As might be expected, the increased levels of APQ5 mRNA in response to cpt-cAMP were detectable somewhat earlier than protein. The maximal increase in AQP5 mRNA level was observed between 3 and 6 h after cpt-cAMP treatment, but the maximal increase in AQP5 protein (prepared from whole cell extracts) was seen only at 48 h, indicating that increased protein levels most likely resulted from translation of increased numbers of AQP5 mRNA transcripts. To determine whether increased numbers of AQP5 mRNA transcripts were the consequence of increased AQP5 transcription or increased stability of AQP5 mRNA, cells were incubated with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor, ActD, prior to stimulation with cpt-cAMP (Fig. 5). This completely abolished the effect of cpt-cAMP on the AQP5 mRNA (Fig. 5), indicating that the increase in AQP5 mRNA levels was a result of increased AQP5 gene transcription rather than a decrease in the turnover rate of AQP5 mRNA or increased stability of the mRNA transcript. Based on published reports that cAMP frequently regulates the transcription of target genes by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, thus modulating the affinity of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein for cAMP-responsive elements in the target gene (27Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), we asked whether the effect of cpt-cAMP on AQP5 expression involved PKA. We found that pretreatment of cells with H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, prior to the addition of cpt-cAMP totally abolished the increase in AQP5 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 6), indicating that the action of PKA is necessary for the transcriptional increase of AQP5 induced by cAMP, most likely through the phosphorylation of one or more transcription factors. To further dissect the pathway connecting the agonist, cpt-cAMP, with its transcriptional target, AQP5, we asked whether synthesis of transcriptional factors was required for the agonist-mediated increase in transcription of the target gene. Incubation of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prior to adding cpt-cAMP substantially blocked (by about 70%) the increase in AQP5 mRNA (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that de novo protein synthesis of specific transcriptional factor(s) is essential for the effect of cAMP on any aquaporin. To determine whether triggering an increase of endogenous cAMP evoked the same response in AQP5 as the addition of cpt-cAMP, we stimulated cellular adenylyl cyclase activity by the addition of either forskolin or the β-adrenergic agonist ISO. We found that the addition of forskolin (Fig. 9, A and B) and ISO (Fig. 9, C and D) resulted in an increased level of AQP5 protein, indicating that physiological circuits that are known to exist in the lung (24Bristow M.R. Hershberger R.E. Port J.D. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar) can be triggered by appropriate agonists to modulate AQP5 expression. To further investigate whether the effects seen in MLE-12 cells were corroborated in lung tissue, we added forskolin to freshly excised slices of mouse lung and examined its effect on AQP5 after 24 h of treatment. The data from this experiment, shown in Fig. 10, indicate that treatment with forskolin results in a 2-fold increase in AQP5 protein. Although the increase in AQP5 protein in lung tissue is less than the 5-fold increase observed in the MLE-12 cell line, and this is probably due to the heterogeneity of the cell types in the mouse lung, the data clearly demonstrate that stimulation of the cAMP pathway results in increased AQP5 both in vitro and ex vivo. One of the important cellular mechanisms by which membrane channels are rapidly mobilized consists of trafficking channel proteins from cellular reservoirs to the plasma membrane in response to appropriate stimuli. For example, it has been shown that water permeability in the renal collecting duct is primarily regulated by vasopressin-mediated translocation of the AQP2 water channel to the luminal plasma membrane in the epithelia of the collecting duct (11Dibas A.I. Mia A.J. Yorio T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T. Agre P. Knepper M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). To test whether cpt-cAMP triggered a similar translocation of AQP5 to the plasma membrane, we used immunofluorescence staining with AQP5 antibody to examine the localization of AQP5 in lung epithelial cells that were treated with 200 μm cpt-cAMP and untreated controls. The data clearly demonstrate that treatment with cpt-cAMP results in translocation of AQP5 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8). Although the staining did not unequivocally reveal whether the translocation of AQP5 was exclusively to the apical surface or to both apical and basolateral surfaces, we found that AQP5 in MLE-12 cells is detected predominantly in a punctate intracellular pattern and was not visibly detectable in the plasma membrane in untreated cells. However, treatment with cpt-cAMP resulted in a significant translocation of AQP5 from intracellular reservoirs, possibly subplasma membrane vescicles, to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8), indicating that a cAMP-triggered mechanism for translocation to the plasma membrane is apparently shared by both AQP5 (in the lung) and AQP2 in the renal collecting duct (29Lorenz D. Krylov A. Hahm D. Hagen V. Rosenthal W. Pohl P. Maric K. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30van Balkom B.W. Savelkoul P.J. Markovich D. Hofman E.

These findings may be particularly relevant to pharmacological approaches to treatment of hyperviscous secretions in cystic fibrosis because they reveal components of a molecular mechanism that can potentially regulate the activity of AQP5, which is the rate-limiting step in determining the fluid content of secretions from the submucosal glands of the upper airways and nasopharynx. We are grateful to Dr. Stephen B. Liggett for suggestions and help with the β2 adrenergic receptor assay, Drs. Vasily V Ivanenkov and Robert F. Hennigan for assistance with the immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, and Dr. Mark Wathelet for valuable suggestions."

The enzyme is also present under aerobic conditions, its amount is about one-third and its activity is only one-tenth of the values observed under anaerobic conditions. Nevertheless, its function in the presence of oxygen remained ignored. The data presented in this paper led us to propose that the enzyme has a protective role against oxidative stress. Our results indicated that cells deleted in adhE gene could not grow aerobically in minimal media, were extremely sensitive to oxidative stress and showed division defects.

This pleiotropic phenotype disappeared when the adhE gene was reintroduced into the defective strain. The purified enzyme was highly reactive with hydrogen peroxide (with a K i of 5 μm), causing inactivation due to a metal-catalyzed oxidation reaction. It is possible to prevent this reactivity to hydrogen peroxide by zinc, which can replace the iron atom at the catalytic site of AdhE. This can also be achieved by addition of ZnSO4 to cell cultures. In such conditions, addition of hydrogen peroxide resulted in reduced cell viability compared with that obtained without the Zn treatment.

Under anaerobic conditions Escherichia coli carries out mixed-acid fermentation of sugars. One of the major products is ethanol, which is synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A by two consecutive Fe2+ and NADH-dependent reductions, catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase E (AdhE) 1The abbreviations used are: AdhE, alcohol dehydrogenase E; AhpCF, alquil hydroperoxide reductase; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; LB, Luria broth; DNP, dinitrophenyl.1The abbreviations used are: AdhE, alcohol dehydrogenase E; AhpCF, alquil hydroperoxide reductase; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; LB, Luria broth; DNP, dinitrophenyl. (1Clark D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 63: 223-234Crossref Google Scholar). This enzyme, encoded by the adhE gene (2Goodlove P.E. Cunnigham P.R. Parker J. Clark D.P. Gene. 1989; 85: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), belongs to the group III Fe-activated dehydrogenases and shares a high degree of structural homology with other microbial alcohol dehydrogenases (3Reid M.F. Fewson C.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 13-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). AdhE is also known as pyruvate-formate lyase-deactivase because it converts the active radical form of pyruvate-formate lyase into the non-radical form (4Knappe J. Sawers G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 383-398Google Scholar, 5Kessler D. Leibrecht I. Knappe J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). AdhE is abundantly synthesized (about 3 × 104 copies per cell) during anaerobic growth on glucose and forms helical structures, called spirosomes, which are around 0.22 μm long and contain 40–60 AdhE molecules (6Kessler D. Herth W. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18073-18079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This structure has also been detected in Entamoeba hystolitica (7Espinosa A. Yan L. Zhang Z.

When E. coli cells are shifted from anaerobic to aerobic conditions, transcription of the adhE gene is reduced and maintained within 10% of the range found under anaerobiosis (12Chen Y.M. Lin E.C.C.

AdhE has been identified as one of the major targets when E. coli cells were submitted to hydrogen peroxide stress (17Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In fact, under aerobic conditions, AdhE has no assigned function, accounts for about 1% of total protein, and is inactivated by metal-catalyzed oxidation (18Membrillo-Hernández J. Echave P.

This apparent wastefulness prompted us to investigate why this enzyme has been maintained under aerobic conditions. Evidences about the relationship between AdhE and protection against oxidative stress are provided. Strains and Culture Conditions—The merodiploid strain E. coli ECL4000 (MC4100 adhE+ Φ(adhE-lacZ)) was used as the wild type parental strain (18Membrillo-Hernández J. Echave P. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J.

Esparza-Cerón M.A. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Membrillo-Hernández J. Lin E.C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4626-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An E. coli strain katG::tet (PEL1) was constructed by P1 transduction (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, N.

The DHB4 strain was a kind gift from J. Beckwith and was also used as a wild type strain (23Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

S. typhimurium LT2 was from ATCC (catalog number E23564) and Serratia marcescens was from Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo (Valencia, Spain, catalog number 846). Cells were grown at 30 °C either in Luria broth (LB) medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 0.5% tryptone) or minimal medium (64 mm K2HPO4, 34 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 10 μm CaCl2, and 1 μm FeSO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with one of the following carbon and energy sources: glucose (10 mm), glucuronate (10 mm), gluconate (10 mm), acetate (30 mm), succinate (15 mm), fucose (10 mm), manitol (10 mm), glycerol (20 mm), or casein acid hydrolysate (0.1% w/v). Solid media contained 1.5% Bacto-agar (Difco) in LB. Aerobic cultures of 10 ml were grown in 100-ml flasks shaken at 250 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were grown in 100-ml flasks filled to the brim. When appropriate, antibiotics (Sigma) were added at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml kamamycine and 25 μg/ml tetracycline. To study ECL4002 auxotrophies amino acids were added to minimal medium-glucose at 100 μg/ml each and cells were aerobically cultured. Sensitivity to Stress Conditions—Exponentially growing cells (A 600: 0.3) were treated with the stressing compound, which was directly added to the growth medium at the concentrations and periods indicated for each experiment. Untreated cultures were incubated in parallel over the same periods. Sensitivity to the treatment was determined by serially diluted (1/10) bacterial suspension with phosphate-buffered saline and then plated by triplicates on LB agar. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Cells were disrupted by sonication in an ice bath, and the centrifuged extracts were assayed for the following enzyme activities, as described: ethanol dehydrogenase (15Membrillo-Hernández J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7571-7579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aconitase (24Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis—Oxidized proteins in cell extracts were revealed immunochemically by their carbonyl content (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Statdman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar) after derivatization with dinitrophenylhydrazine (17Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibody (Dako) was used at 1:5,000 dilution. Anti-AdhE Western blot was performed using the primary antibody at 1:2,000 dilution. In both cases, the secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Tropix) used at 1:25,000 dilution. Measurement of Intracellular Oxidation Level—The oxidant-sensitive probe H2DCFDA was used to measure the intracellular peroxide levels (28Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells growing aerobically in LB (A 600: 0.3) were washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated for 30 min in the same buffer with 10 μm H2DCFDA (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide). Cells were washed, resuspended in the same buffer, and disrupted by sonication. Cell extracts (100 μl) were mixed in 1 ml phosphate buffer and fluorescence intensity was measured using a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorimeter (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 519 nm). Emission values were normalized by protein concentration. In Vitro Inactivation Assays of AdhE—Purified AdhE (2.5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 160 mm NaCl, pH 8.5, was incubated for 4 min at room temperature with different concentrations of either KO2 (superoxide donor) plus catalase (50 units) or H2O2 and ethanol dehydrogenase was assayed. Potassium superoxide (KO2) was maintained in dimethyl sulfoxide due to its instability in aqueous solutions. KO2 concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically (e260 = 2086 m–1 cm–1) (29Lombard M. Fontecave M. Touati D. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Other Methods—Total cellular iron was determined under reducing conditions (30Fish W.W.

Quantification of AdhE expression was carried out by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis (32Laurell C.B. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 97: 145-160Google Scholar), according to a calibration curve (not shown) obtained with AdhE purified from strain ECL4000 as described previously (18Membrillo-Hernández J. Echave P.

For DNA staining, cells were resuspended for 10 min in 70% (v/v) ethanol, washed and incubated with 1 μg/ml diaminophenylindole in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and then rinsed with the same buffer. Fluorescence was viewed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope and images were taken using a Sony camera system. To obtain scanning electron microscopy images, exponentially growing cells were washed in 0.1 m phosphate potassium buffer, pH 7.0, and fixed for 30 min in phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde (2.5% v/v). Cell suspension was transferred to silanized glass. After washing with potassium phosphate, cells were postfixed with osmium tetraoxide (1% v/v) for 30 min, followed by 10 min washes with 30, 50, 70, and 90% acetone. Cells were then washed 3 times with 100% acetone (30 min each) and dried. After carbon evaporation, gold was added to the cells (Balzers ScD 050 Sputer Coater), and samples were observed using a scanning electronic microscope (DMS 940 A Zeiss). Growth Defects of ECL4002 Strain—When E. coli grows anaerobically on glucose, full expression of the adhE gene gives about 30,000 molecules/cell. In contrast, the amount of AdhE protein present under aerobic conditions, as measured by both Western blot and immunoelectrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”), was only 30% of that present under anaerobic conditions (9.6 ± 0.7 ng AdhE/μg total protein versus 28.1 ± 3.7 ng AdhE/μg total protein). Consequently, when oxygen was present in the culture, there were ∼10,000 molecules of AdhE per cell, of which 70% were inactive. It thus seemed inefficient to synthesize such amounts of a 96-kDa protein that apparently had no physiological role. An explanation for this apparent paradox was found during the study of the ΔadhE strain (ECL4002). ECL4002 cells were unable to grow aerobically in minimal medium on any of the carbon sources tested (glucose, succinate, fucose, acetate, glucuronate, gluconate, manitol, and glycerol). Aerobic metabolism of these sugars did not require any AdhE activity. This mutant strain grew under aerobic conditions in LB medium, but with a duplication time of 60 min (whereas wild type cells duplicated in 35 min in this medium). Addition of 0.1% casein acid hydrolysate to the minimal medium-glucose allowed growth but duplication time increased progressively over time. Analysis of amino acids needed for growth revealed that ΔadhE cells presented auxotrophies for Arg, His, Leu, Pro, and Thr, and growth without Lys was extremely limited. As expected, the ΔadhE strain was unable to grow anaerobically in minimal medium plus glucose, but it did grow when glucuronate was the carbon source (33Clark D.P. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 177-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control lysogen ECL4063 (adhE::kan λatt::adhE +) grew as the wild type strain in all the media and showed aerobic and anaerobic levels of AdhE activity indistinguishable from those of the wild type strain ECL4000 (18Membrillo-Hernández J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33869-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) The growth defects of ΔadhE cells were also associated with changes in size and shape. When grown in LB medium, these mutant cells presented a filamentous appearance in comparison with wild type cells. Although, as known, wild type cells displayed a homogeneous size of 1–2 μm long (Fig. 1A), ΔadhE cells were, on average, 4–5 μm long, but cells 20–50 μm long could also be observed (Fig. 1D). DNA stain with the fluorochrome diaminophenylindole revealed that in these filamentous cells, replication and segregation of DNA was apparently normal (Fig. 1E). The filamentous phenotype was probably due to a problem in septum formation. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy revealed that there was no septum in the long ΔadhE cells (not shown). The same phenotype was also observed in DHB4 cells used as a parallel control. AdhE Deletion Causes an Oxidative Stress Phenotype—During our study of ΔadhE cells, we observed that they showed less viability after freeze-thawing and lysozyme treatment than ECL4000 cells, which could indicate that their cell membrane was defective. This phenomenon and the previously described growth defects led us to hypothesize an internal oxidative stress problem in cells deficient in AdhE. To analyze this possibility, wild type and ΔadhE cells were tested for viability after treatment with 2 mm H2O2 for 60 min. The mutant strain had a decreased viability (around two orders of magnitude) both in aerobic (Fig. 2A) and anaerobic conditions (not shown) compared with the wild type cells. No differences in viability between the two strains were observed when cells were treated with paraquat, a superoxide generator (not shown). The fluorescent probe H2DCFDA was used to measure intracellular peroxide levels (Fig. 2B). Basal levels of endogenously generated peroxides were 5 times greater in ΔadhE cells compared with wild type cells. When treated with 10 mm H2O2 for 60 min, peroxides in the mutant strain were only slightly higher than those found in wild type cells (not shown). Several enzyme activities known to be affected by reactive oxygen species were measured in cells grown aerobically in LB (Fig. 2C). Aconitase, an enzyme with an Fe/S cluster, has been reported to be very sensitive to oxidative stress (31Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Yan L.J. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In ΔadhE cells, aconitase activity was reduced 5-fold with respect to wild type strain. As a control, malate dehydrogenase, which has been reported to be resistant to oxidative stress (31Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), showed no differences between wild type and ΔadhE cells. Catalase (HPI) and Mn-superoxide dismutase are enzymes regulated by the transcriptional regulators OxyR (activated in response to H2O2) and SoxRS (activated in response to superoxide), respectively. Levels of catalase activity in ΔadhE cells grown either in LB medium or in glucose-minimal medium supplemented with casein acid hydrolysate, were, respectively, two and four times greater with respect to those displayed in wild type cells. However, there was no difference in superoxide dismutase activity between both strains, either when grown in LB or in glucose-minimal medium. This indicated that H2O2, but not O2·¯ levels, were higher than normal in the ΔadhE cells (Fig. 2C). The endogenous oxidative stress measured with H2DCFDA could have been due to a defective iron metabolism, resulting in iron accumulation within the cell, as reported in several E. coli mutant strains (37Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, total iron was measured using batophenanthroline sulfonate (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results demonstrated that there were no significant differences between wild type and ΔadhE strains grown in LB with respect to total cell iron (3.3 nmol Fe/6 × 108 cells). One of the markers under oxidative stress conditions is the formation of carbonyl groups on proteins due to modification of some amino acid side chains (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Statdman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Anti-DNP Western blot experiments revealed that in ΔadhE cells, grown aerobically in LB and stressed with 10 mm H2O2 for 60 min, showed increased levels of protein damage as compared with stressed wild type cells (Fig. 2D). As shown, even in non-stressed cells, protein carbonylation was slightly higher in ΔadhE cells than in wild type cells. Many microorganisms, including human pathogens, also synthesize a multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase. These enzymes are members of the “iron-dependent” dehydrogenase family and share a high sequence homology to AdhE from E. coli. To verify whether these homologues were also major targets under H2O2 stress conditions, wild type cells from other two enterobactericeae, S. typhimurium and S. marcescens, were submitted to 10 mm H2O2 for 60 min, and protein oxidation was analyzed by anti-DNP Western blot and compared with E. coli (Fig. 2E). As expected, a band corresponding to AdhE became strongly carbonylated in both S. typhimurium and S. marcescens, which means that homologues of AdhE exhibit the same reactivity to H2O2. Comparison Between ΔadhE and ΔkatG Cells—From the above results one can hypothesize that strain ECL4002 was deficient at detoxifying endogenously generated peroxides. In this context, to compare the role of AdhE with that of catalase, a katG defective mutant was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). This gene encoded for the exponential phase catalase, HPI. Several parameters were measured to compare ΔkatG cells with ΔadhE cells. Cultures of ΔkatG cells were grown aerobically in LB with a duplication time of 45 min (as compared with 60 min for ΔadhE and 35 min for wild type strain). The HPI-deficient cells grew on minimal medium with glucose as a carbon source under aerobic conditions, although only at the permissive temperature of 30 °C (ΔadhE strain did not grow in this medium at any temperature). When observed under the electron microscope, a minor fraction (fewer than 0.1%) of the cells were longer than normal when grown in this minimal medium (Fig. 1G). No apparent defects were observed when grown in LB (not shown). Peroxide levels measured in ΔkatG cells growing under aerobic conditions in LB (Fig. 2B) were found slightly increased compared with wild type cells, although smaller than those found in ΔadhE cells. It is known that cells submitted to a non-lethal oxidative stress by H2O2 transiently arrest their growth. After a lag period cells recover from the stress and growth is restored. This lag time was measured in wild type, ΔkatG and ΔadhE cultures, grown aerobically in LB and stressed with various concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 3). Wild type cells presented only slight growth delay at the highest dose of H2O2 used (1 mm) and almost no effect at lower concentrations. On the contrary, both ΔadhE and ΔkatG cells arrested their growth after stress. As expected, at 0.5 and 1 mm H2O2, HPI was more important than AdhE, because ΔkatG cells arrested growth longer than ΔadhE cells. However, at 0.1 mm H2O2, growth of ΔadhE cells was almost as equally affected as ΔkatG cells. In addition, ΔadhE strain had a duplication time higher than ΔkatG strain. These results indicated that AdhE was more important than HPI for maintaining basal levels of H2O2. AdhE is Highly Reactive to H 2 O 2 —The reactivity between AdhE and H2O2 was observed in vivo measuring the rapid inactivation of ethanol dehydrogenase activity following the addition of 0.5 or 1 mm H2O2 for 5 min to ECL4000 cultures. An inactivation of 55 and 80% was, respectively, obtained. Under these conditions, aconitase was only inactivated 25 and 40%, respectively. AdhE inactivation by H2O2 was irreversible because addition of 10 μg/ml chloramfenicol to ECL4000 cells simultaneous to H2O2 treatment prevented the recovery of ethanol dehydrogenase activity. When no antibiotic was added, AdhE activity increased in parallel with the duplication of cells (not shown). Using pure preparations of AdhE, the plot of H2O2 concentration versus enzyme inactivation gave an inactivation constant (K i) for H2O2 of 5 μm (Fig. 4A). However, when KO2 was used as a superoxide donor (in the presence of catalase to remove spontaneously formed H2O2), AdhE reactivity was clearly lower (K i for superoxide was 120 μm) (Fig. 4A). As expected, inactivation of AdhE by H2O2 resulted in carbonyl formation (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results were consistent with the idea that AdhE plays an important role in combating H2O2 stress, but not superoxide stress. Zn Inactivation of AdhE Generates Cells Highly Sensitive to Oxidative Stress—Assuming the aerobic role of AdhE as an H2O2 scavenger, the addition of any inhibitor of its scavenging activity should result in cells highly sensitive to oxidative stress, resembling ΔadhE cells. In previous studies (38Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Obradors N. Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) on ADHII, a dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis, which is also a member of the iron-activated dehydrogenase family, our group demonstrated that the Fe-ion was easily exchanged by Zn, which results in alcohol dehydrogenase inactivation and inability to carry out Fenton reaction. As expected, when ZnSO4 was added to ECL4000 cultures, AdhE was inactivated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). In addition, carbonyl groups formation in AdhE under oxidative stress were undetectable when zinc was present (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows that the effect of Zn treatment prior to H2O2 stress reduced cell viability (around 1 order of magnitude), demonstrating the importance of Fe-AdhE as an H2O2 scavenger. AdhE displays its activity under anaerobic or microoxic conditions; in aerobiosis, transcription is down-regulated and the enzyme is inactivated by metal-catalyzed oxidation. To date, no role has been assigned to this enzyme when oxygen is present. Our results indicated that cells lacking AdhE showed markers of a stress situation with a phenotype resembling that of a cell deficient in antioxidant defense systems. This conclusion was based on the following observations. (i) The increased H2O2 concentrations inside the cell, measured with H2DCFDA. (ii) Inactivation of aconitase, an enzyme highly sensitive to oxidative stress (31Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Yan L.J. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kalyanaraman B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14064-14069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This, in turn, may further increase production of reactive oxygen species. (iii) Increased levels of catalase activity, which are probably the result of OxyR activation. This transcription factor becomes activated when H2O2 concentration is 10–5m or higher (42Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). (iv) Filamentous morphology may indicate the activation of the SOS system (43D'Ari R. Huisman O. Biochemie. 1982; 64: 6273-6277Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), due to damage to DNA produced by H2O2 (44Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). SOS activation blocks septum formation, producing cells longer than normal (45Huisman O. D'Ari R. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4490-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). (v) Auxotrophies observed in ΔadhE could not be explained solely on the basis of a higher susceptibility to inactivation of enzymes implicated in the amino acid biosynthesis. This could also have been due to membrane permeation produced by reactive oxygen species as described in Δsod cells (46Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The results clearly demonstrated that AdhE was able to react with H2O2, both in vivo and in vitro, producing an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. This was indicated by the lack of recovery when chloramfenicol and H2O2 were simultaneously added to the culture. This scavenging power would imply an equimolar reaction between H2O2 and AdhE. Although a reducing cycle (with Fe3+ being recycled to Fe2+, perhaps by NAD(P)H+ or superoxide) would make the system more efficient by allowing to scavenge more than 1 molecule of H2O2 per molecule of AdhE, several indirect results seemed to rule out this possibility. First, AdhE has lower binding affinity to ferrous ion than to ferric ion. 2P. Echave, J. Tamarit, E. Cabiscol, and J. Ros, unpublished results. And second, propanediol oxidoreductase, an enzyme with the same iron-binding signature is inactivated by metal-catalyzed oxidation due to the modification of a highly conserved histidine residue, which is essential for iron binding (39Obradors N. Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AdhE is important for controlling H2O2 homeostasis under normal aerobic conditions because reactive oxygen species produced in the electron transport chain are of the same order of magnitude as K i for H2O2 (5 μm). A similar role has been proposed for alquil hydroperoxide reductase (AhpCF) (48Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Although it would be difficult to establish which is more important, in contrast to ΔadhE strain, ΔahpCF mutants grow aerobically in LB as well as a wild type strain (48Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). AhpCF is regulated by OxyR (AdhE is not), which means that at intermediate H2O2 concentrations (10–5–10–4m), the amount of AhpCF would rise considerably and, consequently, will perform its physiological role. At high concentrations, catalases are the predominant enzyme against H2O2 as demonstrated in the case of our HPI-deficient cells and by other authors (48Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 49Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPI has a K m of 5.9 mm (50Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 59: 5868-5875Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and HPII (reported as important only in stationary phase, when it is induced by RpoS) (48Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 51Sak B.D. Eisenstark A. Touati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3271-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has similar kinetic parameters (52Obinger C. Maj P. Nicholls P. Loewen P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One can hypothesize that these sets of enzymes could constitute a three-step barrier against H2O2, with AdhE being the most important at lowest H2O2 concentrations. An additional advantage, such as the fast adaptability to an anoxic situation, can be deduced from the maintenance of such an expensive system as AdhE under aerobic conditions. In this context, it must be remembered that 30% of AdhE molecules remain active and can start immediately working as a dehydrogenase. The observation that these mutant cells exhibited lower resistance to freeze-thawing and to lysozyme treatment (not shown) led us to believe that ΔadhE cells were very fragile as a result of the continuous attacks from H2O2 generated inside the cell (the membrane was probably affected). The decreased viability observed by a strong stress (2–10 mm H2O2), would be the result of this fragility and not strictly due to the lack of AdhE scavenging activity, because in this situation HPI is by far the most important enzyme. There is an increasing list of microorganisms with orthologues to AdhE sharing a 60–90% sequence homology (Fig. 6). These include human pathogens, which give this enzyme clinical importance. It seems reasonable to assume that all these enzymes should act in the same way that AdhE did in E. coli. The results obtained in S. typhimurium and S. marcescens are in agreement with this assumption. Additionally, in a systematic study of genes involved in survival to macrophage attack in S. typhimurium, it was observed that adhE mutant cells were more sensitive than wild type cells (53Baumler A.J. Kusters J.G. Stojiljkovic I. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of these orthologues as H2O2 scavengers provide clues to explain why even microorganisms that neither produce alcohols nor use them as carbon sources (Listeria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) have maintained this enzyme. It would be especially interesting to be able to inactivate these AdhEs in bacterial pathogens making them more susceptible to the immune system. From previous studies (38Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we know that Zn can replace Fe easily in these dehydrogenases in vitro. As we have demonstrated in this study, treatment of E. coli cells with ZnSO4 inactivated AdhE, and this Zn-AdhE was not able to perform the Fenton reaction. More interestingly, these Zn-treated E. coli cells became more susceptible to oxidative stress. It is possible to speculate on the possible role of Zn treatment in infections involving such pathogen microorganisms. Developing specific inhibitors to AdhE could be of great interest in the near future.

Here we show that EGF stimulation induces a specific, rapid, and transient membrane recruitment of Rin1 and that recruitment is dependent on the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Rin1. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR is accompanied by co-immunoprecipitation of Rin1 in a time- and ligand-dependent manner. Association of Rin1 and specifically the SH2 domain of Rin1 with the EGFR was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the EGFR. The recruitment of Rin1, observed by light microscopy, indicated that although initially cytosolic, Rin1 was recruited to both plasma membrane and endosomes following EGF addition. Moreover, the expression of the SH2 domain of Rin1 substantially impaired the internalization of EGF without affecting internalization of transferrin. Finally, we found that Rin1 co-immunoprecipitated with a number of tyrosine kinase receptors but not with cargo endocytic receptors.

Of the many cell systems that are impacted by EGFR signaling, the activation of the Ras-dependent extracellular-regulated kinase/microtubule-activated protein kinase cascade appears to have the most pronounced effect on the proliferative response to EGF (28Liebmann C.

Urbe S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3075-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Attenuation of EGFR signaling is mediated by internalization and subsequent degradation of activated receptors (31Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill S.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Wells A.

However, there is increasing evidence that simple removal of the activated EGF receptor from the plasma membrane does not lead to immediate signal attenuation (33Wiley H.S. Burke P.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Rather, the signaling capacity of the receptor may be qualitatively or quantitatively changed due to the different effector molecules encountered by the receptor as it travels through the compartments or subcompartments of the endocytic pathway (34Bishop N.

Only upon the final delivery to the lysosome and/or some prelysosomal degradative compartment are the receptors completely inactivated. Following receptor internalization, Rab5a (a member of the small GTP-binding protein family) plays a key role in regulating the trafficking of the EGFR (2Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Newly formed endocytic vesicles carrying the activated EGFR and the other cargo fuse with early endosomes and gain access to the endocytic pathway. Endosome fusion is a Rab5a-dependent process. Using an in vitro assay that measures early endosome fusion, activation of Rab5a was found to be rate limiting for this process (40Barbieri M.A. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rab5a and/or an activated allele of Rab5a has also been shown to stimulate both EGFR uptake and fluid-phase endocytosis (2Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that activation of EGFR regulates the nucleotide status of Rab5a, a process that was dependent on selected domains in the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR and on the activation of Ras (1Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Overexpression of activated Ras has long been known to stimulate fluid-phase endocytosis (45Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 46Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Cooper J.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19367-19370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which Ras exerted its influence of the endocytic pathway was not understood. Recently, we have demonstrated that Rasactivated endocytosis is facilitated by Rab5a, in part, by the ability of Ras to directly regulate the Rab5a nucleotide exchange activity of Rin1 (1Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rin1 contains an SH2 (Src homology 2) domain, a proline-rich domain, a Vps9p domain, and a region involved in the binding of activated Ras (48Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 49Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Vps9p domain of Rin1 has been shown to serve as a Rab5a-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Rin1 is potentiated by the binding of activated H-Ras and also increases EGFR endocytosis when co-expressed with Rin1. The ability of activated Ras to increase EGFR endocytosis is mitigated when a mutant form of Rin1 that lacks Rab5a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity is co-expressed. These studies clearly demonstrate that Rab5a, Rin1, and Ras play a coordinated role in regulating EGFR endocytosis. In this study, we examined the role that the SH2 domain found in Rin1 plays in mediating EGFR endocytosis and describe the functional relationship between specific EGFR and Rin1 domains. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that the SH2 domain is essential for interaction of Rin1 with the EGFR. Moreover, EGFR tyrosine auto-phosphorylation is required for this interaction. The association of Rin1 with the EGFR appears to be transient, and expression of the Rin1-SH2 domain has been shown to effectively compete EGFR internalization. Rin1 was also found to interact with several other well characterized RTKs. The functional interaction between the SH2 domain of Rin1 and RTKs points to a novel signal transduction pathway by which Ras and Rab5a are directly linked to the EGFR via SH2 domain of Rin1.

Construction of GST-Rin1 Domains—Rin1-SH2 (amino acids 67–154) and Rin1-C (amino acids 413–730) were amplified by PCR using human Rin1-wild-type (WT)-SINREP5 cDNA as the template (Fig. 2). The oligonucleotides for PCR of SH2 were 5′-ACCCGGGGATCCCCCGTGTGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAGAAGAATTCCGATGTGCCGGGT-3′ (where BamH1 and EcoR1 sites are underlined) and of Rin1-C were 5′-CTGAGTGAATTCGCGGAGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-TGTCACCTCGAGAGCCCCCTGGGT-3′ (where EcoR1 and XhoI sites are underlined). To produce the proline-rich domain of Rin1 (Rin1-Pro, amino acids 259–268), we generated an annealing reaction. The oligonucleotides were 5′-GATCCCCACCTGCCGTGCCACCTCCCCCGTCCCCGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCGGGGACGGGGGGAGGTGGCACGGCAGGTGGG-3′ (where BamH1 and EcoR1sites are underlined). The amplified fragments were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of Recombinant Sindbis Viruses—Human Rab5a cDNA was subcloned into the unique XbaI restriction site of the Sindbis vector Toto1000–32J (46Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C.

The Rin1-WT, Rin1, H-Ras, and Rab5a constructs were then linearized by XhoI digestion and used as a template for in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. The resulting RNA transcripts were used for transfection of confluent BHK-21 cell monolayers using a Lipofectinmediated procedure (Invitrogen) as described by previously (46Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C.

Whole Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting— NR6 cells that stably express the human EGFR (NR6-EGFR) were serum-starved, incubated with 100 nm EGF for 1 h at 4 °C, and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell proteins were measured with Bio-Rad procedure, and the EGFR and Rin1 were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Rin1 antibodies (BD Biosciences) as indicated in each figure. The immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with monoclonal anti-bodies to EGFR, Ras, Rab5a, and Rin1. Cell lysates from CHO-IR, NIH-3T3-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), 293T-FGFR, CHO-mannose receptor (MR), and CHO-transferrin receptor (TfR) were prepared from stimulated or non-stimulated cells. Each cell line was stimulated with the appropriate ligand as indicated in each figure legend. The cell extract was then prepared as described above for the NR6-EGFR cell line. Receptor Internalization Studies—Mouse EGF (Invitrogen) was iodinated with 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific activities of labeled ligands were typically 150,000 cpm/ng (600 Ci/mmol). NR6 monolayers were infected with the empty Sindbis vectors or Sindbis viruses as described previously (46Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Cooper J.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10337-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NR6 cell monolayers infected with Sindbis virus alone or with Rin1 recombinant virus for 6 h were serum-starved as indicated in each figure legend prior to activation with EGF for the indicated times. NR6 cells expressing the different Rin1 constructs was washed in binding buffer (α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 13 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3% fetal bovine serum, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 100 pm [125I]EGF. To assess internalization, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in binding buffer lacking [125I]EGF in an air environment for the indicated times. Nonspecific binding (∼2%) was assessed in the presence of 200 nm unlabeled human EGF (Sigma) and subtracted from the total. Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were examined by confocal microscopy in the absence or presence of 100 nm EGF as described previously (2Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was carried out on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope. GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (50Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). A431 and NR6-EGFR cell lines were serum-starved for at least 6 h and stimulated or not by EGF (100 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). After a 15-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, each supernatant was incubated 2 h with 5 mg of immobilized GST fusion proteins at 4 °C. After washing three times, bound protein was eluted by SDS sample buffer. Solubilized protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with specific antibodies. Full-length Rin1 Interacts with the EGF Receptor—Activated tyrosine kinase receptors are rapidly internalized and targeted to early endosomes. Recent work (1Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Rin1 operates as a linker protein by serving to couple the activation of the EGFR to the recruitment and activation of Rab5a, a requisite for access to early endosomes. To determine whether Rin1 interacts with the EGFR, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using lysates from HeLa cells, representative of cultured cells expressing “normal” levels of EGF receptor (Fig. 1A) as well as cells overexpressing Rin1 and EGF receptor (Fig. 1B). In Fig. 1A, right panel, HeLa cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with EGF for 5 min. The cells were lysed, and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated under native conditions. Proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with the EGFR were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of Rin1 and EGFR was determined by Western analysis. As seen in Fig. 1A, right panel, Rin1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR when the cells were stimulated with EGF. In the absence of added EGF, detectable but small amounts of Rin1 were observed in the immunoprecipitate. As a control, we used the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, an SH2-containing protein known to interact with the EGFR. In Fig. 1A, left panel, the presence p85 was detected in the EGFR immunoprecipitates by Western blotting following stimulation with EGF. The amount of Rin1 and p85 immunoprecipitated with EGFR was estimated at 0.8 and 1.2%, respectively. We further examined the co-immunoprecipitation of p85 and Rin1 in cells overexpressing p85 and Rin1. CHO cells stably expressing EGFR were transiently transfected either with pcDNA3-Rin1 or pcDNA3-p85. Following 6-h serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with 100 nm EGF for 5 min. Cell lysates were prepared, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 1B, Rin1 (right panel) and p85 (middle panel) co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR in the presence of added EGF but not in unstimulated cells. To determine the time dependence of Rin1-EGFR association, NR6-EGFR cells were grown in serum-free media and incubated in the presence or absence of EGF (100 nm) for a period covering a total of 60 min. Rin1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR from NR6-EGFR lysates when the cells were incubated in the presence of EGF but not in its absence. After as little as 1-min exposure to EGF, the EGFR-Rin1 interaction could be detected. This response was maximal between 1 and 10 min with the strongest signal being observed at 5 min, trailing to small but detectable levels after 60-min post-EGF addition. The trailing off of the Rin1-EGF signal (Fig. 1C) may be attributed to the loss of EGFR as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1C. These results suggest that Rin1 is preferentially associated with activated EGFR in a transient manner. The SH2 Domain in the N-terminal Region of Rin1 Interacts with the EGFR—Rin1 has at least four clearly defined domains (1Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of the molecule contains a SH2 domain followed by a proline-rich domain, the Vps9p domain, and finally, the Ras association domain (Fig. 2). To identify the portion of Rin1 that interacts with the EGFR, we prepared a series of HA-tagged constructs that encode various domains of Rin1. Initially, N-terminal (Rin1-N) and C-terminal (Rin1-C) expression constructs (Fig. 2) were tested for their ability to interact with the EGFR (Fig. 3A). These constructs, as well as full-length Rin1, were expressed in EGF-NR6 cells using Sindbis virus for transient expression. After infection, the cells were stimulated with EGF (100 nm) for 5 min or left untreated. Immediately following this incubation, the cells were cooled, washed, and lysed and EGFR was immunoprecipitated. EGFR and its associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length Rin1 co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR as did the N-terminal portion of Rin1 (i.e. Rin1-N). The C-terminal portion of Rin1 (Rin1-C) did not co-immunoprecipitate with the EGFR. Because the N-terminal portion of Rin1 contains both a putative SH2 domain as well as a proline-rich domain, the ability of the SH2 domain alone to bind to the EGFR was determined. In this case, GST fusion proteins that contained the SH2 domain (GST-Rin1-SH2) or the proline-rich domain (GST-Rin1-Pro) were used in addition to a C-terminal expression construct (GST-Rin1-C). GST alone was included as a control. A431 cells were serum-starved for 6 h and then treated with EGF (100 nm) for 10 min. Control cells did not receive EGF. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with glutathione beads that had been preloaded with the GST fusion proteins or GST alone. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted from the beads with GSH (reduced glutathione) and separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of EGFR was determined by Western analysis. The relative amount of EGFR in each cell lysate used is shown in Fig. 3B. As seen in the Fig. 3B, top panel, only GST-Rin1-SH2 was effective in interacting with the EGFR. Neither GST-Rin1-Pro nor GST-Rin1-C nor GST alone interacted with the EGFR. In Fig. 3C, an experiment identical to that described in Fig. 3B was carried out to compare the relative EGFR pull-down capacities of GST-Rin1-SH2 and GST-p85. The data show that both Rin1-SH2 and p85 interact with the EGFR under these conditions to approximately the same extent. A Motif on the Cytoplasmic Tail of EGFR Interacts with the SH2 Domain of Rin1—To define the site on the EGFR where Rin1 interacts, a series of C-terminal truncation constructs and point mutations of the EGFR were examined for their ability to bind Rin1. Three truncations of the EGFR were used including EGFR-C′1000, EGFR-C′991, and EGFR-C′973. In addition, we used a full-length “kinase dead” point mutant (K721M) construct and several well described EGFR constructs (EGFR-F1, EGFR-F2, EGFR-F3, EGFR-F4, and EGFR-F5) in which the major auto-phosphorylation sites were mutated. We also used a EGFR-Phe-992 point mutant. The EGFR cell lines were transfected with a Sindbis virus construct that encoded a full-length HA-tagged version of Rin1. The transfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h, EGF (100 nm) was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min. The cells were lysed, and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated under native conditions. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western analysis using anti-EGFR or anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, only the full-length EGFR interacted with Rin1. The EGFR-C′1000 truncation construct also interacted with Rin1 but at a very reduced level. Interestingly, the truncated mutant EGFR-C′973 (Fig. 4A) and the “kinase dead” EGFR mutant (K721M) (data not shown) were unable to interact with Rin1, indicating that receptor phosphorylation is required for Rin1 interaction. Consistent with this interpretation, the tyrosine point mutants of EGFR-F5, EGFRF4, EGFR-F3, and EGFR-F2 all failed to interact with Rin1 (data"

The transcriptional pathway mediating this effect is, however, unknown. Because products of PLA2 activity are endogenous activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα, we postulated that sPLA2s mediate their effects on sPLA2-IIA expression via sPLA2 activity and subsequent PPARα activation. This study shows that various sPLA2s, including venom enzymes, human sPLA2-IIA, and wild-type and catalytically inactive H48Q mutant of porcine pancreatic sPLA2-IB, enhance the TNFα-induced sPLA2-IIA expression at the mRNA and protein levels. In cells transfected with luciferase sPLA2-IIA promoter constructs, sPLA2s are active only when the promoter contains a functional PPRE-1 site. The effect of exogenous sPLA2s is also blocked by the PPARα inhibitor MK886. Interestingly, the expression of sPLA2-IIA induced by TNFα alone is also attenuated by MK886, by the sPLA2-IIA inhibitor LY311727, by heparinase, which prevents the binding of sPLA2-IIA to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and by the specific cPLA2-α inhibitor pyrrolidine-1. Together, these data indicate that sPLA2-IIA released from mesangial cells by TNFα stimulates its own expression via an autocrine loop involving cPLA2 and PPARα.

Piot O. Masliah J. Barakett V. Maury E. Bereziat G. Offenstadt G. Infection. 1996; 24: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), asthma (5Calabrese C. Triggiani M. Marone G. Mazzarella G. Allergy. 2000; 55: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and rheumatoid arthritis (6Bidgood M.J. Jamal O.S. Cunningham A.M. Brooks P.M. Scott K.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). sPLA2-IIA is also highly expressed in the kidney during experimental and human acute pancreatitis (7Nevalainen T.J. Hietaranta A.J. Gronroos J.M. Hepatogastroenterology. 1999; 46: 2731-2735PubMed Google Scholar), which can lead to post-injury multiple organ failure (8Partrick D.A. Moore E.E. Silliman C.C. Barnett C.C. Kuypers F.A. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In rat renal mesangial cells, which are used as a cell model system to study inflammatory processes, it was shown earlier that cAMP-elevating agents and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and TNFα stimulate the gene expression and secretion of sPLA2-IIA by different transcriptional activation pathways (9Pfeilschifter J. Mühl H. Pignat W. Märki F. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: S7-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Walker G. Kunz D. Pignat W. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Scholz-Pedretti K. Eberhardt W. Rupprecht G. Beck K.F. Spitzer S. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The functional role of the sPLA2-IIA released from mesangial cells is, however, less clear. In rat mesangial cells, it has been shown that exogenously added sPLA2-IIA acts as a growth factor mediating the action of IL-1β on cell proliferation, and that this effect is mimicked by lysophospholipids (12Wada A. Tojo H. Sugiura T. Fujiwara Y. Kamada T. Ueda N. Okamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Exogenous sPLA2-IIA and lysophospholipids were also found to rapidly stimulate the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade in mesangial cells, leading to early activation of cPLA2 (13Sugiura T. Wada A. Itoh T. Tojo H. Okamoto M. Imai E. Kamada T. Ueda N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Huwiler A. Staudt G. Kramer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear whether sPLA2-IIA released by mesangial cells after cytokine induction acts like exogenously added sPLA2-IIA and, in particular, whether sPLA2-IIA can exert a positive feedback amplification loop on its own gene expression by activating one of the above signaling pathways and/or other pathways (see below). High levels of another sPLA2 subtype, the so-called pancreatic-type sPLA2-IB, are also found in kidney during acute pancreatitis (7Nevalainen T.J. Hietaranta A.J. Gronroos J.M. Hepatogastroenterology. 1999; 46: 2731-2735PubMed Google Scholar, 15Uhl W. Schrag H.J. Schmitter N. Nevalainen T.J. Aufenanger J. Wheatley A.M. Buchler M.W. Gut. 1997; 40: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that sPLA2-IB may also contribute to the pathophysiological effects in such conditions. In rat mesangial cells, exogenously added pancreatic sPLA2-IB can stimulate the mRNA and protein expression of sPLA2-IIA, as well as prostaglandin biosynthesis (16Kishino J. Ohara O. Nomura K. Kramer R.M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to involve binding of sPLA2-IB to the M-type sPLA2 receptor expressed in mesangial cells (17Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This view is strengthened by the fact that a catalytically inactive mutant of sPLA2-IB, which still binds to the M-type receptor, has effects similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (16Kishino J. Ohara O. Nomura K. Kramer R.M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, sPLA2-IB from different species including rat, but not rat sPLA2-IIA, binds to the M-type receptor expressed in rat mesangial cells (17Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 372: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that sPLA2-IIA acts through binding to a different cell membrane target. When exogenously added to other cell types, sPLA2-IB was also found to activate the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (20Tohkin M. Kishino J. Ishizaki J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1834-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, exogenously added sPLA2-IIA can induce the activation of cPLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (3Gelb M.H. Valentin E.

Res. 2002; 90: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) on different cell types. The nature of the sPLA2-IIA cellular target involved in these biological effects remains, however, to be clearly identified. Although human sPLA2-IIA does not bind to the human M-type receptor (18Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7034-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that this receptor or a related receptor may be involved, whereas the sPLA2 activity may not play a major role. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) including glypican-1 may also contribute to the effects of sPLA2-IIA (30Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Besides activation of p38, p42/44, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinases by sPLA2-IB or -IIA (13Sugiura T. Wada A. Itoh T. Tojo H. Okamoto M. Imai E. Kamada T. Ueda N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Hernandez M. Fuentes L. Fernandez Aviles F.J. Crespo M.S. Nieto M.L. Circ.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), little is known about the transcriptional pathways activated by exogenously added sPLA2s. It has been shown that sPLA2-IB enhances the expression of COX-2 through activation of the transcription factor CCAT/enhancer-binding protein β in NIH3T3 and MC3T3E1 cells (21Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Mukherjee A.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1084-1091PubMed Google Scholar). Because sPLA2s can produce lipid mediators such as free fatty acids and prostaglandins that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) ligands (33Corton J.C Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), another attractive hypothesis is that sPLA2s induce the expression of genes containing PPAR-responsive promoters by activating PPAR nuclear receptors. Interestingly, a recent work has shown that sPLA2-IB may exert its proliferative effects via hydrolysis of nuclear phospholipids and activation of PPARα (34Specty O. Pageaux J.F. Dauca M. Lagarde M. Laugier C. Fayard J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). More recently, we and others found that the rat sPLA2-IIA promoter contains peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements (PPRE) (35Scholz-Pedretti K. Gans A. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Couturier C. Brouillet A. Couriaud C. Koumanov K. Bereziat G. Andreani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23085-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that PPAR activation in rat mesangial cells might be involved in the induction of sPLA2-IIA by exogenously added sPLA2s including sPLA2-IB, and also by rat sPLA2-IIA endogenously produced after cytokine treatment. The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of PPARα in the induction of sPLA2-IIA transcription by cytokines and by exogenous sPLA2s in rat mesangial cells. To determine the role of PPARα and the sPLA2 signaling pathways, we used rat sPLA2-IIA promoter constructs containing functional or mutated PPARα binding sites, as well as PPARα and various PLA2 inhibitors. Altogether, our data indicate that sPLA2-IIA released by mesangial cells after treatment with cytokines potentiates its own expression in a positive feedback loop via activation of cPLA2 and PPARα. Exogenously added sPLA2s including sPLA2-IB also use this transcriptional mechanism to enhance sPLA2-IIA gene expression, although the pathways used at the plasma membrane may differ among sPLA2s.

Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—Rat mesangial cells were cultured and characterized as described (41Pfeilschifter J. Vosbeck K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and bovine insulin (0.66 units/ml). Twenty-four hours prior to stimulation and during the experiments, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA. Northern Blot Analysis—Confluent mesangial cells were cultured in 100-mm diameter culture dishes. After stimulation for 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and harvested using a rubber policeman. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the cell pellet using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method. Ten μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.4% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized with the radiolabeled cDNA probes for sPLA2-IIA or 18 S RNA. For quantification the signals of the filters were scanned and evaluated densitometrically using a BAS 1500 phosphorimager from Fuji (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The signal obtained with the sPLA2-IIA probe was normalized to that obtained with the 18 S RNA probe. Western Blot Analysis—sPLA2-IIA protein secreted by mesangial cells was measured by precipitating 500 μl of the culture supernatant with 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel was performed under nonreducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-PVDF membranes for 30 min at 0.7 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody against rat sPLA2-IIA (generous gift from Prof. Henk van den Bosch, Utrecht, The Netherlands) at a 1:100 dilution in 0.01% milk powder in PBS. This rat sPLA2-IIA antibody cross-reacts with neither the human recombinant sPLA2-IIA nor the other sPLA2s used in this study. Indeed, Fig. 1B shows that the antibody detected the exogenously added recombinant rat enzyme (100 nm) as a thick band, but does not recognize the human sPLA2-IIA and the other sPLA2s. This clearly demonstrates that this antibody can be specifically used to detect the sPLA2-stimulated release of rat sPLA2-IIA from mesangial cells. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) at a 1:15,000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The washing steps were performed in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. After washing, peroxidase activity was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). sPLA 2 Assay—sPLA2 activity in supernatants of mesangial cells was determined with [1-14C]oleate-labeled Escherichia coli membranes as substrate (42Märki F. Franson R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 879: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, assay mixtures (1 ml) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm CaCl2, [1-14C]oleate-labeled E. coli (≈10,000 cpm), and 5 μl of cell supernatants, which produces less than 5% of substrate hydrolysis. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermomixer. The extraction of the lipids was performed by Dole's method exactly as described (42Märki F. Franson R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 879: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Free [1-14C]oleate was measured in a β-counter. Construction of Reporter Gene Fusions—A BamHI/KpnI fragment (2.67 kbp) of the rat sPLA2-IIA promoter (accession no. AF375595) was fused to the luciferase gene by cloning this fragment to the respective sites in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Unidirectional nested deletions of this construct were performed with the Erase-a-Base system (Promega) as described previously (35Scholz-Pedretti K. Gans A. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations within the putative PPAR binding site –909 to –888 (5′-AGGTTGTCCTCTGAACTCCACA-3′ in the rat sPLA2-IIA promoter fragment were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Stratagene) as described previously (35Scholz-Pedretti K. Gans A. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the changes in the obtained sequence 5′-AGGTTGTGTTCTGCGCTCCACA-3′ are underlined. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—For transfection, cells were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and transfected with 400 ng of plasmid DNA and 40 ng of Renilla luciferase DNA (pRL-TK vector) per well using the Effectene transfection reagent from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). After 16 h, cells were stimulated with the different effectors for another 24 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer from the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), scraped with a rubber policeman, and transferred into 1.5-ml vials. The cell lysates were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles for complete lysis of cells. After short centrifugation, the assays for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially by using a luminometer (Autolumat from Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Values for the sPLA2-IIA promoter activity were divided by those obtained from Renilla luciferase activity. The mean values ± S.D. obtained for the control cells were set as 1. Values obtained with treated cells are expressed as -fold increase in luciferase activity (relative units) compared with control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The sequences of the double-strand oligonucleotides used to detect the DNA binding activities of PPAR were chosen as described previously (35Scholz-Pedretti K. Gans A. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complementary DNA strands were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts from stimulated cells were isolated as described previously (35Scholz-Pedretti K. Gans A. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions with radioactive oligonucleotides were performed for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μg of total protein in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50,000 dpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with a 100-fold excess of cold PPRE-1 oligonucleotide or with antibodies against PPARα (4 μg/onset) and RXRα (3 μg/onset) for 30 min at room temperature before addition of the labeled oligonucleotides. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound DNA probe on native 8% polyacrylamide gels at 20 mA in 34 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 17 mm sodium acetate, and 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Gels were vacuumdried and analyzed with a phosphorimager. RT-PCR Analysis of 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and 5-LOX-activating Protein (FLAP)—Expression of mRNA for 5-LOX and FLAP was analyzed by RT-PCR using a total of 5 μg of RNA. As positive controls, RNA extracts from kidneys of rats sacrificed at 6 and 24 h after induction of Thy-1 nephritis were used (43Lianos E.A. Bresnahan B.B. Wu S. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was transcribed with Superscript II RNase H-RT obtained from Invitrogen and oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega). PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Thermal Cycler with specific primers as follows: arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5), sense (5′-CTGGTAGCCCATGTGAGGTT-3′) and antisense (5′-GCACAGGGAGGAATAGGTCA-3′) (product, 162 bp); rat FLAP sense (5′-CGTAGATGCGTACCCCACTT-3′) and antisense (5′-CGCTTCCGAAGAAGAAGATG-3′) (product, 245 bp); 18 S RNA, sense (5′-GCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCCTCTTAATCATGGCCTCAGT-3′) (product, 289 bp). The different cDNA probes were amplified in a prepared Mastermix containing dNTPs, specific primers, and Red Taq polymerase (Sigma) in the corresponding PCR buffer. For the PCR reactions, the following sequences were performed. For 5-LOX, sequence was 95 °C for 4 min (1 cycle) followed immediately by 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s (36 cycles) and a final extension phase at 72 °C for 10 min. For FLAP, sequence was 95 °C for 4 min (1 cycle) followed immediately by 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 20 s (36 cycles) and a final extension phase at 72 °C for 10 min.

Amplified PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The PCR products from the rat kidneys were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) for sequencing using a kit based on the dye terminator technology (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) in combination with the automated sequence analyzer A310 (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. A probability < 0.05 was considered as significant. Effect of Exogenous sPLA 2 s on sPLA 2 -IIA Expression in Rat Mesangial Cells—The scope of this study was to identify the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of sPLA2-IIA expression in rat mesangial cells triggered by exogenous sPLA2s. For this purpose, we treated rat mesangial cells with various sPLA2s from mammalian and venom origins in the absence or presence of TNFα (Table I). The effects of a catalytically inactive mutant of the porcine pancreatic sPLA2-IB containing a single amino acid mutation at position 48 (H48Q) was also studied. This mutant has less than 0.02% of wild-type PLA2 activity (39Janssen M.J.W. van de Wiel W.A.E.C. Beiboer S.H.W. van Kampen M.D. Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. Egmond M.R.

In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel mouse alkaline ceramidase (maCER1) with a highly restricted substrate specificity. maCER1 consists of 287 amino acids, and it has a 28 and 32% identity to the Saccharomyces alkaline ceramidases (YPC1p and YDC1p) and the human alkaline phytoceramidase, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated that maCER1 was predominantly expressed in skin. maCER1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum as revealed by immunocytochemistry. In vitro biochemical characterization determined that maCER1 hydrolyzed d-erythro-ceramide exclusively but not d-erythro-dihydroceramide or d-ribo-phytoceramide. Similar to other alkaline ceramidases, maCER1 had an alkaline pH optimum of 8.0, and it was activated by Ca2+ but inhibited by Zn2+,Cu2+, and Mn2+. maCER1 was also inhibited by sphingosine, one of its products. Metabolic labeling studies showed that overexpression of maCER1 caused a decrease in the incorporation of radiolabeled dihydrosphingosine into ceramide and complex sphingolipids but led to a concomitant increase in sphingosine-1-P (S1P) in HeLa cells. Mass measurement showed that overexpression of maCER1 selectively lowered the cellular levels of d-erythro-C24:1-ceramide, but not other ceramide species and caused an increase in the levels of S1P. Taken together, these data suggest that maCER1 is a novel alkaline ceramidase with a stringent substrate specificity and that maCER1 is selectively expressed in skin and may have a role in regulating the levels of bioactive lipids ceramide and S1P, as well as complex sphingolipids.

Both ceramide (phytoceramide) and sphingosine (phytosphingosine) have been shown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of mammalian cells, whereas sphingosine-1-P (S1P) 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine-1-P; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NBD, N-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EST, expressed sequence tag; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; TLC, thin liquid chromatography; maCER1, mouse alkaline ceramidase 1; haPHC, human alkaline phytoceramide; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; ORF, open reading frame; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; Vec, vector; e, erythro. appears to promote cell growth and proliferation and suppress apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A.

As a result of the opposing effects of ceramide and sphingosine versus S1P, their relative levels may regulate the ability of cells to grow, to survive, or to die. Ceramidases are enzymes that break down the amide linkage of ceramides (ceramide, dihydroceramide, and phytoceramide) to generate free fatty acids and sphingoid bases (sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or phytosphingosine) (4el Bawab S. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Subcell. Biochem. 2002; 36: 187-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn are phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to generate sphingoid base phosphates (2Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 3Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol.

Because ceramidases are capable of regulating the levels of these bioactive lipids, they may have an important role in regulating cellular responses mediated by these lipids. Furthermore, ceramides are also the building blocks of complex sphingolipids, which have important structural and functional roles (see reviews in Refs. 6Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar and 7van Meer G. Lisman Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25855-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, ceramidases may also regulate sphingolipid-mediated biology by regulating metabolism of the precursors of complex sphingolipids. Ceramidases, according to their pH optima for activity, fall into three groups, acid, neutral, and alkaline (4el Bawab S. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Subcell. Biochem. 2002; 36: 187-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human acid ceramidase is a lysosomal enzyme (8Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K. Linke T. Bar J. Breiden B. Neumann U. Lang F.

Alkaline ceramidases (YPC1p and YDC1P) were first cloned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in our laboratory (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). YPC1p and YDC1p share a 50% protein identity, are localized in the ER, and have an alkaline pH optimum but differ in some biochemical properties. YPC1p exhibits both ceramidase and (CoA-independent) ceramide synthase activities in vitro and mainly hydrolyzes phytoceramide. YDC1p has a major ceramidase activity but a minor ceramide synthase activity in vitro and hydrolyzes dihydroceramide preferentially. Based on sequence similarity to YPC1p and YDC1p, we recently identified and cloned a human alkaline phytoceramidase (haPHC) that preferentially hydrolyzes phytoceramide (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar) and exhibits no ceramide synthase activity in vitro. haPHC is localized to both the Golgi and ER. These alkaline ceramidases appear to have roles in regulating metabolism of sphingolipids and modulating biologic responses. Deletion or overexpression of the yeast alkaline ceramidases significantly alters the turnover of complex sphingolipids, free sphingoid bases, and their phosphates (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of YDC1p reduces the tolerance of yeast cells to heat stress (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Overexpression of haPHC in yeast cells leads to increased hydrolysis of phytoceramide and a concomitant increase in the generation of phytosphingosine and its phosphate (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar) and leads to suppression of yeast cell growth. In this study, we have identified and cloned a novel mouse alkaline ceramidase (maCER1). We demonstrate that maCER1 exclusively hydrolyzes d-erythro-ceramide, and it possesses the ability to regulate the levels of very long chain ceramides, S1P, and complex sphingolipids. This enzyme is localized in the ER. The identification of this novel alkaline ceramidase reveals that turnover of ceramides is carried out by multiple distinct ceramidases in different compartments, suggesting complexities in regulating the levels of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-P in mammalian cells. Tissue Culture and Cell Transfection—HeLa and COS1 cell lines purchased from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. DMEM, fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Lipid Preparation—Glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide were purchased from Sigma. [14C]Sphingomyelin was synthesized as described (22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). d-erythro-Sphingosine, l-threonine-sphingosine, d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, and d-ribo-phytosphingosine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. d-erythro-C12-NBD-4,5-dihydroceramide, d-ribo-C12-NBD-phytoceramide, d-erythro-C12-NBD-ceramide, and l-threonine-C12-ceramide were synthesized as described (23Marchesini S. Preti A. Aleo M.F. Casella A. Dagan A. Gatt S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 53: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitic acid was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. d-erythro-4,5-[3H]Dihydrosphingosine, d-erythro-4,5-[3H]dihydrosphingosine-1-P, d-erythro-3-[3H]sphingosine, and d-erythro-3-[3H]sphingosine-1-P were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. cDNA Cloning—A search of EST in the NCBI data base using haPHC as a query revealed a mouse EST sequence with a putative open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polypeptide homologous to haPHC. To clone the 5′-upstream sequence of the putative ORF, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on a mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech, Inc.) using the RACE adaptor primer AP1 (Clontech, Inc.) and a gene-specific primer (5′-GATACCATAAGGAAATGTGATGCTTA-3′) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first-round PCR products were diluted and subjected to a second round of PCR using the RACE adaptor primer AP2 and a nested gene-specific primer (5′-ATCCCTAATCTTCTTGTACTCTGTGC-3′). The resultant PCR product was cloned into a vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Plasmid Construction—To construct a yeast expression vector with an epitope tag, the sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the FLAG coding sequence flanked by HindIII and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, were synthesized. These two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form a double-stranded DNA fragment that was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). The resulting vector, pYES2-FLAG, was sequenced to verify the insertion of the correct FLAG coding sequence. The ORF of the mouse alkaline ceramidase was amplified from the mouse liver cDNA library using the forward primer 5′-GCGGATCCATGCATGTACCGGGCACCAG-3′ (underlined is the BamHI site) and the reverse primer 5′-GCGAATTCTCAGCAGTTCTTGTCATTCTCCTGG-3′ (underlined is the EcoRI site) as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). This coding sequence was cloned in-frame with the FLAG tag into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pYES2-FLAG using standard DNA cloning procedures. The resulting construct, pYES2-FLAG-maCER1, was verified by sequencing. pYES2-FLAG-maCER1 was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI to release the HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the coding sequence of the FLAG-tagged maCER1. The released fragment was cloned into the compatible sites of pcDNA3.1(+) to generate the construct pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-maCER1, which directs expression of the FLAG-tagged maCER1 in mammalian cells. Stable Cell Lines—At 80% confluence, HeLa cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG or the construct pcDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-maCER1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells from a 65-mm culture dish were dislodged by trypsin-EDTA treatment and plated into ten 10-cm culture dishes. The cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 1 g/ml G418 (high G418 medium). The high G418 medium was changed every 3–4 days until single clones were formed. The G418-resistant clones were expanded in DMEM medium in the presence of G418 (200 μg/ml) (low G418 medium) and were screened for expression of the FLAG-tagged maCER1 by both in vitro activity assay and Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. The cell lines stably expressing the FLAG-tagged maCER1 were maintained in the low G418 medium. As a negative control, G418-resistant clones transfected with the empty vector pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG were selected in the high G418 medium and maintained in the low G418 medium. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Briefly, the maCER1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the pYES2-FLAG-maCER1, purified by gel extraction, and radiolabeled by [32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences). This radiolabeled DNA probe was hybridized to a multiple mouse tissue mRNA blot (Clontech, Inc.). After being washed, the hybridized membrane blot was exposed to an x-ray film (BioMax MR; Eastman Kodak Co.) at –70 °C for 1 week. The same blot was hybridized by a radioactive probe for β-actin mRNA after the maCER1 probe was stripped from the blot. The membrane blot was exposed to an x-ray film for 5 h. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA (1 μg from each sample tissue) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR amplifications using Precision Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and an maCER1 primer pair (5′-AGTTCTGAGGTGGATTGGTGTGAG-3′ and 5′-TGGACTTTGAGGGTTTTATCTGGC-3′) or β-actin primer pair (5′-TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′). Conditions for the maCER1 PCR analysis were one cycle of 94 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR product (698 base pairs) was verified by DNA sequencing. For the β-actin PCR analysis, 25 above PCR cycles were performed using one-third amount of the cDNA templates. maCER1 Expression in Yeast Cells—maCER1 was expressed in yeast cells as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression construct pYES2-FLAG-maCER1 or the empty vector pYES2-FLAG was transformed into the yeast strain Δypc1Δydc1. Expression of the FLAG-tagged maCER1 was induced by 2% galactose. maCER1 Expression in Mammalian Cells—COS1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG and pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-maCER1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested after trypsin-EDTA treatment. After being washed three times with PBS, the cells were resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (CLAP; Roche Applied Science)), and were sonicated for 10 s at a power level of 1.5 on a microtip-equipped Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) and then chilled on ice for 30 s. The process of sonication and chilling was repeated twice. The total cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to obtain the M r = 10,000 membrane fraction. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to obtain microsomes (the M r = 100,000 membrane fraction), which were washed three times with Buffer A. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins extracted from membranes of yeast or mammalian cells by Buffer A with 0.5% Triton X-100 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—HeLa cell lines containing the vector (Vec) or stably expressing the FLAG-tagged maCER1 were plated into 6-well plates. At 80% confluence, the cells were transfected with the plasmid pEGFP-ER (Clontech, Inc.), which expresses a green fluorescent protein that was specifically targeted to the ER. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were fixed by 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice by PBS, and subjected to immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody (1:250) followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine (1:250) as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). The cells were examined under a Nikon fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. Ceramidase Activity Assay—Ceramidase activity was determined by the release of NBD-fatty acid from fluorescent substrates, NBD-C12-ceramide, dihydroceramide, or phytoceramide as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of microsomes (containing 10–20-μg proteins) in Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2) was mixed with 20 μl of 200 μm NBD-ceramide in Buffer B with 0.4% Nonidet P-40 in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube. After incubation at 37 °C for 30–60 min, the reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min and dried under a SpeedVec. The released NBD-fatty acid was separated from NBD-ceramide by TLC in a solvent of chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (90:30:0.5) and quantified by a PhosphorImager set at fluorescent mode. To determine the pH optimum of maCER1, the maCER1 microsomes were resuspended in Buffer C (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2). To determine a cation effect, the maCER1 microsomes were resuspended in Buffer A without CaCl2. Ceramidase Reverse Activity Assay—The reverse ceramidase activity was determined by the formation of ceramide (dihydroceramide or phytoceramide) from [3H]palmitic acid and sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or phytosphingosine as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of the Vec or maCER1 microsomes (containing 20-μg proteins) in Buffer A were mixed with 20 μl of substrates (100 μm [3H]palmitic acid and 100 μm sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or phytosphingosine) in Buffer A and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min and dried under the SpeedVec. The [3H]ceramide formed from the condensation of [3H]palmitic acid, and a sphingoid base was analyzed by TLC and quantified by scintillation counting. Protein Concentration Determination—Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sphingolipid Labeling—At 85% confluence, HeLa cells grown in a 65-mm culture dish were labeled with 2.5 μCi of [3H]DHS for 14 h. After being washed twice with PBS, the cells were scraped and subjected to lipid extraction with a solvent of chloroform:methanol:water:pyridine (60:30:6:1). After being dried under an N2 evaporator, the extracted lipids were resolved by TLC in a solvent of chloroform:methanol:15 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8) and detected by autoradiography as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar). Radiolabeled sphingosine, ceramide, S1P, and sphingomyelin were identified by their radioactive corresponding standards resolved on the same TLC plate. To visualize glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide standards, TLC plates were sprayed with a solution containing 8% (w/v) H3PO4 and 10% (w/v) CuSO4 charred at 180 °C for 10 min as described (24Doering T. Brade H. Sandhoff K. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1727-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The radioactive lipid bands were scraped off the TLC plates and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Electrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry Lipid Analysis—Analysis of sphingolipids was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode. Total cells, fortified with a set of internal standards, were extracted with ethyl acetate/isopropanol/water (60/30/10, v/v). The lipid extracts were dried under an N2 evaporator and reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol. The reconstituted samples were injected into the Survayor/TSQ 7000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system with the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3-μm particle size column, which was eluted with 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate/2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. The peaks for the target lipids and internal standards will be collected and processed using an Xcalibur software system. Calibration curves will be constructed by plotting peak area ratios of the target lipids to their respective internal standard against concentration, using linear regression model. Cloning of a Murine Alkaline Ceramidase—A BLAST search of EST databases in GenBank™ against haPHC revealed a mouse EST encoding a 270-amino acid putative protein distinct from but significantly homologous to haPHC. The coding sequence of the putative protein preceded by 5′-untranslated region was cloned from a mouse liver cDNA library by RACE as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). Sequencing analysis revealed an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first ATG codon of the coding region. The flanking sequence of the ATG codon matched with the Kozak consensus sequence, suggesting the authenticity of the predicted ORF. Sequence alignment showed that this putative protein exhibited 28% identity to both YPC1p and YDC1p and 32% to haPHC (Fig. 1B) and that it contained several conserved regions shared by the alkaline ceramidases. Similar to the other alkaline ceramidases, this putative protein have five putative transmembrane domains as predicted by a pSORTII program (Fig. 1A). Based on the sequence similarity to the alkaline ceramidases, this mouse protein is postulated to be a new member of the alkaline ceramidase family, designated maCER1. maCER1 is a Bona Fide Ceramidase That Hydrolyzes d-erythro-Ceramide—To investigate whether maCER1 is a bona fide ceramidase, it was tagged with the FLAG epitope and expressed in a yeast mutant (Δypc1ydc1) devoid of ceramidase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Microsomes were prepared from the Δypc1ydc1 strain transformed with the empty vector (the Vec strain) or the maCER1-expressing construct pYES2-FLAG-maCER1 (the maCER1 strain). Expression of the FLAG-tagged maCER1 was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. The FLAG-tagged maCER1 was associated with membranes isolated from the maCER1 strain but not from the Vec strain (Fig. 2A). The microsomes were assayed for ceramidase activity using NBD-C12-ceramides as substrates. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the microsomes of the maCER1 strain, but not the Vec strain, had a significant activity toward d-e-C12-NBD-ceramide (100 μm). Neither the Vec nor maCER1 microsomes exhibited ceramidase activity toward d-e-C12-NBD-dihydroceramide, d-ribo-C12-NBD-phytoceramide, or l-t-C12-NBD-ceramide, a stereoisomer of d-e-C12-ceramide at the same concentration. The ceramidase activity toward -d-e-C12-NBD-ceramide, but not the stereoisomers of d-e-C12-NBD-ceramide, was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that maCER1 is a ceramidase with a highly restricted substrate specificity for the natural stereoisomer of ceramide with d-erythro-sphingosine but not d-ribo-phytosphingosine or d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine as a backbone. We have shown previously that the yeast alkaline phytoceramidase YPC1p has a considerable reverse activity. To determine whether maCER1 has such an activity, the same microsomal preparations were assayed for reverse activity using [3H]palmitic acid and sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or phytosphingosine as substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” maCER1 had a minor reverse activity only when sphingosine was used but not when phytosphingosine or dihydrosphingosine was used as substrate (data not shown). These results suggest that maCER1 has a major ceramidase activity and only a very minor reverse activity. We further confirmed that maCER1 is a ceramidase by expressing it in mammalian cells. COS1 cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG or the construct pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-maCER1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Forty-eight h after transfection, membrane fractions were prepared from the transfected cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were extracted from the membrane fractions (microsomes) sedimented at 100,000 × g and were subjected to Western blot analysis for expression of the FLAG-tagged maCER1 using anti-FLAG antibody as described previously. The FLAG-maCER1 was detected in the microsomes prepared from the COS1 cells that were transfected with the expression construct (maCER1) but not with Vec (Fig. 3A). The same microsomal preparations were assayed"
https://openalex.org/W2169980652,"Comprehensive analysis of the changes in gene expression during liver regeneration was carried out by using an in-house microarray composed of 2,304 distinct mouse liver cDNA clones. Mice were subjected to partial two-thirds hepatectomy, and changes in mRNA levels were monitored up to 48 h. Of the 2,304 genes analyzed, 496 genes showed expression levels measurable at all time points after the partial hepatectomy. 317 genes were up- or down-regulated 2-fold or more at least at one time point during liver regeneration and were classified into eight clusters based on their expression patterns. With a more stringent cut-off value of ±2 S.D., 68 genes were listed and were classified into five clusters. In these two analyses with different clustering criteria, functionally categorized genes showed similar cluster distributions. Genes involved in protein synthesis and posttranslational processing were significantly enriched in the cluster characterized by rapid gene activation and subsequent persistence. This suggests the importance of modulating the efficiency of protein supply and/or altering the composition of protein population from the early phase of hepatocyte proliferation. Genes for two major liver functions, i.e. plasma protein secretion and intermediate metabolism were enriched in distinct clusters exhibiting the features of gradual gene activation and sustained repression, respectively. Therefore, these genes are differentially regulated during the regeneration, possibly leading to changes in the flow of amino acids and energy from enzyme proteins to plasma proteins in their synthesis.

Thus, clustering analysis of expression patterns of functionally classified genes gave insights into mechanism and pathophysiology of liver regeneration. Liver is unique in the ability to regenerate rapidly even in adulthood. A number of studies have been done to reveal the genes responsible for liver regeneration. Cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α, hormones and growth factors including insulin, norepinephrine, hepatocyte growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, and a number of transcription factors have been shown to be involved in liver regeneration (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 2Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While administration of these proteins and/or overexpression of their genes induced the rapid regeneration, disruption of the genes in mice resulted in severe impairment of the regeneration (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 2Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the clarification of the importance of these genes for liver regeneration, the complex mechanism for the regeneration by the interplay of many factors remains to be investigated. The expression patterns of many genes associated with liver regeneration were discussed previously (4Taub R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, a simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of the expression profiles of these genes has been difficult because of technical limitation. Recently, DNA microarray technology has been developed and shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing the expression profiles of many genes at one time (5DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). By using this technique, Su et al. (6Su A.I. Guidotti L.G. Pezacki J.P. Chisari F.V. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) revealed gene expression profiles during the priming phase of liver regeneration up to 4 h after partial hepatectomy (PHx), 1The abbreviations used are: PHx, partial hepatectomy; Hsp, heat-shock protein; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; HFH, HNF-3/fork head homolog. and demonstrated the changes in expression of 185 genes. After the priming phase, hepatocytes proliferation starts at the periportal area of the lobular architecture and then proceeds to the perivenular areas (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 7Assy N. Minuk G.Y. J. Hepatol. 1997; 26: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since the peaks of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes after PHx are around 24–40 h (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 3Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), here we analyzed the changes in gene expression up to 48 h by using an in-house microarray harboring mouse liver cDNAs. 317 genes were shown to be up- or down-regulated during the course following PHx, and their clustering analysis revealed striking features of expression profiles of functionally classified genes, giving insights into roles and regulation of genes in liver regeneration. Mice and mRNA Preparation—Male C57BL6 mice aged 5–7 weeks were obtained from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and were subjected to partial two-thirds PHx under ether anesthesia as described (8Higgins G.M. Andersen R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Two mice were sacrificed at each time point (2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after PHx), and livers were resected. Liver sections removed by original hepatectomy operation of respective mice were used as a control. Total RNA was prepared from livers using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and subjected to isolation of poly(A)+ RNA using the Oligotex-dT30 mRNA purification kit (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of the cDNA Microarray—A cDNA microarray chip, consisting of 2,304 cDNA (1,504 known genes and 800 unknown genes) was made as described previously (5DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar, 9Yoshikawa T. Nagasugi Y. Azuma T. Kato M. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. Seki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7668) Google Scholar). 2,304 unique clones were selected from about 9,000 sequenced clones in an oligo-capped cDNA library (11Suzuki Y. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) of the mouse liver. PCR-amplified cDNA products were mixed with nitrocellulose in dimethyl sulfoxide and then spotted onto carbodiimide-coated glass slides using robotics SPBIO-2000 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Yokohama, Japan). Microarray Analysis—Fluorescent cDNA probes (Cy3- or Cy5-labeled) were prepared from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. Hybridization and fluorescence detection were performed essentially as described previously (9Yoshikawa T. Nagasugi Y. Azuma T. Kato M. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. Seki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Images were analyzed with Quant Array (GSI Lumonics, Nepean, Canada) and DNASIS Array (Hitachi Software Engineering) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensities of four areas between diagonal spots were used as the background for each spot. The mean and S.D. of background levels were calculated, and the genes whose intensities were less than mean plus 2 S.D. of background levels at any of the time points were excluded from further analysis. The Cy5/Cy3 ratios of all spots on the microarray were normalized by dividing them by the median. Averaged data of the two animals were subjected to statistical analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and cross-linked with irradiation. Probes were generated using Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP. Probes and blots were hybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were performed twice and quantified using BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis and Annotation of Gene Function—The normalized Cy5/Cy3 ratios in the microarray analysis were log2-transrformed and used to classify the patterns of serial changes of the gene expression. Genes whose expression levels varied at least 2-fold or by 2 S.D. at any of the time points were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis, using the algorithm of Euclid and Ward in GeneMaths software (Applied Maths BVBA, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The molecular functions of the genes were assigned referring to GENE ONTOLOGY™ (www.geneontology.org/) and GeneCards™ (bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/). To examine statistical significance for frequencies of genes of each functional group in each cluster, values of the other groups in the relevant cluster, and values of the other clusters in the relevant group, were each combined, and the resultant combined values were compared with the relevant value with Fisher's exact test by computing for the 2 × 2 table with the statistical program StatView (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Application of the cDNA Microarray Analysis for Detection of Changes in Gene Expression during Liver Regeneration—To examine the sequential changes in gene expression during liver regeneration comprehensively, we performed cDNA microarray analysis. We selected the PHx to cause the regeneration, because the initiation time of the regeneration is very clear in this model and because effects on gene expression by tissue injury or inflammation observed in other models using chemical compounds such as carbon tetrachloride or acetyl aminofluorene are minimal in the remnant intact liver in the PHx model. Poly(A)+ RNAs derived from the liver at 2, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h after PHx and the control liver in duplicate were subjected to Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, respectively, coupled with cDNA synthesis. Both cDNAs were mixed in an equal amount, and hybridized with a microarray. We used an in-house microarray (9Yoshikawa T. Nagasugi Y. Azuma T. Kato M. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. Seki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) harboring 2,304 mouse liver cDNA clones, facilitating efficient detection of changes in gene expression in the target organ. Out of the 2,304 genes analyzed, we regarded expression of 496 genes as meaningful, because their expression levels were higher than background levels in all microarray experiments. 317 genes were up- or down-regulated 2-fold or more at least at one time point during the regeneration. To determine the validity of results obtained by the microarray analysis, 10 randomly selected genes were subjected to Northern blot analysis. While mRNAs for two genes (glutathione peroxidase and itih-4) were under the detectable level in Northern analysis (data not shown), mRNA levels of the other eight genes (S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, claudin-1, squalene synthase, virus-like retro-element, leptin receptor, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, haptoglobin, and α-1 acid glycoprotein 1B) were almost comparable between microarray and Northern analysis (Fig. 1), generally verifying the competency of the microarray analysis for detection of changes in gene expression after PHx. However, some discrepancy was present between the results of microarray and Northern experiments. Following analyses on microarray data were done with gene numbers large enough for statistical treatment. Serial Changes in Expression Levels of the Genes in Relation to Their Functions—The 317 genes with the changes in their expression levels after PHx were subjected to clustering analysis based on expression patterns and were classified into eight clusters (Table SI (see Supplemental Material) and Fig. 2A). Time course of changes in mRNA levels in each cluster can be roughly characterized as follows (Fig. 2B): cluster A, rapid increase and persistence; cluster B, transient up-regulation and gradual decrease; cluster C, gradual increase; cluster D, transient down-regulation and rebound; cluster E, rapid increase and rapid return; cluster F, transient down-regulation and gradual increase; cluster G, general decrease; cluster H, transient down-regulation and persistence. We also categorized the 317 genes based on their functions, referring to GENE ONTOLOGY™ and GeneCards™, and classified them into 11 groups (Table SI in Supplemental Material and Fig. 3): cell growth and maintenance, cytoskeleton and cell membrane, metabolism, secreted proteins, signal transduction, transcription and processing, translation and processing, mitochondrion, others, and expressed sequence tags (EST). Frequencies of these functionally classified genes in each cluster are shown in Fig. 3, with statistical significance evaluated by Fisher's exact test for high and low frequencies. Hitherto, we have used the 2-/0.5-fold changes in expression levels as cut-off values for seemingly reliable changes, which were exhibited by 17, 29, 23, 23, and 15% (amounting to 317 genes in total) of intensity-measurable 496 genes at the time points of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. The 2-/0.5-fold changes corresponded with 1.41/-1.12, 1.51/-0.75, 1.24/-0.97, 1.12/-1.34, and 1.21/-1.32 S.D. at each time point. We also tested a more stringent cut-off value of ±2 S.D., to verify the cluster-function relationship (Fig. 4). The numbers of genes that exceeded this cut-off value occupied 3.8, 4.8, 5.6, 3.2, and 5.0% (amounting to 68 genes in total) of the 496 genes at each time point. The 68 genes were classified into five clusters (a–e) by hierarchical clustering analysis. Their features are as follows: cluster a, rapid increase and rapid return; cluster b, rapid increase and persistence; cluster c, transient up-regulation and gradual decrease; cluster d, gradual increase; cluster e, general decrease. Again, frequencies of functionally categorized genes in these clusters are represented with their statistical significance (Fig. 4, right panels). Together with the results of Fig. 3, high frequencies were reproducibly observed in following gene distributions: genes for the category “translation and processing” in the cluster “rapid increase and persistence” (clusters A and b in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively); “secreted proteins” in “gradual increase” (clusters C and F and d); “metabolism” in “general decrease” (clusters G and e). We will discuss these characteristic gene distributions below, mainly based on the gene cluster classification in Table SI in Supplemental Material and Figs. 2 and 3. Activation of Genes in the Category “Translation and Processing” in the Early Stage of Liver Regeneration—Among genes in the cluster A with properties of rapid activation and following persistence, significantly frequent were members of the category “translation and processing” (Fig. 3), which are a ribosomal protein (number 19 in Table SI in Supplemental Material), elongation factors (numbers 16 and 17 in Table SI in Supplemental Material) and components of protein transport machineries (numbers 1 and 24 in Table SI in Supplemental Material). This suggests that machinery for protein synthesis, folding, and transport were prepared at the early stage of liver regeneration, presumably to synthesize and deliver proteins of altered population with modified efficiencies. Importance of adequate protein synthesis and processing for cells to pass the restriction point and enter the S phase has been repeatedly noted. When the cellular ribosome content decreases, the translation of CLN3 mRNA is inhibited, presumably leading to growth arrest (12Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Involvement of translation factors in growth regulation has been most dramatically exemplified by the fact that overexpression of the mRNA cap binding protein (eIF4E) causes deregulated cell growth and malignant transformation of rodent and human cells (13Abid M.R. Li Y. Anthony C. De Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35991-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importance of cotranslational and posttranslational protein quality control in cell cycle progression has been also stressed. For example, accumulation of misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum inhibits cyclin D1 translation and results in cell cycle arrest (14Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8505-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). After PHx, most of the hepatocytes in the residual liver should participate in one or two proliferative events theoretically, and the peak of DNA synthesis is about at 24–40 h (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 3Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of hepatocytes have to pass the restriction point and enter the S phase before this period, apparently being reflected by early activation of genes for protein-supplying machineries. Differential Regulation of Genes for Categories “Metabolism” and “Secreted Proteins”—Genes for two major live functions, i.e. intermediary metabolism and plasma protein secretion exhibited distinctive cluster assignment. The category “metabolism” is mainly composed of enzymes involved in hepatic intermediary metabolism of compounds such as sugars, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, steroids, and xenobiotics. Genes of this category were significantly enriched in the cluster G, which exhibited general features of gene repression: a majority of mRNAs were under the control level even at 24 and 48 h after PHx (Fig. 2B). Seemingly, metabolic enzymes in the liver have catalytic capacities sufficient to compensate a two-thirds loss of the liver by PHx, presumably being aided also by prolongation of half-lives of the enzyme proteins during the regeneration. In fact, the degradation rate of protein decreases in the regenerating liver (15Swick R.W. Ip M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the category “secreted proteins” contains plasma proteins as a large majority and a small number of proteins involved in local liver function. Genes of this category were enriched in the clusters C and F, which are characterized by gradual increases in mRNA levels despite down-regulation, if any, in the early periods. Most of mRNAs were above the control level at 24 and 48 h following PHx (Fig. 2B). This may reflect at least two aspects in regulation of plasma protein levels. One is induction of acute phase proteins such as fibrinogen subunits (numbers 53 and 65 in Table SI in Supplemental Material), α-1 acid glycoprotein 1B (number 70 in Table SI in Supplemental Material), C-reactive protein (number 137 in Table SI in Supplemental Material) and complement components (number 151 in Table SI in Supplemental Material), in response to systemic injury following PHx. The other is supplementation of constitutive plasma proteins that are under constant turnover: the two-thirds PHx seems to impose upregulation of plasma protein synthesis on the one-third remnant liver. Thus, syntheses of hepatic enzymes and plasma proteins seem to be regulated in the opposite direction. Amino acids and energy saved by decreased synthesis of enzyme proteins are likely to be turned toward plasma protein synthesis during liver regeneration. Remarkable Genes with Altered Expression Levels during Liver Regeneration—Claudin-1 (number 66 in Table SI in Supplemental Material) in the cluster C is an integral membrane protein of tight junctions (16Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Previously, a related factor claudin-3 was reported to be up-regulated during liver regeneration (17Takaki Y. Hirai S. Manabe N. Izumi Y. Hirose T. Nakaya M. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Akimoto K. Tsukita S. Shuin T. Ohno S. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Behavior of tight junctions during cell division is potentially very interesting. 55.11 binding protein (number 63 in Table SI in Supplemental Material, also designated TRAP2) in the cluster C is a regulatory component of the 26S proteasome and binds to the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (18Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Wallach D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), possibly allowing direct regulation of the proteasome by the receptor (19Tsurumi C. Shimizu Y. Saeki M. Kato S. Demartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Yamasaki M. Hendil K.B. Toh-e A. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Heat shock protein (Hsp) 84-1 (number 64 in Table SI in Supplemental Material, also designated Hsp84 and Hsp90) in the cluster C was previously shown to be induced during liver regeneration (20Carr B.I. Huang T.H. Buzin C.H. Itakura K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5106-5111PubMed Google Scholar), and was recently reported to participate also in tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of IκB kinase (21Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3β (number 116 in Table SI in Supplemental Material, also designated Foxa2) was among the four members of the cluster E, which exhibited a striking expression profile of rapid transient augmentation. HNF-3α, -3β, and -3γ are members of the winged helix/fork head transcription factor family and regulate a number of hepatocyte-specific genes (22Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 23Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Another related member HNF-3/fork head homolog (HFH)-11B (Foxm1) was shown to be up-regulated during the regeneration (24Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In HFH-11B-overexpressing transgenic mice, the onset of hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis during liver regeneration was accelerated (25Ye H. Holterman A.X. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the winged helix/fork head transcription factor family including HNF-3β seems to play important roles in liver regeneration. Quiescin Q6 (number 153 in Table SI in Supplemental Material) in the cluster F was originally identified as a protein strongly induced when fibroblasts enter reversible quiescence, suggesting a role in growth regulation (26Thorpe C. Hoober K.L. Raje S. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Turi G.K. Coppock D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, this protein was shown to be a sulfhydryl oxidase that catalyzes formation of disulfide bonds in reduced proteins (27Benayoun B. Esnard-Feve A. Castella S. Courty Y. Esnard F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13830-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quiescin Q6 was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus as well as outside the cell and seems to be involved in oxidative folding of various proteins including secreted ones (26Thorpe C. Hoober K.L. Raje S. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Turi G.K. Coppock D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consistently, Quiescin Q6 resides in the cluster F that harbors a number of secreted proteins, the candidate substrates of the enzyme. The observation that mRNA level of Quiescin Q6 is still increasing at 48 h after PHx (Table SI in Supplemental Material) is also concordant with the notion that this enzyme might play a role in growth arrest of the regenerating liver, and it remains to be investigated. In conclusion, the present comprehensive study with cDNA microarray analysis and following statistical analysis revealed remarkable features of changes in gene expression during liver regeneration after PHx. It is plausible that early activation of genes for protein synthesis and processing is essential for hepatocytes to enter the S phase. Prolonged activation of plasma protein genes and repression of metabolic enzyme genes suggest dynamic changes in the flow of amino acids and energy in protein synthesis. A number of remarkable individual genes were also identified. These results shed light on mechanism and pathophysiology of the liver regeneration. We thank M. Tagawa, K. Fukai, T. Kanda, M.

https://openalex.org/W1689188863,"The first directed mutant of a higher plant ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), constructed by chloroplast transformation, is catalytically impaired but still able to support the plant's photosynthesis and growth (Whitney, S. M., von Caemmerer, S., Hudson, G. S., and Andrews, T. J. (1999) Plant Physiol. 121, 579–588). This mutant enzyme has a Leu to Val substitution at residue 335 in the flexible loop 6 of the large subunit, which closes over the substrate during catalysis. Its active site was intact, as judged by its barely impaired competency in the initial enolization step of the reaction sequence, and its ability to bind tightly the intermediate analog, 2′-carboxy-d-arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate. Prompted by observations that the mutant enzyme displayed much less slow inhibition during catalysis in vitro than the wild type, its tendency to catalyze side reactions and its response to the slow inhibitor d-xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate were studied. The lessening in slow inhibition was not caused by reduced production of inhibitory side products. Except for pyruvate production, these reactions were strongly enhanced by the mutation, as was the ability to catalyze the carboxylation of d-xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Rather, reduced inhibition was the result of lessened sensitivity to these inhibitors. The slow isomerization phase that characterizes inhibition of the wild-type enzyme by d-xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate was completely eliminated by the mutation, and the mutant was more adept than the wild type in catalyzing the benzylic acid-type rearrangement of d-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate (produced by oxidation of the substrate, d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate). These observations are consistent with increased flexibility of loop 6 induced by the mutation, and they reveal the underlying mechanisms by which the side reactions cause slow inhibition.

Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and intensive mutagenic study of algal (3Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and bacterial (7Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar) Rubiscos, progress toward understanding the catalytic mechanism has been hampered by an inability to express the dominant higher plant form of the enzyme in heterologous hosts. This precluded application of the power of directed mutagenesis to the higher plant enzyme until Whitney et al. (8Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) constructed the first such mutant by chloroplast transformation in the natural host, tobacco. Because it was desirable to maintain photosynthetic viability, a mutation (a Leu to Val substitution at residue 335 of the plastid-encoded large subunit) was chosen with the aim of changing the kinetic parameters (particularly the CO2/O2 specificity (9Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) as much as possible without seriously disabling catalytic performance at elevated CO2 concentration. The substitution successfully reduced the CO2/O2 specificity 4-fold, and the Michaelis constants for CO2, O2, and ribulose-P2 2- to 10-fold, while retaining sufficient substrate-saturated activity to allow growth under CO2 enrichment. The changes were readily apparent in the photosynthetic characteristics of the leaves of the mutant plant (8Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Leu-335 is located near the apex of loop 6 of the Rubisco large subunit, which closes over the active site after ribulose-P2 binds (6Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The adjacent residue, Lys-334, is catalytically essential, and it makes contacts with the P1 phosphate and the C2 carboxylate formed by addition of CO2 (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), which stabilize the transition state for carboxylation (11Lorimer G.H. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9018-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Leu-335 residue makes van der Waals contacts with the P2 phosphate (attached to C5 of the substrate) (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus the effects of the Val-335 substitution were interpreted in terms of its alteration of the position and orientation of the critical ϵN of Lys-334 (8Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to carboxylation and oxygenation, Rubisco also catalyzes other reactions leading from the intermediates of the central two catalytic pathways (Scheme 1) (2Roy H. Andrews T.J. Leegood R.C. Sharkey T.D. von Caemmerer S. Photosynthesis: Physiology and Metabolism. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2000: 53-83Google Scholar). The initial step of catalysis is the formation of an enediol (VI) from ribulose-P2 (V). This enediol is subject to misprotonation to form xylulose-P2 (I) and perhaps other pentulose bisphosphate isomers and β elimination to form deoxypentodiulose-P (II). The peroxyketone intermediate of the oxygenation pathway (X) eliminates H2O2, producing pentodiulose-P2 (XI), which rearranges to carboxytetritol-P2 (XII). The aci-acid form of P-glycerate (VIII), produced following C2/C3 cleavage of the carboxyketone (VII), β eliminates its phosphate group, forming pyruvate (III). Some of these side reactions are enhanced by certain mutations (12Morell M.K. Paul K. O'Shea N.J. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. J. Biol.

Paul K. O'Shea N.J. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8091-8098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of their mimicry of ribulose-P2 or its enediolized form, the bisphosphate by-products are slow binding, competitive inhibitors of Rubisco catalysis. They have been implicated in the slow decline in Rubisco activity during in vitro assay (the so-called “fallover” phenomenon) that is always observed naturally with the higher plant enzyme (19Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although pentodiulose-P2 (XI) and carboxytetritol-P2 (XII) are so far only known to be produced by mutant Rubiscos (14Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11741-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Harpel M.R. Serpersu E.H. Lamerdin J.A. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11296-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the former is particularly significant, because it is present in all ribulose-P2 preparations by virtue of spontaneous oxidation and will further accumulate by this process during the usual aerobic Rubisco assays (25Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To mitigate fallover inhibition of Rubisco in vivo, higher plants have Rubisco activase, a motor protein powered by ATP hydrolysis that apparently manipulates the active site of Rubisco to remove bound bisphosphates (3Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 28Portis A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Here we show that the perturbation of loop 6 caused by the Val-335 substitution affects catalysis more pervasively than can be explained by a simple misorientation of the adjacent Lys-334. The alteration exacerbates the inhibitor-producing side reactions, but the changed structure and dynamics of the loop permit the inhibitors to escape from, or be rearranged by, the active site. As a result, fallover inhibition during catalysis is suppressed or eliminated, depending on conditions, revealing the underlying causes of the phenomenon and suggesting how it may have evolved. Materials—Wild-type tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Petit Havana [N,N]) was grown in a naturally illuminated glasshouse. The plastome mutant that produces Rubisco with a Leu to Val mutation at residue 335 of the large subunit (8Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was grown in an artificially illuminated growth cabinet in an atmosphere containing 0.3% (v/v) CO2. Wild-type and L335V Rubiscos were purified either by crystallization as described previously (29Servaites J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or by polyethylene glycol precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q, Amersham Biosciences) using a procedure similar to that described for spinach Rubisco (18Morell M.K. Wilkin J.-M. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5445-5451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tobacco Rubisco concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, assuming that the protein concentration in mg·ml–1 is given by A 280 × 0.7 (30Kung S.D. Chollet R. Marsho T.V. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 326-336Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1-3H- and 3-2H-labeled and unlabeled ribulose-P2 were synthesized as described (25Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Van Dyk D.E. Schloss J.V. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5145-5156Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and carboxy-14C-labeled carboxypentitol-P2 were synthesized, and carboxyarabinitol-P2 was purified from these preparations as described (32Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Xylulose-P2 was synthesized from glycolaldehyde-2-phosphate, prepared by periodate oxidation of d-ribose-5-phosphate (33Loring H.S. Levy L.W. Moss L.K. Ploeser J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3724-3727Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate using rabbit muscle aldolase (34Byrne W.L. Lardy H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 14: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and purified by the same anion-exchange chromatographic procedure used for ribulose-P2 (25Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All bisphosphate preparations were desalted by using Sephadex G-10 chromatography (25Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Measurement of Activity—Ribulose-P2 carboxylase activity was determined at 25 °C using a modification of a spectrophotometric assay (35Lilley R.M. Walker D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 358: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Rubisco was activated at 50 °C for 10 min in 100 mm EPPS-NaOH buffer solution, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaHCO3. Each assay solution (2 ml) contained 100 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ribulose-P2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 20 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mg·ml–1 carbonic anhydrase, 25 units·ml–1 creatine phosphokinase, 25 units·ml–1 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 20 units·ml–1 glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, 55 units·ml–1 triose phosphate isomerase, and 20 units·ml–1 glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of activated Rubisco (3–12 nm active sites), and A 340 was measured at 5-s intervals for 2000 s. When anaerobic conditions were required, the buffer was pre-sparged with N2 before addition of 20 mm NaHCO3, and the assays were carried out in septum-capped cuvettes with the headspace flushed with N2. Characteristically of higher plant Rubisco (19Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), activity declined exponentially from an initial rate (νi) to reach a final, steady-state rate (νf). Data for product accumulation versus time were fitted to the following equation (19Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), [product]=vi-vfkobs(1-e-kobst)+vft(Eq. 1) where k obs is the observed first-order rate constant. Residual activity versus time was plotted using the parameter estimates obtained and the differentiated form of Equation 1, in Equation 2. vvi=1-vfvie-kobst+vfvi(Eq. 2) Xylulose-P2 carboxylase activity was measured using the same method, but with 25–50 μm xylulose-P2 instead of ribulose-P2, and using 0.5–2.0 μm active sites. Controls lacking Rubisco or ATP showed no activity. Enolization of Ribulose-P2—The enolization rate was measured by NMR spectrometry by observing the rate at which the deuteron of [3-2H]ribulose-P2 was exchanged with a proton from solution. Assays were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) 2H2O, and 2.9 mm [3-2H]ribulose-P2. Reactions were initiated by the addition of Rubisco (to 3 μm sites) that had been activated as described above. Spectra were collected at 2-min intervals using a Varian INOVA 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. The water resonance was suppressed by the W5 WATERGATE pulse (36Liu M.L. Mao X.A. Ye C.H. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 132: 125-129Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The increasing intensity of the resonance at 4.37 ppm due to the 3-H proton with time was fitted to an exponential equation, and the initial rate was corrected for the 10% 2H2O present in the solvent. No exchange occurred in controls lacking enzyme. Reaction Products—Assays were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 100 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm [1-3H]ribulose-P2. Assays under carboxylating conditions used buffer that had been sparged with N2 before the addition of 20 mm NaHCO3; assays under predominantly oxygenating conditions used buffer that had been sparged with O2 and had a final concentration of NaHCO3 (carried over with the preactivated enzyme solution) of 10 μm. Assays were initiated with preactivated enzyme (described earlier) to a final concentration of 3.7 μm active sites and terminated at 10 min after complete consumption of the ribulose-P2. To measure the total reaction products, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Denatured protein was removed using a Millipore Ultrafree-MC filter unit (M r 10,000 cutoff) and the filtrate was loaded onto a Amersham Biosciences Mono Q 5/5 column equilibrated with 10 mm EPPS/10 mm boric acid/NaOH, pH 8.0, and the reaction products were separated using a NaCl gradient. The radioactively labeled compounds were detected by online scintillation counting (Ultima-Flo, Packard). The contributions of ribulose-P2 and xylulose-P2 to the unresolved pentulose bisphosphate peak were measured by collecting the peak, treating with alkaline phosphatase at pH 9.3, and carrying out chromatographic analysis of the pentuloses at 85 °C on a water-equilibrated Bio-Rad HPX-87C column. To measure products that remained bound to the enzyme, the reactions were terminated by ultrafiltration (as described above) before denaturation. The retentate was washed with four 400-μl aliquots of buffer before elution of the bound products with a 10 mm EPPS/10 mm boric acid/NaOH, pH 8.0, 2% (w/v) SDS and chromatographic analysis as described above. Radioactivity in the wash fractions was measured by scintillation counting. Products that remained bound after complete consumption of oxidized ribulose-P2 were analyzed using a similar procedure. [1-3H]Ribulose-P2 (50 μm) was oxidized for 3 h with 1 mm CuSO4 as described (25Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oxidized [1-3H]ribulose-P2 (8 μm) was reacted at room temperature for 10 min with 10 μm preactivated Rubisco active sites in 50 mm EPPS-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm NaHCO3 before separation of Rubisco-bound radioactivity from unbound by gel filtration on a 1- × 20-cm column of Sephadex G-50 fine (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer solution. The protein peak was collected, and the radioactivity it contained was measured and released by adding SDS to 2% (w/v). Denatured protein was removed by ultrafiltration, and an aliquot of the filtrate was chromatographed as described above. In some further experiments, 5 mm H2O2 was included in the solution during consumption of the oxidized ribulose-P2 by Rubisco; in others, addition of the H2O2 was delayed until 5 min after mixing the oxidized ribulose-P2 with Rubisco. Rubisco-bound radioactivity was separated by gel filtration and measured. The rate of pyruvate production during catalysis was measured spectrophotometrically as described (37Andrews T.J. Kane H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9447-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with the rate of P-glycerate production measured with the standard assay described above. Assays Under CO2 and O2 Limitation—Continuous spectrophotometric assays were conducted in N2-sparged, septum-capped cuvettes with a minimal initial CO2/HCO3- concentration (50–100 μm), limited to that carried over with the preactivated enzyme preparation (activated as described above), and in the presence of excess ribulose-P2 (1 mm), so that ample ribulose-P2 remained after CO2/HCO3- exhaustion. Deoxypentodiulose-P formation was measured from the absorbance of its quinoxaline adduct with o-phenylenediamine as described by Morell et al. (18Morell M.K. Wilkin J.-M. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5445-5451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with a final Rubisco concentration of 10 μm active sites used to initiate the assay. Xylulose-P2 formation was measured using a method based on that described by Edmondson et al. (22Edmondson D.L. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 62-66Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in a buffer solution containing 100 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg·ml–1 rabbit muscle aldolase, 0.15 mg·ml–1 rabbit muscle glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mm NADH, and 1 mm ribulose-P2. Reactions were initiated by addition of preactivated Rubisco (final concentration, 4 μm active sites), and the rate of decrease in A340 was measured. Both assays were conducted at 25 °C for 10 min after initiation, and rates of absorbance change in controls lacking enzyme were subtracted. Inhibition by Xylulose-P2—Rapid equilibrium inhibition by xylulose-P2 (competitive with respect to ribulose-P2) was measured as described (38McCurry S.D. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8344-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by adding preactivated enzyme (final concentration, 12 nm sites) to initiate spectrophotometric assays containing mixtures of ribulose-P2 (2.5–320 μm) and xylulose-P2 (0–40 μm). Initial activities for each substrate/inhibitor combination were measured, and the data for all combinations were fitted simultaneously to the hyperbolic equation for competitive inhibition to estimate the Km (ribulose-P2) and Ki (xylulose-P2). Slow inhibition of initially fully carbamylated Rubisco was monitored using a method based on that of Zhu and Jensen (23Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rubisco (0.05–1 μm sites) was fully carbamylated by incubation with 100 mm EPPS-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA. Then 0.4–500 μm xylulose-P2 was added, and, at intervals thereafter, assays were initiated by adding a 200-μl sample of this mixture to a 2-ml spectrophotometric assay mixture as described above. Initial activities were measured, the data were analyzed, and the various parameters were estimated as described below. Inhibition by Carboxyarabinitol-P2—Binding of carboxyarabinitol-P2 to Rubisco was measured using the method of Pierce et al. (32Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), adapted for use with the spectrophotometric assay. Rubisco (10–50 nm sites) was fully carbamylated by incubation with 100 mm EPPS-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, and the other components required for the spectrophotometric assay (see above). Then 0.1–2.0 μm carboxyarabinitol-P2 was added and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for various periods before assays were initiated by adding ribulose-P2 to 0.5 mm. The initial activities measured decayed exponentially as a function of the duration of incubation with carboxyarabinitol-P2. The data were analyzed, and the various parameters were estimated as described below. Release of carboxypentitol-P2 was measured by observing the exchange of enzyme-bound [14C]carboxypentitol-P2 with unbound, unlabeled carboxypentitol-P2 using a gel-filtration procedure to separate bound and unbound label (32Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Analysis of Slow Binding Inhibition—Both xylulose-P2 and carboxyarabinitol-P2 are slow binding inhibitors of Rubisco. This has been modeled previously as a two-step process (32Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar): an initial rapid equilibrium interaction with the active site that competes with the substrate, ribulose-P2, followed by a slow isomerization of the initial complex to a much tighter complex that is likely to be associated with closure of flexible loops of the protein over the ligand within the active site (39Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). E+I⇌k2k1EI⇌k4k3EI*(Eq. 3) where E represents enzyme, I, the inhibitor, EI the complex in rapid equilibrium with E and I, EI*, the slowly or non-exchanging complex, and k 1 to k 4 are the rate constants of the individual forward and reverse reactions. Assuming that k 3 and k 4 are much smaller than k 1 and k 2 and that [I] ≫ [E], the rate equation for this process is, vvi=EaEt=1-k4kobse-kobst+k4kobs(Eq. 4) where kobs=k3Iki+I+k4(Eq. 5) and ν is the Rubisco activity at time t, νi is the Rubisco activity at time zero, E a (= [E] + [EI]) and E t are the concentrations of non-tightly complexed and total Rubisco active sites, respectively, I is the inhibitor concentration, and Ki = k 2/k 1. When k 4 = 0 (i.e. the tight complex is non-exchangeable and inhibition proceeds to completion, as it does with carboxyarabinitol-P2), these relationships simplify to those used previously (32Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); however, if k 4 is finite, inhibition proceeds until an equilibrium is reached at which a portion of the enzyme remains unsequestered in the tight complex and active. This active fraction is given by, vfvt=EaEt=k4kobs(Eq. 6) where νf is the final activity after preincubation to equilibrium. Because of the saturation of the rate of inhibitor binding inherent in the model"
https://openalex.org/W1968048262,"Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and their associated GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) are key regulatory elements in the signal transduction machinery that relays information from the extracellular environment into specific intracellular responses. Among them, the MAPK cascades represent ubiquitous downstream effector pathways. We have previously described that, analogous to the Ras-dependent activation of the Erk-1/2 pathway, members of the Rho family of small G-proteins activate the JNK cascade when GTP is loaded by their corresponding GEFs. Searching for novel regulators of JNK activity we have identified Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP) as a strong activator of JNK-1. Epac is a member of a growing family of GEFs that specifically display exchange activity on the Rap subfamily of Ras small G-proteins. We report here that while Epac activates the JNK severalfold, a constitutively active (G12V) mutant of Rap1b does not, suggesting that Rap-GTP is not sufficient to transduce Epac-dependent JNK activation. Moreover, Epac signaling to the JNKs was not blocked by inactivation of endogenous Rap, suggesting that Rap activation is not necessary for this response. Consistent with these observations, domain deletion mutant analysis shows that the catalytic GEF domain is dispensable for Epac-mediated activation of JNK. These studies identified a region overlapping the Ras exchange motif domain as critical for JNK activation. Consistent with this, an isolated Ras exchange motif domain from Epac is sufficient to activate JNK. We conclude that Epac signals to the JNK cascade through a new mechanism that does not involve its canonical catalytic action, i.e. Rap-specific GDP/GTP exchange. This represents not only a novel way to activate the JNKs but also a yet undescribed mechanism of downstream signaling by Epac.

(exchange protein activated by cAMP) is a newly discovered guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that selectively activates members of the Rap family of G-proteins (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T.

Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 5Kitashama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) that function as allosteric regulatory elements, switching between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound conformation (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The switch mechanism consists of activation by exchange of bound GDP for GTP, and inactivation by hydrolysis of GTP into GDP, catalyzed by GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), respectively. Similar to all GEFs, Epac acts catalytically on the rate-limiting step for G-protein activation, i.e. dissociation of bound GDP (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The involvement of Rap1 in signaling mechanisms is demonstrated by the variety of second messengers mediating its activation. Recently, a number of exchange factors were identified as mediators of these specific activities (6Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Among them, Epac was characterized as a molecule responsible for cAMP-dependent Rap1 activation (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 2Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki S.T. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Epac is a multidomain protein comprised of a COOH-terminal catalytic and an NH2-terminal regulatory module. The COOH-terminal module encompasses the Rap-specific GEF catalytic core and the Ras exchange motif (REM) (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). According to the structure solved for SOS GEF, the REM domain does not provide any catalytic residues but rather participates in GEF stability (7Boriack-Sjodin A.P. Margarit M.S. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal regulatory module contains a DEP domain whose function seems to be related to membrane/cytoskeleton association, and a cAMP-binding domain (CBD) homologous to the CBD originally identified in the regulatory subunit of PKA (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Although cAMP binding and GEF activity are energetically uncoupled processes (8Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), deletion of the NH2-terminal regulatory module renders a constitutively active (cAMP-independent) GEF, which is suggestive of an auto-inhibitory mechanism that is relieved upon cAMP binding (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) represent an example of fundamental biochemical processes regulated by G-proteins (9Gutkind, J. S. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/40/RE1.Google Scholar). Three major MAP kinase cascades have been described so far (10Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar): the Ras-dependent MAPKs as ERK-1/2 are typically associated with cell proliferation (11Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4354) Google Scholar). The stress-activated proteins kinases (SAPKs) as the c-Jun kinase or JNK and the p38 kinases are triggered in response to environmental stresses (13Davis R.D. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar, 14Martin-Blanco E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), although they have also been linked to proliferative conditions depending on the cellular setting (9Gutkind, J. S. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/40/RE1.Google Scholar, 12Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4354) Google Scholar). The discovery of additional MAPKs as ERK-5 and others add diversity to the MAPK scenario (15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2864) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades that end in MAPKs and regulate their activity include several sequential events of phosphorylation in the cytoplasm that define phosphorylation cascades. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation at two residues, a tyrosine and a threonine by kinases known as MAPKKs (16Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 82-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Particularly JNK is activated by the prototypical JNKKs, MKK4 (SEK1) and MKK7 (SEK2), which are in turn activated by upstream phosphorylation events. A large group of JNKKKs has been reported (13Davis R.D. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the activation of these JNKKKs, and the link between a specific stress signal and its mediators are still ill defined. The module SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk-1–2 constitutes a typical example of a MAPK signaling pathway (10Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar). In recent years we have contributed to the development of the dominant concept that probably all of the MAPKs are activated in an analogous fashion when we discovered that Dbl, a GEF specific for the Rho family of small G-proteins, can activate the JNK pathway (17Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Termoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) through the Rho family members Rac and Cdc42 and a series of kinases that include MLK3, MEKK, and SEK (17Coso O.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It is well now established that the Rho-like small G-proteins Rac and Cdc42 represent a link between environmental stimuli and JNK activation (21Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These G-proteins as well as their corresponding GEFs are also regulators of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). Expression of the small G-protein Rap1b in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induces an anchorage-dependent transformed phenotype (23Ribeiro-Neto F. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), accompanied by changes in focal contacts and actin cytoskeleton. 2D. Altschuler, unpublished observations.2D. Altschuler, unpublished observations. These results prompted us to address whether Rap G-proteins, like Rac and Rho, might participate in signaling to the JNKs. Unexpectedly, we have found that Epac effectively signals to the JNK pathway, while its cognate G-protein Rap1b does not. Our studies identified a new function for the Rap-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac: JNK activation, which is independent of Rap1 activation and unrelated to its GEF activity. Moreover, this signal is specific for JNK, since other SAPKs like p38 MAPK are not activated. We can circumscribe downstream signaling to JNK to a region in Epac devoid of exchange activity on Rap, the REM domain, which is sufficient to activate JNK. This is to our knowledge not only the first report of a transduction mechanism that connects this GEF to the MAPKs acting independently of its G-protein counterpart but also describes a novel, Rap-independent, Epac function. Cell Lines and Transfections—HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, adjusting the total amount of plasmid DNA to 3–6 μg/plate with empty vector. Additional transfections were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), adjusting the total amount of DNA plasmid to 0.5–1 μg/plate as directed by the manufacturer. Kinase Assays—48 h after transfection, cells were starved with serum free media for 2 h, stimulated if necessary, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mMMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. AU5-JNK was precipitated from the cleared lysates by incubation with the specific antibody against AU5 (MMS-135R, Covance) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Complexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma-Bind Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz) and washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium vanadate, once with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and three times in kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). The JNK activity present in the inmunoprecipitates was determined by resuspension in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction and 20 μm unlabeled ATP, using 1 μg of purified bacterially expressed, GST-ATF2 protein as substrate. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. Autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. Parallel inmunoprecipitates were processed for Western blot analysis using the same antiserum as described previously (17Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Termoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

The Epac REM and DEP domains were isolated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides 5′-acGGATCCacagtgatgtctggcacc-3′ and 5′-tgGAATTCtcactgctcgctgccacccgc-3′ for REM and 5′-acGGATCCatgacccgagaccggaagtacc-3′ and 5′-gaGAATTCgtagaattgggcatctcg-3′ for DEP. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and ligated in the corresponding sites in a pCEFL-GST vector. pCEFL GST-REM expresses amino acids 345–410 from Epac as a GST fusion protein. The same is true for amino acids 74–140 from Epac in pCEFL-GSTDEP. Western Blots—Lysates taken from transfected cells, containing similar amounts of protein, were analyzed for protein expression levels by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, with the corresponding antibodies.

Rap Activation Assay Using RalGDS-RBD—Cells transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-Rap1b were lysed with a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 μm aprotinin. Lysis was performed at 4 °C for 10–30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at maximal speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. 10 μg of bacterially expressed RalGDS-RBD (26Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the supernatants and incubated at 4 °C for 60min with slight agitation. Beads were washed four times in the same lysis buffer. After the final wash, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples. Proteins were fractionated in a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. HA-Rap1-GTP was visualized by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody as described previously (17Coso O.A.

Epac Is a JNK Activator—Expression of the Rap1-specific GEF Epac into HEK-293T cells triggered a strong JNK response, about a 6-fold increase in its kinase activity. This Epac-mediated effect was similar in magnitude to the one produced by canonical JNK activators as Onc-Dbl and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (Fig. 1, upper panel and bars). The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows that coexpression of the GEFs did not alter the JNK protein levels, which is indicative of changes in specific JNK activity rather than changes in the amount of enzyme present. As reported previously for MAPK activation (27Karim M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), parallel experiments showed that a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-JNK fusion protein translocates to the nucleus upon contransfection with plasmids that express Epac or Onc-Dbl (data not shown). Opposite to Epac, a Constitutively Active Mutant of Rap1b Fails to Stimulate JNK Activity—We have previously found that expression of constitutively active forms of small G-proteins of the Rho subfamily were highly effective in triggering JNK activation to levels comparable with its corresponding GEFs, Ost and Dbl (17Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Termoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Epac is a Rap-specific GEF that turns out to be a significant JNK activator (Fig. 1). If its effects on JNK activity are conveyed through Rap activation, we reasoned that expression of a constitutively active Rap form should fully mimic the action of Epac. We found that while Rac1QL and Epac display a 5-fold induction in JNK activation (Fig. 2A), expression of a GTPase-deficient form of Rap1b (RapG12V) did not produce any changes in JNK activity, despite high levels of expression as measured in Western blots (Fig. 2, A and B). The HA-RapG12V construct is expressed on its active form when transfected into HEK-293T cells as shown by its ability to bind to the Rap binding domain of RalGDS, which binds Rap1 on its active GTP-bound conformation (not shown). These results demonstrate that in contrast to Epac, Rap1b-G12V does not activate JNK, suggesting that the enzymatic activity described for Epac (GTP loading unto Rap) is not sufficient to transduce the effects of Epac on JNK activity. Rap Activity Is Not Necessary for Epac-mediated JNK Activation—Results from the two preceding sections suggest two potential alternatives for Epac signaling. One of them would be mediated by Rap activation, as has been previously demonstrated, while the other one would be Rap-independent. The first scenario should be mimicked by expression of RapG12V; meanwhile, the second one should not be altered by the presence of Rap inhibitory molecules. We observed no JNK activation by RapG12V; therefore, to assess the second possibility, endogenous Rap1 was inactivated, and the effects of Epac on JNK were tested. Rap1 inactivation was attained by expression of two inhibitory molecules: dominant negative RapN17 and RapGAP, which inactivate Rap by different mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that RapGAP that inactivates active Rap-GTP by driving the equilibrium toward its inactive Rap-GDP form (25Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.F. Zwartkruis F.J.T. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) did not modify Epac-mediated JNK activity despite these proteins being expressed at high levels (Fig. 3B) and able to inhibit Epac-mediated Rap1 activation (see below). Like the so-called dominant negative RasN17 mutant (28Powers S. O'Neill K. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), RapN17 inhibits activation of endogenous Rap by binding and sequestering GEFs, upstream activators of Rap1. As expected, expression of RapN17 partially inhibited Epac activation of JNK activity (Fig. 3A). This seemingly contradictory result could be explained assuming that RapN17 is actually an inhibitor of the upstream GEF regulator Epac, and not of the small G-protein itself, acting presumably through titration of “free” Epac molecules, thereby preventing Epac actions including JNK activation. Since RapG12V does not mimic the action of Epac on JNK, and expression of a downstream negative regulator of Rap1 (RapGAP) has no effect on Epac-stimulated JNK activity, we conclude that Rap1 activity should not be necessary for Epac-mediated JNK activation. Stimulation of JNK by Epac Is Independent of Its cAMP-dependent GEF Activity—The general organization of Epac is schematized in Fig. 4A. The COOH-terminal domain contains the catalytic exchange core (GEF), responsible for the GDP/GTP exchange on Rap. The NH2-terminal regulatory domain negatively modulates this catalytic activity. Binding of cAMP to the CBD site in this NH2-terminal domain relieves the negative constrain, leading to GEF-dependent Rap activation (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Accordingly, deletion of the NH2-terminal domain, including the CBD, renders a constitutively active GEF mutant (Δ-Epac), which maximally activates Rap1 even in the absence of agonist stimulation (cAMP) (1Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if Rap exchange activity is involved in JNK signaling, maximum JNK activation should be observed when Δ-Epac dose responses are compared with full-length Epacs, working in the absence of cAMP stimulation. In other words, when measuring JNK activity the dose-response curve to Epac should present a higher EC50 relative to that of Δ-Epac. In addition, cAMP-signaling agents should potentiate Epac′, but not Δ-Epac′, dose-response curves. As shown in Fig. 4B, Epac and Δ-Epac stimulation of JNK activity showed identical profiles in the absence of cAMP stimulation. A 15-min treatment with forskolin, a cAMP-elevating agent, did not increase JNK activity induced by either Epac versions (not shown). We verified that Δ-Epac is functional as a Rap1GEF, as shown by GST-RalGDS-RBD pull-down assays (Fig. 4C). Moreover, coexpression of RapGAP reduced the amount of pulled HA-Rap to values below basal, thus confirming that the observed Δ-Epac-induced increase in HA-Rap represents active GTP-loaded Rap. In addition, RapGAP coexpression did not affect JNK activation by Δ-Epac (data not shown). We conclude that Epac stimulation of JNK is independent of cAMP-mediated Epac exchange activity on Rap1b. Epac-mediated JNK Activation Is Dissociated from the GEF Activity of Epac—Although the results described above strongly suggest that the nucleotide exchange on Rap1 Epac is not involved in Epac-mediated JNK activation, we directly tested this premise experimentally. We asked whether the presence of the GEF domain was necessary for Epac-mediated JNK activation. A construct containing the NH2-terminal regulatory domain (N-Epac), but devoid of the catalytic GEF domain, was sufficient to activate JNK at levels comparable with both Epac and Δ-Epac (Fig. 5A, compare with Figs. 3A and 4B). As expected, Δ-Epac stimulated the loading of GTP onto Rap1, while N-Epac did not (Fig. 5B). Most importantly, while the JNK stimulating activity of full-length Epac was partially sensitive to RapN17 (Fig. 3A), the JNK response to N-Epac was completely resistant to both Rap inhibitory molecules RapN17 and RapGAP (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate unequivocally that Epac activation of JNK is independent of its guanine nucleotide exchange function. Finding a New Effector Domain in Epac; a Role for the REM Domain in JNK Activation—What is the minimal domain of Epac responsible for downstream signaling into JNK? The three Epac versions used in this study (Epac, N-Epac, and Δ-Epac) activate JNK comparably with known JNK activators such as Dbl or anisomycin. That N-Epac fully mimics the effect of full-length Epac on JNK suggests that the JNK activation domain of Epac resides outside the GEF domain in a region common to the three mutants. That Δ-Epac is as a potent JNK activator as N-Epac suggests that the minimal Epac domain responsible for downstream signaling into JNK is a region encompassing the REM domain (amino acids 345–410), which is common to these three constructs (Fig. 4A). To assess this possibility we decided to isolate the REM domain and challenge its ability to activate JNK; another Epac region that contains the DEP domain was also isolated as a control, and both were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Fig. 6 shows that while being expressed to the same levels (Fig. 6A), GST-DEP did not induce changes in JNK activity but GST-REM exerted an effect comparable with N-Epac (Fig. 6B). We understand that the REM domain of Epac is responsible for this JNK activatio"

Here we have investigated the possibility that JIP1 may also affect the catalytic activity of Akt1, a serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in multiple cellular processes, including survival and proliferation. JIP1 expression enhanced Akt1 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner following serum starvation in 293 cells. Cellular activation of Akt1 following stimulation with low concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) was elevated in the presence of JIP1. JIP1 expression also prolonged Akt1 stimulation after a short IGF-1 pulse. The mechanism of JIP1-mediated Akt1 activation involved JIP1 protein binding to the Akt1 pleckstrin homology domain, which in turn promoted the phosphorylation of the activation T-loop of Akt1 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. These results suggest that, in certain cellular contexts, JIP1 may act as an Akt1 scaffold, which regulates the enzymatic activity of Akt1. This study also indicates that JIP1 expression can exert signaling effects independent of JNK activity.

An important positive modulatory phosphorylation occurs within a short C-terminal hydrophobic stretch on Akt Ser-473 (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

The identity of the one or more kinases, such as PDK2, that phosphorylate this site remains controversial (14Chan, T. O., and Tsichlis, P. N. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/66/pe1.Google Scholar) We have recently found that JIP1 interacts directly with Akt1 (15Kim A.H. Yano H. Cho H. Meyer D. Monks B. Margolis B. Birnbaum M.J. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This association was found to inhibit the ability of JIP1 to form active JNK cascade complexes in the context of excitotoxic neuronal death. The JIP1 binding region of Akt1 was localized to amino acids 61–112 of Akt1, sequences within the PH domain of Akt1. Because the PH domain plays an important regulatory role in the activation of Akt family members, we hypothesized that JIP1 binding to Akt1 may affect the protein kinase activity of Akt1. The Akt family has been shown to antagonize the activity of the JNK pathway in multiple systems, which accounts for some of the prosurvival effects of Akt (16Cerezo A. Martinez A.C. Lanzarot D.

However, the possibility that JNK pathway members might regulate Akt activity has not been explored. JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP1) has been identified as a JNK scaffold protein, which can specify and insulate particular JNK modules (20Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The JIP1 scaffold has been demonstrated to be required for stress-specific neuronal apoptosis in culture and in vivo (21Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P.

Here we have studied the mechanism of JIP1-mediated Akt1 activation. The present study demonstrates that JIP1 enhances Akt1 activity following serum starvation and limited growth factor stimulation in 293 cells. Our findings indicate that JIP1 binding to Akt1 relieves the autoinhibitory constraint imposed by the PH domain and allows PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt1. The results provide insight into the regulation of Akt1 activity by a JNK scaffold protein and suggest that JIP1 may act as an Akt1 scaffold under conditions of limiting growth factor.

Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin) plus 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Clarified lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibody followed by protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in lysis buffer plus 1 mm DTT and twice in kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Kinase reactions were performed for 15 min at 25 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer plus 2 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technologies). Reactions were terminated by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer and boiling. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore). Phosphorylation of GSK-3 protein was analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis, and the amount of Akt1 protein in the same sample was visualized by anti-HA immunoblotting followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Both the extent of substrate phosphorylation and the amount of Akt1 protein were quantified by densitometric analysis (ImageQuant). Kinase activities were normalized to the activity of HA-Akt1 (= 1.0) transfected alone. For immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, cells transfected with the indicated constructs were processed as for the immunoprecipitation kinase assays except for the following. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer without DTT. Clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies followed by protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or protein G-agarose. Pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer. After SDS-PAGE and PVDF transfer, proteins were visualized by immunoblotting as described above. PI3K Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—The PI3K activity assay has been previously described (24Sasaki T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem.

Briefly, transfected cells were serum-starved for 24 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a buffer composed of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Clarified lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-p85 followed by anti-mouse IgG-agarose resin (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and then three more times with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. PI3K activity was assayed with 0.1 mm PtdIns(4,5)P2 and 0.1 mm (1 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP. Lipid products were resolved by thin layer chromatography, and [γ-32P]ATP incorporation was quantitated with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. PDK1-mediated Akt1 Phosphorylation in Vitro—Cells transfected with HA-Akt1 or HA-Akt1Δ11–60 plus or minus myc-JIP1 were serum-starved for 24 h and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (for Akt1) or anti-myc (for JIP1-bound Akt1) followed by incubation with protein G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT). Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of PDK1 assay dilution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) with 9 ng of recombinant active PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing vesicles (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and dioleoylphosphatidylserine from Avanti Polar Lipids; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from BIOMOL) prepared as described by Upstate Biotechnology. Reactions were terminated by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer and boiling. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Extent of in vitro Akt1 phosphorylation was determined by anti-phospho-Akt(Thr-308) immunoblotting. Levels of protein in crude lysates and immunoprecipitations were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. JIP1 Promotes Akt1 Kinase Activation—It is well established that sustained, pharmacological concentrations of growth factors often elicit rapid induction of Akt kinase activity within 2–10 min (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

However, the kinetics of Akt catalytic activity under more physiological scenarios, for example, in the presence of limiting growth factor or following a short growth factor pulse, have not been investigated. JIP1 has been found to bind Akt1 directly (15Kim A.H. Yano H. Cho H. Meyer D. Monks B. Margolis B. Birnbaum M.J. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that JIP1 may affect Akt1 catalytic activity. To test whether JIP1 affects Akt1 activity, we transiently transfected 293 cells with JIP1 and Akt1 constructs and assessed Akt1 activity in the cell lysates by both immunoprecipitation kinase assays and anti-Akt1 immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific Akt antibodies (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, JIP1 enhanced Akt1 kinase activity ∼1.7-fold compared with Akt1 transfection alone following 18 h of serum starvation. However, JIP1 did not alter the maximal Akt1 activation achieved by 10 min of IGF-1 stimulation (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). This JIP1-mediated increase in Akt1 activation required PI3K activity, because a 20-min incubation with LY294002 following serum starvation inhibited this enhancement (Fig. 1A). To examine JIP1-dependent activation further, Akt1 was immunoprecipitated followed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Akt1 phosphoThr-308 (PT308) and Akt1 phosphoSer-473 (PS473). These results recapitulated the kinase assay findings (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of both Akt1 Thr-308 and Ser-473 was enhanced by JIP1 coexpression following serum starvation. As with the kinase assay, PI3K inhibition diminished the JIP1-mediated activation of Akt1. Due to the close correlation between the results from the kinase assay and the anti-PT308 immunoblot analysis, we used immunoblotting to characterize further JIP1 regulation of Akt1 activity. The effect of JIP1 upon Akt1 activity was JIP1-dose dependent (Fig. 1C), with higher JIP1 levels resulting in greater activation of Akt1. To assess whether JIP1-mediated potentiation of Akt1 kinase activity has effects upon Akt1 downstream signaling in intact cells, we evaluated the phosphorylation of an Akt-specific substrate, BAD (26del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar), using antibodies directed against phosphorylated BAD (PS136) (Fig. 1D). When BAD was transfected alone, phosphorylation of BAD on Ser-136 was not detectable following serum starvation. However, in the presence of JIP1, BAD Ser136 was found to be phosphorylated. Because this serine residue lies within a consensus phosphorylation site for Akt, JIP1 likely led to productive BAD phosphorylation by increasing the kinase activity of endogenous Akt1 in cells. Similarly, the ability of transfected Akt1 to phosphorylate BAD in cells was greatly enhanced by coexpression of JIP1. These results indicate that the effect of JIP1 upon Akt1 kinase activity has observable biochemical consequences on an important downstream target in a cellular environment. JIP1 Enhances Akt1 Activity Stimulated by Low IGF-1 Concentrations and Prolongs the Duration of Akt1 Activation following an IGF-1 Pulse—Under what circumstances does JIP1 augment Akt1 kinase activity? JIP1 can potentiate Akt1 kinase activity following serum starvation. This suggests that JIP1 may increase the growth factor responsiveness of Akt1, perhaps when activated by submaximal factor concentrations. We tested whether JIP1 expression could enhance Akt1 activity under more physiological growth factor concentrations by exposing transfected cells to a 10-min treatment of 10 ng/ml IGF-1. Following IGF-1 treatments, Akt1 activity was assessed by anti-PT308 immunoblotting following anti-Akt1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). As shown above, maximal activation of Akt1 after cellular treatment with 100 ng/ml IGF-1 did not differ between vector- and JIP1-transfected cells. However, JIP1 expression caused a marked increase in Akt1 activity following exposure to 10 ng/ml IGF-1 compared with vector transfection, suggesting that JIP1 can enhance Akt1 responsiveness under physiological growth factor concentrations. Given the ability of JIP1 to enhance Akt1 activity following both serum starvation as well as treatment with low IGF-1 concentrations, we hypothesized that JIP1 may prolong Akt1 activation after cellular exposure to a discrete growth factor pulse (Fig. 2A). Transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 10 min and vigorously washed to remove the IGF-1. Four hours following the IGF-1 pulse, Akt1 activity remained substantially more elevated in JIP1-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells. Continuous incubation in IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) for 4 h led to sustained and maximal Akt1 activation regardless of JIP1 expression, indicating that the washes effectively removed IGF-1 from the culture. A detailed time course following a 10-min pulse of IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) demonstrated that, although the initial activation of Akt1 was comparable in JIP1-expressing and non-expressing cells, within 30–60 min, Akt1 activity in JIP1-expressing cells was considerably higher than in cells expressing Akt1 alone (Fig. 2B). Even after 1 h, the activity of Akt1 in JIP1-expressing cells consistently remained higher than in cells expressing Akt1 only for up to 10 h after growth factor stimulation. This striking response over the sustained time course indicates that JIP1 significantly extends the activation of Akt1 following a short growth factor exposure. Mapping of the Akt1 Activation Domain on JIP1—To define the region of JIP1 responsible for the activation of Akt1, we examined a series of JIP1 deletion mutants (Fig. 3) by transfecting them into cells and assessing their ability to potentiate Akt1 activity following serum starvation as above. Coexpression of only the N-terminal third of JIP1, JIP1A (JIP1 amino acids 1–286), had no effect on Akt1 activity compared with Akt1 transfection alone. Likewise, expression of the C-terminal third of JIP1, JIP1C (JIP1 amino acids 287–487), had little effect on Akt1 activity. However, expression of the middle domain of JIP1, JIP1B (JIP1 amino acids 488–711), augmented the activity of Akt1 to as great an extent as full-length JIP1, indicating that this region of JIP1 is sufficient to mediate the Akt1 regulatory function. These data are largely in agreement with our previous mapping analysis of Akt1 binding, in that JIP1B can bind to Akt1 by coimmunoprecipitation (15Kim A.H. Yano H. Cho H. Meyer D. Monks B. Margolis B. Birnbaum M.J. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although JIP1C could also interact with Akt1 in our analysis, this C-terminal region of JIP1 does not appear to be sufficient for enhancement of Akt1 kinase activity. The lack of Akt1 potentiation observed with JIP1A, which can act as a JNK suppressor (28Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J.

Nicod P. Boutin P. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggests that Akt1 activation by full-length JIP1 does not involve cellular JNK inhibition. JIP1 Expression Does Not Increase Activation of PI3K or Akt1 Homo-oligomerization—One possible mechanism for the effect of JIP1 on Akt1 activation by IGF-1 is activation of PI3K (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). We first assessed the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K following anti-p85 immunoprecipitation, an assay that closely correlates with the level of PI3K activity (30Cuevas B.D. Lu Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). JIP1-transfected cells exhibited no significant difference in p85 tyrosine phosphorylation compared with vector-transfected cells immediately following 10 min of IGF-1 treatment or even 2 and 4 h after an IGF-1 pulse (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by anti-p85 immunoblotting (data not shown). These results were confirmed with direct assessment of PI3K activity by immunoprecipitating p85 and measuring the associated 3′-directed lipid kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 4B). PI3K activity after 10 min of IGF-1 stimulation in JIP1-transfected cells was similar to that of vector-transfected cells; additionally, JIP1-expressing cells did not demonstrate elevated PI3K activity compared with control cells 3 h following a 10-min IGF-1 pulse. Together, these data suggest that IGF-1-mediated actions from the level of receptor recruitment to PI3K activation are not directly affected by JIP1. Because of the ability of JIP1 to homo-oligomerize (31Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we also examined the possibility that JIP1 may exert an effect upon Akt1 homo-oligomerization, an event that has been suggested to be involved in Akt1 activation (32Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ability of JIP1 to influence Akt1 oligomerization was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4C). Using two differentially tagged Akt1 constructs (HA-Akt1 and myc-Akt1), JIP1 was in fact found to decrease the homo-oligomerization of Akt1, implying that JIP1 does not promote Akt1 kinase activity by augmenting Akt1 oligomerization. JIPI Increases the Access of Akt1 to PDK1-mediated Phosphorylation—Binding of phospholipids to the PH domain of Akt1 is necessary for subsequent catalytic activation. To determine the relationship between JIP1 binding and phospholipid binding, we first assessed the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dependence of JIP1-mediated Akt1 activation by testing an Akt1 mutant deficient in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding (Fig. 5A). The Akt1Δ11–60 mutant has been shown to be unresponsive to growth factor stimulation in mammalian cells because of the absence of critical phosphoinositide-binding residues (22Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) but retains its ability to bind JIP1 (15Kim A.H. Yano H. Cho H. Meyer D. Monks B. Margolis B. Birnbaum M.J. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similar to above, wild-type Akt1 activity was enhanced by JIP1 expression 6 h following an IGF-1 pulse. Consistent with the PI3K inhibitor results, the Akt1Δ11–60 mutant could not be activated by JIP1 coexpression in cells 6 h after an IGF-1 pulse or by 10 min of maximal IGF-1 stimulation. Similar results were obtained with the Akt1R25C mutant, which harbors a point mutation that eliminates both growth factor-induced kinase activation in cells and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding (data not shown) (8Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 12Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of JIP1-mediated Akt1 enhancement in cells still depends upon PIP3 binding to the Akt1 PH domain. To investigate further the effects of JIP1 on the PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 dependence of Akt1 activity, we assessed the time-dependent effects of LY294002 treatment on Akt1 activity following 10 min of IGF-1 stimulation in cells expressing wild-type Akt1 with or without JIP1 (Fig. 5B). These experiments were conducted at room temperature to reduce the speed of PI3K inhibition. As before, incubation with LY294002 prior to ligand stimulation obliterated the JIP1-mediated activation of Akt1. However, treatment with PI3K inhibitor after IGF-1 exposure demonstrated that JIP1-expressing cells exhibited a higher degree of Akt1 activity for a longer duration than cells expressing Akt1 alone. Similar results were obtained using 10 ng/ml IGF-1, in that JIP1"

The proenzyme of calpain 2 (m-calpain) is a heterodimeric calcium-dependent cysteine protease consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The effects of calcium on the enzyme include activation, autolysis, and subunit dissociation. Here, we examine the potential role of caveolin-1 and caveolae in regulating the cellular distribution and function of m-calpain in parathyroid cells. We show that the inactive heterodimeric forms of m-calpain are concentrated in caveolin-rich membrane fractions prepared from parathyroid cells incubated with low extracellular calcium (Ca2+o). In contrast, in cells incubated with 3 mm Ca2+o, which activates the CaR and increases intracellular calcium, there is a reduction in m-calpain in association with an increase in CaR protein and phosphorylated protein kinase C α and β in caveolin-rich fractions. To assess the impact of activation of calpain on CaR protein in caveolar fractions, we analyzed the effects of m-calpain on the CaR. Activation of the CaR with high Ca2+o induced the release of lower molecular weight fragments of the receptor into the cell culture medium, and calpain inhibitors blocked this effect. Moreover, the fragments of the CaR as well as caveolin-1, m-calpain, and alkaline phosphatase were localized in membrane vesicles shed by parathyroid cells, supporting the association of these proteins in living cells. Treatment of CaR proteins in vitro with m-calpain also resulted in the appearance of lower molecular weight fragments of the CaR.

The released vesicles are enriched in sphingomyelin, cholesterol, gangliosides, and several glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (23Dolo V. Li R. Dillinger M. Flati S. Manela J. Taylor B.J. Pavan A. Ladisch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ganglioside GD3 and caveolin-1 are enriched in shed membrane vesicles of CABA I human ovarian carcinoma cells (23Dolo V. Li R. Dillinger M. Flati S. Manela J. Taylor B.J. Pavan A. Ladisch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MC3T3-EI cells produce both matrix vesicles and media vesicles, and m-calpain was co-secreted into the culture medium with these vesicles (21Nishihara H. Nakagawa Y. Ishikawa H. Ohba M. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). μ-Calpain and m-calpain have distinct large subunits but share the same small subunit. The large (80–82 kDa) catalytic subunit is divided into domains I-IV, and the small (28–30 kDa) regulatory subunit is divided into domains V and VI (15Sato K. Kawashima S. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 17Daman A. Harris F. Biswas S.

It is generally agreed that calpains are proenzymes (16Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The small and large subunits are present in a 1:1 molar ratio and comigrate through various chromatographic and non-denaturing electrophoretic procedures (16Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The two subunits have been chemically crosslinked, and the resulting product has a molecular weight of ∼110,000 and contains immunoreactive epitopes for each of the two subunits (16Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The calpains undergo autolytic processing in the presence of calcium to form the fully active proteolytic isozymes (19Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The effects of Ca2+ on the enzyme include activation, aggregation, and autolysis. In the absence of Ca2+, the protease is inactive. μ-Calpain is enzymatically active at 10–50 μm Ca2+, whereas m-calpain is active at higher Ca2+ concentrations (740–780 μm) in reconstituted assay systems in vitro (24Cong Y. Goll D.E. Peterson A.M. Kapprell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10096-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to the protease presumably induces a conformational change that, in turn, promotes an intramolecular cleavage of the small subunit and results in activation of the protease (18Perrin B.J. Huttenlocher A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of calpain reveals the structural basis for Ca2+-dependent protease activity and a novel mode of enzyme activation (25Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Crawford et al. have suggested that the activated enzyme is released from the membrane surface, because the glycine-rich sequence at the N terminus is removed by autoproteolysis during activation (26Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calpains cleave target proteins in a restricted manner to modify their properties rather than digest them entirely (19Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Calpains have been implicated in several important cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal reorganization (15Sato K. Kawashima S. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). At the pathological level, excessive activation of calpain as well as mutations abrogating calpain activity have been implicated in muscular dystrophy, cardiac and cerebral ischemia, platelet aggregation, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cataract formation, and rheumatoid arthritis (27Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Khorchid A. Ikura M. Nat. Struct.

Activated and membrane-translocated calpains are able to cleave many substrate proteins such as PKC, phospholipase C (PLC), tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, heterotrimeric G-proteins, insulin, angiotensin II, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and cytoskeletal proteins including filamin, talin, fibronectin, and vimentin (15Sato K.

J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Investigation of PT glands using an immunohistochemical method revealed that calpain is abundant in the chief cell cytoplasm (33Watson P.H. Mortimer S.T. Wang K.K.W. Croall D.E. Hanley D.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The use of a calpain inhibitor in bovine PT cells in culture increased the release of intact PTH at high Ca2+o levels and reversed the inhibitory effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on PTH release at low levels of Ca2+o (33Watson P.H. Mortimer S.T. Wang K.K.W. Croall D.E. Hanley D.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CaR is a GPCR that plays key roles in extracellular calcium homeostasis (34Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Quinn S. Hebert S.C. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 1-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 31: 239-297Crossref Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). CaR activation mediates the inhibition of PTH secretion in PT cells and the inhibition of Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney. Mutations affecting the CaR that make it either less or more sensitive to Ca2+o cause various clinical disorders (34Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Quinn S. Hebert S.C. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 1-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 31: 239-297Crossref Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Recent studies have documented that the expression of CaR mRNA and/or protein can change in a variety of circumstances (34Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Quinn S. Hebert S.C. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 1-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 31: 239-297Crossref Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). The ligand binding and signaling properties of a number of GPCRs are modified as a result of receptor dimerization, suggesting a functional relevance of this phenomenon. The CaR forms disulfide-linked dimers, and intermolecular interactions between CaR monomers are important for its normal function (36Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 37Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previously, we have shown that bovine PT cells contain caveolin-1 protein and that the CaR resides within caveolae (7Kifor O Diaz R. Butters R.R. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21708-21713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other signaling proteins, including Gq/11, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and several PKC isoforms (α, δ, and ζ), are also present in PT caveolae, and activation of the CaR by high Ca2+o increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (7Kifor O Diaz R. Butters R.R. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21708-21713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the subcellular distribution of m-calpain in bovine and human PT cells. Our results indicate that, at low Ca2+o, m-calpain is present in PT caveolae in its inactive heterodimeric, presumably proenzyme form. Short-term activation of the CaR with high calcium causes a reduction of m-calpain in a caveolin-rich fraction and increases of CaR protein and phosphorylated PKCs (α and β). Similar to PTH, the CaR is also a substrate for m-calpain in longer term incubations with high Ca2+o. Materials—Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody and protein A/G agarose beads were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal antiserum against the m-calpain (Domain III) large subunit as well as monoclonal anti-calpastatin and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-calpain small subunit (μ- and m-calpain) and monoclonal anti-calpastatin were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to phospho-pPKC (pan) and phospho-PKCs α and β were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). CaR-specific polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits against peptides based on the CaR sequence. Antiserum 4637, raised against amino acids 345–359, and antiserum 4641 to amino acids 215–237 as well as CaR-transfected HEK-293 cells (HEKCaR) were generous gifts of NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa 568 and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The TSA™ Cyanine 5 system was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and Vectashield mounting medium were from Vector Labs (Burlingame, CA). Cell Preparation and Incubation—PT cells were prepared by collagenase and DNase digestion of bovine or human PT glands as described previously (7Kifor O Diaz R. Butters R.R. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J.

For immunocytochemistry, the cells were seeded on glass coverslips and allowed to attach for 1 h in a culture incubator. The cells were then washed with Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.5 mm Ca2+o, 0.5 mm Mg2+o, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (standard medium) and subsequently incubated in standard medium at 37 °C with varying levels of Ca2+o (detailed under “Results”). HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the human CaR cDNA were grown in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without sodium pyruvate) with 10% fetal calf serum (39Kifor O.

Commun. 2001; 285: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Bovine PT cells were incubated with varying levels of Ca2+o for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the culture medium was removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. To pellet the media vesicles, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was stained for alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity by using an AP substrate kit (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate) from Invitrogen (7Kifor O Diaz R.

Immunocytochemistry—Glass slides with adherent PT cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature without permeabilization with detergent. After washing and inhibition of endogenous peroxidase, the slides were immunostained with antibody to caveolin-1 and the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and immunostaining was visualized with the DAKO AEC Substrate System (DAKO Corp.) as described (7Kifor O Diaz R. Butters R.R. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21708-21713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining, the cells were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. They were then incubated with 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.4, for 10 min (to quench intrinsic fluorescence) and blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 1% non-immune goat serum in PBS) for 15 min. For triple immunofluorescence staining, the slides were incubated with a mixture of three primary antibodies (i.e. monoclonal antibody to caveolin-1, sheep anti-PTH antiserum, and rabbit polyclonal m-calpain antiserum) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The next day the cells were washed and incubated with a mixture of secondary antibodies (i.e. goat anti-mouse IgG tagged with Alexa 568, donkey anti-sheep IgG tagged with Alexa 488, and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. After being washed, the slides were incubated with the TSA™ cyanine 5 system, washed again, and mounted in Vectashield to prevent photo-bleaching. Fluorescence images were obtained using the 100× objective of a BioRad MRC 1024/2P multi-photon microscope equipped with krypton and argon lasers at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Confocal Microscopy Core facility. Alexa 568 produces red, Alexa 488 produces green, and the cyanine 5 tyramide system produces blue signals, respectively. When the red, blue, and green components are merged, colocalization of all three colors results in a white color. Autofluorescence of the samples was minimal and was subtracted from the values obtained during measurements. Electrophoresis and Immunoblots—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described (7Kifor O Diaz R. Butters R.R. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2037859009,"Autocrine motility factor (AMF)/phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9) is a housekeeping cytosolic enzyme that plays a key role in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. AMF/PGI is also a multifunctional protein that displays cytokine properties, eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, and differentiation activities, and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Because little is known about AMF/PGI-dependent signaling in general and during tumorigenesis in particular, we sought to study its effect on the cell cycle. To elucidate the functional role of PGI, we stably transfected its cDNA into NIH/3T3 and BALB/c 3T3-A31 fibroblasts. Ectopic overexpression of PGI results in the acquisition of a transformed phenotype associated with an acceleration of G1 to S cell cycle transition. These were manifested by up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity and down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. The reduced p27Kip1 protein expression level in PGI-overexpressing cells could be restored to control levels by treatment with proteasome inhibitor. PGI-overexpressing cells also exhibited elevated expression of Skp2 involved in p27Kip1 ubiquitination and elevation in the levels of retinoblastoma protein hyperphosphorylation. Thus, we may conclude that the overexpression of AMF/PGI enhances cell proliferation together with up-regulation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activities and down-regulation of p27Kip1, whereas the induction of 3T3 fibroblast transformation by PGI is regulated by the retinoblastoma protein pathway.

These findings suggest that the AMF/PGI exhibits a growth factor-like activity, implying that this signaling pathway is linked to cell cycle augmentation. Perturbed control of the G1 phase of the cell cycle is a critical step for cellular transformation and tumorigenesis (17Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar) during which cells respond to signals by either advancing toward another division or withdrawing from the cycle into a resting state (17Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Passage through the G1 phase and entry into S phase are controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that are sequentially regulated by cyclins D, E, and A (17Sherr C.J.

CDK2 also binds to cyclin A during S phase, playing a critical role in DNA replication (17Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically the INK4-type inhibitors, consisting of p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p18Ink4c, and p19Ink4d, regulate the activities of CDK4 and CDK6. On the other hand the Kip/Cip-type inhibitors inhibit the CDK2 type, comprised of p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a critical target protein that is phosphorylated via these cyclin-CDK complexes (20Sherr C.J. McComick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) and controls gene expression mediated by the E2F transcriptional regulators, which activate genes essential for transition from G1 to S phase (20Sherr C.J. McComick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar).Herein we identify downstream targets of PGI whose activities may be important for the cell cycle. Moreover we provide evidence that 1) cyclin D1 is a significant G1 to S transition control factor whose level is modulated by the PGI signaling pathway, 2) CDK inhibitory protein p27Kip1 proteasome-dependent degradation is controlled by PGI, and 3) show that Rb regulates the induction of 3T3 fibroblasts transformation by AMF/PGI overexpression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Nocodazole, cycloheximide, and lactacystin were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4, p21cip1, p27Kip1, p53, and actin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antibody against Rb was from Pharmingen; anti-AMF/PGI and anti-AMFR antibodies were described previously (16Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). Histone H1 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and GST-Rb 769 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Culture and Transfection—A murine NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line and its derivative cell line, BALB/c 3T3-A31 (21Zvibel I. Raz A. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 36: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing vector pcDNA3.1 zeo or pcDNA3.1 zeo-PGI were established as previously described (16Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar) and were designated 3T3zeo and 3T3PGI, respectively.Parental A31 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 zeo or pcDNA 3.1 zeo-PGI using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Isolation of single clones of the stable transfectants was accomplished by adding 750 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) to the culture medium. The A31 cell line, stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 zeo or pcDNA3.1 zeo-PGI, was designated A31zeo or A31PGI, respectively. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and results were confirmed using both clonal cell lines and the pooled cell population.Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation assays were performed by seeding cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were fed DMEM with 10% FBS every other day, and the number of cells were manually counted with a hemocytometer.Cell Cycle Synchronization and DNA Content Analysis—Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Whole cell suspensions were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 70% ethanol, stained in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase, 0.1% Triton X-100, and analyzed with a BD Biosciences.For cell synchronization, exponentially growing cells were treated for 18 h with 100 ng/ml nocodazole to induce G2-M arrest (22Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitotic cells were collected by gentle pipetting and were reseeded into fresh DMEM with 10% FBS. At various times after plating, cells were collected, and their cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry as described above.Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) incubated with primary antibody for 2 h, washed 3 times for 15 min in TBS-T, incubated with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 1 h, and finally washed 3 times. The horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by an incubation of the membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). A Kodak imaging system determined the density of the bands.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (23Wang Q.S. Papanikolaou A. Sabourin C.L. Rosenberg D.W. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For cyclin D1 cDNA, 20 amplification cycles (93 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) were performed with the following primers: mouse cyclin D1, 5′-CTGACACCAATCTCCTCAACGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCAGGTTCCACTTGAGC-3′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCATGCCATCACTGCCACCCAGAA-3′ (forward), and 5′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCG-3′ (reverse). In all cases, PCRs were shown to be in a linear range by performing parallel control PCRs with increasing template cDNA concentrations. To verify the absence of contamination of RNA samples with DNA, we performed the PCR on samples that were processed identically to the target samples but were not reverse-transcribed. After RT-PCR, samples were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the intensity of the bands was measured by a Kodak Digital Science Image System 44 °C.P27Kip1 Stability in Vivo—Because p27Kip1 accumulates in serum-starved and density-arrested cells (24Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar), we examined the p27Kip1 protein changes under these conditions. For the serum dependence assay, cells were grown to 50% confluency in DMEM with 10% FBS. Then the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM and maintained without FBS for 24 h. For cell-cell contact dependence assay, cells were grown to near confluency (95–100%) in DMEM with 10% FBS.To evaluate the changes in p27Kip1 protein stability, cultured cells were treated with cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) for 2 or 4 h to block total cellular protein synthesis. The cells were incubated with proteasome inhibitors lactacystin (5 μm) for an appropriate time in experiments designed to assay proteasome targeting of p27Kip1. Cells lysates prepared after each incubation period were analyzed by Western blotting with p27Kip1 antibody as described above.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The next day, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM with or without 10% FBS. After 36 h incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. The cells were blocked with 1.0% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-p27Kip1 antibody (1:100 dilution in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) at 4 °C for 2 h. After 3 washes with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200 in 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were then mounted on a glass slide with a drop of SlowFade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence was recorded with a Sony digital CCD camera (DXC-970MD) mounted on an Olympus BX40 microscope.In Vitro CDK Assay—CDK2 and CDK4 kinase assays were performed as described previously (18Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μg of protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the anti-CDK2 or anti-CDK4 antibodies for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on protein A-Sepharose® 6MB (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) and contained 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 10 Ci/mmol and 1 μg of histone H1 for CDK2 assays or 1 μg of GST-Rb 769 for CDK4 assays reactions. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained in Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to film. A Kodak imaging system determined the density of the bands. Normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) was used as a negative control in immunoprecipitation experiments.Statistical Analysis—Associations between the variables were tested by Student's t test or Fisher's exact test. All statistical differences were deemed significant at the level of p < 0.05.RESULTSPGI Shortens the G 1 Interval—We have established two different types of murine fibroblast based cell lines (NIH/3T3 and A31) stably transfected and overexpressing AMF/PGI. Three clones exhibiting high level expression of PGI in both NIH/3T3 and A31 cells were selected. The ratios of PGI expression of each clone were 5 to 6 compared with the empty vector-transfected control (Fig. 1A). PGI secretion was restricted to the PGI-transfected cells and could not be detected in the conditioned medium of the parental and empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). All AMF/PGI-overexpressing clones grew ∼2-fold faster than those of parental or empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 1B). The effect of ectopic expression of PGI on cell cycle distribution was determined next. There was no specific accumulation of the PGI-overexpressing cells at any cell cycle phase relative to the control cells (Fig. 1C). The percentage of G1 phase cells was slightly lower, and the proportion of the S phase cells was respectively higher in the PGI-overexpressing cells, but this did not change significantly. To study the effect of PGI on cell cycle progression, the length of G1 phase was determined. Cells were treated with the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole for 18 h followed by shaking and replating in nocodazole-free medium. The cells were collected at the indicate time points after the mitotic shake, and the DNA profiles are shown in Fig. 2. At 8 h after replating, PGI-overexpressing cells shifted toward S phase (increased DNA content) as compared with parental and empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, arrow). The presence of S phase in control cells could not be detected prior to 10 h after cells were replated (top and second panels). Similar results were obtained from two other PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 clones, parental A31 cells, empty vector-transfected A31 cells, and three PGI-overexpressing A31 clones (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PGI-overexpressing cells pass through G1 phase at a shorter rate than control cells.Fig. 2PGI overexpression results in a shortened G 1 phase. Mitotically arrested cells were isolated using nocodazole and replated. Cells were collected at indicated times, and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments (A). Top panel, parental NIH/3T3. Second panel, empty vector-transfected NIH/3T3. Bottom panel, PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 clone 1. Similar results were obtained from other PGI-overexpressing clones and A31 and its derivative cells. y axis, cell number; x axis, DNA content. B, the table shows the percentage of G1/G0, S, G2/M populations of cell at 8 h after replating. PGI-overexpressing cells showed a shift toward S phase.

We have found that the level of cyclin D1 increased 3–4-fold in each of the PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cell clones as compared with the respective control cells (Fig. 3A). The levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, and p53 remained essentially unchanged in the PGI-overexpressing cells as compared with the controlled cells. For a more sensitive analysis, we performed RT-PCR analyses of the expression levels of cyclin D1 and confirmed that cyclin D1 mRNA was increased 3-fold in the PGI-overexpressing cells as compared with their normal counterparts (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in contrast to p21Cip1, the level of p27Kip1 was decreased in each PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 clones (Fig. 3A) by ∼50–60% relative to the control cells. The above-mentioned pattern of the cell cycle components change in expression in the PGI-overexpressing cells was the same, at 2 and 3 days of culture.Fig. 3Expression of cell cycle-related proteins in PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cells. A, cell cycle-regulated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p27Kip1 were observed in PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cells. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting the membrane with an antibody to actin (bottom row). B, RT-PCR analysis of cyclin D1 mRNA levels using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; bottom row) as the internal control. PCR products were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. First lane, parental NIH/3T3; second lane, empty vector-transfected NIH/3T3; third through fifth lanes, PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 clone 1, 2, and 3, respectively; sixth lane, parental A31; seventh lane, empty vector-transfected A31l; eighth through tenth lanes, PGI-overexpressing A31 clone 1, 2, and 3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PGI Promotes Proteasome-dependent Degradation of p27Kip1 Protein—Because of the fact that p27Kip1 increases in serum-starved and contact-inhibited normal cells (24Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar), we questioned the status of p27Kip1 in PGI-transfected cells under diverse culture conditions. Cells were either grown to confluency or cultured as serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C. P27Kip1 expression analysis revealed that in PGI-overexpressing cells it was significantly reduced (60–70%) compared with the cells both in density-arrested and in serum-starved conditions (Fig. 4A). Next we examined whether the reduced p27Kip1 protein level was due to change in protein stability by exposing cells to cycloheximide treatment. P27Kip1 protein was rapidly degraded (80–90% reduced) in cycloheximide-treated PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cells, whereas it was more stable in control cells at 4 and 8 h (Fig. 4B). Altered regulation of p27Kip1 protein stability was probably the major cause of its reduced protein expression in PGI (overexpressing) cells. Thus, we questioned whether p27Kip1 degradation processed was disrupted by the 26 S protease system inhibitor in PGI-overexpressing cells. To address this, we used the 26 S protease-specific inhibitor lactacystin and found that lactacystin treatment restores p27Kip1 expression level in PGI-overexpressing cells and to that of the control cells (Fig. 4C). The F-box protein is the substrate-specific recognition component of Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes that is used to target specific proteins for degradation (25Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether PGI alters the expression of Skp2, a member of the F-box family, leading to an increased ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p27Kip1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4D, Skp2 protein level was slightly elevated in PGI-overexpressing cells. The degradation of p27Kip1 was partially impaired by the anti-PGI antibody treatment, suggesting that PGI-signaling inhibition might impact the degradation process of p27Kip1 (data not shown). Up-regulation of Skp2 expression was inhibited by anti-PGI IgG (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4PGI overexpression induces p27Kip1 down-regulation in NIH/3T3 and A31 fibroblasts. The amount of p27Kip1 is decreased in the PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cells. A, upper row, cells were grown to near confluence (95–100%). Lower row, cells were cultured in serum starvation conditions for 24 h.

B, cells were treated with the protein synthesis translational inhibitor cycloheximide to compare the stability of p27Kip1 protein. Total cellular proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies to p27Kip1. Similar results were obtained from other PGI-overexpressing clones. C, cells were treated for 12 h with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Western blot analysis of p27Kip1 expression was then performed. Similar results were obtained from other PGI-overexpressing clones. D: upper row, expression of Skp2 is upregulated in PGI-overexpressing cells determined by Western blotting; lower row, up-regulation of Skp2 expression was inhibited by anti-PGI IgG.

No differences in the distribution of p27Kip1 localization were detected (data not shown) in asynchronously growing parental, empty vector-transfected, and PGI-overexpressing cells. Whereas (Fig. 5) serum starvation of parental and empty vector-transfected cells led to a clear increase of p27Kip1 nuclear localization (Fig. 5, a, b, d, and e), no accumulation of p27Kip1 was observed in the nucleus of PGI-overexpressing cells during serum starvation (Fig. 5, c and f).Fig. 5Subcellular localization of p27Kip1 in PGI-overexpressing cells.

In asynchronously growing parental, empty vector-transfected, and PGI-overexpressing NIH/3T3 and A31 cells, p27Kip1 was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm (data not shown). p27Kip1 was expressed mainly in the nucleus during serum starvation in parental and empty vector-transfected cells.

https://openalex.org/W1971566284,"The regulation of the metabolic insulin response by mouse growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 (Grb10) has been addressed in this report. We find mouse Grb10 to be a critical component of the insulin receptor (IR) signaling complex that provides a functional link between IR and p85 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and regulates PI 3-kinase activity. This regulatory mechanism parallels the established link between IR and p85 via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. A direct association was demonstrated between Grb10 and p85 but was not observed between Grb10 and IRS proteins. In addition, no effect of mouse Grb10 was observed on the association between IRS-1 and p85, on IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, or on insulin-mediated activation of IR or IRS proteins. A critical role of mouse Grb10 was observed in the regulation of PI 3-kinase activity and the resulting metabolic insulin response. Dominant-negative Grb10 domains, in particular the SH2 domain, eliminated the metabolic response to insulin in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This was consistently observed for glycogen synthesis, glucose and amino acid transport, and lipogenesis. In parallel, the same metabolic responses were substantially elevated by increased levels of Grb10. A similar role of Grb10 was confirmed in mouse L6 cells. In addition to the SH2 domain, the Pro-rich amino-terminal region of Grb10 was implicated in the regulation of PI 3-kinase catalytic activity. These regulatory roles of Grb10 were extended to specific insulin mediators downstream of PI 3-kinase including PKB/Akt, glycogen synthase kinase, and glycogen synthase. In contrast, a regulatory role of Grb10 in parallel insulin response pathways including p70 S6 kinase, ubiquitin ligase Cbl, or mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 was not observed. The dissection of the interaction of mouse Grb10 with p85 and the resulting regulation of PI 3-kinase activity should help elucidate the complexity of the IR signaling mechanism.

Superfamily members share a Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region at the amino terminus, a region termed GM (Grb/Mig) that contains a Ras-associating-like domain (20Wojcik J. Girault J.A.

Ghirlando R. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13257-13264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Grb10 SH2 domain has been reported to associate, independently of phosphotyrosine, with Raf1 constitutively, and with MEK1 in response to insulin (17Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I.

Basal phosphorylation on serine has been reported for Grb10, which was stimulated in response to EGF; similarly platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor caused a mobility shift in the migration of Grb10 on SDS gels that was reversible by phosphatase treatment (1Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Basal serine phosphorylation of one isoform was also stimulated by insulin, which was reversible by phosphatase, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (8Dong L.Q. Du H.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb10 has been reported in response to insulin or vanadate that involves Src family kinases such as Src and Fyn (28Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The underlying signaling mechanism may involve PI 3-kinase, p60 GAP-associated protein, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, and other pathways/mediators including vascular endothelial growth factor (29Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Mas J.C. Van Obberghen E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3959-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinases such as Jak2, Tec, and the oncogene Bcr-Abl (reviewed in Ref. 30Riedel H. Braun B.R. Grunberger G. Zick Y. Insulin Signaling: From Cultured Cells to Animal Models. Taylor and Francis, London2001: 89-105Google Scholar). A role in mitogenesis has also been described for the related Grb7 and Grb14 both of which are also direct partners of IR (16Daly R.J. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Kasus-Jacobi A. Bereziat V. Perdereau D. Girard J. Burnol A.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This role also extends to metabolic insulin responses for Grb14 (31Kasus-Jacobi A. Bereziat V. Perdereau D. Girard J. Burnol A.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Consequently, a role in the mitogenic response to insulin and other peptide hormones has been demonstrated for several Grb10 isoforms, however, a physiologic role in other insulin actions remained less defined (32 and reviewed in Ref. 30Riedel H. Braun B.R. Grunberger G. Zick Y. Insulin Signaling: From Cultured Cells to Animal Models. Taylor and Francis, London2001: 89-105Google Scholar). The present study introduces mouse Grb10 as a critical component of the metabolic IR signaling complex that provides an alternative functional link between IR and p85 PI 3-kinase in response to insulin-stimulated metabolism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll presented data are based on repeated experiments with the error shown between multiple measurements in bar graphs or with one representative experiment shown for immunoblots.Cell Culture—Mouse L6 cells, rat PC12 cells, and human IR overexpressing Rat1 cells (HIRcB) (33McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Levy J. Huecksteadt T. Dull T.J. Lee J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8904-8911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, in a 5% CO2 environment. Mouse 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and were differentiated 2 days post-confluence by addition of 500 μm isobutylxanthine, 25 μm dexamethasone, and 4 μg/ml insulin (34Kayali A.G. Eichhorn J. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13808-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and after 3 days cultured with the addition of only insulin. This medium was replaced every 3 days until cells were used after day 10 as well differentiated adipocytes in experiments. To elicit a metabolic response cells were subsequently typically stimulated with 100 nm insulin as specifically described for each procedure.Transient cDNA Transfection—Plasmid pHook2 (Invitrogen) carries a cytomegalovirus constitutive transcriptional promoter and served as a vector for transient expression of mouse Grb10δ (9Laviola L. Giorgino F. Chow J.C. Baquero J.A. Hansen H. Ooi J. Zhu J. Riedel H. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The complete protein coding cDNA of Grb10 had been removed from plasmid pRK5 (1Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) as a NruI-HindIII restriction fragment. Both sites were end-filled and inserted into the pHook2 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) at a unique SmaI restriction site to produce a mouse Grb10δ expression construct in pHook2. Subconfluent mouse L6 cells in 8-cm culture plates were rinsed with antibiotic-free medium before 3 ml of transfection mixture including 5–6 μg of Grb10 expression plasmid or the corresponding control plasmid, 20 μl of Plus reagent, and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE were added according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Five hours later the transfection medium was replaced with complete culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The effect of Grb10 expression (after cell starvation) was tested about 2 days posttransfection.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were modified as described in Ref. 24Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Rama Swamy O. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. Cells were cultured to quiescence for 20 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and stimulated with or without 100 nm insulin. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and detergent cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 100 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. Samples containing 300–500 μg of total protein were immunoprecipitated in a complex with protein A-Sepharose and antibody directed against Grb10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p85 (Upstate Biotechnology or part of assay kit), IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology assay kit), IRS-2 (Upstate Biotechnology assay kit), IR (Upstate Biotechnology assay kit), or c-Cbl (Upstate Biotechnology assay kit). Precipitates were rinsed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as listed above or phospho-Tyr-specific antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories). For “far western” analysis (35Vidal M. Goudreau N. Cornille F. Cussac D. Gincel E. Garbay C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) the blot was first incubated with TAT-HA-Grb10 fusion protein followed by HA-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and finally by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase as tertiary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Preparation of Cell Membrane-permeable Fusion Protein—The complete mouse Grb10δ protein-coding cDNA was introduced into Escherichia coli expression plasmid pTAT-HA (kindly provided by Steven F. Dowdy, Washington University School of Medicine) under control of the strong T7 phage transcriptional promoter (36Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). This plasmid carries amino-terminal coding sequences for a 6-amino acid His tag peptide to facilitate affinity purification of the recombinant protein and an 11-amino acid HIV TAT protein-derived peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) that renders the resulting fusion proteins cell-membrane permeable. The complete protein coding region of mouse Grb10δ (9Laviola L. Giorgino F. Chow J.C. Baquero J.A. Hansen H. Ooi J. Zhu J. Riedel H. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was assembled starting just upstream of the ATG initiation codon of translation through an XhoI restriction site in the 3′-untranslated region. A 168-bp cDNA fragment encoding the 5′ end of the mouse Grb10δ protein coding sequence was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GTCTTGGGGGTACCGGTGGTATGAACAACGATATTAACTCGTCC-3′) and (5′-ACGCCTGTGGCTGTCCCCGGGAGCTAGATG-3′) that introduced a 5′ KpnI site and 3′ XmaI site into the final PCR product. The remaining protein coding sequences of mouse Grb10δ (9Laviola L. Giorgino F. Chow J.C. Baquero J.A. Hansen H. Ooi J. Zhu J. Riedel H. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were retrieved as an XmaI-XhoI restriction fragment (24Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Rama Swamy O. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both fragments, which reconstituted the complete Grb10δ protein-coding region, were joined with a KpnI-XhoI restriction fragment of plasmid pTAT-HA to produce a cell membranepermeable TAT-HA-Grb10 fusion protein in E. coli.Recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli high level expression host BL21(DE3)LysS (Novagen). 500 ml of LB medium was inoculated with 100 ml of freshly saturated overnight culture and was induced with 500 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C to produce the fusion protein. After 7 h cells were sedimented and re-suspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Cells were disrupted by sonication (Branson Sonifier-450, CT) on ice in a series of pulses for about 2 min until the solution became turbid and lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Grb10 fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction via the His tag by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8 m urea. Fusion protein was eluted by stepwise addition of 5–10 ml of increasing concentrations of 100, 200, and 500 mm and 1 m imidazole in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Fractions with an A 280 above 0.2 were pooled and initially dialyzed (Slide-A-Lyzer, Pierce) with a 3.5-kDa molecular mass cutoff for 2 h at 4 °C in PBS, pH 7.4, 4 m urea. Proteins were concentrated at 4 °C by centrifugation with Centriplus-3 (Millipore) at 3,000 × g at 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff. Samples were repeatedly reconstituted in PBS, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol to reach a peptide concentration of 0.2–0.3 mg/ml. Aliquots were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Cell membrane-permeable fusion peptides representing the Grb10 amino-terminal Pro-rich region or SH2 domain had been prepared as described earlier fused with a sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster antennapedia homeoprotein (24Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Rama Swamy O. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain had been expressed as a fusion peptide in E. coli and the Pro-rich region was represented by a synthetic peptide mimetic (synthesized by American Peptide Company). A synthetic peptide lacking Grb10 sequences or a dialyzed column eluate of a control E. coli cell extract served as peptide controls.Glycogen Synthesis—A protocol was followed as described below similar to the procedure outlined in Ref. 37Wada T.

Mouse L6 cells (after transfection) or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were seeded into 12-well plates at densities of 4–5 × 105 cells per well. Cells were cultured for 24 h and subsequently deprived of serum for 18–20 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by a 3-h incubation in 2.5 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin, cell membrane-permeable peptide mimetics (10 μg/ml), and/or 20 μm PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 and/or 20 μm p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 2.5–5.0 μl of d-[U-14C]glucose (200 μCi/ml, 2–4 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 37 °C (final concentration 0.5–1 μCi/ml). Glycogen synthesis was terminated by rinsing cells three times with ice-cold PBS followed by cell lysis with 0.5 ml of 30% KOH for 1 h at 37 °C. Lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, 50 μl of 20 mg/ml carrier glycogen (final concentration 2 mg/ml) was added, and cell lysates were incubated at 95 °C for 30 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature, 0.6 ml of ice-cold ethanol was added, and glycogen was precipitated for 16 h at –20 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1963999812,"Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) transports solutes in an ATP dependent manner by utilizing its two nonequivalent nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) to bind and hydrolyze ATP. The two NBDs possess different properties (Gao, M., Cui, H. R., Loe, D. W., Grant, C. E., Almquist, K. C., Cole, S. P., and Deeley, R. G. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 13098–13108; Hou, Y., Cui, L., Riordan, J. R., and Chang, X. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 20280–20287) and may play different roles during solute transport. We now report that NBD1 has moderately higher affinity for ATP than NBD2. The consequence of this difference is that the overall <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> value for wild-type MRP1 is mainly determined by ATP binding at NBD1. This conclusion is supported by the following: 1) mutation of the cysteine residue at 682 to alanine (C682A) in Walker A motif in NBD1 decreases the <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> value, indicating increased affinity for ATP; 2) mutation of the alanine residue at 1331 to cysteine (A1331C) in the Walker A motif of NBD2 does not have an effect on the <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> value; and 3) photolabeling of the protein with a cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of NBD1 is much more sensitive to <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide modification than the protein with a cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of NBD2. In contrast, the <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for ATP in support of LTC4 transport is mainly determined by ATP hydrolysis at NBD2. This conclusion is supported by the following: 1) although mutation of A1331C does not have an effect on the <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> value, the <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> values measured from LTC4 transport by proteins with this mutation in NBD2 are much higher than the proteins with wild-type NBD2, implying that the A1331C mutation affects ATP binding/hydrolysis at NBD2; and 2) ATP-dependent LTC4 transport by the protein with a cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of NBD2 is much more sensitive to <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide modification than the protein with a cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of NBD1. Our previous results indicated that ATP binding at NBD1 at low concentration enhanced ATP binding/hydrolysis at NBD2. All of these results support the notion that ATP binding at NBD1 at low concentration plays a more important regulatory role than the binding at high ATP concentration and that ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 plays a dominant role in the ATP-dependent LTC4 transport."
https://openalex.org/W2136485080,"Transmembrane proteins of the tetraspanin superfamily are associated with integrins and are thought to regulate adhesion-dependent signaling. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation remain unknown. We used rat fibroblasts to analyze the contribution of the tetraspanin CD151 in the adhesion-dependent signaling. Expression of CD151 specifically attenuated adhesion-dependent activation of Ras. Furthermore, activation of PKB/c-Akt and ERK1/2, downstream targets in the Ras signaling pathway, was also diminished in cells expressing CD151. In contrast, adhesion-dependent activation of FAK and c-Src were not affected by CD151. The attenuation of Ras signaling did not correlate with phosphorylation of Tyr925-FAK, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, or with assembly of the p120RasGAP-p62Dok complex. Using mutants of CD151 we established that the cytoplasmic C-terminal portion is critical for activity of CD151 toward Ras. Taken together these results identify CD151 as a negative regulator of Ras and suggest a novel mechanism of adhesion-dependent regulation of Ras activity."
https://openalex.org/W2019253727,"In the present study, we investigated the physiological significance of the microtubules in the subcellular localization and trafficking of GLUT4 in rat primary adipocytes. Morphological and biochemical analyses revealed a dose- and time-dependent disruption of the microtubules by treatment with nocodazole. With nearly complete disruption of the microtubules, the insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was inhibited by 55%. This inhibition was concomitant with a comparable inhibition of GLUT4 translocation measured by the subcellular fractionation and the cell-surface GLUT4 labeling by trypsin cleavage. In addition, the time-course of insulin stimulation of the glucose transport activity was significantly delayed by microtubule disruption (t½ were 7 and 2.3 min in nocodazole-treated and control cells, respectively), while the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis was little affected. The impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was not fully restored to the level in control cells by blocking GLUT4 endocytosis, suggesting that the inhibition was due to the existence of a microtubule-dependent subpopulation in the insulin-responsive GLUT4 pool. On the other hand, nocodazole partially inhibited insulin-induced translocation of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase and the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-2 without affecting GLUT1 and VAMP-3. In electrically permeabilized adipocytes, the insulin-stimulated glucose transport was inhibited by 40% by disruption of the microtubules whereas that stimulated with GTPγS was not affected. Intriguingly, the two reagents stimulated glucose transport to the comparable level by disruption of the microtubules. These data suggest that insulin recruits GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from at least two distinct intracellular compartments via distinct traffic routes with differential microtubule dependence in rat primary adipocytes.

These data suggest that insulin recruits GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from at least two distinct intracellular compartments via distinct traffic routes with differential microtubule dependence in rat primary adipocytes. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake mainly by promoting subcellular redistribution of a facilitative glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane in adipocyte and skeletal/cardiac muscles (1Rea S.

While the subcellular trafficking pathways and the molecular mechanisms by which insulin recruits GLUT4 to the plasma membrane still remain obscure, several lines of evidence have suggested that GLUT4 is associated with more than one intracellular compartment. Morphologically, studies with immunoelectron microscopy have shown that most of GLUT4 localizes intracellularly to tubulovesicular structures clustered near the stacks of Golgi and the endosomes, or scattered throughout the cytoplasm in unstimulated adipocytes and that insulin decreases GLUT4 from all the intracellular compartments (4Slot J.W.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, many biochemical studies have indicated that insulin-responsive GLUT4 is associated with the endosomal recycling pathway and with a more specialized postendosomal compartment (for review, see Ref. 1Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, more recent works have suggested that insulin recruits GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from the postendosomal vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 1The abbreviations used are: VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CD-M6PR, cation-dependent mannose 6-phoshate receptor; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.-2-positive compartment as well as from the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR)-positive compartment that is dynamically shuttling between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (6Ramm G.

While such a diversity of the subcellular localization of GLUT4 would hamper our understanding of the insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4, it implies that the transit of GLUT4 to and from such distinct subcellular compartments would be regulated by different signals and trafficking machinery (e.g. Refs. 8Foran P.G.

The actin and microtubule cytoskeleton networks have been implicated in the subcellular movements of the GLUT4-containing membranes. While the role of the actin filaments in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation has been reported with relatively consistent results (10Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem.

Thus, depolymerization of the microtubules caused a complete cessation of the basal linear tracking movements of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GLUT4, and inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake by 40–70% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Fletcher L.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) also showed that nocodazole treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in about 80% inhibition of insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. In addition, the GLUT4-containing vesicles have been shown to be associated with α-tubulin and polymerized microtubules under the in vivo and in vitro conditions, respectively (16Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two molecular motor proteins, dynein and kinesin, that direct the vesicles along the microtubules toward the minus and plus ends, respectively, have been implicated in the subcellular localization and insulin-responsive movements of GLUT4 (17Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Emoto M. Langille S.E. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10677-11082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations have strongly supported a physiological significance for the microtubules in the subcellular trafficking of GLUT4. On the other hand, more recent studies demonstrated that depolymerization of the microtubules with lower concentrations (2–3 μm) of nocodazole did not affect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (19Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43829-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Shigematsu S. Khan A.H. Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They also argued that the inhibition of glucose transport with higher concentrations (30 μm or more) of nocodazole derived from a direct inhibition with the drug of the glucose transporter activity itself. Thus there remain important issues to be addressed on the role of the microtubules in the GLUT4 trafficking and the action of nocodazole as a microtubule-depolymerizing tool. In addition, all of the studies were carried out using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while the relevance of the microtubules to the GLUT4 trafficking has never been precisely studied in primary adipocytes. Structurally, isolated adipocyte has a spherical shape with a large diameter (usually 50–100 μm), a huge lipid droplet inside the cell, and the thin cytoplasm confined beneath the plasma membrane. Because of these morphological features, the relationship between the microtubules and GLUT4 has not been visualized in primary adipocytes. Functionally, although both GLUT1 and GLUT4 isoforms are expressed in primary adipocytes, the latter is far more abundant and virtually accounts for the major portion of the cellular glucose uptake (21Oka Y. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13432-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This feature makes it easier to study the effect of nocodazole on the glucose transport activity of GLUT4. Additionally, some of the observations described in 3T3-L1 adipocytes may not be applicable to primary adipocytes; for example, endothelin-1 stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation via a Gq/11-dependent stimulation of the endosomal recycling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Imamura T.

In the present study, we reconstructed the three-dimensional images to investigate the spatial relationship between the microtubules and GLUT4 in isolated rat adipocytes. In addition, we investigated the role of the microtubules in the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. The results of our study suggested that insulin recruits GLUT4 to the cell surface from at least two distinct intracellular compartments via distinct traffic routes with differential microtubule dependence in rat primary adipocytes. Materials—Nocodazole was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 20 mm (stock solution). The maximal final concentrations of nocodazole and Me2SO were 100 μm and 0.5%, respectively. The same concentration of Me2SO (0.5%) was added to the controls. The Dk-(62–85) peptide (RETQIAKGNEQSFRVDLRTLLRYY) was synthesized as described previously (27Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), dissolved to a concentration of 1.0 mm in 0.1 m NaCl, and activated by incubation at 37 °C overnight prior to the addition to cells. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GLUT4 were raised as described previously (27Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT1 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Kuniaki Takata (Gunma University). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (clone TUB 2.1) and anti-vimentin (clone V9) antibodies were from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH) and Lab Vision (Fremont, CA), respectively. Rabbit anti-VAMP-2 and sheep anti-VAMP-3 antibodies were kindly provided by Masami Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences) and Jeffrey E. Pessin (University of Iowa), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) antibody was kindly donated by Mitsuru Hashiramoto (Ehime University). Alexa Fluor-labeled anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) and Rabbit anti-phospho-c-Cbl (Tyr-774) and rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). GTPγS tetralithium salt was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Endothelin-1 was from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Preparation of Isolated Rat Adipocytes and Permeabilization—Isolated adipocytes were prepared by the collagenase method from epididymal adipose tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats (from Charles-River, ∼170–220 g) (28Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, isolated cells were suspended in Buffer A (25 mm Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer supplemented with 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) and 3 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4). The cells to be permeabilized by electroporation were suspended in high K+/low Ca2+ buffer designated as Buffer X (118.0 mm KCl, 4.74 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 23.4 mm Hepes/KOH, 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4). The electroporation was carried out four times in a Gene-Pulser (from Bio-Rad) set at 25 microfarads and 2 kV/cm as described previously (29Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Visualization of the Microtubules and GLUT4 in Isolated Adipocytes—For visualization of the microtubules and GLUT4 by laser confocal microscopy, cells were washed three times with Buffer A and fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized and nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 3% normal goat serum for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-GLUT4 serum (1:1000 dilution) and mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% saponin. Next, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% saponin, mounted in 50% glycerol saturated with n-propyl gallate as an anti-bleaching reagent, and observed with an epifluorescence microscope (BX-50; Olympus, Tokyo) equipped with a laser confocal system (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Captured images were processed with Bio-Rad LaserSharp software. The three-dimensional images were reconstructed from serial confocal images taken at 0.5 or 1-μm intervals along the z-axis. Analysis of GLUT4 Translocation by Confocal Microscopy—After incubation without or with nocodazole for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were treated without or with 10 nm insulin for 30 min, and then immunostained with anti-GLUT4 antibody as described above. Confocal images from 100 cells were obtained for each condition, and the individual cells were graded according to the continuity of the GLUT4 fluorescence signals at the peripheral rim of the cell. Thus, cell scored 0 without any continuous GLUT4 signal, 1 with continuity less than the third of the circumference, 2 with continuity between one- and two-thirds, and 3 with more than two-thirds. Extraction and Measurement of Polymerized and Unpolymerized Tubulin—Polymerized and unpolymerized tubulin were separated as described by Breitfeld et al. (30Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After incubation without or with nocodazole for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with extraction buffer (2 m glycerol, 100 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m PIPES/Na, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 30 s. The resulting infranatant below the cell cake, which contains monomeric tubulin, was incubated with SDS lysis buffer (0.4 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4) for 5 min at room temperature, and boiled for 3 min before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Unextracted polymerized tubulin associated with the cells was recovered by incubation with SDS lysis buffer for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation for 30 s at 500 × g. The infranatant was boiled for 3 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The immunoblots were semi-quantified by using NIH image software. Measurement of 3-O-Methyl-D-glucose Uptake—The cellular glucose transport activity was estimated by measuring the rate of 0.1 mm 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake by the oil-flotation method as described previously (29Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subcellular Membrane Fractionation and Immunoblotting—The plasma membrane and low density microsomal (LDM) fractions were prepared by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (27Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proteins in the plasma membrane and LDM fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (from Millipore). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and 154 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-GLUT4 (1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-GLUT1 (1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-VAMP-2 (1:1000 dilution), sheep anti-VAMP-3 (1:1000 dilution), or rabbit anti-IRAP (1:1000 dilution) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following an extensive wash, the blots were visualized by using ECL Western blotting System (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface GLUT4 Labeling and Measurement of GLUT4 Endocytosis—GLUT4 in the plasma membrane was labeled by limited proteolysis with trypsin as described by Czech and Buxton (31Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, adipocytes in Buffer A were stimulated with 10 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C, and then incubated for 15 min in the presence of 3 mm potassium cyanide in order to inhibit GLUT4 recycling by deprivation of metabolic energy. Then the cells were treated without or with 100 μm nocodazole for 30 min. TPCK-treated trypsin (a final concentration of 1 mg/ml) was added to the cells for the last 20 min of nocodazole treatment. For measurement of the amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml at the end of the incubation, and the cells were washed three times with STE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl and 1 mm EDTA/Na, pH 7.4), homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer, and subjected to subcellular membrane fractionation as described above. For measurement of GLUT4 endocytosis, the trypsin-treated cells were washed three times with Buffer A after the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml), resuspended in fresh Buffer A and incubated for 0 (immediately washed), 5, 10, or 20 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed three times with STE buffer, homogenized, and subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting with anti-GLUT4 antibody. Measurement of Tubulin Associated with GLUT4-containing Membranes—The LDM fractions were prepared as described above and incubated with 5 μl of anti-GLUT4 antiserum and 20 μl (bed volume) of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in STE buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with STE buffer. The proteins associated with the immunoadsorbed membranes were solubilized with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Detection of Phosphorylated Proteins—Adipocytes in Buffer A were washed with STE buffer and homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4) (for phosphotyrosine and phospho-c-Cbl) or homogenizing buffer (50 mm HEPES/Na, pH7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 KIU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate) (for phospho-Akt). After centrifugation for 2 min at 3,000 × g, the infranatant fraction below the fat was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phospho-c-Cbl (Tyr-774) or anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibodies. Phosphodiesterase Assay—Phoshodiesterase was assayed as described previously (32Kono T. Robinson F.W. Sarver J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7826-7835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubation of the enzyme with 0.1 μm [3H]cAMP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min at 30 °C in the presence of 4 mm MgSO4 and 40 mm TES buffer, pH 7.5. After the incubation, the fat cell phosphodiesterase was heat-denatured, the [3H]AMP formed was quantitatively degraded with snake venom into [3H]adenosine, and the latter was separated from unreacted [3H]cAMP by column chromatography on AG1-X2 (from Bio-Rad). Phosphodiesterase activity is shown in the unit of pmol of cAMP decomposed/min/mg of protein. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar); the standard used was crystalline bovine serum albumin. To investigate the physiological role of the microtubules in the subcellular trafficking of GLUT4, we first examined the effect of nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing reagent, on the integrity of the microtubules in isolated rat adipocytes by morphological and biochemical methods. Because the cytoplasm of isolated adipocyte is generally confined to a thin rim beneath the plasma membrane due to the presence of a lipid droplet, we obtained confocal images near the cell surface for observation of the microtubules. As shown in Fig. 1, the microtubules were observed as filamentous networks developed in the cytoplasm. Treatment with nocodazole for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in a dose-dependent disappearance of these filamentous signals (Fig. 1A). A significant portion of the microtubules was disrupted with nocodazole at 1 μm, and the disruption seemed nearly complete at 100 μm. With this concentration of nocodazole, we examined the time course of the disruption of the microtubules. As depicted in Fig. 1B, nocodazole caused a time-dependent disruption of the microtubules, with a nearly complete loss of the filamentous signals at 30 min. These morphological data were corroborated by biochemical measurement of the polymerized tubulin. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the amount of polymerized tubulin decreased in a dose-dependent manner by nocodazole treatment for 30 min at 37 °C, with a concomitant increase in the amount of tubulin monomer. Approximately 50% of the polymerized tubulin was lost with nocodazole at 1 μm, and the effect of nocodazole was maximal at 100 μm. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the microtubules resulted in dispersion of the perinuclear GLUT4 compartments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Fletcher L.M. Welsh G.I. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M.

To investigate the spatial relationship between the microtubules and GLUT4, we reconstructed three-dimensional images from serial confocal sections of double-immunostained cells. Fig. 3 illustrates the two-dimensional projections of the reconstructed three-dimensional images. The three-dimensional images revealed the microtubules as reticular filamentous network developed throughout the cytoplasm in the basal cells (Fig. 3b). GLUT4, on the other hand, were shown as punctate signals distributed throughout the cytoplasm with intense accumulation around the nuclei (Fig. 3a). Some, but not all of the GLUT4 signals were colocalized with the microtubules (Fig. 3, c and d, arrowheads), suggesting association of the GLUT4-containing membranes with the microtubules. Insulin stimulation did not cause any significant alterations in the distribution of microtubules (Fig. 3j), while the cell surface became diffusely labeled with the GLUT4 signals, with concomitant decrease in the punctate and perinucelar signals in the cytoplasm, suggesting translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (Fig. 3i). In addition, the association of GLUT4 with the microtubules apparently decreased in insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 3, k and l). Nocodazole treatment caused nearly completely disruption of the microtubules throughout the cytoplasm, resulting in more random distribution of GLUT4 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3e). In addition, the perinuclear GLUT4 signals became moderately dispersed although they were still in the vicinity of the nuclei. In such microtubule-disrupted cells, insulin stimulation apparently caused subcellular redistribution of GLUT4, but the insulin-induced surface labeling with GLUT4 and decrease in the cytoplasmic punctate GLUT4 signals were not so consistent among the cells as in control (nocodazole-untreated) cells (Fig. 3m). Such inconsistency in the extent of the insulin efffect among nocodazole-treated cells led us to further analyze the GLUT4 distribution in the microtubule-defic"

To test whether there is a protein-protein contact site between the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of factor IXa and factor VIIIa, we demonstrated that an antibody to the Gla domain of factor IXa inhibited factor VIIIa-dependent factor IXa activity, suggesting an interaction of the factor IXa Gla domain with factor VIIIa. To study this interaction, we synthesized three analogs of the factor IXa Gla domain (FIX1–47) with Phe-9, Phe-25, or Val-46 replaced, respectively, with benzoylphenylalanine (BPA), a photoactivatable cross-linking reagent. These factor IX Gla domain analogs maintain native tertiary structure, as demonstrated by calcium-induced fluorescence quenching and phospholipid binding studies. In the absence of phospholipid membranes, FIX1–47 was able to inhibit factor IXa activity. This inhibition is dependent on the presence of factor VIIIa, suggesting a contact site between the factor IXa Gla domain and factor VIIIa. To demonstrate a direct interaction we did cross-linking experiments with FIX1–479BPA, FIX1–4725BPA, and FIX1–4746BPA. Covalent cross-linking to factor VIIIa was observed primarily with FIX1–4725BPA and to a much lesser degree with FIX1–4746BPA. Immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody to the C2 domain of factor VIIIa indicate that the factor IX Gla domain cross-links to the A3-C1-C2 domain of factor VIIIa. These results suggest that the factor IXa Gla domain contacts factor VIIIa in the tenase complex through a contact site that includes phenylalanine 25 and perhaps valine 46.

Factor IX is composed of a single polypeptide comprising an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; BPA, benzoylphenylalanine.1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; BPA, benzoylphenylalanine.)-rich domain, an aromatic amino acid stack domain, two epidermal growth factor domains, and a C-terminal serine protease domain. The Gla domain contains 12 γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues a post-translationally modified glutamic acid residue. γ-Carboxylation occurs in the liver where the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase converts glutamic acid to γ-carboxyglutamic acid in an enzymatic reaction that requires vitamin K (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, the Gla domain folds to become a membrane-binding structure (2Furie B. Furie B.C.

In the absence of metal ions the Gla domain is largely unfolded and does not bind to membranes. Mg2+ ions, in the absence of Ca2+, support folding of residues 12–47 of factor IX but not folding of the membrane-interactive omega loop included in residues 1–11 (4Freedman S.J.

Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12126-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The metal ion-specific conformational changes have provided the basis for developing antibodies that recognize the Ca2+-dependent 11-amino acid membrane binding region (6Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa is a cofactor for the factor IXa-mediated cleavage of factor X to factor Xa. Factor VIII is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain composed of three A domains (A1, A2, and A3), one B domain, and two C domains (C1 and C2) in the sequence, A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (7Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A domains are homologous to ceruloplasmin, and the C domains are homologous to discoidin I, a phospholipid binding lectin (8Simpson D.L. Rosen S.D. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3487-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and to a murine milk fat globule membrane protein (9Stubbs J.D. Lekutis C. Singer K.L. Bui A. Yuzuki D. Srinivasan U. Parry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8417-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The B domain has no known homology to any other protein. Factor VIII is variably cleaved, prior to its secretion, between the B and A3 domains to yield a heterodimeric protein composed of a variably sized heavy chain (A1-A2-B) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2). Thrombin activates factor VIII to factor VIIIa via several cleavages within both the heavy and light chains to yield a heterotrimeric protein (A1, A2, A3-C1-C2) that is non-covalently associated. The C2 domain of factor VIII/VIIIa contains the major membrane binding motif (10Arai M. Scandella D. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin.

Properties of the membrane-binding interaction include high affinity (12Gilbert G.E. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), high specificity for membrane binding sites that include phosphatidylserine (13Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Barter S. Clouse S.B.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9577-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Factor IX is proteolytically activated to factor IXa, a serine protease. Factor VIII is activated to its cofactor form, factor VIIIa, via a proteolytic mechanism. Factor IXa and factor VIIIa assemble on phosphatidyl-l-serine-containing phospholipid membranes in the presence of Ca2+ to form an enzymatic complex known as the tenase complex (2Furie B. Furie B.C.

The tenase complex converts factor X to factor Xa, the enzyme that converts prothrombin to thrombin leading to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and the formation of a fibrin clot.

Furthermore, a naturally occurring mutation of the Gla domain of factor IX leads to loss of factor VIIIa-mediated tenase activity (23Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K.

In this report, we use a synthetic analog of the factor IX Gla domain, FIX1–47 (Fig. 1), which we modify by replacing a specific hydrophobic amino acid with the photoactivatable amino acid, benzoylphenylalanine. With these Gla domain peptides, we provide direct evidence using a cross-linking strategy for the binding of the factor IX Gla domain to the light chain of factor VIIIa. Reagents—Factor IXa and factor X were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Recombinant human factor VIII formulated in sucrose (Kogenate FS) was received as a gift from Bayer Canada and activated to factor VIIIa as described previously (24Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain phosphatidylserine (PS), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), and dansylated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Chromogenic substrate S-2765 was purchased from Diapharma Group Inc. ESH8 antibodies were purchased from American Diagnostica. Antibodies to the Gla domain of factor IXa were prepared as previously described (6Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antibody to γ-carboxyglutamic acid was a gift from Dr. Johan Stenflo (25Brown M.A. Stenberg L.M. Persson U. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19795-19802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The FIX1–47BPA analogues were synthesized as previously described (4Freedman S.J.

Enzymatic Assays—The activation of factor X by factor IXa was measured with a two-step amidolytic substrate assay. For inhibition experiments with the FIX1–47BPA peptides or with anti-FIX CaCl2-specific antibodies, factor IXa (20 nm) was incubated with 500 nm factor X, 4 nm factor VIIIa, and the specified concentrations of the FIX1–47 peptides or anti-FIX CaCl2-specific antibodies in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 25 °C. The reaction was then stopped with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA. The amount of factor Xa generated was determined immediately using the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (0.3125 mg/ml) using a Molecular Devices enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Experiments conducted without factor VIIIa were incubated for 120 min. Measurements were carried out in duplicate, and IC50 values for FIX1–47BPA peptide inhibition of factor IXa activity in the presence of factor VIIIa were determined by non-linear least-square fitting of the values of factor Xa generation versus the logarithm of FIX1–47 peptide concentration using SigmaPlot 8.0 for Windows (SPSS). Preparation of Phospholipid Vesicles—Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS, 75:25) were prepared by the method of Barenholz (26Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Phospholipids in chloroform were dried at 45 °C under N2, washed three times with methylene chloride, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and sonicated in a bath sonicator until the solution cleared. The suspension of phospholipid vesicles was centrifuged, first at 160,000 × g for 30 min and then at 250,000 × g for 90 min in a Beckman L8–80M ultracentrifuge using a Ti-70.1 rotor. The supernatant contained the small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphorus analysis (27Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Analyt. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5805) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence energy transfer experiments and fluorescence quenching experiments were performed as previously described (28Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation constants (K D) were calculated as described previously (29Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Experiments—Covalent cross-linking of BPA-labeled FIX1–47 peptides to factor VIIIa was performed through photoactivation of p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine substituted for specific hydrophobic residues in FIX1–47. Each of the three peptides (FIX1–479BPA, FIX1–4725BPA, or FIX1–4746BPA), at a concentration of 1 μm, was mixed with factor VIIIa (100 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. The samples were irradiated with a B-100 AP ultraviolet lamp (UVP) for 20 min at a distance of 5.5 cm. Non-covalent Ca2+-mediated protein-protein binding was reversed by the addition of SDS and EDTA and heating at 37 °C for 5 min. The samples were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a primary mouse monoclonal antibody to γ-carboxyglutamic acid, followed by the addition of a secondary antibody, sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody. The blots were developed with an ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cross-linking protocol was carried out for each peptide in the presence and absence factor VIIIa, and calcium. In addition, cross-linking experiments were carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of factor IXa. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with ESH8, a monoclonal antibody to the C2 domain of factor VIIIa. After irradiation and photo-induced cross-linking, the samples were immunoprecipitated with ESH8, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting as described for the cross-linking experiments. The tenase complex, assembled on phospholipid membranes, is composed of the enzyme, factor IXa, and the cofactor, factor VIIIa. To test the hypothesis that the factor IXa Gla domain might bind to factor VIIIa, inhibition of factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X was performed in the presence or absence of factor VIIIa using an antibody to the calcium-stabilized conformation of factor IXa (anti-FIX·Ca(II)-specific antibodies). The epitope recognized by this antibody is targeted against residues 1–11 within the Gla domain of factor IXa. Because anti-FIX·Ca(II)-specific antibodies inhibit factor IX binding to phospholipid membranes (6Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phospholipid membranes were omitted from this assay system. In the absence of phospholipid membranes, factor IXa can catalyze the conversion of factor X to factor Xa albeit at a significantly reduced rate. Anti-FIX·Ca(II)-specific antibodies inhibited the generation of factor Xa by factor IXa, if factor VIIIa was present (Fig. 2A). In the absence of factor VIIIa, there was no inhibition of the conversion of factor X to factor Xa by factor IXa (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with antibody-mediated inhibition of the interaction of the Gla domain of factor IXa with factor VIIIa. A peptide comprising the Gla and aromatic amino acid stack domains of factor IXa, FIX1–47, was also used to study factor IXa Gla domain-factor VIIIa interactions. FIX1–47 has been previously demonstrated to be a good model for studying the biochemical properties of the factor IXa Gla domain (28Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate direct binding between the Gla domain of factor IXa and factor VIIIa, analogs of FIX1–47 containing benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) were synthesized. BPA forms covalent bonds with adjacent structures within a 3 Å radius when irradiated at 350 nm (30Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). It has been previously used to identify the residues that constitute a phospholipid binding site in factor IXa (4Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Three analogs were chosen based upon the positioning of the BPA in the Gla domain, and each had different amino acids replaced with BPA (Fig. 1). Phe-9 and Val-46 were replaced, respectively, in two peptides (FIX1–479BPA and FIX1–4746BPA) and have been previously characterized (4Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A third peptide was prepared with Phe-25 replaced by BPA. All three peptides bind calcium similarly to unsubstituted FIX1–47 (28Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the BPA substitution does not disrupt tertiary structure (Fig. 3A). Fifty percent fluorescence quenching occurred at 210, 100, and 317 μm CaCl2 for FIX1–479BPA, FIX1–4725BPA, and FIX1–4746BPA, respectively, similar to 50 μm CaCl2 seen with FIX1–47 (28Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that they all undergo the calcium-induced fluorescence transition. FIX1–479BPA, FIX1–4725BPA, and FIX1–4746BPA bind to phospholipid membranes with similar binding affinities, and the binding is reversible with EDTA as demonstrated previously (4Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant, K D, for the binding of FIX1–4725BPA to phospholipid membranes was 1.2 μm (Fig. 3B), similar to the binding affinities of FIX1–479BPA (1.5 μm), FIX1–4746BPA (6 μm), and FIX1–47 (2.4 μm) for phospholipid membranes and within experimental error of the system (4Freedman S.J.

The ability of the BPA-containing FIX1–47 peptides to inhibit the conversion of factor X to factor Xa by factor IXa in the presence and absence of factor VIIIa was determined in the absence of phospholipid membranes. A representative experiment, depicted in Fig. 4, shows inhibition of factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X by FIX1–4725BPA in the presence (Fig. 4A) but not in the absence of factor VIIIa (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that FIX1–4725BPA can bind directly to a specific site in factor VIIIa, preventing factor VIIIa from binding to factor IXa and serving as a cofactor in the activation of factor X to factor Xa. The IC50 of this inhibition was 3.8 ± 0.35 μm. The IC50 of the other peptides were generally similar as shown in Table I. Although somewhat higher activity was observed in the presence of very low concentrations of the FIX1–47 25BPA peptide, as shown in the representative experiment depicted in Fig. 4A (∼10% on average; four experiments), the basis for this effect is unclear. It could reflect some stabilization of the normally very labile factor VIIIa during the 1-h assay period, because it was not seen in the absence of factor VIIIa (Fig. 4B). This observation notwithstanding, the overall effect of this peptide was to prevent tenase complex formation by inhibiting the binding of factor VIIIa to factor IXaTable IInhibition by the FIX 1–47 peptides of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex in the absence of phospholipid membranesPeptideIC50μ mFIX1-479BPA1.8 ± 0.97FIX1-4725BPA3.8 ± 0.35FIX1-4746BPA3.1 ± 1.16 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate direct binding between the factor IXa Gla domain and factor VIIIa and to identify the region on FIX1–47 that is near or in the contact site that binds to factor VIIIa, cross-linking experiments were performed to determine which FIX1–47 BPA species would bind covalently to factor VIIIa. The photoactivatable peptides, FIX1–479BPA, FIX1–4725BPA, or FIX1–4746BPA, were incubated with factor VIIIa in the presence of CaCl2. After irradiation, the protein mixtures were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-γ-carboxyglutamic acid antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, FIX1–4725BPA was covalently cross-linked to factor VIIIa, whereas reaction mixtures containing FIX1–47 9BPA showed no cross-linking. There is a faint band in the FIX1–4746BPA cross-linking experiment suggesting cross-linking is present albeit to a very minor degree. Furthermore, cross-linking was observed only when the reaction mixture included FIX1–47 25BPA or FIX1–4746BPA peptides, calcium ions, and factor VIIIa and when the reaction was irradiated at 350 nm. The complex of FIX1–47 25BPA coupled to factor VIIIa migrated on SDS gels in a position just above that of the light chain of factor VIIIa, suggesting a covalent complex between FIX1–47 25BPA and the light chain of factor VIIIa. To substantiate this result, we immunoprecipitated the cross-linked material with ESH8, monoclonal antibody to the C2 domain of factor VIIIa. The immunoprecipitate was run on an SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with an anti-Gla antibody. This result, shown in Fig. 6, substantiates the conclusion that the region on factor VIIIa to which FIX1–4725BPA binds is the light chain (A3-C1-C2 domain).Fig. 6Immunoabsorption of the covalent complex with a factor VIII light chain antibody. Immunoprecipitation was performed with ESH8, a monoclonal antibody to the C2 domain of factor VIIIa. Following FIX1–4725BPA covalent cross-linking to factor VIIIa in the presence of phospholipid membranes, the samples were incubated with ESH8 or a control IgG antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose. The material bound to the beads was then subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and probed with an antibody to γ-carboxyglutamic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish the specificity of the cross-linking of FIX1–4725BPA to the light chain of factor VIIIa, full-length factor IXa was employed at different concentrations to inhibit cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of increasing amounts of factor IXa led to complete inhibition of the cross-linking of FIX1–4725BPA to factor VIIIa. In the present work, we demonstrate that the Gla domain of factor IXa interacts with the light chain of factor VIIIa. A schematic model of this complex, assembled on phospholipid membranes, is presented in Fig. 8. Two contact sites on factor IXa have previously been implicated in this interaction. Using fluorescence anisotropy, Fay et al. demonstrated a contact site between the A2 domain of factor VIIIa and the serine protease domain of factor IXa. This interaction was characterized by an affinity of ∼300 nm (31O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Another contact site of higher affinity (∼15 nm) has been identified between the A3 domain of factor VIIIa and the first epidermal growth factor domain of factor IXa (34Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that the Gla domain of factor IXa and light chain of factor VIIIa, both phospholipid-binding structures, also bind to each other. Because factor VIIa is homologous with factor IXa, the contact sites through which tissue factor activates factor VIIa provide useful comparisons to the contact sites through which factor VIIIa activates factor IXa. On-off rates using both fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance demonstrate three interactive sites between the enzyme, factor VIIa, and its cofactor, tissue factor. A site of interaction between the Gla domain of factor VIIa and tissue factor is one site of interaction analogous to that identified in the present work. This site is considered to be of lower affinity in comparison to the other sites of interaction. The similar properties that we describe for the factor VIIIa-factor IXa Gla domain complex are consistent with that report (35Österlund M. Persson E. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Freskgård P.-O. Thromb. Hemost. 2001; 86: 1788Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of the involved residues in tissue factor that contact factor VIIa confirm that these sites become protected from solvent upon binding factor VIIa (36Owenius R. Osterlund M. Svensson M. Lindgren M. Persson E. Freskgard P.O. Carlsson U. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2357-2369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the contact between the light chain of factor VIIIa and the factor IXa Gla domain is physiologically important. First, a naturally occurring mutation in the Gla domain of factor IXa leading to hemophilia B affect function only in the presence of factor VIIIa. This propisitus, with a substitution of glycine 12 by arginine, has a severe bleeding phenotype (23Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, factor IXa-factor VIIIa interactions can be inhibited by a peptide comprising the Gla domain of factor IXa, FIX1–47. Our data suggest an interaction between the C-terminal half of the Gla domain of factor IXa and the light chain of factor VIIIa. In the folded Gla domain Phe-25 is located at the distal end from the omega loop and phospholipid binding site and not too distant from residue 46. The side chains of Phe-25 and Val-46 project from the backbone of the Gla domain at an angle greater than 90 degrees from one another. Nevertheless, it is possible that the side chains of both residues interact with the light chain of factor VIIIa, although from the cross-linking data Phe-25 may interact more effectively than Val-46 (5Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12126-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The failure of FIX1–479BPA to cross-link to factor VIIIa suggests that the face of the omega loop, including Phe-9, does not contact factor VIIIa; in the presence of membranes it is buried in the phospholipid bilayer. 2M. Shenone, B. Furie, and B. C. Furie, unpublished data. In this study, we identify a region of the factor IXa Gla domain containing Phe-25 and Val-46 as a contact site with factor VIIIa. These contact sites are localized to the C-terminal portion of the Gla domain, which is similar to two homologous serine proteases, factor VIIa and protein C. The crystal structure of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex demonstrates a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of the Gla domain of factor VIIa and tissue factor (37Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In the case of the protein C-protein S complex, replacement of the Gla domain of protein C with that of prothrombin renders protein C activity independent of protein S, its cofactor. This protein S dependence localizes to residues 23–46 of the Gla domain of protein C (38Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction between the Gla domain of factor IXa and the light chain of factor VIIIa. Given that both the Gla domain of factor IXa and the C2 domain of factor VIIIa are membrane-binding structures, we envision these regions bound to membranes and to each other. Whether the occupancy of this contact site promotes allosteric activation of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex on phospholipid membranes remains to be determined. We thank Drs. Johan Stenflo, Mark Brown, and Leisa Sternberg for their generous gift of the anti-γ-carboxyglutamic acid antibody and Dr. Gary Gilbert for his critical review of the manuscript."

We have used enzymatic and chemical probes to follow the movement of Pyrococcus RNA polymerase (RNAP) along the glutamate dehydrogenase gene during transcription initiation and transition to elongation.

The upstream edge of RNAP was in close contact with the archaeal transcription factors TATA box-binding protein/transcription factor B in complexes stalled at position +5. Movement of the downstream edge of the RNAP was not detected by exonuclease III footprinting until register +8. A first structural transition characterized by movement of the upstream edge of RNAP was observed at registers +6/+7. A major transition was observed at registers +10/+11. In complexes stalled at these positions also the downstream edge of RNA polymerase started translocation, and reclosure of the initially open complex occurred indicating promoter clearance. Between registers +11 and +20 both RNAP and transcription bubble moved synchronously with RNA synthesis. The distance of the catalytic center to the front edge of the exo III footprint was ∼12 nucleotides in all registers.

Finally, a stable ternary elongation complex is formed. These steps have been extensively studied during the last 2 decades in bacterial RNA polymerase and eukaryotic polymerase II (for reviews see Refs. 1Heumann H. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Hermann T.

S. A. 1998; 95: 15218-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have been studied. The transition from initiation to elongation has not yet been investigated in Archaea. In bacteria, promoter isomerization from closed to open complex catalyzed by the predominant RNA polymerase holoenzyme (ββ′α2σ70) occurs spontaneously in a temperature-dependent manner (8deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9van Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcription Regulation.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6535-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase specific for promoters of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (ββ′α2σ54; see Ref. 11Kustu S. Santero E. Keener J. Popham D. Weiss D. J. Microbiol. 1989; 53: 367-376Google Scholar) require ATP hydrolysis for promoter melting. In the pol II system promoter opening involves the helicase activity of TFIIH (12Timmers H.Th.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases I and III share with the σ70 containing E. coli RNA polymerase the ability to produce an open complex of 12–15 bp without ATP hydrolysis. In the pol III system the presence of the general transcription factor TFIIIB is required in addition to open complex formation (3Kassavetis G.A. Blanco J.A. Johnsen T.E. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Methods have been described to prepare ternary complexes stalled at different positions. Analyses of these transcription complexes by nuclease and chemical footprinting provided detailed insights into the basic mechanism of initiation of transcription in enteric bacteria and the eukaryotic pol II system. Pol II complexes were subjected to numerous structural alterations during formation of the first 30 phosphodiester bonds (14Cai H. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.Th.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In bacteria, a discontinuous model of elongation (inch-worming) was inferred from these studies (17Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The finding that movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template was not synchronous with single nucleotide additions was alternatively explained by transient backtracking of RNA polymerase (19Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Goldfarb and co-workers (20Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that the strength of the RNA-DNA hybrid is essential for maintaining stability of transcription complexes by preventing backtracking of RNA polymerase. Irregular footprints observed earlier were interpreted by these authors in the light of their findings as reflections of mixed populations of transcription complexes in productive and backtracked states. The archaeal transcription system is a simplified version of the eukaryotic pol II machinery (21Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The archaeal TATA box is recognized by an archaeal TATA box-binding protein (TBP). This interaction is stabilized by transcription factor B (TFB), a homologue of general pol II transcription factor TFIIB. This TBP-TFB promoter complex recruits the archaeal RNA polymerase that shows striking similarity in sequence and subunit composition to pol II. With the exception of TFE, which is homologous to the α-subunit of pol II transcription factor TFIIE (23Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 133-138Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), no other homologues of the basal eukaryotic transcriptional machinery were detected in archaeal genomes. Consistent with the lack of TFIIH in Archaea and in contrast to the striking general similarity to the pol II system, the archaeal RNA polymerase does not require hydrolysis of ATP for open complex formation at the tRNAVal promoter of Methanococcus vannielii (6Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have developed recently a cell-free transcription system for the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus (26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner w. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This highly purified system consisting of bacterially produced TBP and TFB and RNA polymerase isolated from Pyrococcus cells was used for the characterization of the archaeal preinitiation complex (27Hausner W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), analysis of the trajectory of DNA in an archaeal transcription complex (28Bartlett M.S. Thomm M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we used immobilized templates to purify Pyrococcus ternary transcription complexes stalled in registers between +5 and +20. Analysis of these complexes by exonuclease III (exo III) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting provided a detailed view of the early steps of transcription in Archaea. Reagents and Enzymes—Exonuclease III was purchased from New England Biolabs. Potassium permanganate was obtained from Merck. [α-32P]UTP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Hartmann Bioanalytics (Braunschweig, Germany). Templates for in Vitro Transcription and Footprinting Reactions— Nine templates were constructed. All cytosine residues in the non-template strand between the transcription start site and position +20 relative to the transcription start site were substituted by other bases using PCR and the plasmid pUC19 containing the gdh (glutamate dehydrogenase) gene from –95 to +163 from P. furiosus. The forward primer was complementary to sequences ∼160 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and the reverse primer was partly complementary to sequences from positions –15 to +20 used to induce the point mutations. After hydrolysis of the amplified fragments with EcoRI, the resultant DNA fragments contained the promoter and the mutated region downstream of the transcription start site of the gdh gene. The fragments were inserted between the EcoRI and SmaI (compatible to the blunt ends on one side of the fragment produced by PCR amplification) restriction sites of the vector pUC19. The resulting fragments were transformed into E. coli JM109. The resulting plasmids pUC19/gdh-C5, pUC19/gdh-C6, pUC19/gdh-C7, pUC19/gdh-C8, pUC19/gdh-C9, pUC19/gdh-C10, pUC19/gdh-C11, pUC19/gdh-C15, and pUC19/gdh-C20 were used to generate transcription templates by PCR of 263–278 bp in length. Oligonucleotides complementary to DNA sequences ∼160 bp upstream and ∼90 bp downstream of the transcription start site were used as primers. One primer was labeled with biotin, and the resulting fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of Pyrococcus RNA Polymerase—RNA polymerase from P. furiosus was purified as described previously (26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner w. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Transcription Factors— The transcription factor TBP from Pyrococcus woesei was overproduced in E. coli as described previously (27Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of P. woesei TBP and P. furiosus TBP show 100% identity. TFP from P. furiosus was expressed and purified as described previously for P. woesei (27Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immobilized in Vitro Transcription Assays—In vitro transcription assays were performed according to Ref. 26Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner w. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. A standard reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 60 ng of immobilized template, 660 ng of RNA polymerase, 150 ng of recombinant TBP, 120 ng of recombinant TFB, 40 μm ATP and GTP, 2 μm UTP, and 0.15 MBq [α-32P]UTP (110 TBq/mmol). The transcription buffer contained 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2. Transcription reactions were performed for 3 min at 70 °C. To perform footprinting experiments, the immobilized templates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. [α-32P]UTP was not added to the reaction. Isolation of Stalled Ternary Complexes—Ternary complexes stalled in in vitro transcription reactions at positions +5 to +11, +15, and +20 relative to the transcription start site were isolated at 20 °C by the use of a magnet, so DNA attached to magnetic beads could be located to one edge of the reaction tube, and the supernatant could be removed. To remove TBP/TFB from promoter DNA, complexes were washed with transcription buffer containing 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine (NLS) and 40 μm GTP. Then the isolated ternary complexes were resuspended in transcription buffer and either analyzed on a 28% denaturing polyacrylamide gel or supplemented with all four nucleotides (40 μm each) but no additional radioactivity in a total volume of 25 μl. During further incubation for 3 min at 70 °C run-off transcripts were formed. Transcription reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Exonuclease III Footprinting—To perform footprinting experiments, the immobilized DNA templates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP on the free 5′-end of either the coding or the RNA-like strand, depending on which strand was attached to the magnetic particle on the 5′-end. The in vitro transcription reaction was performed as described, but no [α-32P]UTP was omitted. After the complexes had been stalled at positions +5 to +11, +15, and +20 relative to the transcription start site, they were isolated as described. Then they were resuspended in 25 μlof reaction buffer for exo III digestion (40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After addition of 100 units of exo III, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of loading buffer, and the samples and sequencing reactions were loaded on a 6% denaturing sequencing gel. KMnO 4 Sensitivity Assay—To perform KMnO4 probing, the immobilized DNA templates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP on the free 5′-end of either the coding or the non-coding strand, depending on which strand was attached to the magnetic particle on the 5′-end. The in vitro transcription reaction was performed as described, but no [α-32P]UTP was added. After the complexes had been stalled at positions +5to +11, +15, and +20 relative to the transcription start site, they were isolated as described. The complexes were resuspended in 25 μl of transcription buffer, and 2.5 μl of potassium permanganate (250 mm) were added. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 45 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.7 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 μl of stop mix (1.25% SDS and 125 mm EDTA). The supernatant was removed, and the modified immobilized DNA was resuspended in 18 μl of water, and piperidine was added to a total volume of 20 μl. The DNA was subjected to cleavage by piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. Piperidine was removed by ethanol precipitation, and the dried pellets were resuspended in loading buffer and loaded together with a sequence ladder onto a 6% denaturing sequencing gel. To detect the open complex 2.5 μl of KMnO4 (250 mm) were added immediately after incubation of template DNA with TBP, TFB, and RNA polymerase for 3 min at 70 °C, and the reaction was performed for another 3 min at 70 °C. The reaction was stopped and subjected to piperidine treatment as described. Stalled Archaeal Transcription Complexes Contain a Homogenous Population of RNA Molecules—To investigate the transition between initiation and elongation, we constructed a set of sequence variations of the Pyrococcus gdh gene sequence with their first C residue between position +6 and +21. RNA synthesis can be blocked at positions 5–11, 15, and 20 (Fig. 1) by omitting CTP from transcription reactions. The primers used for the construction of these gdh-C derivatives (Fig. 1) were biotinylated allowing rapid isolation of ternary transcription complexes by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Both in bacterial and eukaryotic systems read-through of RNAP beyond the expected stall sites has been observed (31Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Fiedler U. Timmers H.Th.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2706-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To establish the conditions for the synthesis of RNA products of correct size, we analyzed first cell-free transcripts from the template containing the first C residue at position +21 (gdh-C20; Fig. 2A). RNA products were labeled with [α-32P]UTP. After short incubation times between 30 s and 3 min, an RNA product of 20 nt was synthesized as the predominant product (data not shown). After incubation times between 5 and 45 min, additional products of 21 and 32 nt probably caused by misincorporation at positions 21 and 22 were observed. Products of the expected size were also transcribed from the other templates shown in Fig. 1 when transcription reactions were conducted for 3 min (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Isolated ternary complexes contain RNAs of correct size and are transcriptionally active. Transcription experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stalled complexes were washed in washing buffer to remove unincorporated nucleotides and released RNA. A, the isolated complexes were analyzed on a 28% polyacrylamide gel. Lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 show the RNA products of the isolated complexes stalled in the indicated registers. The higher mobility of the 5-nt RNA products in lanes 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 is due to the last incorporated nucleotide in the nascent RNA being an A instead of a G. Minor products in lanes 15 and 17 could be detected after longer exposure. When the isolated complexes were chased by the addition of all NTPs (40 μm each), no RNA products could be detected in lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 indicating that all isolated complexes remained in a transcriptionally competent state. B, the run-off products in the supernatant ranging in length from 98 nt for gdh-C5 to 113 nt for gdh-C20 are shown. They were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stalled Complexes Are Stable and Transcriptionally Competent—To investigate the stability of stalled ternary complexes, the various biotinylated templates (Fig. 1) were incubated for 3 min in transcription reactions, and ternary complexes were purified by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The RNA contained in these purified complexes was analyzed by PAGE. In addition, the RNA released by the RNAP which was not bound to the magnetic beads was analyzed. The ratio of nascent RNA in ternary complexes to released RNA increased with the length of the RNA molecules synthesized (Table I). When isolated complexes were incubated in transcription buffer supplemented with all nucleotides, labeled RNA associated with isolated complexes could no longer be detected (data not shown). This finding suggests that the nascent RNA molecules were retained in functional ternary complexes that were elongated to run-off products after addition of nucleotides. To provide conclusive evidence that the isolated complexes were functionally active, the RNA products released after addition of nucleotides were analyzed. Fig. 2B shows that run-off transcripts were synthesized under these conditions. Therefore, the isolated ternary transcription complexes are still functionally competent and seem suitable for subsequent analyses of footprints of the RNAP and of growth of transcription bubble at each of these stall sites. An additional analysis of the labeled RNA in isolated complexes stalled at each register between +5 and +20 (see Fig. 1) showed that RNA of the expected size was the major product in most cases (Fig. 2A, lanes 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17). Longer exposures of complexes stalled in register +20 and +15 showed the existence of minor RNA products estimated to be 18 and 13 nt in length (Fig. 2A, lanes 15 and 17). At present it is unclear whether these shorter RNA products are caused by pausing of RNAP or whether they are due to hydrolysis of completed RNA from its 3′-end. All complexes stalled between +7 and +20 contained a 5-nt product suggesting the existence of DNA fragments in complex with RNAP paused at position +5. Further analysis of exo III and KMnO4 footprints showed that the movement from +5 to position +6/+7 marks a significant transition in archaeal transcription which is probably a rate-limiting step (see below). However, these complexes stalled at +5 were not arrested because they could be chased after addition of nucleotides (Fig. 2A, lanes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18).Table IRatio of nascent to released RNARegister of stalled complexC5C6C7C8C9C10C11C1520Nascent RNA (%)191111182021437375Released RNA (%)818989828079572725 Open table in a new tab Interaction of Stalled RNA Polymerase with DNA Probed by Exonuclease III Footprinting—We used exo III as a probe to identify the upstream and downstream boundaries of RNA polymerase at each of the stall sites. To define the upstream extent of the binding site, linear DNA was 5′-end-labeled with 32P on the template DNA strand, and the biotin label was associated with the 5′-end of the complementary DNA strand. For analysis of the downstream extent of the RNAP-binding site, the 5′-end of the RNA-like strand was labeled with 32P, and the biotin label was attached to the 5′-end of the template DNA strand. Cell-free transcription reactions were conducted at 70 °C and the subsequent purification of transcription complexes at 20 °C. Because exo III was rapidly inactivated at 70 °C (data not shown), ternary complexes were incubated with exo III at 37 °C. At this temperature, initiation of transcription did not occur, but already formed isolated ternary complexes can be elongated by addition of a complete set of nucleotides (data not shown). Therefore, the complexes probed by exo III at 37 °C were transcriptionally active and competent. When the downstream boundary of the complex stalled at position +5 was analyzed, two distinct signals not present in the control reaction were identified (Fig. 3A, left panel). The strong diffuse band located between positions –19 to –15 corresponds approximately to the downstream end of the TBP/TFB footprint identified in the Methanococcus and Sulfolobus system by DNase I protection analyses (6Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The second signal at position +18 corresponds to the downstream edge of RNA polymerase identified in the Methanococcus and Sulfolobus system. After addition of NLS to the complexes, the exo III stall site at position –19/–15 was no longer detected, whereas the second signal at position +18 was not sensitive to NLS treatment (Fig. 3A, left lane in left panel). We therefore conclude that NLS removes TBP/TFB from the template, whereas the archaeal RNA polymerase in ternary complexes remains associated with DNA like eukaryotic pol II (14Cai H. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consecutive elongation of RNA from 5 to 8 nt did not cause movement of the downstream edge of RNAP (Fig. 3A and summary of footprinting data in Fig. 5). Between registers +9 and +20 the downstream edge of RNAP translocated approximately synchronously with RNA elongation. The downstream end of the RNAP footprint was located at positions +20, +22, +24 + 26, and +32 in registers +9, +10, +11, +15, and +20 (Fig. 3A and Fig. 5).Fig. 5Map of exo III footprints, single-stranded DNA regions, and of the RNA-DNA hybrid in early archaeal elongation complexes. The DNA sequences containing the transcription initiation region are shown for each stalled transcription complex and for the open complex the promoter is also depicted. The designation of templates on the left refer to the stall position. The TATA box, the BRE, and the transcription initiation site (In) are boxed. The black vertical lines indicate the stall positions. The limits of the RNA polymerase as defined by exo III footprinting were marked with arrows. The numbers refer to the nucleotide relative to the transcription start site. Black circles show the nucleotides with strong reactivity to KMnO4, gray those with less, and white circles those with weak reactivity to KMnO4. Modifications downstream of the stall position are marked by asterisks. The gray box is the estimated extent of the transcription bubble. DNA strands were regarded as separated when the base in either one of the two strands was accessible to KMnO4 modification. Strand asymmetry in chemical modification is due to an RNA-DNA hybrid. The portions of DNA supposed to be in a hybrid with RNA are underlined. Because of the sequence dependence of KMnO4 the extent of the RNA-DNA hybrid cannot be determined exactly (dotted line). For the same reason the size of the transcription bubble is a lower estimate in most cases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In register +5, a distinct upstream boundary of RNA polymerase could not be identified (Fig. 3B, left lane). The two signals at positions –42 and –35 are almost identical with the upstream edges of the TBP/TFB and TBP DNase I footprint at the Pyrococcus gdh promoter (27Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In all archaeal systems investigated, the upstream edge of RNAP could not be directly determined in preinitiation complexes. Addition of RNA polymerase to TBP/TFB promoter complexes caused extension of the protection patterns downstream but not upstream of the TBP/TFB-binding site (6Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

However, in complexes stalled between position +7 and +9 an upstream edge of RNAP could be identified at position –7 (Fig. 3B and Fig. 5). This finding indicates that a structural transition occurred in the early elongation complex stalled between +7 and +9. The upstream edge of complexes stalled at positions +10, +15, and +20 was located at position –4, +1, and +4 (Fig. 3B and Fig. 5). This finding indicates continuous movement of RNAP with the extension of the RNA chain between registers +10 to +20.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, electrophysiological and biochemical methods, we demonstrate here that the recently described toxin mutant (LTXN4C) is unable to insert into membranes and form pores due to its inability to assemble into tetramers. However, this mutant still binds to major LTX receptors (latrophilin and neurexin) and causes strong transmitter exocytosis in synaptosomes, hippocampal slice cultures, neuromuscular junctions, and chromaffin cells. In the absence of mutant incorporation into the membrane, receptor activation must be the only mechanism by which LTXN4C triggers exocytosis. An interesting feature of this receptor-mediated transmitter release is its dependence on extracellular Ca2+. Because Ca2+ is also strictly required for LTX interaction with neurexin, the latter might be the only receptor mediating the LTXN4C action. To test this hypothesis, we used conditions (substitution of Ca2+ in the medium with Sr2+) under which LTXN4C does not bind to any member of the neurexin family but still interacts with latrophilin. We show that, in all the systems tested, Sr2+ fully replaces Ca2+ in supporting the stimulatory effect of LTXN4C. These results indicate that LTXN4C can cause neurotransmitter release just by stimulating a receptor and that neurexins are not critical for this receptor-mediated action. α-Latrotoxin (LTX) causes massive release of neurotransmitters via a complex mechanism involving (i) activation of receptor(s) and (ii) toxin insertion into the plasma membrane with (iii) subsequent pore formation.

This toxin has been extensively used to probe molecular mechanisms that control exocytosis of both synaptic vesicles (SVs) and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) in such diverse models as brain, neuromuscular junctions, and endocrine cells (for reviews see Refs. 1Rosenthal L.

Because toxin pores damage cell membranes and produce strong cytotoxic effects (e.g. 13–15), only the receptor-transduced LTX action is likely to reveal intact, physiologically important exocytotic mechanisms. Unfortunately, this action is difficult to study using the wild-type LTX (LTXWT) because it easily inserts into membranes and forms ionic pores (9Volynski K.V. Meunier F.A. Lelianova V.G. Dudina E.E.

This problem could be overcome by designing LTX mutants that would lack the propensity of membrane insertion, and a promising toxin variant has been described recently (LTXN4C) (17Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This mutant had the same affinity for the receptors as LTXWT (17Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Südhof T.C.

Lacking the major (ionophore) activity, LTXN4C was originally thought to be altogether inactive (12Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ichtchenko K.

However, we have discovered that, in fact, LTXN4C strongly stimulates receptor-mediated transmitter release (8Ashton A.C. Volynski K.E. Lelianova V.G. Orlova E.V. Van Renterghem C. Canepari M.

If LTXN4C acts via receptor stimulation, which LTX receptor is crucial for this signaling? Two major receptors have been isolated that bind LTX specifically and with high affinities: neurexin Iα (NRX Iα) (18Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and latrophilin 1 (LPH, also called CIRL) (19Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F.

NRXs are a family of single-pass transmembrane proteins that resemble cell-contact molecules (18Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). There are three long (α) and three short (β) forms of NRXs transcribed from three homologous genes (18Ushkaryov Y.A.

A. 1993; 90: 6410-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). While NRX Iα binds LTX strongly, other homologs have low affinities for the toxin (22Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, all NRXs strictly require Ca2+ for this interaction (22Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C.

LPH is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds LTX avidly under all ionic conditions (5Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3909-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). LPH also has two homologs (LPH 2 and 3), but these do not interact with LTX appreciably (22Sugita S.

Although this hypothesis contradicted our previous results (5Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A.

B. 1999; 354: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we decided to test it using the fact that Sr2+ does not support the interaction of LTX with NRX Iα but substitutes Ca2+ in LTX-evoked exocytosis (5Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3909-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The objectives of the current study were (i) to reveal the molecular basis of the mutant's inability to form ionic pores and (ii) to assess the importance of NRX(s) for the receptor-mediated LTX action. We show that LTXN4C is unable to form pores because it fails to assemble into tetramers. In several model systems that endogenously express both LPH and NRXs (rat synaptosomes; rat hippocampal cultures; mouse neuromuscular junctions, NMJs; and bovine chromaffin cells), we demonstrate that, in the presence of Sr2+, LTXN4C does not interact with any NRX, but still strongly stimulates receptor-mediated neurotransmitter release. We conclude that NRXs are not strictly required for the receptor-transduced LTX signaling and suggest that LPH is the major player in this process. Materials—Native toxin (LTXNAT) was purified from the black widow spider venom as described (16Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M.

A polyclonal anti-LTX Ab was obtained by immunizing rabbits with SDS-denatured LTX.

These fragments were consecutively ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector pMelBacA (Invitrogen). The final LTXN4C construct was verified by complete sequencing and co-transfected with the viral DNA (Bac-N-Blue kit, Invitrogen) into Sf9 cells cultured in complete TNM-FH medium (Invitrogen). Positive plaque selection, production of high-titer baculovirus stocks and large-scale expression of recombinant toxins in Hi5 cells was carried out as published (28Volynski K.E. Nosyreva E.D. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant toxins were purified by affinity chromatography on the A15 mAb attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For this purpose, expression medium containing a secreted recombinant LTX was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Whatman) and then passed through the antibody column. The column was washed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and eluted with three column volumes of 1 m MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Chromatographic fractions were analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis/Western blotting, and those containing the recombinant LTXs were pooled, dialyzed against TBSM (in mm: 150 NaCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 50 Tris-HCl; pH 8.2) and concentrated in a Vivaspin6 unit (Sartorious) to ∼50 nm.

One day after transfection, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of recombinant toxins in buffer A (in mm: 145 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 5.6 glucose, 0.5 MgCl2, 15 HEPES, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 μCi/ml of 45Ca2+. After 5 min incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells washed twice. The amount of radioactivity accumulated by cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting of cells solubilized in 1% Triton X-100. For electrophysiological detection of toxin channels, CHO cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen), were transiently co-transfected with receptor constructs mixed with pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) encoding green fluorescent protein (to identify transfected cells); FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used to aid transfection. Recordings were performed 29–41 h after transfection, on isolated cells expressing green fluorescent protein. The extracellular solution contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 3 CaCl2, 48 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; pH 7.4. The 2–5 MΩ patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution consisting of (in mm): 135 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.2 GTP-Na2; pH 7.2 with CsOH. Pulse and Pulsefit (HEKA) software was used for experimental protocols and analysis. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Inward currents induced by LTXs were measured and a voltage stimulation protocol (10 mV × 40 ms steps to –90/+30 mV from holding potential of –60 mV) was applied every 1 min to check membrane conductance. Native Electrophoresis—The recombinant toxins were subjected to native alkaline electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (29Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Prior to loading onto the gel, some samples were incubated for 5 min with 0.2% SDS (without boiling) or with 1% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (with boiling). After separation, the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using a polyclonal rabbit anti-LTX Ab. Cryomicroscopy and Image Processing—Specimens for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) were prepared by applying 4-μl aliquots of 100 μg/ml LTXN4C in TBSM onto grids containing a porous carbon foil, followed by immediate vitrification; for details and references, see Ref. 29Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar. Images of the vitrified samples kept at –184 °C were taken in a CM200 cryomicroscope equipped with a field-emission gun, at ×50,000 magnification and 3.1 ± 0.1 μm defocus. The micrographs were digitized at a step size of 14 μm (2.8 Å on the specimen scale). Molecular images were selected interactively and processed using the IMAGIC-5 software. The images were subjected to multireference alignment and multivariate statistical classification in order to find characteristic molecular views in the sample. Symmetry of the oligomers was determined using free reference alignment followed by multistatistical analysis. Characteristic views of LTXN4C were compared with re-projections of the three-dimensional maps of the LTX dimer and tetramer created using the exact filter back projection algorithm (29Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Binding Experiments—Recombinant toxins were labeled with 125I as outlined previously (30Ushkarev Iu.A. Grishin E.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1986; 12: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar). To study toxin dissociation from membranes, 0.5 nm iodinated LTXWT or LTXN4C were incubated in TBSM (plus 2 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 10 min, either on ice or at 37 °C, with P2 membranes (0.5 mg protein/ml) isolated from rat brain (31Phelan P. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Turner A.J. Bachelard H.S. Neurochemistry. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 1-38Google Scholar). The samples were then supplemented with 500 nm LTXNAT (to displace the specifically bound iodinated LTXs) and transferred on ice (to prevent any further toxin incorporation into the membranes). Aliquots were taken from these reaction mixtures at specified times and filtered through GF/F filters (Whatman) to determine the remaining bound toxin. The amount of non-specifically bound LTXs was established by including 500 nm LTXNAT during the initial incubation. For binding studies, COS7 cells were transfected with LPH or NRX Iα as described (9Volynski K.V. Meunier F.A. Lelianova V.G. Dudina E.E. Volkova T.M. Rahman M.A. Manser C. Grishin E.V. Dolly J.O. Ashley R.H. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41175-41183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), dislodged from plates and incubated (2.5 × 105 cells/reaction) for 10 min with 1 nm [125I]LTXN4C in buffer A supplemented with EGTA, CaCl2 or SrCl2 as indicated in Fig. legends. Throughout this work, Sr2+ buffers also contained 0.2 mm EGTA to chelate any contaminating Ca2+, while the [SrCl2] was adjusted to give the stated free [Sr2+]. Reaction mixtures were filtered through GF/F filters whose radioactivity was then measured. The affinities of recombinant toxins for receptors in chromaffin cells were determined in situ, similar to catecholamine release studies (see below). After the incubation with 0–10 nm radiolabeled LTXWT or LTXN4C and washes, the amounts of bound toxins were established by γ-spectrometry of solubilized cells. The bound and free toxin concentrations were calculated using quantitative assessments of oligomeric states of the two toxins (determined by cryo-EM). In these experiments, the specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding (determined in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled LTX) from the total binding. Immunological Procedures—For immunoprecipitation experiments, the NRX Ab was purified by affinity chromatography on SH-Sepharose conjugated with the cognate peptide (NH2-CSANKNKKNKDKEYYVCOOH). P2 membranes were prepared from rat brain and liver as outlined (31Phelan P. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Turner A.J. Bachelard H.S. Neurochemistry. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 1-38Google Scholar). The membranes were solubilized with 1% Thesit in buffer A (1 mg of protein/ml) and divided into 200-μl aliquots, which were incubated for 10 min with 1 nm125I-LTXN4C in the presence of EGTA, CaCl2, or SrCl2. Then, 5 μg of the affinity-purified NRX Ab and 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma) were added to each tube and incubated for another 3 h. The radioactivity of agarose pellets was determined after two washes with buffer A containing respective additives. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with the SDS-electrophoresis loading buffer, separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon) and visualized using the anti-NRX Ab, a peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab and a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For detection of LTX receptors in chromaffin cells, equal samples of Triton X-100-solubilized chromaffin cells (105/lane) were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto Immobilon and stained with the anti-NRX and anti-LPH Abs as above. Biochemical Measurements of Release—Release of [14C]glutamate ([14C]Glu) was done as in Ref. 8Ashton A.C. Volynski K.E. Lelianova V.G. Orlova E.V. Van Renterghem C. Canepari M. Seagar M. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44695-44703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. Briefly, synaptosomes were loaded for 5 min with [14C]Glu, washed with physiological buffer (in mm: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4), and used for release experiments 1 h later (to facilitate the labeling of both the readily releasable and depot pools of vesicles). The release was measured over 5 min after application of 0–2 nm recombinant toxins in the presence of EGTA, CaCl2, or SrCl2. In some experiments, LaCl3 was also included in the buffer to block any toxin pores. Bovine chromaffin cells were prepared and maintained at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 24-well culture plates (32Lawrence G.W. Weller U. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Five days later, the cells were stimulated for 15 min with 0–5 nm recombinant LTXs in buffer A containing EGTA, CaCl2, or SrCl2. Pore formation was determined simultaneously with release measurements in samples containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 μCi/ml of 45Ca2+. After the 15-min stimulation with the toxins, the media were removed; the cells were washed twice with the incubation buffer (without the radioactive tracer) and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100. The uptake of 45Ca2+ was determined by scintillation counting of the solubilized cells. Catecholamine contents of the solubilized cells and media were measured fluorimetrically (32Lawrence G.W. Weller U. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using an automated microplate fluorimeter, Fluoroscan Ascent FL (Labsystems). Both in synaptosomes and in chromaffin cells, stimulated release was calculated by subtracting basal release in the absence of the toxins from release in their presence and expressed as a percentage of total transmitter contents. Electrophysiological Recordings of Synaptic Transmission—Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as described (33Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells were performed with pipettes filled with intracellular solution (in mm, 126 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, and 0.3 GTP-Na2, pH 7.3). Extracellular solution (the same as in toxin channel recordings in CHO cells above) was supplemented with 1 μm tetrodotoxin, 30 μm bicuculline, 3 mm CaCl2, or SrCl2 and oxygenated. The recorded neurons were voltage-clamped at –70 mV; membrane currents were amplified (10 mV/pA), low-pass filtered at 2.9 kHz, and digitized at 5 kHz. Toxin applications were done as described (34Capogna M. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3149-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The currents were acquired on-line using the Pulse software. Intracellular recordings in NMJs were made using standard techniques on isolated preparations of a mouse flexor digitorum brevis muscle. Spontaneous miniature end-plate potentials (mepps) were recorded before and after the addition of 1 nm LTXN4C. The continuously oxygenated extracellular perfusion solution (in mm: 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5.6 glucose, 0.03 tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4) was supplemented with EGTA, Ca2+, or Sr2+. Recordings were made using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments); voltage signals were amplified and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz using the 1401+ signal converter and recorded into Spike 4 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). The toxin was added directly to the recording chamber and thoroughly mixed with the perfusion buffer. All electrophysiological data were analyzed off-line with the MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft). Molecular Basis of the Inability of the Mutant Toxin to Insert into Membranes and Make Pores—Both LTXWT and LTXN4C were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells (28Volynski K.E. Nosyreva E.D. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified using an immobilized mAb against LTX. A single pass through the mAb column nearly exhausted the expressed toxins from the medium and yielded essentially pure LTXWT and LTXN4C (Fig. 1). We previously showed that LTXN4C fails to form ionic pores in the membrane of synaptosomes and LPH-transfected BHK cells (8Ashton A.C. Volynski K.E. Lelianova V.G. Orlova E.V. Van Renterghem C. Canepari M. Seagar M. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44695-44703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed and extended these observations by comparing the abilities of the recombinant toxins to induce 45Ca2+ influx into COS7 cells expressing exogenous LPH or NRX. As expected, LTXWT caused massive accumulation of the radioactive tracer in the cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, LTXN4C stimulated no detectable 45Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2A). The lack of pore formation by even high concentrations of the mutant toxin was not due to its poor interaction with the expressed receptors because, in the same experiment, LTXWT and LTXN4C exhibited similar binding to both NRX- and LPH-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). We then compared the channe"

Consistent with its functions as a post-transcriptional regulator, ICP27 interacts with various RNAs in vitro (23Brown C. Nakamura M. Mosca J. Hayward G. Straus S. Perera L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7187-7195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ingram A. Phelan A. Dunlop J. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Mears W. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and forms UV light-induced cross-links to poly(A)+ RNA and seven HSV-1 intronless mRNAs from all kinetic classes during infection (12Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Soliman T.M. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Structural domains of ICP27 implicated in RNA binding are an arginine- and glycine-rich region (RGG box) (25Mears W. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and three putative K homology (KH)-like domains (39Soliman T.M. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), initially identified as RNA-binding domains in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (41Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 42Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The RGG box acted as a ICP27 protein domain necessary for interaction with RNA (12Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Mears W. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was a determinant of in vivo methylation (25Mears W. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A viral substitution mutation that mapped to KH-like motif 3 displayed a reduced efficiency of in vivo UV cross-linking to poly(A)+ RNA (39Soliman T.M. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the KH-like motifs in ICP27 have not been demonstrated to be directly involved in interaction with HSV-1 RNAs. A specific ICP27-interacting RNA binding site has not been identified to date, and it is unknown whether other HSV-1 mRNAs may interact with ICP27. In the present study, we address these points by using a yeast three-hybrid system (reviewed in Ref. 43Bernstein D. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This approach is the first to identify in vivo ICP27 interactions against a library of HSV-1 RNAs of various lengths that represent the entire viral genome. Plasmids—The following plasmids have been described elsewhere: pACTII-CAN, pIIIA/MS2–2 (44Zhang B. Kraemer B. Sengupta D. Fields S. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 399-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pM15 (38Rice S.A. Lam V. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pMd4–5 (35Mears W.E. Lam V. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 935-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kind gifts from S. Rice), pIII/MS2-IRE, pADIRP1 (45Sengupta D. Zhang B. Kramer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and pSG130 (46Sekulovich R. Leary K. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4510-4522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pAD27 was constructed by first PCR amplifying a 10-amino acid (aa) N-terminal truncated form of the ICP27 open reading frame (ORF) from plasmid pSG130 using oligonucleotides ICP27Δ9(S) (5′-GCAGATCTACCTCGGCCTGGACCTCTCCGACAGC-3′) and ICP27(A) (5′-CGAGATCTCTAAAACAGGGAGTTGCAATAAAAATAT-3′) that introduced BglII restriction enzyme recognition sites (underlined) at both ends of the ORF. The PCR product was digested with BglII and ligated to pACTII-CAN digested with BglII and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, resulting in pAD27. pAD27 encodes a fusion protein containing the GAL4 activation domain fused to ICP27 aa 10 to 512. To generate pADM15, ICP27 aa 10 to 512 containing the M15 mutation (38Rice S.A. Lam V. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from plasmid pM15 and cloned into pACTII-CAN as outlined above. To generate pADΔRGG, pADΔRGG/KH2/3, and pADΔRGG/KH1/2/3, various 10-aa N-terminal truncated ICP27 fragments, also having the RGG box (aa 138–152) internally deleted, were PCR amplified from plasmid pMd4–5 (35Mears W.E. Lam V. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 935-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using ICP27Δ9(S) and ICP27(A), ICP27Δ9(S), and ICP27ΔKH2(A) (5′-GAGATCTCTAGATGCACATCTTGCACCACG-3′) or ICP27Δ9(S) and ICP27 ΔKH1(A) (5′-GAGATCTCTAGGCGGGAAACGGCTGCCCCC-3′), respectively. The PCR products were digested with BglII and ligated to pACTII-CAN, digested with BglII, and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, resulting in pADΔRGG, pADΔRGG/KH2/3, and pADΔRGG/KH1/2/3. Plasmid structures were confirmed by digestion with restriction enzymes and DNA sequencing. Construction of HSV-1 Genomic DNA Plasmid Library—The source of HSV-1 strain 17syn+ genomic DNA was a set of five previously described cosmids (47Cunningham C. Davison A.J. Virology. 1993; 197: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whose inserts overlap and represent the entire viral genome (cosmids 6, 14, 28, 48, and 56; a kind gift from Dr. A. J. Davison). Cosmids were digested with various combinations of 11 different restriction enzymes, partially or to completion, and the ends were made blunt by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). DNA fragments ranging from 20 to 400 bp were purified from an agarose gel, followed by ligation to pIIIA/MS2–2, digested with SmaI, and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This resulted in insertion of various HSV-1 genomic DNA fragments, in sense or antisense orientation, upstream of the sequences encoding the MS2 RNA. Different ligations were pooled and used to transform electrocompetent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The library was amplified by growing transformants on solid LB media overnight, followed by growth of the pooled transformants for 4 h in liquid LB media. Yeast Three-hybrid RNA Screen—The yeast three-hybrid RNA screen was performed essentially as described previously (44Zhang B. Kraemer B. Sengupta D. Fields S. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 399-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Sengupta D. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with certain procedural modifications. The HSV-1 genomic plasmid library was transformed into yeast strain L40coat (L40), pre-transformed with plasmid pAD27. Transformants were plated onto synthetic dropout (S.D.) medium lacking leucine and histidine (leu–/his–) and supplemented with 0.2 to 1.0 mm 3-aminotriazole. White colonies were picked after 6 days and patched onto new S.D. leu–/his– plates containing 0.5 mm 3-aminotriazole, for regrowth to confirm expression of the HIS3, ADE2, and LEU2 genes, followed by analysis of β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity by using an X-gal filter assay. LacZ+/HIS+ colonies were made to loose the pAD27 plasmid, retaining only the library plasmid, by the procedure described previously (44Zhang B. Kraemer B. Sengupta D. Fields S. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 399-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants that lost the pAD27 plasmid were patched to S.D. ura– plates and analyzed for loss of β-gal activity. LacZ– transformants in the absence of pAD27 were then mated with yeast strain R40coat, pre-transformed with plasmids pAD27 or pADIRP1. Diploids that restored β-gal activity in the presence of pAD27, but not in the presence of pADIRP1, expressed HSV-1 RNAs that likely interacted specifically with ICP27 protein. Library plasmid DNAs were isolated from yeast and sequenced. Library plasmids that encoded RNAs corresponding to single inserts of transcribed HSV-1 genes were retransformed back into L40, followed by mating with R40 pre-transformed with plasmids pAD27 or pADIRP1. The specificity of these RNAs for ICP27 was again tested by measuring β-gal activity of resulting diploids using a liquid assay and confirmed by analysis of β-gal activity in the presence of ICP27 mutants. Assays of β-Gal Activity—Using the X-gal filter assay, lawns of yeast transformants were grown on appropriate S.D. plates. Yeast transformants were lifted onto Whatman (grade 5) filter paper, freeze-thawed once in liquid nitrogen, and placed onto Whatman 3MM paper presoaked in Buffer Z (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) containing 300 mg/ml X-gal. Filters were examined for development of blue color after incubation for 3 h at 30 °C. To assay β-gal activity quantitatively, the liquid assay was used with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (49Miller J.H. Schmeissner V. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Iwabuchi K. Li B. Bartel P. Fields S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1693-1696PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown in appropriate S.D. medium overnight, followed by reinocculation of fresh cultures and regrowth to A 0.8. Cells were pelleted, washed in appropriate enzyme buffer once, and freeze-thawed three times in between liquid nitrogen and 37 °C. Enzyme buffer containing CPRG substate was added, and following color development, the reactions were stopped to yield optical density values in the linear range of the assay. Measurements below one unit (in reactions stopped after 2 h of color development) were not in the linear range of the assay and were referred to as <1 unit. Yeast Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cultures of R40 cells were grown in appropriate S.D. medium overnight, followed by reinocculation of fresh cultures and regrowth to A 0.8. Cells (100 ml) were added to an equal volume of ice and then pelleted, washed, and suspended in 400 μl 10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KF, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma protease inhibitors (1:100), pH 7.5). Glass beads (20 μl, 425–600 μ; Sigma) were added, and samples were vortexed four times each for 30 s followed by 30 s on ice. Debris was removed by full speed centrifugation in a microfuge, and 30-μl samples of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using a mixture of mouse monoclonal anti-ICP27 antisera H1113 and H1119 (Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research) as described previously (28Wadd S.

Screening for HSV-1 RNAs Interacting with ICP27 Protein— ICP27 protein interacts with various RNAs in vitro (23Brown C. Nakamura M. Mosca J. Hayward G. Straus S. Perera L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7187-7195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ingram A. Phelan A. Dunlop J. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Mears W. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with several HSV-1 RNAs during lytic infection (7Sandri-Goldin R.M. Mendoza G.E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 848-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A yeast three-hybrid system was utilized to examine interactions of ICP27 protein with HSV-1 RNAs; modified from its original presentation (45Sengupta D. Zhang B. Kramer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), this system has enabled the isolation of unknown RNAs from a genomic background that interact with a known RNA-binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 43Bernstein D. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This yeast three-hybrid system detects physical RNA-protein interactions upon the in vivo assembly of two protein hybrids and a fusion RNA, forming a complex capable of transactivating promoters of the lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes. The first protein hybrid component, a LexA-MS2 coat protein fusion, was stably expressed in yeast strain L40 (45Sengupta D. Zhang B. Kramer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). An HSV-1 genomic plasmid DNA library was constructed to provide the fusion RNA component. Gel-purified HSV-1 DNA fragments were ligated upstream of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein binding sites, in the RNA pol III promoter-driven RNA expression plasmid pIIIA/MS2–2. A total of >3 × 104 E. coli transformants was generated, and sequence analysis of more than twenty clones revealed that inserts varied in length from 20 to 400 nucleotides and corresponded to different locations on the HSV-1 genome. This confirmed the construction of a small-insert library, similar to that used to screen the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome (48Sengupta D. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and having a >15-fold theoretical coverage of the entire HSV-1 genome. To generate the second protein hybrid component, the ICP27 ORF was inserted inframe with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) in plasmid pACTII-CAN, generating plasmid pAD27 (resembling plasmid p502CAD used in yeast two-hybrid screens; see Refs. 28Wadd S.

Wadd S. Lamond A.I. Silverstein S.J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4376-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); because inclusion of ICP27 aa 1 to 9 fused to the GAL4 AD transactivates certain yeast promoters unspecifically in a yeast two-hybrid system (28Wadd S.

Lamond A.I. Silverstein S.J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4376-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), an N-terminal truncated ICP27 ORF (aa 10 to 512) was used. The HSV-1 plasmid library was transformed into yeast strain L40, which had been pre-transformed with plasmid pAD27. Growth of transformants was performed on solid S.D. medium lacking leucine and histidine and containing 3-aminotriazole, selecting for plasmid pAD27 and activation of the HIS3 reporter gene, respectively. The transformation yielded >5 × 105 yeast transformants, of which >103 white colonies grew on the S.D. medium 6 days post-transformation (Fig. 1). By analysis of activation of the lacZ reporter gene of colonies picked at random, using a filter lift assay, we isolated 334 transformants that had β-gal activity (Fig. 1). Having isolated 334 colonies that activated expression of both reporter genes (LacZ+/His+), we investigated whether activation of the lacZ reporter gene was dependent on the GAL4 AD-ICP27 protein hybrid. Thus, transformants were grown in rich medium without selection, causing some cells to lose the pAD27 plasmid, followed by growth on S.D. medium lacking uracil to select for those cells that retained the library plasmid but had lost the pAD27 plasmid. These colonies were analyzed for loss of β-gal activity as compared with the initially isolated LacZ+/His+ transformants (which contained all three hybrid components). Of the 334 transformants analyzed, 113 showed β-gal activity in the absence of the GAL4 AD-ICP27 protein hybrid (Fig. 1), suggesting that they activated the lacZ reporter gene in a ICP27-independent manner. Similar RNA activators were reported in a screen of a yeast DNA library (48Sengupta D. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in which 84% of the LacZ+/His+ transformants showed this property as compared with 34% observed here. The remaining 221 transformants, which showed loss of β-gal activity upon loss of the GAL4-ICP27 protein hybrid, were then mated with R40 (opposite mating type of L40), pre-transformed with plasmids pAD27, pADIRP1 (expressing a GAL4 AD-IRP1 protein hybrid), or pACTII-CAN (expressing the GAL4 AD alone). Analysis of β-gal activity by the filter lift assay showed that 68 single transformants had a restored activation of the lacZ gene upon reintroduction of the GAL4 AD-ICP27 protein hybrid, but not upon introduction of a GAL4 AD-IRP1 protein hybrid or the GAL4 AD alone (Fig. 1). The results suggested that 68 transformants expressed ICP27-interacting RNAs, but, mainly because of the qualitative nature of the filter lift assay, these RNAs were considered as only candidate ICP27-specific interactors at this stage. The library plasmids of the 68 transformants were isolated, and the DNA insert in each plasmid was sequenced. Computer searches of the HSV-1 strain 17+ genome and sequence analysis revealed that 31 of the isolated library plasmids encoded single-insert RNAs that were expressed in the same orientation as HSV-1 transcribed genes. Among these, two sets of RNAs corresponding to two different genomic regions were isolated more than once: clones 324/16.2 and 19/85/185 (see Fig. 2 and Table I). Furthermore, five sets of RNAs overlapped the same genomic region but were of different lengths: 251 and 19/85/185, 352 and 75, 17 and 247, 4 and 242, and 5 and 231 (see Fig. 2 and Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2120632550,"Proper function of the 26 S proteasome requires assembly of the regulatory complex, which is composed of the lid and base subcomplexes. We characterized Rpn5, a lid subunit, in fission yeast. We show that Rpn5 associates with the proteasome rpn5. Deletion (rpn5Δ) exacerbates the growth defects in proteasome mutants, leading to mitotic abnormalities, which correlate with accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, such as Cut2/securin. Rpn5 expression is tightly controlled; both overexpression and deletion of rpn5 impair proteasome functions. The proteasome is assembled around the inner nuclear membrane in wild-type cells; however, in rpn5Δ cells, proteasome subunits are improperly assembled and/or localized. In the lid mutants, Rpn5 is mislocalized in the cytosol, while in the base mutants, Rpn5 can enter the nucleus, but is left in the nucleoplasm, and not assembled into the nuclear membrane. These results suggest that Rpn5 is a dosage-dependent proteasome regulator and plays a role in mediating proper proteasome assembly. Moreover, the Rpn5 assembly may be a cooperative process that involves at least two steps: 1) nuclear import and 2) subsequent assembly into the nuclear membrane. The former step requires other components of the lid, while the latter requires the base. Human Rpn5 rescues the phenotypes associated with rpn5Δ and is incorporated into the yeast proteasome, suggesting that Rpn5 functions are highly conserved.

Human Rpn5 rescues the phenotypes associated with rpn5Δ and is incorporated into the yeast proteasome, suggesting that Rpn5 functions are highly conserved. The 26 S proteasome carries out the timely and efficient removal of misfolded and regulatory proteins whose accumulation is detrimental to cell growth (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). For example, the level of tumor suppressor p53 is tightly regulated such that it will rise up during DNA damage but decrease rapidly when the growth condition is favorable to prevent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, efficient progression of M-phase requires the degradation of securin and mitotic cyclin. Securin (called Cut2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ref. 2Funabiki H. Yamano H. Kumada K. Nagao K. Hunt T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 381: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) controls proteolysis of cohesin, the “glue” protein that bundles together sister chromatids. Securin degradation triggers cohesin degradation thus allowing sister chromatids to separate during mitosis. The mitotic cyclin must undergo proteolysis during anaphase to induce cytokinesis and the exit from M-phase. The 26 S proteasome is composed of a catalytic complex, known as the 20 S core, and two regulatory complexes, called the 19 S caps (3Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The 19 S cap is itself composed of two subcomplexes, the lid and the base, each of which contains at least eight subunits. The catalytic core cannot degrade polyubiquitinated substrates unless it is assembled with the 19 S cap. At least two subunits in the 19 S cap bind polyubiquitinated proteins (4Wilkinson C.R.

Components in the 19 S cap also process antichaperone and protease functions (7Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat.

Despite the importance of the 19 S cap, the functions of most of its subunits remain unknown. We are using S. pombe to study Yin6, a homolog of mammalian Int6, which has been implicated in the development of breast cancer (9Yen H.-c.S. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). yin6Δ cells display numerous mitotic abnormalities, including inefficient chromosome segregation. In order to better understand how Yin6 regulates chromosome segregation, we performed a two-hybrid screen to search for Yin6-binding proteins, and identified a conserved proteasome regulatory subunit, Rpn5 (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We show that while S. pombe proteasome components are normally localized around the inner layer of the nuclear membrane, in yin6Δ cells, Rpn5 mislocalizes in the cytosol, which correlates with improper proteasome assembly and inactivation. These data raise the possibility that Rpn5 can regulate proteasome functions by influencing its assembly. In this study, we report that Rpn5 associates with the proteasome and is required for proper proteasome assembly in S. pombe. Intriguingly, Rpn5 is also frequently mislocalized in the cytosol in mutants defective in the lid of the 19 S cap; in contrast, in the base mutants, Rpn5 can enter the nucleus, but is not assembled around the nuclear membrane. We illustrate that human Rpn5 rescues the phenotype of rpn5Δ cells and is similarly assembled into the proteasome in yeast, suggesting that the function of Rpn5 is highly conserved. Our data collectively support a model in which Rpn5 regulates proteasome assembly. In addition, it seems that the assembly of Rpn5, and perhaps other regulatory components as well, into the proteasome can be divided into at least two steps: 1) nuclear import and 2) assembly at the nuclear membrane, and that each regulatory component may influence these processes in a cooperative manner.

Cells were grown in either yeast extract medium (YEAU) or synthetic minimal medium (MM) with appropriate auxotropic supplements (17Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). To test for MBC and canavanine sensitivities, stock solutions of MBC (5 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) and canavanine sulfate (3 mg/ml in water) were prepared and added to media after autoclaving. We carried out all the experiments with cells pregrown to early logarithmic phase (2–5 × 106 cells/ml). For spotting experiments, cells were serially diluted 1:5. Plasmid Constructions—The construction of pMYCRPN5, pREP1RPN5, pREP41GFP, pREP41GFPRPN5, pGADspRPN5, pBSRPN5ag, and pBSRPN5-HAKanR are as described (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C.

The DNA fragment encoding GFP-KanR was amplified by PCR using pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-KanMX6 (19Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

A human rpn5 was amplified by PCR from a cDNA library of human erythroleukemia K562 cell line (Clontech) and cloned into pREP41GFP and pARTCM (18Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H. Wigler H.M.

Strain Constructions—The construction of the strains pus1-ProA, RPN5aU (rpn5a::ura4 rpn5b +), RPN5bU (rpn5a + rpn5b::ura4), RPN5aA (rpn5a::ADE2 rpn5b +), RPN5bA (rpn5a + rpn5b::ADE2), and RPN5UA (rpn5a::ura4 rpn5b::ADE2) has been described previously (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To tag chromosomal rpn5a or rpn5b at the 3′-end with the coding sequences of GFP or the HA1 epitope, XhoI-SmaI fragments containing rpn5-gfpKanR or rpn5–3HAKanR were isolated from pBSRPN5-GFPKanR or pBSRPN5-HAKanR and transformed into SP870 and RPN5aA or RPN5bA strains. Proper tagging was confirmed by PCR and Western blots. The resulting strains were named RPN5a-GFP (rpn5a-gfp rpn5b +), RPN5b-GFP (rpn5a + rpn5b-gfp), RPN5a-HA (rpn5a-HA rpn5b +), RPN5b-HA (rpn5a + rpn5b-HA), RPN5aARPN5b-HA (rpn5a:: ADE rpn5b-HA), and RPN5bARPN5a-HA (rpn5a-HA rpn5b::ADE2). To tag both rpn5 genes with GFP, the RPN5a-GFP and RPN5b-GFP strains were each transformed with a plasmid to provide a selection marker allowing for protoplast fusion and the strain RPN5-GFP (rpn5a-gfp rpn5b-gfp) was later isolated after tetrad dissection. We used the same strategy to generate strain RPN5-HA (rpn5a-HA rpn5b-HA). The strains with multiple genetic manipulations (mutation and gene tagging) were all isolated by tetrad dissection after cell fusion. We named those strains: 10PA5bHA (pus1-ProA rpn5b-HA), 10PA11GFP (pus1-ProA pad1/rpn11-gfp), 10PA11GFP5bHA (pus1-ProA pad1/rpn11-gfp rpn5b-HA), 10PA11GFP5Δ (pus1-ProA pad1/rpn11-gfp rpn5a::ADE2 rpn5b::ADE2), 2TS10PA5bHA (mts2/rpt2–1 pus1-ProA rpn5b-HA), 3TS10PA5bHA (mts3/rpn12–1 pus1-ProA rpn5b-HA), 11TS10PA5bHA (pad1/rpn11–1 pus1-ProA rpn5b-HA), 11GFP5Δ (pad1/rpn11-gfp rpn5a::ura4 rpn5b::ADE2), and CUT2-MYCRPN5UA (cut2–13MYC rpn5a::ura4 rpn5b::ADE2). Fluorescence Microscopy—The procedures for calcofluor and 4′-6-diaminodino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining are as described (www.bio.uva.nl/pombe/handbook). 26 S Proteasome Pull-down—Approximately 30 ODs (∼3×108) of cells were lysed in the ice-cold 26 S-binding buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, pH 7.0–7.4). Total crude lysates were centrifuged twice at 20,800 × g for 20 min. Supernatants with the same amount of proteins were incubated with either 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Invitrogen) or protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) beads overnight at 4 °C. After eight washes in the 26 S binding buffer, beads were incubated with the TEV protease (Invitrogen) twice for 1 h at 30 °C to release the 26 S proteasome. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. The antibodies against Mts2/Rpt2, Mts3/Rpn12, Mts4/Rpn1, and Pus1/Rpn10 were as described (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and used at 1:1,000 dilution. The antibodies against GFP (1:500), proteasome 20 S core α-subunits (MCP231, 1:1,000), and Cdc8 (1:400) were from Clontech, Affiniti and M. Balasubramanian (University of Singapore, Singapore; Ref. 20Balasubramanian M.K. Helfman D.M. Hemmingsen S.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies 9E10 (1:1,000) and 12CA5 (1:1,000) were used to detect Myc- and HA-tagged proteins. Detection of Ubiquitinated Proteins—To detect ubiquitinated proteins, cells were broken by glass beads in the PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9). Total crude extracts contain equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an ubiquitin antibody (1:3,500, from C. Pickart). The assay for detecting polyubiquitinated Cut2 was essentially as described (12Berry L.D. Feoktistova A. Wright M.D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2535-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transformed with pREP1 or pREP1His6-Ub and grown in MM medium without thiamine for 22 h to induce His-tagged ubiquitin expression. Approximately 30 OD units of cells were harvested and lysed in the lysis buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Total lysates were centrifuged twice at 20,800 × g for 20 min. Supernatants with the same amount of proteins were mixed with 100 μl of Ni-His·bind resin (Novagen) and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The resin was washed and ubiquitinated Cut2-Myc was detected by Western blotting with 9E10 (1:1,000). The rpn5 Deletion Causes a Wide Range of Abnormalities Including Chromosome Missegregation—S. pombe possesses two rpn5 genes, rpn5a, and rpn5b, whose 5′-flanking sequences are different, but which encode identical proteins (Fig. 1A). To examine the function of Rpn5, we created strains in which either rpn5a (rpn5aΔ) or rpn5b (rpn5bΔ) or both (rpn5Δ) were deleted. We found that rpn5Δ cells, like yin6Δ cells, are morphologically abnormal (fat and bent at 32 °C, Fig. 1B), resistant to the microtubule-destabilizing drug MBC (Fig. 1C), and display a cold-dependent growth defect (Fig. 1D). In the cold, rpn5Δ cells become elongated (Fig. 1B) and display chromosome disjunction defects (Fig. 1E). Approximately 30% of septated rpn5Δ cells grown at 20 °C contain uneven DNA separation, and this defect happened less frequently when rpn5Δ cells were grown at 30 °C (2.8%) and was undetectable in wild-type cells (<0.1%). As in rpn5Δ cells, S. pombe proteasome mutants also display MBC resistance and mitotic defects (21Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The similar phenotypes between rpn5Δ cells, proteasome mutants, and yin6Δ cells support the hypothesis that Rpn5 can regulate the proteasome and that Yin6 regulates the proteasome via Rpn5. In contrast to rpn5Δ cells, cells in which only one copy of rpn5 was deleted are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown), suggesting that both rpn5a and rpn5b genes are functional. Rpn5 Protein Levels Are Tightly Controlled—To directly examine whether rpn5a and rpn5b are both expressed, we tagged one or both chromosomal rpn5 genes with the HA1 epitope and performed immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 2A, both genes are expressed with the level of Rpn5b protein ∼3–4-fold higher than that of Rpn5a (compare lane 2 and lane 4). Importantly, when rpn5b is deleted, more Rpn5a is expressed such that the total Rpn5 protein level in rpn5bΔ cells remains the same as that of rpn5 + cells (compare lane 2 and lane 3). Reciprocally, when rpn5a is deleted, more Rpn5b is expressed (compare lane 4 and lane 5). Furthermore, we found that overexpressing rpn5 exogenously from a plasmid leads to the reduction of endogenous Rpn5 protein expression (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that both rpn5 genes are expressed and that the level of Rpn5 is tightly controlled. The physiological significance of this regulation will be investigated later. Rpn5 Associates with the Proteasome—To investigate whether Rpn5 is part of the 26 S proteasome in S. pombe, we performed an affinity pull-down assay. We built a strain in which a component of the proteasome base, Pus1/Rpn10, was tagged at the chromosomal level by protein A (ProA), and the endogenous Rpn5 was tagged with the HA1 epitope. The resulting strain does not display any abnormal phenotypes, suggesting that both fusion proteins are functional. Our data show that by using the IgG beads, Rpn5 is efficiently pulled down along with Pus1/Rpn10-ProA, components of the 19 S lid and base, and the 20 S catalytic core (Fig. 3A). Next, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to determine whether Rpn5 binds components of the 19 S cap with specificity. Our data indicate that Rpn5 readily binds Mts1/Rpn9 and Mss1/Rpt1, but not Mts2/Rpt2, Mts4/Rpn1, Pus1/Rpn10, and Rpt6 (Fig. 3B and Table I).Table IPhysical interaction between Rpn5 and various proteasome components detected by the yeast two-hybrid systemProteinDescriptionsBinding with Rpn5Mts1/Rpn9Lid subunit containing the PCI domain+Pus1/Rpn10Base subunit that bind Ub-Mts4/Rpn1Non-ATPase in the base-Rpt1ATPase in the base+Mts2/Rpt2ATPase in the base-Rpt5ATPase in the base-Rpt6ATPase in the base- Open table in a new tab S. pombe proteasomes are concentrated near the nuclear membrane. We have previously shown that Rpn5 is localized around the nuclear membrane when it is tagged N-terminally with GFP and expressed under the control of the nmt1 promoter (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined where endogenous Rpn5 localizes in the cell. A strain was constructed in which the endogenous rpn5 genes were both tagged with the coding sequence for GFP at the 3′-ends. Our data show that Rpn5-GFP, like other proteasome components (e.g. Pad1/Rpn11), localizes to the nuclear membrane of the cell (Fig. 3C). These data support the idea that Rpn5 is a proteasome component in S. pombe cells. Proper Proteasome Functions Require Rpn5—Since Rpn5 associates with the proteasome, we performed several lines of investigation to examine whether Rpn5 is important for the proper function of the proteasome. First, we tested whether rpn5Δ cells are sensitive to canavanine, an arginine analog, which causes the accumulation of abnormal proteins that must be degraded by the proteasome. As shown in Fig. 4A, canavanine is toxic to rpn5Δ cells, but not to rpn5aΔ, rpn5bΔ, and wild-type cells. Second, we determined whether proteasome mutations can intensify the growth defect of rpn5Δ cells and whether overexpression of proteasome subunits can rescue it. We found that the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations inactivating pad1/rpn11 and mts3/rpn12 are synthetically lethal with rpn5Δ since no viable rpn5Δ pad1/rpn11 ts and rpn5Δ mts3/rpn12 ts double mutants were obtained even at the permissive temperature (24 °C) after tetrad dissections (Fig. 4B and data not shown). A mts2/rpt2 ts mutation also severely worsens the growth defect of rpn5Δ cells (data not shown). We examined the lethality of rpn5Δ mts3/rpn12 ts double mutant cells in detail and found that these inviable cells are highly elongated with supercondensed chromosomes (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that rpn5 and proteasome double mutant cells lose viability due to a failure in cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation. Conversely, overexpression of at least two proteasome subunits, Mts2/Rpt2 and Mts3/Rpn12, partially rescues the cold-sensitive growth defect of rpn5Δ cells (Fig. 4C). Third, we investigated whether polyubiquitinated proteins are accumulated in rpn5Δ cells by using immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4D, rpn5Δ cells do contain more polyubiquitinated proteins as compared with wild-type cells. The level of polyubiquitinated proteins is further increased when rpn5Δ cells are grown in the cold, which is consistent with the fact that the growth defect of rpn5Δ cells is more severe in the cold (see Fig. 1D). Cut2/securin is a well documented substrate for the proteasome and its accumulation leads to improper chromosome segregation. Thus, we examined whether the level of ubiquitinated Cut2 (Ub-Cut2) is higher in rpn5Δ cells. We overexpressed polyhistidine-tagged Ub in cells and then examined whether more Cut2 can be pulled-down by Ni2+-beads in rpn5Δ cells. As shown in Fig. 4E, cells lacking Rpn5 indeed contain more Ub-Cut2, and this may explain why rpn5Δ cells show abnormal chromosome segregation (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, both our genetic and biochemical data indicate that Rpn5 is necessary for proper proteasome functions. Since Rpn5 levels are tightly controlled, we investigated whether elevating the level of Rpn5 can interfere with proteasome functions. Indeed, we found that Rpn5 overexpression severely intensifies the growth defect of all available proteasome lid and base mutants (mts1/rpn9 ts , mts2/rpt2 ts , mts3/rpn12 ts , mts4/rpn1 ts, and pad1/rpn11 ts), and a representative study involving the pad1/rpn11 ts mutant is shown in Fig. 4F. We confirmed that our method of Rpn5 overexpression indeed raised total Rpn5 protein levels by immunoblots (Fig. 4F). These results support the hypothesis that Rpn5 interacts with proteasome components in a dosage-dependent fashion. Rpn5 Is Required for Proteasome Integrity—To examine whether proper proteasome assembly requires Rpn5, we performed a Pus1/Rpn10-ProA affinity pull-down assay to isolate proteasomes and analyzed their contents with immunoblots. Our data show that levels of proteasome components in the lid (Pad1/Rpn11 and Mts3/Rpn12) and base (Mts2/Rpt2 and Mts4/Rpn1) and the 20S core (the α-subunits) are reduced at least 50% in rpn5Δ cells (Fig. 5A). To further confirm that proteasome misassembly/mislocalization occurs in rpn5Δ cells, we examined the localization of Pad1/Rpn11-GFP in live cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, Pad1/Rpn11 is not associated with the nuclear membrane in rpn5Δ cells; rather, it is primarily in the nucleoplasm. Assembly of Rpn5 into the Proteasome Can Be Affected by the Proteasome Lid and Base Components via Different Mechanisms—We examined whether other components in the lid and base can reciprocally influence Rpn5 assembly into the proteasome. Indeed, by using the Pus1/Rpn10-ProA pull-down, we found that Rpn5 incorporation into proteasomes is impaired in all tested lid and base mutants (Fig. 6A). Proteasome assembly in the nucleus may involve multiple steps. To delineate these steps and to determine what roles the lid and base components play in these, the localization of GFP-Rpn5 was analyzed in the lid and base mutants. Our data show that at the nonpermissive temperature, Rpn5 is diffused throughout the cell in the lid mutants, while in the base mutant, Rpn5 enters the nucleus, but is not concentrated around the nuclear membrane (Fig. 6B). The lack of Rpn5 around the nuclear membrane is not due to a decrease in Rpn5 protein levels, since they are the same in all tested mutants (data not shown). These results support the possibility that the assembly of Rpn5 requires at least two steps: 1) nuclear import and 2) assembly of nuclear protein into the nuclear membrane. The lid is clearly important in facilitating Rpn5 entry into the nucleus, while the base plays a role in assembling Rpn5 into the nuclear membrane. Note that at the nonpermissive temperature, some cytoplasmic Rpn5 in both wild-type and proteasome mutant cells form aggregates (punctuate accumulations in the cytoplasm), which implies that Rpn5 may be misfolded when it is not in complex with the rest of the proteasome. Rpn5 Function Is Conserved Evolutionarily—Human and S. pombe Rpn5 are over 40% identical in amino acid sequences (see Supplemental Figure). We investigated whether they are also functional homologs. Our data show that human Rpn5 effectively rescues the phenotypes of rpn5Δ cells (see Fig. 7A for the rescue of the cold-dependent growth defect; the data showing the restoration of the MBC response are not shown). Furthermore, human Rpn5, like S. pombe Rpn5, is a nuclear protein (Fig. 7B) and incorporated into the yeast proteasome (Fig. 7C). Based on these data, we propose that the function of Rpn5 is conserved extensively across species. We present evidence that Rpn5 is a regulatory component of the proteasome because it stably associates with the proteasome in S. pombe cells and its inactivation apparently weakens the proteasome activities, leading to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. While functions of most of the proteasome regulatory subunits are unknown, we demonstrated that Rpn5 plays a role in the assembly of the proteasome itself. This conclusion supports our previous finding that Yin6 can regulate proteasome assembly via Rpn5 (11Yen H.C. Gordon C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Rpn6 and Rpn9, like Rpn5 in fission yeast, are required for proper assembly of the proteasome (22Takeuchi J. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Tanaka K. Toe-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Santamaria P.G. Finley D. Ballesta J.P. Remacha M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 6687-6695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of proteasome assembly may be a common function performed by its regulatory subunits. While Rpn5 plays a role in proteasome assembly, our data show that assembly of Rpn5 itself requires other proteasome regulatory subunits. These observations are consistent with the possibility that proteasome assembly is a cooperative process—the absence of a given proteasome subunit can lead to improper assembly of the entire proteasome. In further support of this, our data show that proteasomes are also misassembled in mts2/rpt2 ts, mts3/rpn12 ts, and pad1/rpn11 ts mutants. Cooperative assembly can occur if proteasome components interact with one another globally. In keeping with this, Rpn5 is a lid component (24Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and we show that it can bind both a lid and a base component (Mts1/Rpn9 and Mss1/Rpt1, respectively). Binding between other lid and bases components and between the regulatory subunits and the catalytic core have also been observed by others (25Ferrell K. Wilkinson C.R. Dubiel W. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are nuclear in a wide range of eukaryotic cells and are nearly exclusively assembled around the nuclear membrane in both budding yeast and fission yeast (15Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Rivett A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Lehmann A. Janek K. Braun B. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How proteasomes are assembled into the nucleus is unknown. We found that Pad1/Rpn11 and Rpn5 can apparently enter the nucleus in proteasome mutants whose proteasome assembly is defective. Hence, we speculate that proteasome assembly can be divided into two discreet steps—nuclear import and assembly to the nuclear membrane (Fig. 8). Furthermore, our data suggest that the lid and base components may preferentially engage in one of these steps (Fig. 8). For instance, when the lid is defective, Rpn5 is unable to enter the nucleus efficiently and is diffused throughout the cells. When the base is defective, however, Rpn5 can enter the nucleus but fails to assemble into the nuclear membrane. It would be of interest to determine whether the lid and base components can also differentially influence the assembly and nuclear import of other regulatory subunits. Furthermore, it is also important to further investigate whether each component in the lid and each component in the base show the same activity in mediating nuclear import and assembly. We cannot exclude the possibility that the proteasome is assembled around the nuclear membrane as soon as it enters the nucleus, and that when the final assembly fails, some proteasome subunits, such as Pad1/Rpn11 and Rpn5, are preferentially discarded in the nucleoplasm. Paradoxically, while fission yeast rpn5Δ cells are viable, budding yeast rpn5Δ cells are not viable (29Saito A. Watanabe T.K. Shimada Y. Fujiwara T. Slaughter C.A. De-Martino G.N. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have several explanations. It is possible that inactivation of Rpn5 only partially impairs proteasome assembly in fission yeast, but it may do so completely in budding yeast. It is also possible that Rpn5 regulates the degradation of a specific set of substrates, which are different in the two yeasts. Moreover, we have shown previously that, of all the proteasome regulatory subunits examined, Yin6 preferentially interacts with Rpn5. Hence, we surmise that S. pombe Rpn5 may have co-evolved with Yin6, which is absent from budding yeast, and with some other components of the proteasome to adapt for a regulatory role. The proteasome in budding yeast, in contrast, cannot function without its Rpn5. In support of the idea that Rpn5 may play key regulatory roles in other eukaryotes, in a recent microarray analysis, the gene encoding human rpn5 has been shown to be among the 200 or so genes that are uniquely expressed in stem cells (30Ramalho-Santos M.

https://openalex.org/W2087388294,"Tpp1 is a DNA 3′-phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is believed to act during strand break repair. It is homologous to one domain of mammalian polynucleotide kinase/3′-phosphatase. Unlike in yeast, we found that Tpp1 could confer resistance to methylmethane sulfonate when expressed in bacteria that lack abasic endonuclease/3′-phosphodiesterase function. This species difference was due to the absence of δ-lyase activity in S. cerevisiae, since expression of bacterial Fpg conferred Tpp1-dependent resistance to methylmethane sulfonate in yeast lacking the abasic endonucleases Apn1 and Apn2. In contrast, β-only lyases increased methylmethane sulfonate sensitivity independently of Tpp1, which was explained by the inability of Tpp1 to cleave 3′ α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. In parallel experiments, mutations of TPP1 and RAD1, encoding part of the Rad1/Rad10 3′-flap endonuclease, caused synthetic growth defects in yeast strains lacking Apn1. In contrast, Fpg expression led to a partial rescue of apn1 apn2 rad1 synthetic lethality by converting lesions into Tpp1-cleavable 3′-phosphates. The collected experiments reveal a profound toxicity of strand breaks with irreparable 3′ blocking lesions, and extend the function of the Rad1/Rad10 salvage pathway to 3′-phosphates. They further demonstrate a role for Tpp1 in repairing endogenously created 3′-phosphates. The source of these phosphates remains enigmatic, however, because apn1 tpp1 rad1 slow growth could be correlated with neither the presence of a yeast δ-lyase, the activity of the 3′-phosphate-generating enzyme Tdp1, nor levels of endogenous oxidation. Tpp1 is a DNA 3′-phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is believed to act during strand break repair. It is homologous to one domain of mammalian polynucleotide kinase/3′-phosphatase. Unlike in yeast, we found that Tpp1 could confer resistance to methylmethane sulfonate when expressed in bacteria that lack abasic endonuclease/3′-phosphodiesterase function. This species difference was due to the absence of δ-lyase activity in S. cerevisiae, since expression of bacterial Fpg conferred Tpp1-dependent resistance to methylmethane sulfonate in yeast lacking the abasic endonucleases Apn1 and Apn2. In contrast, β-only lyases increased methylmethane sulfonate sensitivity independently of Tpp1, which was explained by the inability of Tpp1 to cleave 3′ α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. In parallel experiments, mutations of TPP1 and RAD1, encoding part of the Rad1/Rad10 3′-flap endonuclease, caused synthetic growth defects in yeast strains lacking Apn1. In contrast, Fpg expression led to a partial rescue of apn1 apn2 rad1 synthetic lethality by converting lesions into Tpp1-cleavable 3′-phosphates. The collected experiments reveal a profound toxicity of strand breaks with irreparable 3′ blocking lesions, and extend the function of the Rad1/Rad10 salvage pathway to 3′-phosphates. They further demonstrate a role for Tpp1 in repairing endogenously created 3′-phosphates. The source of these phosphates remains enigmatic, however, because apn1 tpp1 rad1 slow growth could be correlated with neither the presence of a yeast δ-lyase, the activity of the 3′-phosphate-generating enzyme Tdp1, nor levels of endogenous oxidation. The genomes of living cells suffer a great variety of chemical insults, with the greatest quantitative burden caused by endogenously produced DNA-damaging agents and spontaneous chemical processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Friedberg E.C.

These latter insults induce DNA lesions of principally two types: base lesions and single-strand breaks (Fig. 1). Spontaneous processes include cytosine deamination, resulting in a G:U mismatch, and spontaneous depurination, resulting in formation of an abasic site.

Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). ROS oxidize bases (e.g. to 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol) or directly cause strand breakage. Such strand breaks are typically “dirty,” having chemical moieties at their termini other than 3′-hydroxyls and 5′-phosphates. These moieties, including 3′-phosphates, 3′-aldehydes, 3′-phosphoglycolates, and 5′-deoxyribose phosphates (5′-dRP), prevent polymerization and ligation and are thus referred to as blocking lesions. All of these endogenous events can be mimicked and accelerated by exposure to select exogenous DNA damaging agents. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces oxidative lesions, while methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) leads to base alkylation and subsequent abasic site formation.Several enzyme families act at base lesions and single-strand breaks, collectively forming the base excision repair (BER) pathways depicted in Fig. 1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Friedberg E.C.

Individual enzymes frequently only interconvert one form of DNA damage to another. It is through their concerted action that repair is achieved, and there is often more than one sequence leading to repair. Glycosylases remove modified bases to leave abasic sites (9McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), such as the Mag1 enzyme of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that cleaves alkylated bases (11Xiao W. Chow B.L. Hanna M. Doetsch P.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 487: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A subset of glycosylases, referred to as glycosylase/lyases, additionally cleave the resulting abasic site by a non-hydrolytic β-elimination, or lyase, reaction to leave a 3′ α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. β-Lyases include bacterial endonuclease III (Nth), and S. cerevisiae Ntg1, Ntg2, and Ogg1 (9McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

Yet a further subset of glycosylase/lyases catalyze a second sequential β-elimination reaction, more commonly known as δ-elimination, to remove the aldehyde and leave a 3′-phosphate. δ-Lyases include bacterial Fpg and endonuclease VIII (Nei), and recently identified human homologues (9McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

The more common form of BER entails hydrolytic cleavage 5′ to an abasic site by two distinct but functionally similar classes of apurinic/apyrimidinic (i.e. abasic) endonucleases that leave a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-dRP. These include bacterial endonuclease IV (Nfo) and its yeast homologue Apn1 (15Popoff S.C. Spira A.I. Johnson A.W. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and bacterial exonuclease III (Xth) and its yeast homologue Apn2 (16Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Each of the abasic endonuclease families also cleave essentially all 3′ blocking lesions through the same active site, an activity named 3′-phosphodiesterase (17Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Unk I. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, although the 3′-flap endonuclease Rad1/Rad10 is best known for its functions in nucleotide excision repair (NER) (19Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and trimming nonhomologous ends during recombination (20Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), recent studies have suggested a role for Rad1/Rad10 in repair of strand breaks with blocked 3′-termini (21Vance J.R. Wilson T.E.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2833-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).DNA 3′-phosphatase is a more recently discovered BER enzyme. We have identified and begun to characterize Tpp1, the S. cerevisiae phosphatase (24Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15073-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tpp1 is homologous to one portion of the bifunctional enzyme polynucleotide kinase/3′ phosphatase (PNKP) found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and metazoans (26Meijer M. Karimi-Busheri F. Huang T.Y. Weinfeld M. Young D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4050-4055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Jilani A. Ramotar D.

It is also homologous to a family of plant enzymes, including characterized Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana counterparts (30Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Petrucco S. Volpi G. Bolchi A. Rivetti C. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23675-23683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bacteria, in contrast, lack a related DNA 3′-phosphatase. Like the plant enzymes, Tpp1 is devoid of a polynucleotide kinase domain, and we have provided functional evidence that budding yeast in fact do not possess this activity (24Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15073-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, only the 3′-phosphatase function of this enzyme family is consistently conserved, and only in eukaryotes. Tpp1 is functionally redundant with yeast Apn1 and Apn2, which are themselves capable of removing 3′-phosphates (17Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Unk I. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A deficiency of 3′-phosphate repair is only detected when APN1 and TPP1 both are mutated, with the greatest deficiency caused by simultaneous apn1 apn2 tpp1 mutation (25Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unlike Apn1 and Apn2, however, Tpp1 activity appears restricted to 3′-phosphates (25Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Here, we have used a variety of methods to explore the cellular function of Tpp1. We find that Tpp1 can function in bacteria to cleave 3′-phosphates left by δ-elimination, but that budding yeast lack a δ-lyase to account for the conservation of Tpp1. Tpp1 functions in the repair of endogenous DNA damage, but this effect is not realized until a redundant Rad1/Rad10 salvage pathway is also disabled. This and other results demonstrate that strand breaks with persistent irreparable blocking lesions are highly cytotoxic. The source of the requisite endogenously created 3′-phosphates remains enigmatic, but does not appear related to ROS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Unless otherwise specified, chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical, restriction and DNA modifying enzymes from New England Biolabs or Roche Applied Science, and oligonucleotides from Operon Technologies or Invitrogen. Nfo, Nth, and human PNKP (hPNKP) enzymes were as previously described (29Jilani A. Ramotar D. Slack C. Ong C. Yang X.M. Scherer S.W. Lasko D.D. J. Biol.

All other yeast strains were isogenic derivatives of YW465 (21Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The can1Δ::Myc-Fpg and can1Δ::Fpg chromosomal alleles, expressing Myc-Fpg and Fpg from the ADH1 promoter, respectively, were created by replacement of CAN1 with PCR products made from pMyc-Fpg and pFpg (see below). Transformants were selected by replica plating 1-day YPD plates to plates containing 50 μg/ml canavanine. All gene replacements were verified by PCR; can1Δ::Fpg was also sequenced. Standard techniques of mating and tetrad dissection were used to create the further strain derivatives used in these studies.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeaFor clarity, common marker alleles have been omitted from all strains except YW465.

Open table in a new tab Media and Growth Conditions—Bacteria were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Yeast were grown at 30 °C, with shaking at 280 rpm for liquid cultures. Routine yeast media were either YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 40 μg/ml adenine) or synthetic defined medium (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose) supplemented with the appropriate complete synthetic medium dropout mix (QBiogene; adenine concentration was 10 μg/ml for plates and 40 μg/ml for liquid cultures). When indicated, 2% ethanol plus 3% glycerol was substituted for dextrose (YPEG). Anaerobic growth was in sealed jars containing an AnaeroGen anaerobic pack (Camp Micro Inc.) on YPD supplemented with 0.5% Tween 80 and 20 μg/ml ergosterol (34Hongay C. Jia N. Bard M. Winston F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4114-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When indicated, 25 mm ascorbic acid or 25 mm N-acetylcysteine were added as free radical scavengers.Tpp1 Expression Plasmids and Mutagenesis—pTW300 and pTW367 are related LEU2/CEN/ARS vectors that allow for expression of genes in yeast from the strong constitutive ADH1 promoter (35Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 36Wilson T.E. Genetics. 2002; 162: 677-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pTW375 is a pTW300 derivative that expresses His9-Myc3-Tpp1. It was created by making a PCR product corresponding to the TPP1 coding sequence with 5′-BamHI and 3′-SalI tails and ligating it into pTW300 digested with these enzymes. For bacterial expression, the Tpp1 open reading frame was excised from pTW375 by BamHI/SalI digestion and ligated into similarly digested pGEX-5X-1 to form pGST-Tpp1. Tpp1 point mutations D35A and D37A were introduced into pGST-Tpp1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutamer oligonucleotides were (mutated bases are underlined): TppD35Aup (5′-GGTCTAAACGTTTATGCCTTTGCTCTGGACCATACAATTATC; TppR-D35Adwn (5′-GATAATTGTATGGTCCAGAGCAAAGGCATAAACGTTTAGACC); TppD37Aup (5′-CGTTTATGCCTTTGATCTGGCCCATACAATTATCAAACC); and TppR-D37Adwn (5′-GGTTTGATAATTGTATGGGCCAGATCAAAGGCATAAACG). Mutants were subsequently transferred from pGST-Tpp1 to pTW375 by BamHI/SalI digestion and ligation. Mutant pTW375 derivatives were sequenced to confirm the expected mutation and rule out non-directed Tpp1 mutations.Fpg and Nth Expression Plasmids—pMyc-Fpg and pMyc-Nth, which express the bacterial fpg and nth genes in yeast with single amino-terminal Myc tags, respectively, were made by gap repair cloning into pTW367 as previously described (forward primer, 5′-ACCATGGCGTCCGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGCGC; reverse primer, 5′-TTTATGTAACGTTATAGATATGAAGGATTTCATTCGTCTGTCGAC) (36Wilson T.E. Genetics. 2002; 162: 677-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pFpg, the pTW367 derivative that expresses untagged Fpg, was cloned similarly except that a different forward primer was used whose 5′-tail caused deletion of the Myc tag contained in the vector (5′-CAATATTTCAAGCTATACCAAGCATACAATAAGCTTCTCACC). Yeast strains bearing successful gap repair constructs were verified by PCR. In all cases, multiple PCR-positive transformants were tested for MMS sensitivity.H 2 O 2 and MMS Sensitivity—Bacteria were transformed with the appropriate plasmid by the CaCl2 method. Cultures of BW528 strains bearing the respective plasmids were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 in the same medium, grown for 2.5 h at 30 °C, and then the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) was adjusted to 0.9. The cultures were grown for a further 10 min before adding drugs. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, samples were drawn at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min, serially diluted to 1 × 10–5 or 1 × 10–6, and plated onto LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were scored after overnight incubation at 30 °C. MMS was added to cultures at a final concentration of 0.17%, samples were withdrawn at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min and processed as with H2O2 treatment.For determination of yeast MMS sensitivity, exponentially growing cells were exposed to varying concentrations of MMS in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 30 °C for 30 min as previously described (25Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Survival was determined by plating serial dilutions to YPD (or appropriate dropout plates in the case of yeast strains with plasmids), with colonies counted after 3 days growth at 30 °C.Primer Extension Assay—Exponentially growing cells in 5 ml of LB were either untreated or treated with 25 mm H2O2 for1hat37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed twice with M9 buffer, and the cell pellet stored frozen for 1 h at –80 °C. Extraction of the chromosomal DNA was performed as previously described (37Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Demple B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To measure the incorporation of [methyl-3H]dTMP, 150 μm of chromosomal DNA in 25 μl of HE buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0; 1 mm EDTA) was added to 225 μl of an ice-cold reaction mixture. This mixture consisted of 25 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6; 25 mm KCl; 10 mm MgCl2; 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 100 μm dATP; 100 μm dCTP; 100 μm dGTP; 30 μm dTTP, and 3 units of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase per ml. Labeled [methyl-3H]dTTP (NET221X from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 37.0 MBq) was next added to a specific activity of 1260 cpm/pmol. The reaction was started when the samples were immersed into a 37 °C water bath. At the indicated times, 40-μl samples were withdrawn and added to tubes containing 200 μl of 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, followed by the addition of 200 μl of 0.8 m trichloroacetic acid. Tubes were mixed and placed on ice for 10 min. The samples were processed on a 12-hole filtration apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using GF/C circle filters (Whatman). The trapped DNA was washed three times with 3 ml of 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, briefly rinsed with ethanol, air-dried, and counted with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (BCS, Amersham Biosciences). In the case of chromosomal DNA pretreated with either Nfo or hPNKP, 20 ng of the purified enzyme was incubated with the DNA for 20 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6; 50 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin).

Duplex oligonucleotides bearing a uracil, or a 3′-phosphate at a nick, were labeled and annealed as previously described (24Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol.

The uracil was converted to a singlebase gap with a 3′-aldehyde by treatment with uracil-DNA glycosylase (Udg, 0.01 units/5 pmol oligonucleotide) and Nth (28 ng/pmol oligonucleotide) in Udg buffer (NEB) for 1 h at 37 °C. Activity assays contained 50 fmol of DNA substrate and appropriate amounts of enzyme in a reaction volume of 10 μl such that the final buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped with formamide/EDTA loading buffer, and samples were electrophoresed on 7 m urea, 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography.RESULTSTpp1 Can Participate in Repair of H 2 O 2 - and MMS-induced Lesions When Expressed in Bacteria—E. coli strain BW528 bears mutations in both the nfo and xth abasic endonuclease genes and is consequently hypersensitive to agents that induce abasic sites or strand breaks. Because this strain has proven useful for the study of a number of heterologously expressed BER proteins (29Jilani A. Ramotar D. Slack C. Ong C. Yang X.M. Scherer S.W. Lasko D.D. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we examined whether a GST-Tpp1 fusion protein could complement the BW528 mutations. In our first assay, the bacterial chromosome is damaged in vivo with H2O2 and subsequently isolated and used as a template for primer extension by DNA polymerase I in vitro (37Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Demple B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Only if 3′ blocking lesions are removed at H2O2-induced strand breaks can [3H]dTMP be incorporated. Thus, DNA isolated from the treated wild-type strain AB1157 supported primer extension without pretreatment (Fig. 2A), while DNA isolated from BW528 supported extension only when it was pretreated with enzymes such as Nfo (data not shown, but see Tpp1-D35A mutation, Fig. 2C and below). In contrast, DNA from BW528 expressing GST-Tpp1 supported substantial primer extension without pretreatment (Fig. 2B). The amount of [3H]dTMP incorporation could be increased to a minor extent by pretreatment of this DNA with Nfo, but not by pretreatment with hPNKP. Thus, GST-Tpp1 expressed in vivo was able to remove most, but not all, H2O2-induced 3′ blocking lesions. Since H2O2 leaves principally, but not exclusively, 3′ phosphates (38Ramotar D. Popoff S.C.

Chromosomal DNA was isolated from untreated or H2O2-treated E. coli strains as follows: AB1157 (wt) transformed with vector (A), or BW528 (Δ(xthpnc), nfo1::kan) transformed with plasmids expressing wild-type (B) or D35A mutant (C) GST-Tpp1. The ability of these DNAs to prime [3H]dTMP incorporation by DNA polymerase I in vitro was then determined. Where indicated, DNA was pretreated with 20 ng of either purified bacterial endonuclease IV (Nfo) or human polynucleotide kinase (hPNKP).

Here we show that the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), rapidly represses c-myc gene transcription in a protein synthesis-independent manner in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells by inactivation of NF-κB. SNP treatment reduces the DNA binding ability of the constitutively active NF-κB heterodimer, p65/p50, and its consequent transactivation of the c-myc promoter. Repression can be blocked by the peroxynitrite scavenger, deferoxamine, but not by dithiothreitol, which triggers reduction of S-nitrosylated residues. In HEK293 cells, where tumor necrosis factor-α can activate NF-κB, SNP likewise suppresses the binding of the active NF-κB complex, restoring the binding of the repressive p50/p50 homodimer complex. This effect of SNP in HEK293 cells is also blocked by deferoxamine. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of SNP-treated P19 cells reveals reduced association of p65, but not of p50, with the promoter region of the endogenous c-myc gene. SNP-induced p65 dissociation was associated with the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 to the endogenous c-myc gene promoter and the subsequent deacetylation of its chromatin histone. This study is the first to demonstrate that NO modulates the transcriptional activity of the c-myc gene promoter by dissociating the active form of NF-κB and replacing it with a repressive NF-κB complex, correlated with the recruitment of gene-silencing histone deacetylases. In light of findings that NF-κB stimulates Myc oncoprotein expression in cancers, our findings suggest that NO should be investigated as a prospective therapeutic cancer agent.

NO may modulate the cellular redox state by acting as an oxidant, thereby activating or inhibiting various enzymes involved in a number of signal transduction pathways. It is known that NO can regulate gene expression by modulating transcription factors, the translation or stability of mRNA (1Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the modification of proteins (2Shindler H. Bogdan C. Int. J.

It is also known that these effects of NO are differentially elicited by various concentrations of NO in the microenvironment. For instance, a low level of NO activates the cGMP second messenger system, namely the cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, in vascular smooth muscle and others (5Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S.

However, a high level of NO, such as that generated by inducible NO synthase or administered exogenously, will directly modify target proteins through S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues or nitration of tyrosine (Tyr) residues (2Shindler H.

We have previously identified a novel inhibitory role for NO in the transcription of the mouse kappa opioid receptor (KOR) gene in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, a role mediated primarily through reduced expression of c-Myc that activates KOR gene transcription (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family. It forms a heterodimer with Max on the E-box of target gene promoters to activate transcription. In contrast, a heterodimer of Max and Mad binds to the E-box to suppress transcription. A functional role for c-Myc has been established in a wide variety of cellular processes including proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation, genomic stability (11Dang C.V. Mol. Cell.

Our recent study of P19 stem cells presented evidence that c-Myc functions as an activator for the mouse KOR gene by binding to its promoter. We also showed that NO suppressed KOR expression by rapidly down-regulating c-Myc protein synthesis in P19 cells (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying rapid down-regulation of c-Myc by NO in P19 cells. Regulation of c-myc gene expression has been shown to occur at multiple levels, including gene transcription, premature termination of translation (17Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Perez-Juste G. Garcia-Silva S. Aranda A. J. Biol.

In Burkitt's lymphoma the c-myc gene is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene loci on either chromosome 2, 14, or 22. Transcription of the mouse gene can be initiated from two promoters, P1 and P2, separated by ∼160 bp. P2 is the major promoter where several transcription factors and regulatory DNA elements have been identified. For instance, three cis-acting elements for ME1a2, E2F, and ME1a1 have been found in P2 (21Moberg K.H. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Rhee K. Ma T. Thompson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pituitary tumor-transforming gene product can bind to a region near the P2 initiation site as a protein complex containing the upstream stimulatory factor-1 (23Pei L. J. Biol.

A Smad-responsive element has been shown to be responsible for transforming growth factor-α mediated suppression of c-myc transcription (24Yagi K. Furuhashi M. Aoki H. Goto D. Kuwano H. Sugamura K.

In addition, two functional NF-κB elements have been identified in both the human and the murine c-myc genes (27Kessler D.J. Duyao M.P. Spicer D.B. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ji L. Arcinas M.

Importantly, transcription of the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma is stimulated by constitutively expressed NF-κB (19Kanda K. Hu H.M. Zhang L. Grandchamps J. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32338-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our finding of rapid repression of c-Myc by NO in P19 cells (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the identification of two NF-κB binding sites in the c-myc promoter prompted us to examine the potential role of NF-κB in mediating NO regulation of c-myc in P19 cells. NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor. Five members of NF-κB are known, including p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), c-Rel, RelB, and p65 (RelA). The major active form of this transcription factor is the p65/p50 heterodimer (30Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 32Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB complexes are predominantly cytoplasmic and are usually associated with an inhibitory protein, the IκB family. Upon stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1, NF-κB dimer dissociates from IκBα and is translocated into nuclei to act on the target gene (33Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar, 34Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Translocation into nuclei is considered to be a general, underlying mechanism for the activation of NF-κB in gene regulation. It has been shown that NO can inhibit NF-κB by modifying the p50 subunit via redox-based S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue in its N-terminal region. This effect of NO is sensitive to dithiothreitol (DTT) (4Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 35Matthews J.R. Botting C.H.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 4101-4108PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, the effect of NO on c-Myc in P19 cells was not blocked by DTT (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of other NO-triggered mechanisms in the regulation of NF-κB activity. In this study we found that a NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) repressed the DNA binding and activating function of the constitutively active p65/p50 form of NF-κB in P19 cells. Although not affected by DTT, it was blocked by deferoxamine (DFO), a peroxynitrite scavenger. Similarly, the NO donor also repressed TNF-α-activated NF-κB in cells where NF-κB normally existed as an inactive complex. The effect of NO in these cells was likewise blocked by DFO. We then confirmed the effect of NO on NF-κB and the c-myc promoter by examining the dynamic behavior of the NF-κB complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and chromatin acetylation on the endogenous c-myc promoter. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that NO modulates the transcription of the c-myc gene by inducing the dissociation of p65/p50 NF-κB from the c-myc promoter region and the recruitment of the repressive p50 homodimer complex, in correlation with increased recruitment of HDACs and decreased histone acetylation on the endogenous c-myc promoter. Antibodies and Plasmids—Antibodies against c-Myc (N-262), p65 (H-286), HDAC1 (C-19), and HDAC2 (H-54) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-p50 (06-886) and anti-acetylated histone H4 (06-866) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—P19 embryonal carcinoma cell and COS-1 cell lines were maintained as described previously (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids. Transient transfection was performed in P19 and COS-1 cells using the calcium chloride method, and reporter assays were conducted as described previously (40Hu X. Bi J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analyses of c-myc mRNA—The endogenous c-myc mRNA was analyzed by a reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated (by using a Trizol® kit (Invitrogen)) from P19 cells which were pretreated with 2 μg/ml actinomycin D (ActD) or 2 μg/ml cycloheximide. Five mm DTT or 0.1 mm DFO was added for 30 min prior to the addition of 0.5 mm SNP for 6 h. To determine c-myc mRNA stability, P19 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml ActD for different durations in the presence of 1 mm SNP for 6 h. Primers specific to c-myc mRNA for the amplification procedure are 5′-CCATATGCCCCTCAACGTGAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGATCCTTATGCACCAGAGTTT-3′, which span a 1350-bp coding region. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Western Blot— Nuclear extracts and whole cell lysates were isolated from P19 cells treated as above. HEK293 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 8 h to activate NF-κB, followed by the addition of SNP for 6 h. EMSA was performed as described (41Li J. Park S.W. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39967-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Four types of double-stranded oligonucleotides (upstream responsive element (URE), internal responsive element (IRE), mt-URE, and nonspecific KOR gene promoter sequences) (see Fig. 2) were each used as probes that were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP or used as competitors without labeling. Whole cell lysates were analyzed on a Western blot by using anti-c-Myc antibody as described (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—P19 cells were treated with SNP or SNP plus DFO for 6 h (or in a time-dependent manner), followed by cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde. ChIP assay was as described previously (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by using 2 μg of anti-acetylated histone H4, anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-HDAC1, or anti-HDAC2 antibodies. Precipitated DNA was amplified with primers specific to the URE flanking sequences in the endogenous c-myc promoter and to its 3′-untranslated region (UTR), followed by Southern blot analyses of amplified endogenous c-myc sequences. Transcriptional Repression of c-myc Gene by NO—We have previously shown that several NO donors suppressed KOR gene expression in P19 cells through repressing c-Myc protein expression and its binding to the KOR promoter (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the repression of c-Myc by NO in P19 cells occurred at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, P19 cells were treated with SNP, a NO donor, in the absence or presence of ActD or cycloheximide followed by an analysis of the c-myc mRNA level with an established RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). NO dramatically reduced the constitutively expressed c-myc mRNA level (lane 2), and ActD effectively blocked c-myc transcription in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of the NO donor SNP. Interestingly, although cycloheximide slightly increased c-myc expression (lane 5), it had little effect on the repression elicited by NO (lane 6), indicating that NO directly repressed c-myc transcription and that protein synthesis was probably not involved in this repression. To determine if c-myc mRNA stability was affected by NO, an experiment was carried out to determine c-myc mRNA half-life by treating P19 cells with ActD in the presence of SNP for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 1B, the c-myc mRNA half-life remained at ∼20 min in both control cells (lanes 1–5) and cells exposed to NO (lanes 6–10). Therefore, c-myc mRNA stability is not affected by NO, whereas its gene transcription is directly repressed by NO signal. Repression of c-myc Gene Transcription by NO through Inactivation of NF-κB Activity—To define the target of NO-mediated repression of c-myc gene transcription, the regulatory regions of c-myc gene were carefully examined. This gene utilizes two promoters located ∼160 bp apart, with the second promoter residing in exon 1. Interestingly, two putative NF-κB binding sites, an URE (GGGTTTCCCC) located at —1261 to —1251 bp in the 5′-flanking region of promoter 1 and an IRE (GGGAATTTTT) located at +280 to +289 relative to the promoter P2 (27Kessler D.J. Duyao M.P. Spicer D.B. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were found to be relevant (Fig. 2A). NF-κB has been shown to be a target protein of NO signal (3Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 42Colasanti M. Persichini T. Brain Res. Bull. 2000; 52: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We examined how the endogenous NF-κB activity in P19 cells might be affected by NO and augment c-myc gene expression. P19 cells were treated with SNP, followed by analyzing its nuclear extract for DNA binding ability to the κB binding sites of the c-myc promoter in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 32P-labeled URE probe revealed a major retarded band and several minor bands (lane 1), which could be competed out specifically by the wild type cold probe (lane 2) but not by the mutated cold probe (mt-URE, lane 3) or nonspecific oligonucleotides (lane 4). The anti-p65 antibody was able to block the major binding species that is the heterodimeric p65/p50 NF-κB complex (lane 5), and the anti-p50 antibody was able to supershift the minor species, the p50 complex (lane 6). The control, a nonspecific antibody such as the anti-Sp1, had no effect (lane 7). Therefore, the URE consensus sequences of the c-myc gene indeed can be bound by p65/p50 heterodimer and p50 homodimer of NF-κB, but the major complex in P19 cells is the transcriptionally active p65/p50 heterodimer. The second putative NF-κB binding site, IRE, was also tested in EMSA as shown in Fig. 2C, which appeared to share a very similar binding pattern as that of the URE. Furthermore, SNP decreased the intensity of the p65/p50 NF-κB band but increased the p50 complex for both NF-κB sites (lanes 1–4), revealing a decreased activator p65/p50-DNA interaction of P19 nuclear extract as a result of SNP treatment. To determine whether the transcriptional activity of endogenous NF-κB was affected by NO, transient transfection assays were conducted in P19 stem cells and fully differentiated COS-1 cells by using a specific NF-κB reporter, p(Igk)4-LUC (39O'Connell M.A. Bennett B.L. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), without introducing any other expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 3A, SNP effectively suppressed the specific reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner in P19 cells but not in COS-1 cells, which is consistent with our previous conclusion that NO suppressed KOR gene transcription only in P19 cells but not in COS-1 cells (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suppressive effect of NO on NF-κB reporter plasmid in P19 cells agreed with the reduced DNA binding activity of NF-κB from SNP-treated P19 cells (Fig. 2C). The resistance of the same reporter activity to SNP in COS-1 cells was because of the absence of p65/p50 species binding to the URE in COS-1 cells that contained primarily the p50 species binding to the URE site (data not shown). To further confirm that the effect of SNP was indeed mediated by p65/p50 NF-κB, the specific reporter and a pMT2T-p65 expression vector (37Franzoso G. Bours V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Nature. 1992; 359: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were simultaneously introduced into COS-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Indeed, ectopic expression of p65 increased the specific reporter activity in COS-1 cells, which was again suppressed by SNP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Thus, NO not only suppresses the DNA binding activity of p65/p50 NF-κB, but also efficiently reduces NF-κB activity in transcriptional control. The effect is primarily at the p65 subunit. Repression of c-myc Gene Transcription by NO through Peroxynitrite—Previously we have suggested that S-nitrosylation was not involved in c-myc repression by SNP, a NO donor, in P19 cells because this suppressive effect could not be reversed by DTT, an agent that blocks S-nitrosylation of Cys residues by NO (10Park S.W. Li J. Loh H.H. Wei L.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is accepted that NF-κB activity can be inhibited by NO through S-nitrosylation on a Cys residue of its p50 subunit (35Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 36DelaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Punzalan C. Kuo P.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4101-4108PubMed Google Scholar), the failure of DTT to reverse the repressive effects of SNP in P19 cells raised the question as to what other pathway could be involved in this novel suppressive effect of SNP in P19 cells. The alternative modification elicited by NO is Tyr nitration triggered by the highly reactive peroxynitrite (ONOO—) generated from NO and superoxide (4Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we treated P19 cells with DTT or DFO that is known to scavenge peroxynitrite, followed by examining the expression of c-myc mRNA as shown in Fig. 4. DTT failed to reverse the repressive effect of SNP on c-myc transcription (Fig. 4A, lane 3), whereas DFO efficiently blocked the repressive effect of SNP (lane 4). Consistently, c-Myc protein expression (Fig. 4B) was repressed by SNP (lane 2), which was effectively reversed by DFO (lane 4) but not by DTT (lane 3). The potent cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP and guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one affected neither c-myc mRNA nor its protein level (data not shown). To confirm whether peroxynitrite was indeed responsible for inactivating NF-κB activity, transient transfection assays were performed using the specific reporter, p(Igk)4-LUC, in P19 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, DTT failed to reverse the repressive effect of SNP on the NF-κB reporter, but DFO very efficiently reversed the repression to ∼75% of the control level. These results have ruled out the S-nitrosylation and cGMP-dependent pathways and suggested that peroxynitrite generated from NO could play a role in the repression of c-myc transcription in P19 cells, which may involve nitration of NF-κB. It was noted that changes had occurred in the DNA binding pattern of endogenous NF-κB and p50 homodimer in P19 cells following SNP treatment (Fig. 1C). To further confirm this point, we made use of HEK293 cells where the endogenous NF-κB existed primarily as the inactive complexes and could be activated by TNF-α. By testing DNA binding patterns of HEK293 extract as shown in Fig. 5, the portion of heterodimeric NF-κB increased in response to TNF-α stimulation as predicted (lane 2), which was blocked by SNP and replaced with the p50/p50 homodimer complex after SNP treatment (lane 3). Furthermore, the SNP-triggered blockage of NF-κB heterodimer formation was again reversed by DFO (lane 4). The identity of p65/p50 heterodimer and p50/p50 homodimer was again confirmed by using specific antibodies (lanes 5–8) that either blocked (for p65/p50 heterodimer) or supershifted (for p50/p50 homodimer) the complexes. This result confirms that indeed SNP triggers the dissociation of the p65/p50 complex from, and the association of p50 complex with, the target DNA, consistent with the effects of SNP and DFO in the regulation of c-myc gene, as well as its reporter, in P19 cells (Fig. 4). The results of the two cell lines have demonstrated that peroxynitrite indeed disrupts DNA binding of the activated NF-κB, i.e. the p65/p50 heterodimer, which can be blocked by DFO, a scavenger of peroxynitrite. Recruitment of HDACs 1 and 2 to the Endogenous c-myc Promoter by SNP Treatment—The activity of transcription factors can be modulated by altering the recruited coregulators in addition to changes in DNA binding ability. For the repressive activity of p50 homodimer, the recruitment of HDACs has been shown to play a major role (43Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 44Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of SNP and thus replacement of p65/p50 with p50/p50 on its target gene, the role of HDAC activity was examined. P19 cells were transfected with the specific NF-κB reporter p(Igk)4-LUC and treated with SNP, trichostatin A (TSA), or"

We show here that green fluorescent protein-tagged PKN1 has the ability to translocate in a reversible manner to a vesicular compartment following hyperosmotic stress. PKN1 kinase activity is not necessary for this translocation, and in fact the PKN inhibitor HA1077 is also shown to induce PKN1 vesicle accumulation. PKN1 translocation is dependent on Rac1 activation, although the GTPase binding HR1abc domain is not sufficient for this recruitment. The PKN1 kinase domain, however, localizes constitutively to this compartment, and we demonstrate that this behavior is selective for PKNs. Associated with vesicle recruitment, PKN1 is shown to undergo activation loop phosphorylation and activation. It is established that this activation pathway involves PDK1, which is shown to be recruited to this PKN1-positive compartment upon hyperosmotic stress. Taken together, our findings present a pathway for the selective hyperosmotic-induced Rac1-dependent PKN1 translocation and PDK1-dependent activation.

Taken together, our findings present a pathway for the selective hyperosmotic-induced Rac1-dependent PKN1 translocation and PDK1-dependent activation. Hyperosmotic stress is established as a potent activator of several signaling cascades, including stress-activated protein kinases (1Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), p38 (2Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12781-12786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein kinase B (PKB) 1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; PKN, protein kinase N; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MBP, myelin basic protein; PAK, p21-activated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. is shown to be down-regulated by hyperosmotic stress via dephosphorylation of its regulatory Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation sites (4Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast PKC homologues, which in part resemble the PKNs, have been established as essential for the maintenance of cell wall integrity (5Arellano M. Valdivieso M.H. Calonge T.M. Coll P.M. Duran A. Perez P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3569-3578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cell wall integrity has been likened to the hyperosmotic stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has suggested roles for PKCs in high osmolarity responses (6Alonso-Monge R. Real E. Wojda I. Bebelman J.P. Mager W.H. Siderius M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Notably, Mkh1, a yeast MEK kinase, is also shown to be activated and indeed required for cell wall integrity and a normal response to osmotic stress in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, further establishing the link between cell wall integrity and the osmotic stress response (7Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Classical and novel PKC activation is suggested to be a requirement for hyperosmotic induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (8Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102—C109Crossref Google Scholar). This investigation has sought to address the involvement of PKN1 in the hyperosmotic stress response in mammalian cells. PKNs (protein kinase novel, also known as PRKs 2Here the nomenclature PKN is used throughout. PRK1 is referred to as PKN1, and PRK2 is referred to as PKN2. (9Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) are a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases identified independently by molecular cloning, protein purification, and PCR-based screens for PKC related kinases. The carboxyl-terminal kinase domains of these proteins are closely related to those of PKC, and at their amino termini they have a conserved repeated domain (HR1a,b,c) followed by a C2-related domain; overall these proteins have a domain organization related to that of the yeast PKC-related proteins (11Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). PKNs are activated by fatty acids and phospholipids in vitro, although the in vivo significance of this remains unclear (12Morrice N.A. Fecondo J. Wettenhall R.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal HR1 domain was identified as a Rho interacting region (14Watanabe G. Saito Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and RhoB has been shown to target PKN1 to an endosomal compartment where it is implicated in controlling the kinetics of epidermal growth factor receptor traffic (17Mellor H.

Biol. 1999; 9: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The interaction of Rho with PKN1 has been demonstrated to facilitate PKN1 activation loop phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 was originally purified as an activity responsible for PKBα activation loop phosphorylation (19Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). PDK1 has been demonstrated more recently to phosphorylate equivalent residues on many other AGC kinases, including p70S6k, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and PKCs (reviewed in Ref. 21Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 3: 561-576Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Based upon co-transfection experiments, the in vivo ternary complex of Rho-PKN1-PDK1 has been shown to be dependent on PI 3-kinase activity and to be critical for the catalytic activation of PKN1 (22Flynn P. Mellor H. Casamassima A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11064-11070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PKN1 has been linked to stress-induced pathways because it has been implicated upstream of c-Jun transcription via p38γ (23Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), both are activated upon hyperosmotic stress. Another relevant PKN response involves Fyn tyrosine kinase, which has been shown to mediate PKN2 function in keratinocytes (24Calautti E. Grossi M. Mammucari C. Aoyama Y. Pirro M. Ono Y. Li J. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown (25Ko B.C. Lam A.K. Kapus A. Fan L. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46085-46092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to be essential in transcription from the osmotic response element. Here we describe the acute translocation of GFP-PKN1 to vesicles in response to hyperosmotic stress. It is established that PKN1 translocation is dependent on Rac1 activation, and the kinase domain of PKN1 is shown to be an essential component of this response. The activity of PKN1 is found not to be required for vesicle recruitment, although activation loop phosphorylation and catalytic activation of PKN1 is shown to increase upon hyperosmotic stress. This activation is catalyzed by PDK1, which is recruited to the PKN1 compartment in a PI 3-kinase- and PKN1-dependent manner. Thus a pathway is established that leads from the plasma membrane activation of Rac1 to the vesicular accumulation of an activated PKN1 complex. Materials—Anti-PKN1 monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and the anti-phospho-PKN polyclonal antibody was as described previously (22Flynn P. Mellor H. Casamassima A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11064-11070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody was from Cancer Research UK monoclonal services; Cy3 anti-mouse antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch, and anti-HA polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Rac1 activation assay was purchased as a kit from Totam Biologicals. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Clontech, and phosphatidylserine lipids were from Lipid Products. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the ROCK/PKN inhibitor HA1077 were purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmid Constructs—GFP-PKN1 and GFP-PKN2 constructs were generated by PCR using as templates PKN1 and PKN2 constructs, respectively. PKN1 was amplified using primer 1, 5′-GCGCAAGCTTGCATGGCCAGCGACGCCGTGCAGAGTGAGCC-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCGCGGTACCTTAGCAGCCCCCGGCCACGAAGTCGAAGTCCAGGAAGGC-3′; for PKN2 primer 3, 5′-GCGCAAGCTTCGATGGCGTCCAACCCCGAACGG-3′; and primer 4, 5′-GCGCGGTACCTTAACACCAATCAGCAATGTAGTCAAAATCTCTGAACATTTCCTGC-3′. Primers 1 and 3 incorporated a HindIII restriction site, and primers 2 and 4 contained a KpnI site. The resulting products contained the full-length PKN sequences and were cloned into PCR blunt (Invitrogen). This was subsequently digested with HindIII and KpnI and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) enabling the fusion of an amino-terminal GFP tag in-frame with the full-length PKN1 and PKN2. The DS-Red PKN1 was constructed in the same manner as GFP-PKN1, using the pDS-Red-C1 vector from Clontech. HA-HR1abc has been described previously (17Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); GFP-PKCϵ was as described (26Ivaska J. Whelan R.D. Watson R. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3608-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the GFP-PKCα kinase domain was derived from the full-length cDNA. 3S. Parkinson, unpublished observations.

GFP-PDK1 was a gift from Dr. Dario Alessi, Dundee, UK, and the Myc-tagged Rac1 wild type and N17 plasmids were gifts from Dr. Alan Hall, London, UK. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (10% E4). Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The lipid DNA mix was incubated for 6 h according to the manufacturer's protocol, and all subsequent manipulations (see text and figure legends) were performed 48 h post-transfection. Hyperosmotic Stress—Cells were subjected to hyperosmotic conditions for 30 min by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4 m sucrose and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. For recovery experiments, cells were shocked for 30 min, and then medium was replaced with normosmotic medium. The average number of vesicles after 30 min of hyperosmotic stress and subsequent 15 and 30 min of recovery was determined. From each condition, 10 GFP-PKN1 vesicle-containing cells were sampled. Images were taken as confocal sections through the center of the cell, and the number of vesicles from each image was counted. Microscopy—Cells were seeded on acid-washed glass coverslips, and transfection and stimulation were as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. When processing for immunofluorescence, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed, and incubated in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibody containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed three times with the final wash in water. All washes and incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline unless otherwise stated. Cells were mounted on glass slides under Mowiol (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10% (w/v) Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem), and 25% (v/v) glycerol) containing anti-photobleaching agent (2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma)). Slides were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axioplan2 with LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Inc.) equipped with 63×/1.4 Plan-APOCHROMAT oil immersion objectives. GFP and Cy3 were excited with 488- and 543-nm lines of Kr-Ar lasers, respectively, and individual channels scanned in series to prevent bleed through. Each image represents a single 1.0-μm “Z” optical section. Rac1 Activation—NIH-3T3 cells (500,000 cells per 6-cm dish) were seeded and grown in 10% fetal calf serum E4 and subsequently starved for 16 h with 0.05% E4. Cells were then subjected to treatments of hyperosmotic stress as indicated in the figure legends. The Rac activation assay was performed on cell extracts using reagents contained in the kit from Totam Biologicals. This assay employs the p21 binding domain (PBD or CRIB domain) of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK) as a GST fusion protein that selectively binds GTP-Rac1 in a “pull-down” assay enabling the detection of activated Rac1. All samples were prepared and processed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Quantitation was obtained by image capture and densitometry using NIH™ image software. Phosphorylation of GFP-PKN1—Cells were transiently transfected on 6-cm2 plates with GFP-PKN1 and subject to hyperosmotic stress as indicated. Cells were harvested in 400 μl of sample buffer and fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Activation loop Thr-774 phosphorylation of PKN1 was assessed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific polyclonal antibody with excess of dephospho-peptide as described (22Flynn P. Mellor H. Casamassima A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11064-11070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Relative PKN1 phosphorylation was determined as a function of PKN1 protein levels defined using the PKN1 monoclonal antibody. GFP-PKN1 phosphorylation is taken from three duplicate experiments, where represented graphically the error bars denote the S.E. GFP-PKN1 Kinase Assay—For each condition a 15-cm2 plate of cells was transfected with GFP-PKN1 and stimulated with hyperosmotic medium as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested in a lysis buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 Complete tablet (protease inhibitor from Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml of lysis buffer, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. Preclearance of cell lysates with pre-equilibrated protein G was followed by incubation with 9 μg of GFP polyclonal antibody for 20 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubation for 1 h with protein G. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl, and a final wash in reaction buffer, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. For each reaction, 10 μl of immunopurified GFP-PKN1 was incubated in a 40-μl reaction mix of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μg of bath-sonicated phosphatidyl-l-serine, 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C with agitation. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of sample buffer prior to fractionation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently Western blotting analysis was performed. To assess MBP phosphorylation, membranes (Immobilon-P from Millipore) were exposed to PhosphorImager (STORM, Amersham Biosciences) prior to immunoblotting with anti-PKN1. Relative specific activity was determined as a function of immunoreactive GFP-PKN1. The data presented are representative of three duplicate experiments, and where represented graphically, error bars denote the S.E. Additional duplicate reactions incorporated 20 μm HA1077 (a PKN inhibitor) as a control for specific PKN activity (27Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). GFP-PKN1 expressed in NIH-3T3 cells displayed a punctate cytoplasmic localization with an absence of nuclear localization. The effect of a range of potential PKN1 agonists on the subcellular distribution of GFP-PKN1 was investigated including the following: epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and stress conditions such as oxidative, temperature, hypo- and hyperosmotic stress. Notably, cells treated with hyperosmotic media for 30 min displayed a dramatic change in localization, with GFP-PKN1 accumulating in large cytoplasmic vesicular structures (Fig. 1A). The dynamic nature of the hyperosmotic-induced structures was investigated by placing cells back into osmotically balanced media following 30 min of hyperosmotic stress. Cells containing GFP-PKN1 vesicles were randomly selected, and sectional images taken by confocal microscopy. These vesicles were clearly dissipated on removal from hyperosmotic conditions; quantitation showed that the average number of vesicles per cell decreased in a time-dependent fashion after re-addition of osmotically balanced medium. It is evident therefore that the accumulation of vesicular PKN1 is a reversible process (Fig. 1B). GFP-PKCϵ has been shown to accumulate in vesicular structures following chronic PKC inhibition in MEF cells (26Ivaska J. Whelan R.D. Watson R. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3608-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To investigate the selectivity of the PKN1 translocation in response to hyperosmotic stress, DS-Red PKN1 and GFP-PKCϵ were co-expressed. DS-Red-PKN1 has been co-expressed with GFP-PKN1 to confirm that they show the same localization behavior before and after hyperosmotic stress (data not shown). The ability of DS-Red PKN1 to translocate into vesicles upon hyperosmotic stress was unaffected by the presence of GFP-PKCϵ; furthermore, PKCϵ did not locate to the DS-Red PKN1-containing structures (Fig. 1C), indicating that the observed behavior of PKN1 in response to hyperosmotic stress shows some selectivity. The ability of other PKN subfamily members to respond to hyperosmotic stress was also followed. GFP-PKN2 when unstimulated was largely cytoplasmic with some limited nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1D). After hyperosmotic stress, GFP-PKN2 showed the same translocation pattern as GFP-PKN1 (Fig. 1D), indicating that the described behavior is a common PKN response. The influence of catalytic activity on this process was investigated by employing the drug HA1077, which has been shown to inhibit both PKN1 and PKN2 (27Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of GFP-PKN1-transfected cells with HA1077 followed by hyperosmotic stress did not prevent PKN1 vesicle recruitment. Interestingly cells treated with HA1077 alone displayed an accumulation of vesicular GFP-PKN1 (Fig. 2A). To investigate further the contribution of PKN1 activity, we performed localization studies using the kinase-dead GFP-PKN-K644R mutant. When unstimulated this inactive PKN1 mutant shows a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, and after hyperosmotic stress accumulates in vesicles (Fig. 2A) as observed for wild type GFP-PKN1. DS-Red-PKN1 and GFP-PKN1-KR were coexpressed to investigate whether either form of PKN1 could behave in a dominant fashion with respect to vesicle recruitment. Both wild type and kinase-dead PKN1 were cytoplasmic in unstimulated cells and co-localized in vesicles upon hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 2B). These findings imply that the kinase activity of PKN1 is not necessary for vesicle recruitment. However, given the effect of HA1077 in unstimulated cells, PKN1 may play a role in the exit from this vesicular compartment, which itself may be part of a constitutive endocytic pathway (see below and “Discussion”). PKN has been shown to bind to and become activated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases via the regulatory HR1 domain and indeed has been shown previously to be recruited to an endosomal compartment by RhoB (17Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We tested the involvement of Rho proteins in the PKN response to hyperosmotic stress by employing the C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum. C3 toxin has been shown to inhibit specifically the Rho subfamily over other Rho family GTPases such as Rac1 (29Wilde C. Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with GFP-PKN1 and then pre-loaded with C3-GST for 6 h at 5 μg/ml followed by subjection to hyperosmotic stress. The effectiveness of C3-GST cell loading was measured by an in vitro ribosylation assay and also by monitoring the extent of stress fiber disruption assessed by phalloidin staining (data not shown). The accumulation of PKN1-containing vesicles was independent of C3-GST treatment, implying that Rho function is not required for this response (data not shown). The small GTPase Rac1 has been implicated previously in the control of PKN2 (16Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and recently in response to hyperosmotic shock (30Lewis A. Di Ciano C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C271-C279Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence in the absence of a Rho input, the potential involvement of Rac1 in the translocation of PKN1 was investigated. Myc-tagged Rac1 was co-expressed with GFP-PKN1. Under control conditions GFP-PKN1 was cytoplasmic, and Rac1 located to lamellipodia, the plasma membrane, and to some vesicular structures (Fig. 3A). After 30 min of hyperosmotic stress, Myc-Rac1 and GFP-PKN1 co-localized in vesicles (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of the dominant negative Myc-Rac1-N17 with GFP-PKN1 resulted in no vesicular translocation of GFP-PKN1 after hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 3B). These observations imply that GTP loading of Rac1 is necessary for the hyperosmotic stress-induced movement of GFP-PKN1. Rac1 has been shown recently to become GTP-loaded upon hyperosmotic stress in neutrophils (30Lewis A. Di Ciano C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C271-C279Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This was confirmed here by employing a Rac1 pull-down assay, using the CRIB domain of PAK that selectively binds GTP-bound Rac1. After 30 min of hyperosmotic stress, a 1.5-fold increase in the GTP loading of endogenous Rac1 was detected (Fig. 3D). Rac1, like Rho, binds to the HR1 domain of PKN proteins (31Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus the impact of the regulatory HR1abc region on hyperosmotic stress-induced vesicle recruitment was investigated through localization studies of the ectopically expressed HA-tagged HR1abc domain of PKN1. This domain localized around the cell periphery under control conditions, and after hyperosmotic stress did not change its distribution. HA-HR1abc was co-expressed with full-length GFP-PKN1 to determine whether their combined presence would influence each other's localization. The distribution of the HR1abc domain remained unchanged when co-expressed with GFP-PKN1 either before or after hyperosmotic stress. The presence of HR1abc did not abolish GFP-PKN1 vesicle recruitment (Fig. 3C). The evidence thus indicates that Rac1 recruits PKN1 at the plasma membrane where HR1abc can compete for interaction and that the PKN1-Rac1 complex but not the HR1abc-Rac1 complex is then endocytosed. We speculate that because HR1abc was unable to prevent GFP-PKN1 vesicle association, either endogenous Rac1 remains in excess under these conditions or GFP-PKN1 can compete effectively for Rac1 in the presence of co-expressed HR1abc. Irrespective of the lack of the competition between these two, the behavior of the HR1abc domain indicates that although the regulatory input of Rac1 into PKN1 might be essential in priming PKN1 for endocytosis/vesicle recruitment, it cannot be the sole device by which PKN1 vesicle association is mediated. To assess the potential contribution of other PKN domains in vesicle recruitment, the myc-PKN1 kinase domain was transfected into NIH-3T3 cells. Under control conditions, myc-PKN1 kinase domain already displayed a partially vesicular distribution, and upon hyperosmotic stress, this vesicular localization became more pronounced (Fig. 4A). To test whether the kinase domain locates to the same structures as the full-length protein, the Myc kinase domain was co-expressed with GFP-PKN1; after hyperosmotic stress they were found to co-localize in large vesicular structures (Fig. 4B). The observation that the PKN1 kinase domain can by itself localize to vesicles raises the possibility that the kinase domains of highly related PKC isoforms could behave in a similar manner. Myc-PKN1 kinase domain was co-expressed with the GFP-PKCα kinase domain. After hyperosmotic stress the kinase domain of PKN1 could be detected in vesicles; in these structures the kinase domain of PKCα was absent (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that vesicle targeting of PKN1 through the kinase domain is specific for this compartment and must follow distinct mechanisms when compared with a closely related kinase domain. The HA1077 effects on the basal state and osmotic induced distribution of PKN1 (Fig. 2A) imply that its activity could be required for vesicle turnover. However, it is not clear whether activation of PKN takes place in response to osmotic stress. Activation loop phosphorylation is required for optimum catalytic activity of PKN1 (22Flynn P. Mellor H. Casamassima A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11064-11070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies were used to assess the effect of hyperosmotic shock on GFP-PKN1 activation loop phosphorylation. A 2-fold increase in phosphorylation after 30 min of hyperosmotic stress was detected on GFP-PKN1 (Fig. 5A). We were also able to detect an increase in endogenous PKN1 phosphorylation after hyperosmotic shock. Immunoprecipitated GFP-PKN1 from transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells, either prior to or post-hyperosmotic shock, was used to determine directly the effect of osmotic stress on activity. After hyperosmotic shock, immunoprecipitated GFP-PKN1 displayed a specific activity ∼2-fold above un-shocked GFP-PKN1 (Fig. 5B). The possibility of associated kinases being responsible for this activity was precluded with parallel control assays incorporating the PKN inhibitor HA1077. This inhibitor has been reported to be specific for PKN1 over kinases that can associate with it (e.g. PDK1, see below) (27Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamur"

Here we report that the three proteins encoded by this evolutionarily conserved gene, Tid50, Tid47, and Tid40, identified as members of the DnaJ cochaperone family, are destined for different cellular compartments, build complexes with many proteins in a developmental stage-specific manner, and are likely to be involved in different cellular processes.

We provide functional evidence for its direct in vivo interaction with the Hh-bound Ptc receptor during signal transmission. Because loss of l(2)tid causes neoplastic transformation of Hh-responsive cells, we suggest that Tid47 may at least act as a guardian of the Hh signaling gradient by regulating Ptc homeostasis in the tissue. Finally, we show that the expression of htid-1, the human counterpart of l(2)tid, is altered in human BCCs.

As shown by transplantation experiments, the autonomous but non-invasive growth of the mutant imaginal discs begins at early stages of embryonic development (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Phannavong B. Gundacker D. Gateff E. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since the tumor-developing l(2)tid mutants were first discovered, this phenotype determined the designation of the gene. However, mutations of l(2)tid cause severe defects (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Phannavong B. Gundacker D. Gateff E. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Knocking out the l(2)tid function by injection of antisense mRNA as well as overexpression of the antisense mRNA in transgenic animals causes embryonic lethality as a result of multiple developmental abnormalities, including segmentation problems (4Kurzik-Dumke U. Kaymer M. Gundacker D. Debes A. Labitzke K. Gene. 1997; 200: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Tid proteins have been identified as novel members of the evolutionarily conserved DnaJ protein family (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), also referred to as heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) because a number of them are about 40 kDa in size and have been identified as products of heat shock genes (5Zuber U. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Bukkau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1998: 241-271Google Scholar). As shown previously, the expression of l(2)tid is not heat-inducible (6Kurzik-Dumke U. Neubauer M. Debes A. Gene. 1996; 171: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although members of the DnaJ proteins show structural diversity, they share sequence homology with the canonical Hsp40, the Escherichia coli DnaJ (7Bardwell J.C.A. Tilly K Craig E King J Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their defining feature is the J-domain corresponding to the N-terminal 70 amino acids of the E. coli DnaJ (5Zuber U. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Bukkau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1998: 241-271Google Scholar, 7Bardwell J.C.A. Tilly K Craig E King J Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional common structural characteristics of these molecules are a glycine and phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region, a cysteine-rich part resembling a zinc finger and consisting of four CXXCXGXG repeats, and a non-homologous C-terminal domain (5Zuber U. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Bukkau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1998: 241-271Google Scholar). In bacteria DnaJ proteins have been found to be components of the ubiquitous Hsp70 chaperone machinery, a functional complex of Hsp70 (E. coli DnaK), DnaJ and GrpE. By performing a cochaperone function, they participate in correct folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and protein complexes (5Zuber U. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Bukkau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1998: 241-271Google Scholar). The identification of the l(2)tid gene as a DnaJ homolog (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) provided the first proof for causal involvement of these molecules in cancer. To elucidate the tissue-specific contribution of l(2)tid to neoplastic transformation of epithelia, we identified its protein products, determined their subcellular localization, and searched for their life cycle-specific molecular ligands. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the cytosolic Tid47 molecule as a novel component of the cancer-related signaling mediated by Hedgehog (Hh) and its receptor and main regulator Patched (Ptc) (8Bale A.E.

We determined that Tid47 interacts in vivo in a developmental stage-dependent manner with the cytosolic C-terminal part of Hh-bound Ptc during signal transmission. Furthermore, using genetic techniques we determined the imaginal discs region developing into the tumor to a restricted area of the imaginal discs, a population of Hh-responsive cells defined by expression of Ptc and Cubitus interruptus155 (Ci155), the central effector of the pathway (10Ingham P.W.

Urban, Institute of Genetics, Johannes Gutenberg University, Germany) carrying the P-element insertions on the third chromosome. The hybrid strains homozygous for l(2)tid1 mutation on the second chromosome, the marker transgene UAS-mCD8-GFP (17Tzumin L. Ligun L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) on the first chromosome, and the GAL4 driver on the third chromosome were generated by standard genetic methods. First, the l(2)tid1 /SM5 flies (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Phannavong B. Gundacker D. Gateff E. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were crossed to the transgenic UAS-mCD-GFP (17Tzumin L. Ligun L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) flies. The progeny from this cross, carrying both the l(2)tid1 allele and the marker transgene, was mated with the GAL4 lines. The double mutants, l(2)tid1 ptc9 and l(2)tid1 ptctuf-1 , were generated by recombination. All strains were grown on standard media at permissive temperature. Drosophila embryonic Schneider2 (S2) cells were cultivated on Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 25 °C. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Human BCCs—Specimens of primary (12 cases) and recurrent (2 cases) BCCs were obtained from seven female (age range, 57–84 years) and seven male (age range, 46–76 years) patients free from therapy and undergoing surgical treatment at the Regina Elena Cancer Institute. Nine of the samples were from skin exposed to sun. The histological diagnosis followed the criteria of Lever and Schaumberg-Lever (19Lever F.W. Schaumberg-Lever G. Histopathology of the skin. 6th Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1963: 562-575Google Scholar). Upon removal, tissue samples were divided into two parts. One part was processed for routine histopathological examination, and the other was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen at –80 °C before use. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm cryostat sections were fixed in cold absolute methanol for 10 min. Biopsies were stained with the affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-hTid serum (U. K.-D., unpublished data) at the concentration of 40 μg/ml and the polyclonal goat antiserum to the N terminus of Ptc (sc-6149, Santa Cruz) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. Incubation with the primary antibodies and the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were carried out by standard procedures using commercially available reagents (Vectastain). 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) was used as substrate for horseradish peroxidase. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. For morphological evaluation, biopsies were stained with 1% toluidine blue. At least three, non-consecutive sections of each biopsy were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry of Imaginal Discs and Cuticle Analysis— Imaginal discs were dissected from third instar wandering larvae. To obtain a homogeneous population, egg laying was restricted to 3 h. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used in the following dilutions: anti-Tid (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), 1:75; and anti-Ci, 1:20. Secondary antibodies were used in concentrations suggested by the suppliers. Cuticle analysis was performed after standard procedures (16Nüsslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Kluding H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1984; 193: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar).

For immunoblotting the affinity-purified serum was biotinylated (anti-TidB) using the service of the Biotrend company (Cologne, Germany). For Ptc detection, the monoclonal mouse anti-Ptc (20Strutt H.

The expression vector, pQEHis6-Ptc1143–1286, was generated by excision of the ptc gene fragment encompassing nucleotides 4125–4559 (15Hooper J.E. Scott M.P.

Antigen purification and rabbit immunization were performed as described (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Further primary antibodies used in this study were: polyclonal rat anti-Smo (21Denef, N., Neubuser, D., Perez, L., and Cohen, S. M. (2000) 102, 521–531Google Scholar), polyclonal rat anti-Ci (11Motzny C.K. Holmgren R. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), polyclonal rabbit anti-Hh (22Tabata T. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 89-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), monoclonal rat anti-Hsp70 (7FB) (23Velazquez, J. M., Sonoda, S., Bugaisky, G., and Lindquist, S. J. Cell Biol., 96, 286–290Google Scholar), and the monoclonal anti-GAL4-BD (Clontech). Secondary antibodies (alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase- and biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, and biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rat IgG) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory. The concentration of the affinity-purified antisera generated in our laboratory was determined by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay established according to standard protocols (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed from precleared protein lysates made from 10 mg of whole Drosophila organisms using a cellular labeling and immunoprecipitation kit (Roche). To detect all immunoprecipitated proteins, the lysates were biotinylated (Roche). The protein labeling step was omitted in those cases in which the samples were subjected to detection of the Tid molecules, Ptc, Hh, Hsp70, or Smo. For immunoprecipitation of the biotinylated proteins, 2.2 μg of the anti-Tid antibody were used. 4.5 μg of anti-Tid were used for immunoprecipitation of non-labeled proteins. Denatured protein complexes were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1b). To improve the resolution of the molecules sized 30–50 kDA (Fig. 1b), separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was performed (Fig. 1c). The molecules were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Roche). The specificity of the signals was verified by staining with the appropriate preimmune serum (lanes labeled with 2) and by a competition assay (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (not shown). Subcellular compartments were isolated by differential centrifugation and characterized by determination of cell compartment-specific enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and α-mannosidase, and by sucrose content (data not shown) as described (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Antibodies to Tid, Ptc, Hh, Smo, and Hsp70 were used in the following dilutions: anti-TidB, 1:500; anti-Ptc, 1:2000; anti-PtcC, 0.3 μg/ml; anti-Smo, 1:100; and anti-Hsp70, 1:1000. Antibody to Hh was preadsorbed for 2 h at a dilution of 1:100 with 0.2 volume of larval tissues before application. The preadsorbed antiserum was used in a dilution of 1:1000. Secondary antibodies were applied in the concentrations recommended by the suppliers. Stripping of blots reused for control experiments was performed according to standard protocols. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen, Cloning Strategies, and DNA Analysis—To screen the Drosophila embryo yeast matchmaker library (Clontech) and to map the Tid47 domain binding to Ptc, the following recombinant expression plasmids were generated: pAS2-1-Tid98–495, pAS2-1-Tid45–426, pAS2-1-Tid45–212, pAS2-1-Tid45–161, pAS2-1-Tid359–518, pACT2-Tid206–318, and pAS2-1-Ptc1143–1286. The superior numbers in the designation of the fusion vectors indicate the amino acid residues delimiting the encoded protein fragment. The corresponding l(2)tid (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number X77822) or ptc (15Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Cell. 1989; 59: 751-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number M28999) cDNA fragments were isolated by excision or PCR amplification and cloned into the yeast vectors either directly or via intermediates using synthesized adaptors equipped with suitable restriction sites. Details of the construction of the fusion vectors will be provided on request. The expression of the bait/prey proteins was ascertained by standard immunoblot assays using antibodies specific to Tid, Ptc, and GAL4-BD. A total of 15 × 105 transformants were screened. Putative positive clones were identified by determination of β-galactosidase activity using the filter 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside assay. To verify the results, colonies identified as positive were cotransformed into the Y190 cells together with irrelevant bait-plasmids (negative controls). All fusion vectors generated were examined by restriction mapping and sequencing (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Kurzik-Dumke U. Kaymer M. Gundacker D. Debes A. Labitzke K. Gene. 1997; 200: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) across recombinant joints. Sequence analysis was performed using on-line tolls, NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.) software packages. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assay—The GST-Tid45–426 expression construct was generated by cloning the l(2)tid gene fragment encoding amino acids 45–426 (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number X77822) into pGEX5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The C terminus of Ptc was expressed using the pQEHis6-Ptc1143–1286 construct described above. Protein purification under native conditions was performed as recommended in the vector supplier's instructions. For the interaction assay, 5 μg of the GST-Tid45–426 fusion protein and an equimolar amount of GST-loaded beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 250 ng of the purified His6-Ptc1143–1286 protein in the GST-buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Both proteins were purified from bacterial lysates under native conditions. The protein complex was released from the beads using Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5%), and submitted to immunoblot. The specificity of the reaction was examined in a control experiment using the affinity-purified GST protein to pull-down Ptc. Ptc was detected with the affinity-purified anti-PtcC serum. To avoid protein degradation, all steps were performed at –4 °C. The buffers used were supplemented with the Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The Tid Proteins Are Destined for Different Cellular Compartments and Interact in Vivo with Many Molecules in a Developmental Stage-specific Manner—Sequence analysis of the putative Tid56 protein revealed that its N terminus shows features of a mitochondrial leader (2Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), thus implying mitochondrial localization of its products, as shown for the yeast homolog MDJ1 (24Rowley N. Prip-Buss C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The identification of the Tid56 precursor and the two mitochondrial proteins Tid50 and Tid40 confirmed this prediction (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To get an insight into the developmental role of the Tid molecules, we searched for their physiological ligands. Using the anti-Tid antibody (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), proteins that formed complexes with the Tid molecules were precipitated from various Drosophila developmental stages and investigated by immunoblot. This analysis revealed an additional Tid molecule, Tid47 (Fig. 1a) and showed that the Tid proteins do associate with a number of molecules in a developmental stage-specific manner (Fig. 1, b and c). To determine the localization of Tid47, we investigated subcellular compartments isolated from the embryonic S2 cells by differential centrifugation (results not shown) and fractionation on continuous sucrose gradient (3Kurzik-Dumke U. Debes A. Kaymer M. Dienes P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, Tid47, unlike the mitochondrial proteins Tid50 and Tid40, was localized in the cytosol. Because extensive screening of cDNA libraries to isolate a putative cDNA without the mitochondrial leader failed, the question of how Tid47 avoids being imported into mitochondria, or how it can exit from mitochondria and arrive at its destination, has to be answered. Recently published data on the cellular localization of the murine homologs of the Drosophila Tid proteins have shown that, depending on the particular cell type, mTid molecules may be localized to the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus, although the corresponding cDNAs carry putative mitochondrial leader sequences (25Trentin G.A. Yin X. Tahir S. Lhoták S. Farhang-Fallah J. Li Y. Rozakis-Adcock M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13087-13095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The question of how the products of a single gene can be destined for more than one intracellular compartment has been addressed only briefly (26Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 194: 133-191Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The finding that mitochondrial proteins may perform extramitochondrial functions was first suggested by the actions of mitochondrial chaperones, which have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and antigen presentation (27Fisch P. Malkovsky M. Kovats S. Sturm E. Braakman E. Klein B.S. Voss S.D. Morrissey L.W. DeMars R. Welch W.J. Bolhuis R.L.H Sondel P.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the dual targeting of certain mitochondrially encoded proteins have also been reported (27Fisch P. Malkovsky M. Kovats S. Sturm E. Braakman E. Klein B.S. Voss S.D. Morrissey L.W. DeMars R. Welch W.J. Bolhuis R.L.H Sondel P.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the synthesis, processing, and intracellular trafficking of the Tid proteins remains to be investigated. Identification of Ptc as Tid47 Ligand—The various destinations of the Tid proteins expressed at different levels during the life cycle and interacting with many molecules suggest that they participate in different cellular processes and are regulated in a complex tissue-specific manner. To elucidate these processes, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay (Clontech) to isolate the physiological ligands of the Tid molecules. Six bait constructs, pAS2-1-Tid45–426, pAS2-1-Tid45–212, pAS2-1-Tid45–161, pAS2-1-Tid98–495, pAS2-1-Tid359–518, and pACT2-Tid206–318 were generated (Fig. 2a, constructs 1–6) to screen a Drosophila embryo yeast matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech). The expression capacity of the bait proteins (Fig. 2a) has been examined by immunoblot prior to use for library screening (not shown). A total of 15 × 105 yeast transformants were screened. Several potential interacting cDNA clones were isolated. One of the candidate clones, isolated three times using the pAS2-1-Tid45–426 bait (Fig. 2a, construct 1) and confirmed as positive by negative and positive control experiments, was found to encode residues 1143–1286 of the cytosolic C-terminal part of the Ptc receptor (15Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Cell. 1989; 59: 751-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), originally identified as required for proper patterning of the Drosophila embryo (16Nüsslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Kluding H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1984; 193: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Mapping the Tid47 Domain Responsible for Interaction with Ptc—Studies from bacteria and yeast indicate that the J-domain of DnaJ proteins interacts directly with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and thereby concomitantly modulates Hsp70 conformational states (5Zuber U. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Bukkau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1998: 241-271Google Scholar, 28Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This function is evolutionarily conserved. The J-domain of the E. coli DnaJ cochaperone can be functionally substituted by its counterpart of SV40, and human polyoma viruses JC and BK (29Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of the polyomavirus family the N-terminal T/t common exon of the T antigens turned out to be a J-domain. It has been shown to participate in molecular pathways related to cell cycle oncosuppressive activities of p53 and pRB-related proteins (30May E. Breugnot C. Duthu A. May P. Virology. 1992; 180: 285-293Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the viral J-domain seems to play a critical role in cell immortalization, transformation, DNA replication, protein stability, and viral morphogenesis (30May E. Breugnot C. Duthu A. May P. Virology. 1992; 180: 285-293Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The association of the SV40 J-domain with Hsp70 proteins from rat, monkey, and human cells has been documented (30May E. Breugnot C. Duthu A. May P. Virology. 1992; 180: 285-293Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). With regard to the other structural elements of the DnaJ prot"
https://openalex.org/W1991959430,"Human FcαRI (CD89) is the receptor specific for IgA, an immunoglobulin that is abundant in mucosa and is also found in high concentrations in serum. Although FcαRI is an immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcR), it differs in many ways from FcRs for other immunoglobulin classes. The genes of most FcRs are located on chromosome 1 at 1q21–23, whereas FcαRI is on chromosome 19, at 19q13.4, a region called the leukocyte receptor complex, because it is clustered with several leukocyte receptor families including killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) and leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LIRs). The amino acid sequence of FcαRI shares only 20% homology with other FcRs but it has around 35% homology with its neighboring LIRs and KIRs. In this work, we analyzed the crystal structure of the ectodomain of FcαRI and examined structure similarities between FcαRI and KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2 and LIR-1. Our data show that FcαRI, KIRs, and LIRs share a common hydrophobic core in their interdomain interface, and FcαRI is evolutionally closer to LIR than KIR.

In humans, IgA is the most abundant immunoglobulin in secretions, and it constitutes about 20% of the immunoglobulin pool in serum (1Monteiro R.C. van De Winkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 2Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Since its turnover rate is faster than other immunoglobulins, the daily production of IgA exceeds all other immunoglobulins combined (3Galla J.H. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 377-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, IgA should to play important roles in immune defense against invaded pathogens. Five types of IgA receptors have been recognized so far. They are FcαRI (CD89), the polymeric Ig receptor, Fcα/μR, the transferrin receptor, and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (1Monteiro R.C. van De Winkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Among them, FcαRI is the only one that specifically binds IgA. On ligation of IgA complexed with antigens, FcαRI is able to mediate various cellular responses including phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, oxidative bursts, and release of inflammatory mediators (1Monteiro R.C. van De Winkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). FcαRI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains an extracellular region of 206 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 19 amino acids and a cytoplasmic region of 41 amino acids (4Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of FcαRI consists of two Ig-like domains, EC1 and EC2, and six potential sites for N-glycosylation. The receptor binds IgA1 and IgA2 with an equal affinity (5Mazengera R.L. Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A number of residues including Tyr35, Arg52, Tyr81, Arg82, Ile83, Gly84, His85, and Tyr86 on FcαRI are potentially involved in IgA binding (6Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M.

In this paper, we report our analysis of the crystal structure of the ectodomain of FcαRI expressed in Escherichia coli and its comparison with FcRs, LIR, and KIR. Protein Expression and Purification—The construction and expression of the extracellular ligand binding domain of a human FcαRI will be described in detail elsewhere. 2M. Yang, G. Xu, L. Sun, N. Shi, W. Zeng, W. Zhang, and Z. Rao, unpublished data. Briefly, residues 1–207 of the mature sequence were subcloned into a Novagen pET-28a vector using the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites and an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. Two additional amino acids (Met-Ala) were added to the 5′ end of the gene, and a histidine tag (His6) was added to the 3′ end to facilitate the expression and purification. The protein was first expressed in an inclusion body form and then reconstituted in vitro. The isolation of the inclusion bodies was started with an intense combined lysozyme/sonification procedure to open virtually all cells. Subsequent washing steps with Triton X-100 and NaCl yielded a product with a purity of >80% as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in a buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 2 h to unfold completely the misfolded protein of inclusion bodies. Refolding was achieved by dilution of the guanidine-dissolved inclusion bodies dropwise with stirring into the refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 1.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 8.5) at 4 °C. The mixture was stirred for 2–3 days, and then the renatured FcαRI was applied to a Q-Sepharose high performance ion-exchange column and further purified on a Superdex-75 column. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The FcαRI crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop method. The crystals were grown from a buffer of 11.4% polyethylene glycol-8000 in 100 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 8% (v/v) ethanol glycol, 3% (v/v) Me2SO, and 50 mm MgCl2 as an additive, and protein concentration of ∼12 mg/ml. The Se-Met derivative crystal was grown from the same conditions. The Se-Met derivative data were collected at the Spring8 beamline BL41XU under 100 K at wavelengths 0.9798 Å, 0.9800, and 0.9000 Å and processed using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. Part A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group C2221 with the unit cell dimensions of a = 59.0, b = 69.5, c = 106.4 Å and one molecule in each asymmetric unit. The SOLVE program (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallgr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to locate Se sites and to calculate initial phases. Following density modification by RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the resultant electron density map was of sufficient quality that the entire model except for one flexible loop and several residues at the termini could be built. The initial chain tracing and all subsequent model building were done using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The model was initially refined as a rigid body with data 8.0–4.0 Å resolution. The resolution was extended gradually, and subsequent refinement used protocols including anisotropic temperature factor refinement, energy minimization, and slow cool simulated annealing. Several rounds of manual refitting using omit maps permitted the missing loop regions to be traced and side chains built. 68 water molecules were built into the electron density when a F o – F c map, contoured at 3.5σ, coincided with well defined electron density of a 2F o – F c map contoured at 1σ. The N-terminal 2 additional residues (MA), C-terminal 15 residues (DSIHQDYTTQNLILE), and residues 56–59 (FWNE) were disordered in the crystal. The final model contained 191 residues of FcαRI and 68 solvent molecules. R cryst and R free were 0.210 and 0.239, respectively, for data in the resolution range 40.0–2.1 Å. The structure contains two cis prolines at position 154 and 161. None of the main-chain torsion angles are located in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.

Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interdomain contact residues were defined as being within 3.6 Å of the partner domain and identified using CONTACT (35Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Buried surface areas were calculated using SURFACE (35Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with a 1.4-Å probe radius. The crystal structure of the extracellular region of FcαRI consists of two Ig-like domains, EC1 (residues Gln1 to Gly100) and EC2 (residues Pro105 to His199) (Fig. 1a). EC1 and EC2 obey the typical heart-shaped arrangement, and a short linker (Leu101 to Lys104) connects them together. Both domains are primarily composed of β-structure arranged into two antiparallel β sheets with a KIR-like folding topology. The sheets are closely packed against each other with the conserved disulfide bridge connecting the strands B and F on the opposing sheets. Three 310 helices are found in N termini of EC1 (Glu2 to Asp4), EF loops of EC1 (Ala71, Asn72, and Lys73) and EC2 (Leu164, Asn165, and Val166), respectively. In the EC1 domain, four anti-parallel β-strands (A, B, E, D) oppose a sheet of five β-strands (C′,C,F,G,A′) (Fig. 1b). There is a β-bulge (Ser91 to Thr93) in the G strand of EC1 splitting the strand into two short β-strands. The EC2 domain is built up from eight β-strands arranged such that three stands (A, B, E) form one β-sheet and five strands (C′, C, F, G, A′) form a second β-sheet. EC2 does not have a strand in the corresponding position to strand D of EC1. Three residues (Tyr181, Leu182, and Trp183) on EC2 F-G loop stick out. Two of them (Tyr181 and Trp183) form hydrogen bonds with Val98 on EC1 and the OH group of the side chain of Tyr181 forms another hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu95. Furthermore, Trp183 forms hydrogen bonds with Gly100 on the end of EC1 and Leu101 on the linker. The interdomain angle of EC1 and EC2 is calculated to be 85°. The bent shape of the FcαRI produces a large interface between the D1D2 domains that buries 1134 Å2 of the accessible surface area (Fig. 1c). Most of the residues involved in the EC1 and EC2 interdomain interaction are hydrophobic, including Val17 on EC1 A' strand, Ala74 and Gly75 on EC1 E-F loop, Val97, Val98, Thr99, and Gly100 on EC1 G strand, Leu101 and Tyr102 on the linker strand and Tyr173 on EC2 F strand, Tyr181 and Trp183 on the EC2 F-G loop. The hydrophobic core formed by interactions between these residues stabilizes the interdomain angle. Five of them, namely Val17, Tyr97, Tyr173, Tyr181, and Trp183, are most likely to be important for the conformation. Hydrogen bonds are also found in the hinge region providing additional stability to the hinge angle. These hydrogen bonds (Glu95 Oϵ-Tyr181 OH, Val98 N-Tyr181 O, Val98 O-Trp183 N, Gly100 N-Trp183 O) mainly involve main-chain atoms and are therefore independent of sequence variation. As FcαRI shows a relatively high degree of homology to the D1 and D2 domains of KIR and LIR, the Cα atoms of these three receptors were superimposed to analyze their structural similarities. As shown in Fig. 2a, the overall structures of the three receptors are similar especially for the EC2 and D2 domains. The major difference is found in the corresponding position of EC1 C, C′, and D strands of FcαRI. In LIR-1 D1, strands C′ and D are replaced by two 310 helices. On the other hand, the C′ strand of FcαRI is shorter than that of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2. Hence, the C-C′ loop in FcαRI EC1 forms earlier (Fig. 2b), allowing the C-C′ loop and F-G loop to adopt a clamp-like arrangement. A similar feature can also be found in many other FcRs (Fig. 2c) even though they share low degree of identity with FcαRI. The significance of this is still unknown. Although LIR-1 does not contain of C′ and D strands in the D1 domain, it more closely resembles FcαRI in the other part of the molecule compared with KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d) values for the Cα atoms are 1.44 Å for FcαRI EC1 and LIR-1 D1, 1.54 Å for FcαRI EC1 and KIR2DL2 D1 and 1.77 Å for FcαRI EC1 and KIR2DL1 D1. It seems the lack of C′ and D strands in LIR-1 D1 have little effect on its overall structure, although the sequence of C′ and D regions are variable within KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, and LIR-1 (Fig. 3). The interdomain angle of FcαRI is closer to that of LIR-1 (84 to 90°) (25Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but larger than that of KIR2DL2 (60 to 80°) (26Snyder G.A. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic core interface observed in FcαRI also exists in LIR-1 and KIR2DL2 (25Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Snyder G.A. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment shows the 12 hydrophobic residues, especially Tyr181 and Trp183, which play an important role in stabilizing the interdomain angle in FcαRI are also conserved in LIR-1 and KIRs, having only one residue (Leu101 → Ala) different for LIR-1, three residues (Val17 → Leu, Val98 → Ile, and Tyr173 → Phe) different for KIR2DL2 and four residues (Val17 → Leu, Val98 → Ile, Thr99 → Ile and Tyr173 → Phe) different for KIR2DL1. These 12 residues are also conserved in a KIR from cow, with only one residue (Tyr102 → Ser) different from FcαRI in this region (Fig. 3). Moreover, a bovine IgG2 FcR, Fcγ2R, also possesses most of these hydrophobic residues and only four residues (Val97 → Leu, Thr99 → Ala and Tyr102 → Arg and Trp183 → Leu) are different from FcαRI. This Fcγ2R has been previously found to share more similarities to FcαRI (41%) than to other types of human FcγRs (less than 28%) (27Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.A. Sopp P. Howard C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1534-1541PubMed Google Scholar), and it is located on the same chromosome as bovine KIR (28Storset A.K. Slettedal I.O. Williams J.L. Law A. Dissen E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 980-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Klungland H. Vage D.I. Lien S. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 300-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), indicating that it belongs to the bovine leukocyte receptor complex. In contrast, such a hydrophobic core does not exist in human FcRs for IgG and IgE (11Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S.

This suggests that the hydrophobic core is a common feature of receptors from the leukocyte receptor complex and FcαRI is evolutionally closer to LIR and KIR than to other human FcRs. As an immunoglobulin Fc receptor, FcαRI differs from other FcRs not only in structure but also in its ligand binding characteristics. IgG receptor FcγRIII and IgE receptor FcϵRI bind antibodies in the near hinge regions and form 1:1 complexes (8Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 9Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In contrast, FcαRI binds the CH2-CH3 interface of Fcα (10Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol.

Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has been reported that FcγRs and FcϵRI use their membrane-proximal domain and linker region to bind immunoglobulin (8Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 9Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S.

Immunol. 1998; 35: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas FcαRI uses its membrane-distal domain EC1 to bind IgA (33Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of residues have been implicated in IgA binding, including Tyr35, Arg52, Tyr81, Arg82, Ile83, Gly84, His85, and Tyr86 (6Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FcαRI shows that Tyr35 is located in the B-C loop, Arg52 is located in C′ strand, Tyr81 and Arg82 are located in F strand, and the remainder are in the F-G loop. All these residues lie on the receptor surface except Tyr81, which is buried inside the receptor and is unlikely to be involved directly in IgA binding (Fig. 4). FcαRI has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn44, Asn58, Asn120, Asn156, Asn165, and Asn177). Unglycosylated FcαRI has a molecular mass of 30 kDa. When expressed in vivo, its molecular mass is increased to 50–100 kDa due to different degrees of glycosylation (1Monteiro R.C. van De Winkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Although the effect of glycosylation still needs to be elucidated, carbohydrates seem to play an important role in IgA binding since desialylated FcαRI binds five times more strongly to IgA (1Monteiro R.C. van De Winkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the position of potential N-linked glycosylation site at Asn44, which is close to the docking sites of IgA. In conclusion, the crystal structure and sequence alignment show that FcαRI is a member of the leukocyte receptor complex and evolutionally closer to LIR than KIR. All members of this complex found so far share a common hydrophobic core structure. The crystal structure also locates the residues that are involved in FcαRI binding to IgA.

At concentrations of 0.1–1 micromolar found normally in plasma and other extracellular fluids, S1P and LPA evoke cellular proliferation and diverse other functional responses through at least eight members of a family of homologous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (3Goetzl E.J.

Originally termed endothelial differentiation gene-encoded or Edg receptors (Rs), those specific for S1P now are officially re-named S1P1 (Edg-1), S1P2 (Edg-5), S1P3 (Edg-3), S1P4 (Edg-6), and S1P5 (Edg-8), and those for LPA are LPA1 (Edg-2), LPA2 (Edg-4), and LPA3 (Edg-7). Stimulated mononuclear phagocytes and platelets are the predominant sources of S1P and LPA in the immune system. Blood and lymphoid tissue CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, and mononuclear phagocytes all express S1P and LPA GPCRs, in cell type-specific patterns, which are regulated distinctively by their respective ligands and by cellular immune activation (5Goetzl E.J.

S1P is chemotactic for T cells at 0.001–0.1 μm, enhances chemotactic responses to chemokines at 0.01–0.1 μm, and suppresses T cell chemotaxis to numerous stimuli at 0.3–3 μm. As T cell antigen receptor-dependent activation of T cells suppresses expression of S1P GPCRs and functional responses to S1P in parallel, the S1P-S1P1 R axis is considered most important in controlling recruitment and stimulation of naïve and memory T cells by setting their response threshold to other stimuli.One unanswered critical question about S1P1 Rs of T cells and other types of cells is how they are maintained at a level of full functional expression in tissues and fluids where there are completely saturating micromolar concentrations of S1P. Epitope-tagged or fluorescent protein-containing recombinant S1P1 Rs introduced by transfection into several different cell lines were down-regulated by S1P through phosphorylation, internalization, and translocation to a caveolar compartment by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-dependent process (9Watterson K.R.

Rapid down-regulation and internalization, but not S1P1 R binding and signaling functions, were facilitated by N-linked glycans of S1P1 Rs (11Kohno T. Wada A. Igarashi Y.

However, recovery and stabilization of cell-surface expression of S1P1 Rs after down-regulation have not been examined previously. We now report that T cell S1P1 R recovery from S1P-induced down-regulation requires protein kinase C ϵ (PKCϵ) activity and AP-1 transcriptional complex, and involves PKCϵ-dependent late phosphorylation of the S1P1 Rs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation, Transfection, Culture, and S1P Treatment of Cells—Mouse CD4 T cells were isolated from splenocytes of 6 to 8 week-old C57BL/6 female mice at a minimum purity of 97% using metallic beads bearing anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and two cycles of magnetic retention chromatography (Miltenyi-Biotec, Auburn, CA), as described (8Graeler M.

The level of expression of S1P1 Rs was established by TaqMan real-time PCR (8Graeler M. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Suspensions of 0.5 × 106 purified CD4 T cells per ml of RPMI 1640 with 5% charcoal-adsorbed FBS were transfected with 50 μg/ml each of the c-Jun plus c-Fos antisense or corresponding sense phosphorothioated oligonucleotides (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), which had been preincubated with FuGene reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and further incubated for 16 h prior to exposure to S1P. Two-ml aliquots of some suspensions of purified CD4 T cells in RPMI 1640 with 50 μg/ml fatty acid-free BSA (FAF-BSA) (Calbiochem) and of HTC4-S1P1(HA) cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 μg/ml FAF-BSA were preincubated for up to 48 h in 6-well plates to which were added one or more biochemical inhibitors and/or 10–7m S1P at 12 h intervals or 1 h prior to assessment of S1P1 R expression, phosphorylation, or functional signaling.Quantification of Migration of Mouse CD4 T Cells—Migration of mouse purified CD4 T cells was analyzed in Transwell chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with human type IV collagen (Sigma)-coated 5-μm pore width polycarbonate filters and incubation for 4 h, as described previously (6Zheng Y.

T cell suspensions were 1 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 with 5% heated and charcoal-extracted fetal bovine serum, from which 0.1 ml portions of each were loaded into top compartments of chemotactic chambers. S1P, CCL21 (Exodus-2) and CCL5 (RANTES) (Peprotech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) in 0.6 ml of the same buffer were the positive chemotactic stimuli. T cells that had migrated through the filter and into the lower compartment were counted and the chemotactic response (CT) expressed as a percentage of the total T cells initially added to the upper compartment. CT of T cells pretreated with 100 nm S1P and/or an oligonucleotide or pharmacological agent was expressed as a percentage of the concurrent CT of untreated T cells (100%). The inhibition of chemokine-evoked CT by 1 and 3 μm S1P, termed CI, was expressed as percentage inhibition and compared with percentage inhibition of control T cells not preincubated with inhibitors and/or S1P or preincubated with control compounds. The significance of differences between migration altered with S1P and/or inhibitors and control CT or CI was calculated with a paired or two-sample Student's t test.PKCϵ-Null Mice—Mice with a selective absence of PKCϵ, but normal tissue levels of other subtypes of PKC, were obtained from Dr. Robert Messing (Gallo Research Center, Emeryville, CA) (12Khasar S.G.

To determine the course of recovery and persistence of T cell functional S1P1 Rs, mouse CD4 T cells were isolated, preincubated in medium without S1P for 16 h, and then incubated for 48 h with 100 nm S1P present for the entire period or for shorter times prior to assessment of chemotaxis. In the absence of re-exposure to S1P, mean control chemotactic responses ± S.D. to 10–8m and 10–7m S1P, respectively, were 17 ± 4% and 24 ± 6% for all intervals of preincubation as a group and mean control inhibition of chemotaxis to CCL21 by 10–6m and 3 × 10–6m S1P as a group were 47 ± 14% and 53 ± 6%. A 1-h exposure, which down-regulates S1P1 Rs, significantly decreased the chemotactic response of CD4 T cells to 10–8m and 10–7m S1P and concurrently reduced suppression of CD4 T cell chemotactic responses to CCL21 by 10–6m and 3 × 10–6m S1P (Fig. 1). Similar decreases were observed for suppression of chemotactic responses to CCL5 by S1P. At 12 h and for up to 48 h of exposure to S1P, the S1P1R-mediated direct chemotactic effects and chemotactic inhibitory effects of S1P both returned to control levels similar to those for CD4 T cells not exposed to down-regulating levels of S1P.The capacity of inhibitors of potentially relevant signal transducers to prevent recovery of function of down-regulated S1P1 Rs also was assessed in chemotactic assays. After 24 h of exposure of S1P-deprived CD4 T cells to S1P, the direct chemotactic effects and inhibitory actions on chemokine-evoked chemotaxis of 10–8 and 10–6m S1P, respectively, had returned to control levels (Fig. 2A, right frame). The PKC type-specific inhibitors calphostin C and Ro318220, and the PKCϵ subtype-selective inhibitor m-PKCϵV1–2 significantly suppressed the recovery of both functions of the S1P1 Rs. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor KT5720 and the PKCα/β/γ inhibitory peptide m-PKCβC2–4 had no effect on recovery of down-regulated S1P1 Rs (Fig. 2A). In addition, neither calphostin C nor m-PKCϵV1–2 altered the S1P-elicited down-regulation of functional S1P1 Rs after 1 h of exposure of CD4 T cells to S1P (Fig. 2A, left frame). To confirm involvement of PKCϵ in the recovery of down-regulated S1P1 Rs, similar studies were conducted with CD4 T cells from selective PKCϵ-null mice. The patterns of down-regulation of functional S1P1 Rs by a 1-h exposure to 100 nm S1P, reflected in reduced direct chemotactic responses and suppressed inhibition of chemotaxis to CCL21 relative to controls not preincubated with S1P, were identical in wild-type and PKCϵ-null mice (Fig. 2B, left two sets). In contrast, only the wild-type CD4 T cells had recovered S1P1 R-mediated chemotactic and chemotactic inhibitory responses after 24 h of exposure to S1P (Fig. 2B, first of right two sets). PKCϵ-null mouse-derived CD4 T cells continued to show impaired direct chemotactic responses to S1P without suppression by S1P of CCL21-evoked chemotaxis after 24 h (Fig. 2B, second of right two sets), which was a pattern indistinguishable from that observed after 1 h (Fig. 2B, second of left two sets).Fig. 2PKCϵ dependence of recovery of effects of S1P1 (Edg-1) GPCRs on CD4 T cell migration.

The range for chemotaxis to 200 nm CCL21 was 34–41% for 1 and 24 h preincubation without S1P, which represents 0% inhibition on the right ordinate for the one or two right-hand bars in each set. Control values for inhibition of chemotaxis to 200 nm CCL21 (right-hand ordinate) were 43–58% at 1 and 24 h for 10–6m S1P and 47–62% for 3 × 10–6m S1P in the T cell compartment.

Two approaches were used to examine independently the course and PKCϵ dependence of activation of AP-1 by S1P and the involvement of components of AP-1 in recovery of down-regulated functional S1P1 Rs of CD4 T cells. First, the characteristics of S1P activation of c-Fos and c-Jun/JunD in CD4 T cells were investigated, as some growth effects of S1P involve engagement of the c-Fos promoter. S1P increased the nuclear contents of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun/JunD by 1 h, and the levels were sustained for up to 24 h in the continued presence of a plasma concentration of 100 nm S1P (Fig. 3A). These increases were blocked significantly by the type-specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C and the PKCϵ-selective inhibitor m-PKCϵV1–2 at 24 h, but not at 1 h, and not at either time point by the PKCα/β/γ inhibitory peptide m-PKCβC2–4 (Fig. 3A) (14Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, the involvement of AP-1 components in recovery of chemotactic signaling by down-regulated S1P1 Rs of CD4 T cells was demonstrated by introducing c-Fos plus c-Jun antisense oligonucleotides into CD4 T cells, in amounts proven to decrease AP-1 sufficiently for functional alterations (15Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A. Tashima M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol.

Suppression of both direct chemotactic effects of 10–7m S1P and of the inhibition by 10–6m S1P of CCL21-induced chemotaxis by 1 h of prior reexposure to S1P was not affected by the mixture of AP-1 antisense oligonucleotides nor the corresponding sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3B, left-hand set). In contrast, recovery of both chemotactic stimulation by S1P and S1P inhibition of chemokine-elicited chemotaxis after 24 h was prevented by c-Fos plus c-Jun antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3B, set furthest to the right), whereas timely recovery was complete for CD4 T cells pretreated only with corresponding sense oligonucleotides. The migration response patterns were no different after 24 h than 1 h for the antisense oligonucleotide-pretreated CD4 T cells.Fig. 3PKCϵ dependence of the role of AP-1 in S1P effects on CD4 T cell migration.

The range of control values without S1P pretreatment for inhibition of chemotaxis to 200 nm CCL21 was 37–45% and 39–44% for sense- and antisense-treated sets, respectively, with 10–6m S1P in the T cell compartment (right-hand bar and right ordinate).

Selective inhibition of PKCϵ suppressed S1P-evoked threonine phosphorylation after 24 h, but not after 1 h. Protein phosphatase inhibition enhanced threonine phosphorylation of S1P1 Rs slightly after 24 h but not after 1 h. Thus only late threonine phosphorylation of S1P1(HA) Rs appears to be PKCϵ-dependent and occurs in the same time period as reappearance of functional S1P1 Rs. The PKCϵ dependence of recovery and persistence of functional S1P1 Rs in the presence of micromolar concentrations of S1P, which fully saturate the S1P1 Rs, thus also may require S1P1 R specific phosphorylation.Fig. 4Western blot analyses of threonine phosphorylation of S1P1 (Edg-1) GPCRs in HTC4-S1P1(HA) transfectants.

Immediate down-regulation evoked by S1P depended on 12 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus, was resistant to suppression by PKC inhibitors, and was mediated in part by G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2. In contrast, elicitation of immediate down-regulation by a phorbol ester was not dependent on the carboxyl terminus and was completely suppressed by PKC inhibitors. Dissociation of early S1P-evoked down-regulation of S1P1 Rs from PKC activity was confirmed for T cells by the lack of effect of PKC inhibitors or of PKCϵ genetic deletion on down-regulation of functional S1P1 Rs (Fig. 2, A and B). Late recovery and persistence of S1P1 Rs down-regulated by S1P were shown to depend on PKCϵ by the suppressive effects of selective and broadly specific PKC inhibitors, PKCϵ gene deletion, and antisense inhibition of portions of the S1P1-coupled signaling pathways (Figs. 2, 3, 4).Coupling of expression of S1P1 Rs to the activation of PKCϵ was considered because of the known capacity of PKCϵ to recruit components of the AP-1 transcription complex, which are implicated in S1P signaling (13Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These observations have been extended to the demonstration of involvement of PKCϵ-evoked AP-1 in late-phase recovery of down-regulated S1P1 Rs (Fig. 3). A sustained rise in expression of the c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun/JunD components of AP-1 resulted in peak levels for all at 24 h after S1P stimulation (Fig. 3). Antisense suppression of these same components of AP-1 blocked PKCϵ-dependent late recovery of S1P1 Rs from down-regulation by S1P, without altering PKCϵ-independent S1P induction of early down-regulation. Although the site(s) of S1P-evoked and PKCϵ-dependent phosphorylation of S1P1 Rs have not been established, threonine (Fig. 4), and presumably serine, are preferred phosphorylation targets consistent with the specificity of PKC. That PKCϵ-dependent phosphorylation of Edg-1, recruitment of AP-1 components, and recovery of down-regulated Edg-1 receptors follow a similar late time course suggests mechanistic relationships. However, the precise roles and interrelationships of late phosphorylation of S1P1 Rs and AP-1 regulation of specific transcriptional events remain to be elucidated. Ongoing studies are examining effects of AP-1 antisense oligonucleotides on late phosphorylation of S1P1 receptors, distinctive characteristics of S1P1 R phosphorylation in PKCϵ-null mice, and a range of mutant Edg-1 Rs to determ"

Exaggerated levels of LIF have also been detected in the adult respiratory distress syndrome and other disorders. The biologic effects of LIF in the lung, however, have not been elucidated. To define the respiratory effects of LIF, we generated transgenic mice in which human LIF was selectively targeted to the mature lung. In these mice, transgene activation caused an impressive increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity with a significant increase in BAL and tissue B lymphocytes. LIF also conferred protection in 100% O2 where it decreased alveolar-capillary protein leak and enhanced survival. This protective effect was associated with the induction of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein. LIF transgenic mice with a null mutation in IL-6 were more sensitive to the toxic effects of 100% O2 than LIF-transgenic animals with a wild-type IL-6 locus. These studies demonstrate that LIF induces B cell hyperplasia and confers protection in hyperoxic acute lung injury. They also demonstrate that LIF induces IL-6 and that the protective effects of LIF are mediated, in part, via this inductive event.

LIF has pro- and anti-inflammatory properties (3Knight D. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 14: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It can also augment eosinophil activation, enhance epithelial phospholipase A2 production, inhibit smooth muscle hyperplasia, and enhance tachykinin production and airway smooth muscle tachykinin responses (3Knight D. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 14: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Ikezono T. Wu T. Yao X.L. Levine S. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Little else is known, however, about the effector properties of LIF in the lung. In addition, it is not known if LIF production is a feature of disease pathogenesis or an appropriate healing response elicited by lung injury (17Jorens P.G. De Jongh R. Bossaert L.L. De Backer W. Herman A.G. Pollet H. Bosmans E. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To define the in vivo effector properties of LIF in the lung, we used an externally regulatable overexpression transgenic system to inducibly express LIF in the mature murine lung. These studies demonstrate that LIF is a potent stimulator of B cell accumulation. They also demonstrate that LIF has protective effects in oxidant-induced pulmonary injury and demonstrate that these effects are mediated, at least in part, via the ability of LIF to induce IL-6 elaboration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Transgenic Mice—We used an externally regulatable, dual construct overexpression transgenic system to generate CC10-rtTA-LIF mice. The constructs used in this system have been described previously by our laboratory (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The CC10-rtTA-hGH construct contains the CC10 promoter, the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), and human growth hormone (hGH) intronic and polyadenylation sequences (Fig. 1). The rtTA is a fusion protein made up of a mutated tetracycline repressor and the herpes virus VP-16 transactivator. The tet-O-CMV-LIF-hGH construct contains a polymeric tetracycline operator (tet-O), minimal CMV promoter, human LIF cDNA, and hGH intronic and polyadenylation signals (Fig. 1). In this system, the CC10 promoter directs the expression of rtTA to the lung. In the presence of doxycycline (dox), rtTA is able to bind in trans to the tet-O, and the VP-16 transactivator activates LIF gene transcription. In the absence of dox, rtTA binding occurs at very low levels, and only low level gene transcription is noted. The preparation of the CC10-rtTA construct has been described previously (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The tet-O-CMV-LIF-hGH construct was prepared by replacing the IL-11 cDNA in the construct tet-O-CMV-hIL-11-hGH described previously by our laboratory (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the human LIF cDNA. This construct was checked for correct insert orientation by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Both constructs were purified, linearized, separated by electrophoresis through agarose, and purified as described previously (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were prepared in (CBA × C57BL/6)F2 eggs by mixing and simultaneously injecting the constructs into pronuclei as described previously (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The mice were bred for over 10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background before being used in these studies.Documentation of Transgene Status—The presence or absence of the transgenes was initially evaluated using Southern blot analysis and later by PCR. Southern analysis was performed as described previously using cDNA encoding human LIF or rtTA (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PCR for rtTA was also performed using protocols described by our laboratory (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PCR for the LIF-containing construct was undertaken using the following primers: upper primer, 5′ GGC ATC CCG CGG TTC CTC CAA GGC CCT CTG 3′; lower primer, 5′ AGC ACT GGA TCC GAC CTC CTG CTG 3′. The cycling conditions were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min, and 1 cycle at 4 °C to end. All CC10-rtTA-LIF lineage animals were evaluated for the presence of both the rtTA and LIF-containing transgenic constructs. Comparisons were undertaken of mice with both transgenic constructs (transgene (+) mice) and mice with neither construct (transgene (–) mice)Dox Water Administration—CC10-rtTA-LIF animals were maintained on normal water until 4–6 weeks of age. At that time they were randomized to receive normal water or water containing dox (0.5 mg/ml) as described previously (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Quantification of LIF Levels—Mice were killed; the trachea was isolated by blunt dissection, and small caliber tubing was inserted and secured in the airway. Two volumes of 1.0 ml of PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were then instilled and gently aspirated and pooled. Each BAL sample was centrifuged, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C until used. The levels of LIF were determined using a commercial ELISA (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer's instructions.Histologic Analysis—Animals were euthanized, a median sternotomy was performed, and right heart perfusion was accomplished with calcium and magnesium-free PBS to clear the pulmonary intravascular space. The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc, inflated to 25 cm with neutral-buffered 10% formalin, fixed overnight in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and stained. Hematoxylin and eosin, Congo red, Mallory's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff with diastase, and Alcian blue stains were performed in the Research Histology Laboratory of the Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine.mRNA Analysis—mRNA levels were assessed using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as described previously by our laboratories (22Yoon H.J. Zhu Z. Gwaltney Jr., J.M. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7461-7469PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). In these experiments, total cellular RNA from lungs or a variety of other mouse tissues were obtained using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. In the RT-PCR assays, RNA samples were reverse-transcribed, and gene-specific primers were used to amplify selected regions of the LIF target moiety. To verify that equal amounts of undegraded RNA were added in each RT-PCR, β-actin was used as an internal standard. Amplified PCR products were detected using ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis, quantitated electronically, and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using the RiboQuant kit purchased from Pharmingen. These assays were performed according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.ELISA Evaluations—The levels of LIF and IL-6 protein in murine BAL were quantitated by ELISA using commercial assays (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer's instructions.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Transgenic and non-transgenic mice were treated for 2 weeks with dox or normal water as described above. The animals were then sacrificed. The pulmonary vascular tree was perfused with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (pH 7.4) via a right heart catheter, and lung lymphocytes were prepared using collagenase III digestion, mechanical tissue disruption, and Ficoll density centrifugation. The resulting cells were prepared for three-color staining by incubating with phycoerythin-labeled anti-mouse CD3, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD8, CyChrome-labeled anti-CD4, and FITC-conjugated anti-B220 (Pharmingen) for 1 h on ice. Analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data are displayed as dot plots of FITC (x axis) versus phycoerythin- or CyChrome (y axis) fluorescence (log scales). Quadrant markers were positioned to include ≥99% of control Ig-stained cells in the left lower quadrant.Exposure to 100% O 2 —Mice were exposed to 100% oxygen in a 50 × 30 × 30-cm airtight chamber as described previously (24Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Einarsson O. Du Y. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Waxman A.B. Einarsson O. Seres T. Knickelbein R.G. Warshaw J.B. Johnston R. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1970-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fractional inspired O2 concentration in the chamber was monitored with an in-line oxygen analyzer (Vascular Technology, Inc., Chelmsford, MA) and maintained with a constant flow of gas (∼3 liters/min). The mice were fed food and water ad libitum and kept on a 12-h dark-light cycle at sea level and at room temperature. The animals were monitored at intervals for signs of respiratory difficulty and euthanized if there were signs of respiratory distress.BAL Protein Quantitation—BAL was performed as described above, and BAL protein was assayed as an index of lung injury and capillary leak. Protein quantification was accomplished using the method of Lowry.Generation of LIF (+)/IL-6 (–/–) Mice—C57BL/6 mice with a null mutation in IL-6 (IL-6 (–/–)) and IL-6 sufficient (IL-6 (+/+)) controls were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). CC10-rtTA-LIF mice with wild-type and null IL-6 loci were generated by breeding of the CC10-rtTA-LIF mice with the IL-6 (–/–) animals. As described previously, PCR was used to define the transgenic status of all offspring, using primers that detected rtTA, the junction region of our LIF-human growth hormone construct, and IL-6.Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Data were assessed for significance using Student's t test or analysis of variance as appropriate.RESULTSGeneration of Transgenic Mice—To characterize the effects of LIF in the adult lung, we used an externally regulatable, dual construct overexpression transgenic system previously described by our laboratory (20Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu T. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The constructs required for these transgenics (Fig. 1) were prepared, purified, and simultaneously microinjected. Tail biopsies were obtained from potential founder animals; DNA was isolated, and the presence or absence of LIF and rtTA transgenic sequences was determined via PCR. Three dual positive founder animals were obtained. They were subsequently back-crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate transgene (–) and transgene (+) progeny.Regulation and Organ Specificity of LIF Production—Transgene (–) and transgene (+) mice were kept on normal water until they were 4–6 weeks of age. They were then randomized to normal water or dox water. In the absence of dox administration, BAL LIF levels ≤10 pg/ml were appreciated. Dox administration caused a significant increase in BAL LIF. This increase was noted within 48 h of dox administration, persisted for extended intervals, and returned to base line within 4 days of removing dox from the animal's drinking water. The different transgenic animals had BAL LIF levels between ∼200 and 500 pg/ml after 1–4 weeks of dox administration.To determine whether LIF was appropriately targeted to the lung, RNA was obtained from the lungs and a variety of other tissues from transgene (+) mice that had received dox water for 2 weeks. LIF mRNA was then evaluated via RT-PCR analysis. Impressive levels of LIF mRNA could be appreciated in lungs from transgene (+) mice on dox water. In contrast, transgene-induced LIF mRNA was not noted, and histologic abnormalities were not appreciated in a variety of visceral tissues from transgene (+) animals (Fig. 2 and data not shown). This demonstrates that our CC10-driven system appropriately targeted LIF to the lungs of these transgenic animals.Fig. 2Organ specificity of LIF mRNA expression. RNA was isolated from lungs and a variety of other organs from 6-week-old transgene (+) mice that received dox water for 2 weeks. The levels of mRNA encoding human LIF were evaluated by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of LIF on BAL Cellularity—Transgene (+) and transgene (–) mice were kept on normal water until they were 4–6 weeks of age. They were then placed on normal water or dox water and maintained on this regimen for an additional 1–3 months. At intervals, BAL cellularity and lung histology were evaluated. The cell recovery and cellular differentials of the BAL from transgene (–) mice on normal water and dox water and transgene (+) mice on normal water were almost identical at all time points that were evaluated (Fig. 3). In contrast, LIF induction caused an impressive increase in BAL cell recovery (Fig. 3). This increase could be appreciated after 1 month and was even more striking after 3 months of dox administration to transgene (+) mice (Fig. 3). This increase was largely the result of an increase in mononuclear cells with an increase in the percentage of BAL cells that were lymphocytes and an increase in lymphocyte and macrophage recovery (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Abnormalities in neutrophil recovery and eosinophil recovery were not noted.Fig. 3BAL cellularity of LIF transgenic mice. Transgene (+) and transgene (–) mice were randomized to normal water or dox water at 4 weeks of age and maintained on this regimen for up to 3 months. BAL cellularity was assessed after 1 and 3 months of dox administration (*, p < 0.05 versus other 4 groups).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of LIF on Lung Histology—Inflammation was not seen in the hematoxylin and eosin stains of the lungs from transgene (–) mice on normal or dox water. Similarly, inflammation was not noted in histologic sections from transgene (+) mice on normal water at all time points that were evaluated. In contrast, inflammation was noted in the lungs from transgene (+) animals. This response was made up almost entirely of lymphocytes. It was mild, occasionally nodular, and noted in peribronchiolar locations (Fig. 4). The periodic acid-Schiff with diastase stains and Alcian blue stains did not reveal mucus metaplasia or an alteration in histologically apparent mast cells. In addition, the trichrome stains and hematoxylin and eosin stains did not reveal airway wall or alveolar thickening, fibrosis, or remodeling in any of the transgenic animals (data not shown). When viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that LIF elaboration in the lung causes a lymphocytic infiltrate without mucus metaplasia, eosinophilia, or airway or alveolar remodeling.Fig. 4Histology of LIF transgenic mice. Four-week-old transgene (–) and transgene (+) mice were randomized to normal water or dox water and maintained on this regimen 3 months. Hematoxylin and eosin stains were then used to evaluate the histologic features of these animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of the Lymphocytic Infiltrate—Studies were next undertaken to define the lymphocytic infiltrate that was present in lungs from dox-treated transgene (+) mice. This was done by isolating the parenchymal cells from transgene (+) and transgene (–) mice that had been randomized for 3 months to normal or dox water. FACS was then used to compare the surface markers on these cells. As can be seen in Fig. 5, differences in CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells were not readily appreciated. In contrast, an impressive increase in B220+ cells was appreciated in lungs from transgene (+) mice on dox for 3 months. These studies demonstrate that the majority of the lymphocytes in the lungs from the LIF transgenic mice are B lymphocytes.Fig. 5FACS analysis of cells in LIF transgenic mice. Four-week-old transgene (–) and transgene (+) mice were randomized to normal water or dox water and maintained on this regimen for 3 months. Lung cells were then isolated, and lymphocyte populations were characterized by FACS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of LIF in Hyperoxic Acute Lung Injury (HALI)—To investigate the contribution(s) that LIF makes in ARDS, we compared the survival in 100% O2 of transgene (–) and transgene (+) mice on normal water and dox water. As can be seen in Fig. 6, transgene (–) mice on normal water and dox water died after 3–5 days of 100% O2 exposure. In contrast, transgene (+) mice on dox water manifested a markedly enhanced survival with 100% of the animals living for at least 6 days and >50% living for 8 days or more in these hyperoxic conditions (p < 0.002). Interestingly, transgene (+) mice on normal water lived for a slightly longer interval than transgene (–) mice on normal or dox water. This difference, however, was not statistically significant.Fig. 6Effects of LIF on HALI. Four-week-old transgene (–) and transgene (+) mice were normalized to normal water or dox water and maintained on this regimen for 2 weeks. They were then placed in 100% O2, and survival and alveolar-capillary protein leak were assessed at intervals thereafter. A, we compare the survival of transgene (+) mice on dox water (solid circles), transgene (+) mice on normal water (open circles), transgene (–) mice on dox water (open triangles), and transgene (–) mice on normal water (closed triangles). Each curve illustrates the survival of at least eight animals (*, p < 0.002 versus the other three groups). B, the levels of BAL protein are evaluated.

Expression of mGluR5 is developmentally regulated and undergoes dramatic changes in association with neuropathological disorders. We report the complete genomic structure of the mGluR5 gene, which is composed of 11 exons and encompasses ∼563 kbp. Three clusters of multiple transcription initiation sites located on three distinct exons (IA, IB, and II), which undergo alternative splicing, have been identified. The 5′-flanking regions of these exons were isolated and, using a luciferase reporter gene assay, shown to possess active promoter elements in SKN-MC neuroblastoma and U178-MG astroglioma cells. Promoter IA was characterized by a CpG island; promoter IB contained a TATA box, and promoter II possessed three active Oct-1-binding sites. Preferential luciferase activity was observed in SKN-MC concomitant with differential DNA binding activity to several responsive elements, including CREB, Oct-1, C/EBP, and Brn-2. Exposure to growth factors produced enhanced expression of promoters IB and II in astroglioma cells and activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that alternative 5′-splicing and usage of multiple promoters may contribute regulatory mechanisms for tissue- and context-specific expression of the mGluR5 gene.

Glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, exerts a variety of physiological roles through the activation of multiple receptor proteins (1Nakanishi S. Nakajima Y. Masu M. Ueda Y.

These have been categorized into two main classes: ionotropic receptors, which are ligand-gated cation-permeable ion channels, and metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA terminal ends; RT, reverse transcription; BA, Brodmann area; ADM, astrocyte-defined medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GRM5, human mGluR5 gene; TIS, transcription initiation sites; UTR, untranslated region; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TM, transmembrane.1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA terminal ends; RT, reverse transcription; BA, Brodmann area; ADM, astrocyte-defined medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GRM5, human mGluR5 gene; TIS, transcription initiation sites; UTR, untranslated region; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TM, transmembrane. which can couple to several intracellular second messengers through heterotrimeric G-proteins. Each of these classes is comprised of several highly homologous receptors each showing a selective distribution in the brain (2Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Handb. Chem. Neuroanat. 2000; 18: 63-98Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The characteristic expression pattern of glutamate receptors raises some interesting questions regarding the regulatory sequences and molecular mechanisms that determine their cell-specific expression. This information resides in the genomic structure of each receptor gene and in the way it responds to environmental cues. Numerous studies have investigated the genomic structure and genetic regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits (3Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Borges K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas very little is known about mGluRs (4Ueda Y. Iwakabe H. Masu M. Suzuki M. Nakanishi S. J.

Transcript and protein expression of the mGluR5 subtype have been shown recently to undergo dramatic changes as a consequence of both physiological and pathological conditions. In rodents, this receptor is particularly enriched in telencephalic areas including the isocortex, hippocampus, caudate/putamen, and olfactory bulb (8Romano C. Sesma M.A. McDonald C.T. O'Malley K. Van den Pol A.N. Olney J.W. J. Comp.

Neurol. 1995; 362: 134-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). During postnatal development the expression of mGluR5 has been shown to be either up- or down-regulated depending on the brain region (9van den Pol A.N. Romano C. Ghosh P. J. Comp.

Modulation of mGluR5 mRNA expression levels in numerous rat subcortical areas has also been described after challenge with addictive or hallucinating drugs (19Abe S. Suzuki T. Ito T. Yamaguchi M.

Synapse. 2001; 41: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that transcriptional modulation of mGluR5 might be linked to drug abuse.The human mGluR5 gene (GRM5) has been mapped to chromosome 11 cytogenetic position 11q14 (22Devon R.S. Anderson S. Teague P.W. Muir W.J. Murray V. Pelosi A.J. Blackwood D.H. Porteous D.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and although a preliminary exon/intron arrangement of the GRM5 was reported (22Devon R.S. Anderson S. Teague P.W. Muir W.J. Murray V. Pelosi A.J. Blackwood D.H. Porteous D.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene were not identified. As a consequence, no evidence of the mechanism and regulation of transcription for GRM5 have yet been provided.Here we report the entire genomic structure of GRM5, and we demonstrate that its transcriptional activity is driven by at least three distinct promoters. The transcriptionally competent regions for each promoter were determined by means of a luciferase reporter gene in both neuroblastoma and astroglioma cells; the cis regulatory elements within these promoter regions were identified based on gel-shift analysis. In addition, we provide evidence that growth factor-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of mGluR5 only affects two GRM5 promoters. Hence, this study provides the basis for a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of GRM5 transcription in both neuronal and glial cells under physiological and pathological conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES5′- and 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—All oligonucleotide primers used in this work were provided by the Human Molecular Genetic Group, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, or purchased at MWG-Biotech and are listed in Table I. The transcription initiation and polyadenylation sites were determined by 5′- and 3′-RACE using human hippocampal Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech). For the 5′-cDNA RACE, two gene-specific primers (A-Rev and B-Rev), designed according to the public mGluR5 cDNA sequence I21436, were used in combination with adapter primers (AP-1 and AP-2; Clontech). PCRs were carried out for 35 cycles with a denaturing step at 94 °C (1 min), followed by annealing at 56 °C (1 min) and extension at 72 °C (1.5 min). For the 3′-cDNA RACE a similar procedure was performed using two specific gene primers (C-For and D-For) in combination with AP-1 and AP-2 adapter primers. PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and nucleotide sequence analysis of these and all other cloned DNA fragments were confirmed determining both strands by means of a dye terminator cycle sequencing ready-reaction kit (ABI Prism, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IOligonucleotide sequences and their use in experimental methodsRNase Protection Assay—RNase protection assays were conducted using the RPA III kit (Ambion). In order to identify the 5′-ends of the human mGluR5 mRNAs, two antisense riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription using T3 polymerase: probe IA, spanning both exons IA and II (from bp –335 to –1 upstream from the ATG), and probe IB, encompassing exons IB and II (from –382 to –1). The antisense probes were radiolabeled using [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity 800 Ci/mmol) and purified onto a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel and eluted at 65 °C for 2 h into the kit elution buffer (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted from human hippocampus and temporal cortex (kindly provided by Prof. G. Sperk, Department of Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Austria) with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The quality of the RNA samples was assessed by means of the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Annealing reactions (2 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled probe per reaction) were carried out in 10 μl of hybridization solution at 42 °C overnight, using 50 μg of human hippocampal or cortical total RNA, or the same amount of yeast total RNA as a negative control. The annealed products were treated with a 1:100 dilution of RNase A (2.5 units/ml)/RNase T1 (100 units/ml) mix for 30 min at 37 °C, precipitated, and resolved onto a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. RNA Century Marker Plus Template Set (Ambion) was used to generate a radiolabeled molecular weight ladder. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Sequence Analyses and Data Base Searches—Genomic sequences for the human mGluR5 gene were retrieved by BLAST 2.0 (23Altschul S.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) analysis using public cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers D28538, I21436, and I21437) and RACE-derived sequences. GRM5 genomic sequences were identified with the accession numbers NT_024168, AP000626, and AC026078. Consensus sequences for poly(A)+ signals and 3′-end cleavage were analyzed using the POLYAH software (BCM Search Launcher, Baylor College of Medicine). Sequence analyses of all PCR products were performed with the alignment program Gel Assemble-GCG Package (GCG, Wisconsin Package version 8, Genetics Corporate Group, Madison, WI) or with FASTA. Transcription factor recognition sites were searched by MatInspector TRANSFAC and TFSEARCH programs (24Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Promoter prediction analysis was carried out by means of the Promoter Prediction software by Neural Network (25Reese M.G. Eeckman F.H. Venter J.C. Doyle D.

PCRs were performed as described previously (6Corti C. Sala C.F. Yang F. Corsi M. Xuereb J.H. Ferraguti F. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis of Alternative 5′-Untranslated Exons of GRM5— Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from human caudate, hippocampus, Brodmann area 7 (BA7), BA11, BA17, cerebellar cortex, and thalamus (provided by the Cambridge Brain Bank Laboratory, University of Cambridge) by means of a Oligotex suspension (Qiagen). Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). PCRs were carried out as reported previously (6Corti C. Sala C.F. Yang F. Corsi M. Xuereb J.H. Ferraguti F. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 14: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using 1 μl of template cDNA for each brain area. When nested PCRs were carried out, 2 μl of PCR products were used as template for the successive reactions.The amplification of exon IA was obtained using the following set of primers: HR5-ExIA.AFor and HR5-Rev for first round, and HR5-ExIA.BFor and II-C.Rev for the second round. Consecutively, a nested PCR was carried out with primers HR5-ExIA.BFor and HR5-ExIA-.DRev, which span exon IA only. The amplification of exon IB was obtained from a first round of PCR using the oligonucleotide primers IB-G.For and HR5-Rev. A second set of primers was used for the nested PCR (IB-G.For and II-C.Rev) to amplify a fragment that spanned exon IB and exon II. Amplification of a fragment contained in exon II was carried out with the set of oligonucleotide primers HR5-For and HR5-Rev, which spanned the translation initiation codon. Amplification of β-actin was carried out as positive control.Northern Blot Analysis—Human brain MTN Blot II and V (Clontech), containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/line, were hybridized with a mGluR5 probe (bp 143–752) labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridizations were performed at 68 °C overnight in ExpressHyb Solution (Clontech). Washes were carried out at 50 °C following the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were then exposed to BioMax MR1 films (Kodak).Reporter Gene Constructs—Reporter gene constructs were prepared by PCR amplification, using either the PAC clone 33C21 or human caudate cDNA as templates. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on poly(A)+ RNA extracted from caudate as described above. Promoter regions were amplified and subcloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega) upstream from the firefly luciferase gene. GRM5 promoter-reporter gene plasmids used in this study were prepared as shown in Table II.Table IIGRM5-luciferase reporter gene constructsTable IIGRM5-luciferase reporter gene constructsDetection of mGluR5 in Cell Lines by RT-PCR—The human astroglioma cell lines H4, T98G, Tp265, Tp336, Tp356, Tp483, U87-MG, and U178-MG (kindly provided by Prof. V. P. Collins, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge), the human neuroblastoma cell line SKN-MC, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used to extract poly(A)+ RNA as described above. Reverse transcription was carried out using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit as described above. PCRs were then performed using the set of oligonucleotide primers (HR5-For and HR5-Rev) covering a region common to all different mGluR5 mRNA isoforms. Poly(A)+ RNA from human BA17 was used as a positive control.Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—U178-MG astroglioma cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen), and SKN-MC cells were cultured in MEM with the addition of non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C.Reporter gene constructs were transfected into U178-MG, SKN-MC, and CHO cell lines by means of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.5 × 105 U178-MG, 3 × 105 SKN-MC, and 1.5 × 105 CHO cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes and transfected the following day, using 0.8 μg of DNA and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE/well. To normalize for transfection efficiency pRL-RSV (Promega), coding for Renilla luciferase, was co-transfected in a 1:50 ratio with each reporter gene construct. Cells were incubated with the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex for 4 h, washed, and maintained in their respective medium for 48 h. The medium was then removed, and cells were lysed by application of 250 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) followed by mechanical scraping. firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). In each lysate, the activity of the firefly luciferase was normalized for that of the Renilla luciferase. Basal luciferase activity was measured in the extract of cells transfected with the pGL3-Basic (Promega). Background activity was determined in cells transfected with 0.8 μg of pGEM-4Z (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection System).The effect of growth factors on transcriptional activity of GRM5 promoters in U178-MG cells was evaluated by exposing the cells, transiently transfected with GRM5-reporter genes, to astrocyte-defined medium (ADM) containing growth factors. Twenty four hours after transfection with reporter gene constructs, the medium was removed and substituted with serum free-ADM containing the following components: Ham's F-12 medium, transferrin 50 μg/ml, d-biotin 10 ng/ml, sodium selenite 5.2 ng/ml, fibronectin 1.5 ng/ml, heparan sulfate 0.5 μg/ml, epidermal growth factor (EGF) 10 ng/ml, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 5 ng/ml, insulin 5 μg/ml. EGF and bFGF were from Invitrogen; all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cells were exposed to ADM plus growth factors for 24 h, and then the luciferase activity was assessed as described above.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (26Clarkson R.W. Heeley J.L. Chapman R. Aillet F. Hay R.T. Wyllie A. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12737-12742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were harvested from 1 × 107 cells in 20 mm Hepes, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 μg of total protein (∼2 μl) incubated with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, and 7.5 pmol of cold competitor oligonucleotide in a final volume of 25 μl for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were run on 6% bisacrylamide gels in 1× TAE, pH 7.5, at 200 V for 3 h and exposed for autoradiography. Oligonucleotide sequences are listed in Table I.RESULTSCharacterization of the Human mGluR5 Gene (GRM5)—To define the 5′ extent of the mGluR5 mRNA, 5′-RACE was performed on human hippocampal poly(A)+ RNA. Ten different populations of clones were obtained out of 120 5′-RACE clones isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing, which indicated the presence of multiple transcription initiation sites. These were found to belong to three clusters of alternative mRNA forms (Fig. 1A). One form contained a newly identified 5′-end sequence, named exon IA, consisting of 135 bp, in which three distinct transcription initiation sites (TISs) were found (Fig. 1A). BLAST analysis identified a human EST sequence (BI826234), obtained from human brain stem mRNA, containing exon IA. This sequence extends the 5′-end of exon IA by an additional 34 nucleotides, suggesting that alternative TISs might be present in other brain areas. The second mRNA form appeared to be generated from 5 distinct TISs within an exon located downstream from exon IA and named exon IB (Fig. 1A). Exon IB is separated from exon IA by an intronic sequence of 2.1 kbp in length, and it extends by 13 additional bps at the 5′-end of the mGluR5 mRNA sequence I21436. The third 5′-alternative mRNA form was found to initiate within the exon containing the codon for the initiation of translation, named exon II, and to be generated by two TISs located 22 and 90 bp downstream from the 5′-intron/exon junction (Fig. 1A). The presence of multiple transcription initiation sites in the three alternatively spliced first exons was confirmed by RNase protection assays carried out on total human RNA extracted from both hippocampus and temporal cortex (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Genomic organization of the human GRM5 gene. A, nucleotide sequence of the three alternative first exons IA, IB, and II as defined by 5′-RACE. The location of the transcription initiation sites is indicated by arrowheads. The codon for translation initiation in exon II is shown on a black background. Nucleotide residues are numbered beginning from the first transcription initiation site. B, identification of 5′-ends by RNase protection assay in 50 μg of RNA of human adult hippocampus and temporal cortex. Probe IA (lanes 1 and 2) and IB (lanes 3 and 4) both identified several transcription initiation sites in either the hippocampus (lanes 2 and 4) or temporal cortex (lanes 1 and 3). Arrowheads indicate the position of the major protected probe fragments. Lane 5 shows yeast total RNA hybridized with probe IA followed by RNase digestion. Lanes 6 and 7 show the undigested probes IA and IB, respectively. C, determination of mGluR5 polyadenylation signal. The nucleotide sequence of the3′-untranslated region is shown with the termination codon in boldface and underlined. The polyadenylation signal was determined by 3′-RACE on human hippocampal cDNA. The position of the gene-specific primers (C-For and D-For) is indicated by arrows. The polyadenylation signal is shown on a black background. Capital letters represent coding sequences. The reported sequence is numbered according to the mRNA sequence deposited in the GenBank™ with the accession number D28538. D, exon/intron arrangement of the GRM5 gene and relative sequences at the splice junctions. Splice sites (shown in boldface) conform to the gt/ag rule of canonical donor and acceptor splice sites. E, schematic diagram of GRM5 exon/intron organization. Exons are boxed, and the untranslated regions in exons IA, IB, II, and X are shaded. The seven transmembrane spanning regions (7TM) contained in exon VIII are shown as vertical stripes. The position of the translational start (ATG) and stop (TGA) codons are marked by arrows. The size of the exons and introns given in base pairs (bp) and kilobase pairs (kbp), respectively, are not drawn to scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 3′-region of the GRM5 gene was also mapped by RACE. 3′-RACE confirmed the putative polyadenylation signal AATTAAA, located 4076 bp downstream from the translation termination codon, as a transcription termination signal (Fig. 1C). BLAST analysis of human mGluR5 cDNA sequences (from both data bases and sequencing of 5′- and 3′-RACE products) with genomic sequences allowed us to assign exon/intron boundaries within the gene (Fig. 1, D–E). Northern blot analysis of different human adult brain areas, carried out under high stringency conditions, revealed a hybridization band of ∼8.5 kbp consistent with the size of mGluR5 transcripts deduced from the complete GRM5 structure reported here. High mGluR5 mRNA expression was observed in the hippocampus, amygdala, isocortex (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital pole), caudateputamen, and thalamus, whereas low expression levels were seen in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata (Fig. 2). Only a very weak signal was detected in spinal cord and corpus callosum (Fig. 2). An additional band of ∼2.5 kbp was observed in most of the brain areas analyzed, which corresponds to a novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-related gene (27Bates B. Xie Y. Taylor N. Johnson J.

The probe used for Northern hybridization was derived from a cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 143–752 of mGluR5, GenBank™ accession number D28538, common to all splice isoforms. A principal band of 8.5 kbp can be observed in all tissues analyzed, consistent with the size of mGluR5 transcripts deduced from the complete GRM5 structure. A second band of ∼2.5 kbp can be observed in most of the brain areas analyzed, which corresponds to a novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-related gene (27Bates B. Xie Y. Taylor N. Johnson J.

Nakanishi S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Comparison of the human GRM5 with that of the rat and mouse showed similar organization and a high degree of homology at the level of their exonic sequences (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in the human gene an exon corresponding to the rat and mouse exon II could not be identified. In order to recognize conserved segments, a comparison between the human (AP000626) and mouse (AC122517) genomic sequences, covering the whole 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and the first translated exon, was performed using the PipMaker Web Server (bio.cse.psu.edu). As shown in Fig. 3, regions of conserved sequences with identity above 75% are present only in correspondence of exon IA and IB and of the first translated exon. A sequence sharing 65% identity with rat exon II was found in the contig NT_033240, lying within the region spanned by the GRM5 gene. However, this sequence was found to be located within a LINE2 repetitive element. No human ESTs corresponding to this region could be retrieved by BLAST analysis. In addition, none of the clones obtained from the 5′-RACE appeared to contain this putative exon. RT-PCR analysis from several human brain areas (caudate, hippocampus, BA7, BA11, BA17, cerebellar cortex, and thalamus) also failed to identify transcripts containing a homologue sequence to rat exon II (data not shown).Fig. 3Comparison of the genomic structure of GRM5 between human and rodents (rat and mouse).

It presents a large number of pharmacological targets, including small conductance Ca2+-activated and voltage-gated K+ channels. Contrary to other toxins of the α-KTx6 family (Pi1, Pi4, Pi7, and HsTx1), MTX exhibits a unique disulfide bridge organization of the type C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C4, and C7-C8 (instead of the conventional C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8, herein referred to as Pi1-like) that does not prevent its folding along the classic α/β scaffold of scorpion toxins. Here, we developed an innovative strategy of chemical peptide synthesis to produce an MTX variant (MTXPi1) with a conventional pattern of disulfide bridging without any alteration of the toxin chemical structure. This strategy was used solely to address the impact of half-cystine pairings on MTX structural properties and pharmacology. The data indicate that MTXPi1 displays some marked changes in affinities toward the target K+ channels. Computed docking analyses using molecular models of both MTXPi1 and the various voltage-gated K+ channel subtypes (Shaker B, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3) were found to correlate with MTXPi1 pharmacology.

It is worth noting that the integrity of the α/β scaffold is maintained by the connection of the α-helix to the antiparallel β-sheet by two of the three or four disulfide bridges, depending on the scorpion toxin considered. The pharmacological profile of a particular toxin can be inferred to the spatial positioning of key amino acid residues required for ion channel recognition. The spatial positioning of those crucial residues depends on the toxin primary structure and the associated specific arrangement of half-cystine pairs (16Fajloun Z. Ferrat G. Carlier E. Fathallah M.

In the case of MTX, the disulfide bridging is normally of the uncommon C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C4, and C7-C8 type (Fig. 1A). However, MTX is able to adopt the standard C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8 arrangement (as observed in other α-KTx6 members) consecutive to selective amino acid residue substitution(s) (16Fajloun Z.

Though the substituted residues were mainly selected on the basis of a presumptive non-implication regarding ion channel recognition, one cannot rule out that they not only affect half-cystine pairings but also the spatial distribution of key toxin amino acid residues. In the present work, we examined for the first time the sole contribution of the disulfide bridge arrangement on toxin pharmacology by maintaining unchanged the MTX primary structure. The aim was to produce and characterize an MTX variant adopting conventional Pi1-like disulfide bridges, referred to as MTXPi1 (Fig. 1A). For this purpose, we developed an innovative strategy of solid-phase peptide synthesis based on a temporary chemical modification of the side chain of a trifunctional MTX amino acid residue (Tyr32) expected to guide the type of toxin half-cystine pairings (Fig. 1B). We focused on the Tyr32 residue because formation of the short Cys31-Cys34 (C7-C8) disulfide bridge (referred to as a 14-member disulfide ring) is very sensitive to local steric hindrance. Indeed, we have previously shown that replacement of the side-chain hydrogen atom of Gly33 by a larger methyl group of Ala prevents the C7-C8 connection and forces the corresponding synthetic MTX analogue ([Ala33]-MTX) to adopt the conventional Pi1-like disulfide bridge arrangement of other α-KTx6 members (18Fajloun Z. Mosbah H. Carlier E. Mansuelle P. Sandoz G. Fathallah M. di Luccio E. Devaux C. Rochat H. Darbon H. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39394-39402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This novel pattern of half-cystine pairings (C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8) comprises the reorganization of two of the four disulfide bridges (C3-C7 and C4-C8, versus C3-C4 and C7-C8). The following approach was experimentally developed to produce MTXPi1 (Fig. 1B). (i) A classic stepwise solid-phase assembly of MTX peptide chain using a combination of Fmoc chemistry and t-butyl-type side-chain protecting groups for trifunctional amino acid residues (19Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In the case of Tyr32, a more acid-resistant 2,6 dichloro-benzyl group was used to protect its phenol ring. (ii) A trifluoroacetic acid treatment to remove all t-butyl-type protecting groups and to cleave the peptide from the resin. (iii) An oxidative folding of the Tyr32-protected MTX (MTXTyr), and (iv) a final trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) treatment of the folded/oxidized MTXTyr to remove the Tyr32 side-chain protecting group, thereby generating MTXPi1 (20Tam J.P. Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5242-5251Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Using this procedure, we succeeded in the chemical production of MTXPi1 and demonstrate that its novel, but conventional, disulfide bridging is accompanied by marked differences in toxin properties. N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acids, Fmoc-amide resin, and reagents used for peptide synthesis were obtained from PerkinElmer, except N-α-Fmoc-l-Tyr(2,6 dichloro-benzyl)-OH, which was from Fluka. Solvents were analytical-grade products and purchased from SDS. Enzymes (trypsin and chymotrypsin) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The MTXPi1 variant was assembled by the solid-phase technique (19Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) using a peptide synthesizer (Model 433A; Applied Biosystems Inc.). Peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.35 milliequivalent of Fmoc-amide resin (0.66 milliequivalent of amino group/g) using 1 mm Fmoc amino acid derivatives. The side-chain protecting groups used for trifunctional residues were: trityl for Cys, Asn, and Gln; t-butyl for Ser, Tyr, Thr, and Asp; pentamethylchroman for Arg; t-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys; and 2,6 dichloro-benzyl for Tyr in position 32. The Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were coupled (20 min) as their hydroxybenzotriazole active esters in N-methylpyrrolidone (2.8-fold excess). The fully protected peptide resin (2.5 g) was treated for 2.5 h at 25 °C with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/thioanisole/ethanedithiol (73:11:11:5, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (2.5 g). Under this condition, the peptide is cleaved from the resin and all its side-chain protecting groups are removed, except the 2,6 dichloro-benzyl protecting group of Tyr32. After filtration of the mixture, the crude Tyr32-protected peptide (MTXTyr) was precipitated and washed by adding cold diethyloxide. The crude MTXTyr was pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g; 10 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The reduced MTXTyr was then dissolved at 2 mm concentration in 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, and stirred under air to allow oxidative folding (72 h, 25 °C). The folded/oxidized MTXTyr peptide was purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (PerkinElmer, C18 Aquapore ODS 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm) by means of a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0% to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 5 ml/min (λ = 230 nm). The purified oxidized MTXTyr (10 mg) was treated for 10 min at 25 °C with a 10.25-ml mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (97.5:2.5, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (1.5 g) and p-cresol (1 g). Next, the mixture was chilled on ice before addition of 1 ml of neat trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (20Tam J.P. Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5242-5251Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The new mixture was then incubated for an additional 20 min to remove the 2,6 dichloro-benzyl protecting groups from oxidized MTXTyr, thereby yielding MTXPi1. The peptide was then filtrated, precipitated, and washed as described for MTXTyr after the first trifluoroacetic acid cleavage. The homogeneity and identity of MTXPi1 was assessed by: (i) analytical C18 reversed-phase HPLC, (ii) amino acid analysis after acidolysis, (iii) Edman sequencing, (iv) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and (v) enzyme-based cleavage for half-cystine pairing determination. MTXPi1 (800 μg) was incubated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at 10% (w/w) in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 12 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide fragments were then purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Chromolith RP18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm) with a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid /0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (λ = 230 nm) and freeze-dried prior to their analyses. These peptide fragments were hydrolyzed by acidolysis (6 N HCl/phenol), b and their amino acid contents were determined (System 6300 amino acid analyzer; Beckman). The fragments were further characterized by mass spectrometry analysis (RP-DE Voyager; Perseptive Biosystems) and Edman sequencing using a gas-phase microsequencer (Applied Biosystems 470A). In standard HPLC conditions for analyzing phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acid derivatives, diPTH-cystine elutes at a retention time of 9.8 min. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-423S thermostat. A ratio of 2:20 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. CD spectra were reported as the absorption coefficient (Δϵ) per amide. The far UV CD spectra were acquired at 20 °C in H2O between 185 and 260 nm using a 0.1-cm path length cell. Data were collected twice at 0.6-nm intervals with a scan rate of 50 nm/min. As assessed by amino acid analysis, the concentration of MTXPi1, MTX, or Pi1 was 40 nm. Atomic Coordinates—Atomic coordinates of MTX was obtained from the Swiss Protein Data base (Swiss-Prot www.expasy.ch) (number 1TXM). Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling of the S5-H5-S6 portions of rat Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Drosophila Shaker B channels was achieved on the basis of the crystal structure of the KcsA channel solved at a resolution of 3.2 Å (Swiss-Prot number 1BL8). The three-dimensional structural models of these channels were generated by using KcsA as a template and with the biopolymer homology modeling software of Swiss-model/Deep view 3.7 (Swiss-Prot, Switzerland). Amino acid sequence alignments between KcsA and Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, or Shaker B channels, which were generated by using CLUSTALW (V.1.82, www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/), showed that homologies are 69.8, 70.1, 69.1, and 65.6%, respectively. To avoid steric overlaps and clashes, modeled side chains and Cα backbones of K+ channels were subjected to energy refinement (until ΔϵE < 0.05 kJ·mol–1·Å–1) using, successively, steepest-descent, conjugate gradient, and Newton Raphson algorithms, with the consistent valence force-field as implemented in the INSIGHT II Discover3 module (1998 release, Molecular Simulations Inc., ACCELRYS, San Diego, CA). Root mean square deviation values between the KcsA template Cα backbone and the modeled Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Shaker B Cα backbones were 0.48, 1.93, 0.32, and 1.68 Å, respectively. A molecular model of Pi1 was obtained on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of MTX in solution (Swiss-Prot number 1TXM) by using the homology method of Swiss-Model/Deep view 3.7. Disulfide bridges were assigned using the Biopolymer module of InsightII. Similarly, this module was used to generate the molecular model of MTXPi1. Molecular models were relaxed by 5,000 steps of 1 fs of dynamics simulation at 15 K, then minimized by energy refinement (until ΔϵE < 0.05 kJ·mol–1·Å–1) using the algorithms and force field previously described for Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Shaker B channels. Amino acid sequence alignment between Pi1 and MTX (CLUSTALW) points to 88.2% sequence homology. Root mean square deviation values between template MTX Cα backbone and the modeled Pi1 and MTXPi1 Cα backbones were 1.33 and 1.05 Å, respectively. Geometric quality of all models was evaluated using PROCHECK V3.5.4 (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 22Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Protein Docking—Molecular interaction simulations were performed using the BiGGER program (bimolecular complex generation with global evaluation and ranking) (23Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the first step, a 1-Å three-dimensional matrix composed of small cubic cells, which represents the complex shape of each molecule, was generated. The translational interaction space was searched for each relative orientation of the two molecules by systematically shifting the probe matrix (toxin) to the target matrix (ion channel). 5,000 docking solutions were selected after probe rotation of 15° relative to the target, and this surface matching was repeated until a complete non-redundant search was achieved. The algorithm used by BiGGER performs a complete and systematic search for surface complementarities (both geometry complementarities and amino acid residue pairwise affinities are considered) between two potentially interacting molecules and enables an implicit treatment of molecular flexibility. In the second step, the 5,000 putative solutions were ranked according to four different interaction terms: surface matching, side-chain contacts, electrostatic, and solvation energies combined into a global scoring function. Docking Solution Screening—The 15 best solutions were selected according to (i) the global score from BiGGER, (ii) toxin Lys residue (Lys23 for MTX and MTXPi1, or Lys24 for Pi1) and β-sheet strand orientations toward the ion channel pore, and (iii) the best orientation, considering the electrostatic properties of both the toxin and the K+ channel. The GRASP software (24Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) was used to determine these electrostatic properties (GRASP; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York). Structural Refinement of the Final Complexes—The screened docking solutions were minimized with a rigid-body method (Cα-locked) with steepest-descent algorithms using Deep-view V3.7 (until ΔϵE < 0.05 kJ·mol–1·Å–1) with a GROMOS96 force field (25Stocker U. van Gunsteren W.F. Proteins. 2000; 40: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to relieve possible steric clashes and overlaps. During structural refinement, a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was used. Docking Energy Calculations—Final docking energy of each best solution (ϵtoxin–channel–ϵtoxin+ ϵchannel)) was obtained by subtracting the sum of toxin energy alone (ϵtoxin) and ion channel energy alone (ϵchannel), after rigid body minimization (Cα–Cα distances locked) until ΔϵE < 0.05 kJ·mol–1·Å–1 (GROMOS96 force field) (25Stocker U. van Gunsteren W.F. Proteins. 2000; 40: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), from the final complex energy (ϵtoxin–channel) minimized under identical conditions. Close Interaction Analyses—Details of interactions were analyzed using the LIGPLOT program (26Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar) on each best docking solution given by the screening method. Linear Regression—Linear regression was computed using the Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 3.0cx for MacOS X; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com). The peptides were tested in vivo for toxicity by determining the LD50 after intracerebroventricular injections into 20 g of C57/BL6 mice (animal testing agreement number 006573, delivered by the Ministàre de l'Agriculture et de la Pêche). Groups of six mice per dose were injected with 5 μl of MTXPi1 solution containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared as described by Gray and Whittaker (27Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl of 0.1 nm125I-apamin were added to 400 μl of synaptosome suspension (0.4 mg protein/ml). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of one of a series of concentrations of MTXPi1 or MTXTyr or MTX (10–2m to 10–14m) in 500 μl of final volume. The incubation buffer was 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.2. The samples were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were washed three times in 1 ml of the same buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by γ counting (Packard Crystal II). The values expressed are the means of triplicate experiments ± S.D. Nonspecific binding, less than 8% of the total binding, was determined in the presence of an excess (10 nm) of unlabeled apamin. Xenopus laevis oocytes at stages V and VI were prepared for cRNA injection and electrophysiological recordings. The follicular cell layer was removed by enzymatic treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase IA (Sigma) in classic Barth's medium lacking external Ca2+. The cDNA plasmids were linearized with SmaI (Shaker B), NotI (rat Kv1.1), XbaI (rat Kv1.2), and EcoR1 (rat Kv1.3) and transcribed with either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine kit; Ambion). The cells were microinjected 1–2 days later with 50 nl of cRNA (0.1 μg/μl Shaker B, rat Kv1.1, rat Kv1.2, or rat Kv1.3 channels). To favor K+ channel expression, cells were incubated at 16 °C into a defined nutrient oocyte medium (28Eppig J.J. Dumont J.N. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) 2–6 days before current recordings. Oocyte currents were then recorded at 20 °C by standard two-microelectrode techniques using a voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500; Axon Instruments) interfaced with a 16-bit AD/DA converter (Digidata 1200A; Axon Instruments). Electrodes filled with 140 mm KCl had an electric resistance of 0.5–1 MΩ. Voltage pulses were delivered every 15 s from a holding potential of –80 mV. Current records were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter and stored on computer for subsequent analysis. The extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): 88 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 0.5 niflumic acid, 5 HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Leak and capacitive currents were subtracted on-line by a P/4 protocol. Residual capacitive artifacts were blanked for display purposes. Toxin solutions were superfused in the recording chamber at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a ValveBank4 apparatus (Automate Scientific Inc.). The results are presented as mean ± S.D. Solid-phase Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of MTX Tyr and MTX Pi1 —Stepwise assembly of MTXTyr was achieved by means of Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry (19Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). For Tyr32, we used the more acid-resistant, but TFMSA-sensitive, 2,6 dichloro-benzyl side-chain protecting group that is not"
https://openalex.org/W1966905507,"Among the picornaviridae, hepatitis A virus (HAV) is unique in that its assembly is driven by domain 2A of P1-2A, the precursor of the structural proteins (Probst, C., Jecht, M., and Gauss-Müller, V. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 4527–4531). Whereas infected individuals excrete in stool mature HAV capsids with VP1 as the major structural protein, its C-terminal extended form VP1-2A is the main component of immature procapsids produced in HAV-infected cells in culture. Obviously, a postassembly proteolytic step is required to remove the primary assembly signal 2A from VP1-2A of procapsids. Mutants of VP1-2A were expressed in COS7 cells to determine the cleavage site in VP1-2A and to test for the cleavage potential of viral and host proteinases (factor Xa and thrombin). Site-specific in vitro cleavage by factor Xa and thrombin occurred in procapsids that contained VP1-2A with engineered cognate cleavage sites for these proteinases. Interestingly, factor Xa but not thrombin liberated mature VP1 also from native procapsids in an assembly-dependent manner. The data show that domain 2A, which is required for pentamerization of its precursor polypeptides and thus for the primary step of HAV assembly, is removed from the surface of immature procapsid by a host proteinase. Moreover, our data open a novel avenue to produce homogenous HAV particles from recombinant intermediates by in vitro treatment with exogenously added proteases such as factor Xa or thrombin. Among the picornaviridae, hepatitis A virus (HAV) is unique in that its assembly is driven by domain 2A of P1-2A, the precursor of the structural proteins (Probst, C., Jecht, M., and Gauss-Müller, V. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 4527–4531). Whereas infected individuals excrete in stool mature HAV capsids with VP1 as the major structural protein, its C-terminal extended form VP1-2A is the main component of immature procapsids produced in HAV-infected cells in culture. Obviously, a postassembly proteolytic step is required to remove the primary assembly signal 2A from VP1-2A of procapsids. Mutants of VP1-2A were expressed in COS7 cells to determine the cleavage site in VP1-2A and to test for the cleavage potential of viral and host proteinases (factor Xa and thrombin). Site-specific in vitro cleavage by factor Xa and thrombin occurred in procapsids that contained VP1-2A with engineered cognate cleavage sites for these proteinases. Interestingly, factor Xa but not thrombin liberated mature VP1 also from native procapsids in an assembly-dependent manner. The data show that domain 2A, which is required for pentamerization of its precursor polypeptides and thus for the primary step of HAV assembly, is removed from the surface of immature procapsid by a host proteinase. Moreover, our data open a novel avenue to produce homogenous HAV particles from recombinant intermediates by in vitro treatment with exogenously added proteases such as factor Xa or thrombin. The mature capsid of picornaviruses has an icosahedral symmetry and contains 60 copies of the structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 that enclose the viral RNA genome. All viral structural and functional proteins are derived from a large polyprotein by proteolytic cleavage. The P1 region of the polyprotein is the precursor of the structural proteins, and the regions P2 and P3 contain polypeptides involved in the replication of the viral genome. Similar to other RNA viruses, picornaviral gene expression is mainly governed by proteolytic processing of the polyprotein. Whereas most picornaviruses use at least two proteinases for primary and secondary cleavages, HAV 1The abbreviations used are: HAV, hepatitis A virus; FXa, factor Xa; Th, thrombin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBS-Tw, PBS containing Tween 20; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. encodes only proteinase 3C, which is part of P3. Uniquely, HAV 3C catalyzes both the liberation of the precursor of the structural proteins P1-2A in a primary cleavage step as well as that of most mature viral proteins in secondary cleavages (1Probst C.

Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1993; 193: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following proteolytic release of P1-2A from the polyprotein, viral particle formation is initiated by the oligomerization of this polypeptide to pentamers, which sediment at 14 S after 3C cleavage (6Anderson D.A. Ross B.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Borovec S.V. Anderson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent assembly of 12 pentamers gives rise to procapsids, an icosahedral structure that sediments at 70 S. The formation of pentamers and procapsids is dependent on cleavage of P1-2A to produce the structural proteins VP0, VP3, and VP1-2A. For all picornaviruses, it is generally agreed that mature capsids sedimenting at 160 S are formed by the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA and cleavage of VP0 to VP2 and VP4. Cleavage of HAV VP0 during particle maturation is greatly protracted when compared with other picornaviruses, and it possibly retards the spreading of this virus in cell culture (8Bishop N.E. Anderson D.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Kusov Y. Kazachkov Y.A. Dzagurov G.K. Khozinskaya G.A. Balayan M.S. Gauss-Muller V. J. Med. Virol. 1992; 37: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Absolutely unique to HAV procapsids is the presence of VP1-2A (38 kDa), the C-terminal extended form of the structural protein VP1 that was demonstrated in viral particles produced in infected cells (6Anderson D.A. Ross B.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Borovec S.V. Anderson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bishop N.E. Anderson D.A.

For HAV, polyprotein cleavage and the initial assembly steps have been assessed in detail by genetic studies using recombinant expression systems (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol.

Clear evidence was provided that instead of P1, polypeptide P1-2A is the functional precursor of the HAV structural proteins, and only the viral proteinase 3C as part of the P3 domain is required for particle formation. It was shown that 2A as the C-terminal domain of P1-2A functions as the assembly signal for pentamer formation, whereas VP4 as its N-terminal domain is crucial for the assembly of 12 pentamers into the icosahedral capsid structure (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). During the assembly of the HAV precursor polypeptide and their subsequent proteolytic cleavage by the viral proteinase 3C, a conformational change occurs that is accompanied by the formation of the neutralizing epitope and that can be determined immunologically with a monoclonal antibody (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Anderson D.A. Ross B.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas 2A is a crucial prerequisite for the first step of HAV particle assembly, its absence in fecally excreted particles suggests that its release may affect capsid maturation and/or export from the infected cells. In fact, nothing is known about the route by which HAV particles are released from cells during its non-lytic and persistent replication. Conflicting evidence has been put forward on the type of proteinase(s) that may catalyze the release of 2A from its precursors VP1-2A or P1-2A. From recombinant studies with mutated 3C and P1-2A substrates, it was concluded that HAV 3C does not liberate 2A (14Graff J. Richards O.C. Swiderek K.M. Davis M.T. Rusnak F. Harmon S.A. Jia X.Y. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Martin A. Benichou D. Chao S.F. Cohen L.M. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6220-6227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar experimental approach, yet with a high level expression system, we have shown that coexpression of P1-2A and VP1-2A with 3C-containing polypeptides yielded both VP1-2A and VP1 (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, electrophoretic analyses of various truncated forms of recombinant VP1 suggested that the C-terminal amino acid of VP1 might be the glutamine residue at position 273 of VP1-2A (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dotzauer A. Vallbracht A. Keil G.M. Virology. 1995; 213: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This circumstantial evidence was questioned when C-terminal amino acid sequence analyses of VP1 from purified HAV particles showed heterogeneous termini with threonine, glutamine, and serine at positions 272–274, respectively (14Graff J. Richards O.C. Swiderek K.M. Davis M.T. Rusnak F. Harmon S.A. Jia X.Y. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As these residues are not part of the generally accepted consensus sequence of HAV 3C substrates, the authors concluded that a host proteinase mediates the liberation of the VP1 C terminus. To resolve these discrepancies and to directly test host proteinases for their ability to release 2A from HAV procapsids, particle formation and cleavage was studied for variants of HAV P1-2A carrying mutations at the proposed C terminus of VP1. In addition, P1-2A mutants carrying the consensus cleavage sequence of either factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin near the C terminus of VP1 were tested for their ability to assemble into subviral particles. These mutants were generated with the aim to assess the accessibility of the VP1-2A cleavage site and to enable proteolytic removal of 2A by direct and 3C-independent cleavage. Since FXa and thrombin are highly specific proteinases that are produced as inactive proenzymes in the liver, they were chosen as molecular tools for proteolytic cleavage. We show that FXa and thrombin cleaved particulate VP1-2A that carried cognate cleavage sites near the C terminus of VP1. Cleavage mediated by these host proteinases produced polypeptides that migrated with the apparent molecular mass expected. Surprisingly, FXa but not thrombin released 2A also from the surface of native procapsids in an assembly-dependent manner. Direct evidence for 2A-dependent pentamerization of VP1-2A is presented, confirming the notion that 2A is the first assembly signal of HAV particle formation that can be removed from the surface of the particle by FXa. The data suggest that host proteinase(s) such as FXa are involved in the conversion of viral procapsids to capsids. cDNA Constructs—pET-HM-P1-2A(E-S), pET-HM-P1-2A(V-S), and pET-HM-P3 were prepared by inserting the appropriate HAV fragment derived from pEXT7-HM/HM-P1-2A(E-S), pEXT7-HM/HM-P1-2A(V-S), and pT7-HAV1, respectively (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), into pET11a (Novagen). By PCR with primers listed below, mutated fragments of 2.5 kb were created, restricted with NheI and BclI, and inserted into pET11a opened with NheI and BamHI. To construct plasmids encoding the mutated sequences shown in Fig. 1, pET-HM-P1-2A(E-S) was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: for pET-HM-P1-2A(V-T), 5′-GCT ATG TTG TCC ACT GTTACT ATG ATG AGT AGA ATT GC-3′ (sense V-T); for pET-HM-P1-(E-S)-(278), 5′-CC ATG ATG AGT AGA TAA GCT GCT GGA GAC TTG G-3′ (sense (278)); for pETHM-P1-2A(E-S)-R278M, 5′-CC ATG ATG AGT ATG ATT GCT GCT GGA GAC TTG G-3′ (sense -R278M); for pET-HM-P1-2A(E/FXa/S), 5′-GCT ATG TTG TCC ACT GAG ATT GAA GGA AGA TCC ATG ATG AGT AGA ATT GCA GC-3′ (sense E/FXa/S); for pET-HM-P1-2A(FXa/S), 5′-CCA TTA AAT TCA AAT GCT ATG ATT GAA GGA AGA TCC ATG ATG AGT AGA ATT GCA GC-3′ (sense FXa/S); for pET-HM-P1-2A(E/Th/S), 5′-GCT ATG TTG TCC ACT GAG TTG GTT CCT AGA GGA TCC ATG ATG AGT AGA ATT GCA GC-3′ (sense E/Th/S); for pET-HM-P1-2A(Th/S), 5′-CCA TTA AAT TCA AAT GCT TTG GTT CCT AGA GGA TCC ATG ATG AGT AGA ATT GCA GC-3′ (sense Th/S). Antisense primers were complementary to the listed sense primers. Underlined nucleotides differ from the template sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene) or by a modified protocol described elsewhere (17Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the mutated regions were verified by DNA sequencing. The numbers of amino acid residues 273 and 274 refer to the position of Glu and Ser in VP1-2A and correspond to positions 764 and 765 in P1-2A (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cohen L. Benichou D. Martin A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Martin A. Benichou D. Chao S.F. Cohen L.M. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6220-6227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct infectious full-length genomes carrying the insertion mutations (E/Th/S and E/FXa/S), appropriate restriction fragments were inserted into the HAV full-length cDNA pT7-18f (13Kusov Y. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 9867-9878Crossref Google Scholar). Expression and Immunological Analysis of Viral Proteins and Particles—3 × 105 COS7 cells grown overnight to ∼70% confluency in wells of 35-mm diameter were transfected with a total of 1 μg of cDNA and 9 μl of LipofectAMINE™ according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Three h after transfection, infection with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 followed for 30 min at 37 °C (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). After replacement of the medium by 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, incubation was continued for 18 h. Transfected cells were scraped off the plate in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBSTw), resulting in the total cell extract. To separate soluble 70 S procapsids from insoluble overexpressed proteins, we centrifuged the crude cell extract for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. 10 μl of the crude and the soluble extracts were mixed with 3.3 μl of NuPAGE (Invitrogen) sample buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min followed by ultrasonication. After separation on a 10% NuPAGE gel using MOPS-SDS running buffer, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose. The antisera used for the immunoblots were described elsewhere (anti-VP1, anti-VP0 (19Gauss-Muller V. Lottspeich F. Deinhardt F. Virology. 1986; 155: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), anti-2A (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-3C (20Schultheiss T. Kusov Y.Y. Gauss-Muller V. Virology. 1994; 198: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Subviral particles were detected and quantified by a particle-specific ELISA using the neutralizing monoclonal antibody K2-4F2 as capture and detection antibody (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each transfection was independently analyzed three times. For the production of complete viral particles, Huh7 cells were infected with HAV strain 18f and incubated for 20 days. Due to its protracted replication, long incubation periods are required for sufficient antigen accumulation. The virus was harvested as described above for the transfected cells. Proteinase Digest—Transfected cells of 6 wells were extracted with 250 μl of PBS-Tw. The crude cell extract was clarified by centrifugation, and 30 μl of the soluble extract were digested with either 1 unit of factor Xa (Novagen) or 125 unit of thrombin (Novagen) for 16 h at 20 °C. 10 μl of the digests were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. Characterization of Subviral Particles—For rate zonal centrifugation, 1 × 107 COS7 cells grown on 175 cm2 were transfected with a total of 17.5 μg of cDNA and 157 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) in 17.5 ml of OptiMEM. Infection with vTF7-3 was performed as described above. Cells were lysed by passing the extracts in 700 μl of PBS-Tw through a 26-gauge needle. 500 μl of the soluble extract were incubated with the proteinase or its buffer. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a SW41 rotor (Beckmann Instruments) at 35,000 rpm, 4 °C for 3 h using a linear 5–30% (w/w) sucrose gradient in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3. The gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube, and the sucrose concentration of each fraction was measured with a refractometer. 50 μl of each fraction (1 ml) were diluted 1:1 with PBS-Tw and analyzed by ELISA. For immunoblot analysis of the proteins of the particles, 500 μl of each fraction were concentrated to 30 μl with Microcon YM-30 (g max 14,000) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Millipore) and adjusted to a final volume of 30 μl in 1× NuPAGE sample buffer. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C and separated on a 10% NuPAGE gel using MOPS-SDS running buffer. The subsequent immune reaction with anti-VP0, anti-VP1, and anti-2A was carried out as described above. 3C Cleavage of Assembled and Non-assembled HAV P1-2A— Due to the slow and asynchronous replication in cell culture, details of HAV protein expression and particle formation cannot be assessed in infected cells, yet both can be efficiently analyzed in a mammalian recombinant system using vaccinia virus vTF7-3. As described previously, virions, empty viral procapsids, and the viral proteinase 3C were found in the soluble extract of infected or transfected cells, and other functional proteins and uncleaved intermediate processing products were mostly insoluble (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8013-8020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jecht M. Probst C. Gauss-Muller V. Virology. 1998; 252: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we made use of these earlier observations on the solubility of correctly assembled viral proteins. By comparing the protein pattern in the soluble and insoluble cell fractions, assembled particles were distinguished from uncleaved and presumably incorrectly folded precursor polypeptides and their processing products. Conflicting evidence has been presented as to what proteinase is responsible for cleavage within the precursor polypeptide VP1-2A that is found in HAV procapsids (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Graff J. Richards O.C. Swiderek K.M. Davis M.T. Rusnak F. Harmon S.A. Jia X.Y. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J.

Vallbracht A. Keil G.M. Virology. 1995; 213: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Schultheiss T. Kusov Y.Y. Gauss-Muller V. Virology. 1994; 198: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To distinguish between VP1/2A cleavage catalyzed by a putative host or the viral proteinase, a genetic strategy was chosen, and several mutants of the proposed site (Glu-273–Ser-274 in VP1-2A) were analyzed (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P1-2A(V-S) carries a valine residue at the amino acid position 273 of VP1, whereas in P1-2A(V-T), the dipeptide sequence V-T replaces E-S at the proposed cleavage site (Fig. 1). The three P1-2A variants were transiently expressed in the presence and absence of P3 that provided the active proteinase domain 3C. As reported earlier (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), coexpression of P1-2A with P3 or 3C is a prerequisite for particle formation as shown by rate zonal centrifugation (see below). In addition, assembly of 70 S procapsids and mature virions is accompanied by the formation of the HAV neutralization epitope that is recognized by the monoclonal antibody K2-4F2. We used an ELISA with this antibody to assay for procapsids and their assembly precursors (Fig. 2B, columns above the lanes). When either P1-2A or P3 were expressed alone, no ELISA signal was detectable, proving the specificity of the assay (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). HAV particle formation was detected in the soluble fraction of cells coexpressing P3 with all P1-2A variants (Fig. 2B, columns above lanes 9–11), with P1-2A(E-S) yielding somewhat higher levels of antigenicity than the other precursor polypeptides. To assess proteolytic processing in detail, the P1-2A and P3 processing products were visualized by immunoblots. Expression and processing of P3 proteins was efficient (not shown), confirming our results obtained before (13Kusov Y. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 9867-9878Crossref Google Scholar, 21Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8013-8020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the soluble fractions and the total cell extracts were analyzed to distinguish assembled proteins from unassembled and precursor polypeptides. In the immunoblot of the total extracts of all variants coexpressed with P3, the uncleaved precursors P1-2A and VP1-2A were the predominant polypeptides besides products of various molecular mass (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). Both P1 and VP13C were also detected as products of all mutants tested, with VP13C being more efficiently liberated from P1-2A(E-S) (lane 6) than from the other variants (lanes 4 and 5). This finding confirms our earlier observation that 3C is able to liberate VP1 from P1-2A (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As VP13C found in the total extract was liberated from all variants of the precursor polypeptide, 3C processing of VP1-2A does not appear to be very sensitive to mutations at the cleavage site proposed by us earlier (10Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that either 3C does not cleave at the proposed site or that 3C cleavage within VP1-2A is less restricted in its substrate specificity. 3C cleavage at other sites in P1-2A (VP0/VP3 and VP3/VP1) was unaffected by these mutations as equal amounts of mature VP0 were liberated (not shown; see Fig. 1 for the order of viral proteins in the precursor P1-2A). When the P1-2A variants were expressed in the absence of P3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3), neither P1 nor other specific cleavage products were found in the total cell extracts, confirming our earlier observation that the viral proteinase 3C and/or its precursors are necessary to produce both VP1-2A and VP13C (1Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Muller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4527-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No proteins were detected by anti-VP1 in P3-expressing cells, proving the specificity of the antiserum (lane 7). To distinguish VP1 produced by 3C from that produced by exogenously added host proteinases (see below), this protein is now called VP13C. From these data, it is also clear that intracellular host proteinases do not directly cleave recombinant P1-2A. To test whether VP13C produced under these expression conditions was part of the HAV procapsids, the soluble fractions of the extracts were analyzed (Fig. 2B, lanes 9–11). Only tiny amounts of P1 and VP13C were detectable among the soluble products of P1-2A(E-S)+P3-expressing cells (lane 11). In contrast to the respective total extracts, no VP1 was found among the products of P1-2A(V-T) and P1-2A(V-S) (lanes 9 and 10). The presence of VP13C in the total, but not in the soluble extract, suggests that VP13C is derived from unassembled precursor proteins and does not present a component of assembled procapsids (see Fig. 5) (15Martin A. Benichou D. Chao S.F. Cohen L.M. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6220-6227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the lack of VP13C in assembled particles is due to inaccessibility of the potential cleavage site for 3C after assembly. P1-2A Cleavage by Proteinases Factor Xa (FXa) and Thrombin—To test the accessibility of the VP1-2A cleavage site to 3C or to exogenous host proteinases, further P1-2A mutants were expressed in the presence of P3. To this end, P1-2A variants were constructed that contained cleavage consensus sequences for proteinase FXa or thrombin. The consensus sequences were introduced near the site that had been proposed as C terminus of mature VP1 (14Graff J. Richards O.C. Swiderek K.M. Davis M.T. Rusnak F. Harmon S.A. Jia X.Y. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In P1-2A(FXa/S), the VP1 C-terminal amino acid residues LSTE were substituted by the FXa consensus sequence IEGR; in P1-2A(Th/S), they were replaced by the thrombin consensus sequence LVPRG (Fig. 1). In polyproteins P1-2A (E/FXa/S) and P1-2A(E/Th/S), the appropriate 4 or 5 amino acid residues, respectively, were inserted between Glu-273 and Ser-274 of VP1-2A. The insertion and substitution mutants of P1-2A were expressed in the absence or presence of P3, and the soluble cell extracts were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblot. As determined by the ELISA, HAV antigenicity was found in all soluble extracts being somewhat lower in those of cells coexpressing the mutated forms of P1-2A with P3 as compared with native P1-2A(E-S) (not shown). It is conceivable that formation of the neutralizing epitope on the surface of the procapsid is modulated by mutations near the proposed C terminus of VP1. Mutations (E/FXa/S) and (E/Th/S) were inserted into the background of an infectious HAV cDNA to test for their effect on viral infectivity. Transcripts of both cDNAs were fully infectious, and the insertions were found to be stable for at least three viral passages (data not shown). This finding suggests that small insertions at the C terminus of VP1 not only did not interfere with viral assembly but also did not abrogate other steps in the viral life cycle, such as viral entry and egress. Soluble processing products that were generated by coexpression of the mutated precursor polypeptides with P3 were identified by immunoblot (Fig. 3). 3C cleavage at the VP3/VP1 site was unaffected in all mutants as the anti-VP1 blot revealed almost equal amounts of the structural protein VP1-2A (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–5). As equal amounts of VP0 were detected (not shown), the cleavability at the VP0/VP3 site apparently was also unaffected by the mutations. Due to the additional amino acid residues, VP1-2A of the insertion mutants P1-2A(E/FXa/S) (lane 3) and P1-2A(E/Th/S) (lane 4) migrated more slowly than VP1-2A, containing amino acid substitutions (P1-2A(FXa/S) and P1-2A(Th/S) (in lanes 2 and 5, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2161667640,"We have investigated whether chemokine signaling to the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was regulated by β<sub>1</sub>-integrin-mediated adhesion in B- and T-cell lines. Activation of ERK by the chemokine SDF-1 can be regulated by adhesion to β<sub>1</sub>-integrin substrates in the T-cell lines MOLT-3, Jurkat, and H9 and in the Daudi B-cell line. In Jurkat T-cells, adhesion to the immobilized α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin ligand VCAM-1 or to the α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin ligand fibronectin regulated stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) activation of ERK. Adhesion control of SDF-1 signaling was a rapid event, occurring as early as 10 min after adhesion, and loss of signaling occurred within 10 min of deadhesion. In contrast, SDF-1 activation of the ERK kinase MEK was independent of adhesion. Partial restoration of signaling to ERK in suspension was accomplished by pretreatment with pharmacological inhibitors of serine/threonine or protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, we used a non-radioactive phosphatase assay using phosphorylated ERK as the substrate to determine relative ERK dephosphorylation in whole cell extracts. These results showed greater relative ERK dephosphorylation in extracts from Jurkat cells treated in suspension, as compared with adherent cells. Therefore, these data suggest that adhesion influences SDF-1 activation of ERK by regulating the activity of ERK phosphatases. This identifies a novel locus of adhesion regulation of the ERK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1985777182,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most valuable marker for the evaluation of prostate cancer progression. The expression of PSA is controlled by androgen receptor (AR) through its binding to androgen-response elements (AREs). Several AREs have been identified within the 5.8-kb PSA promoter. The main activity of this 5.8-kb PSA promoter resides in a 455-bp enhancer core region located about 4 kb upstream of the TATA box. Our study suggests that in addition to the four AREs identified in the PSA enhancer core, another regulatory element (GAGATA), which is located at the region designated PSA3.1, also contributes to transcriptional regulation by androgens. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that a putative transcriptional factor bound the GAGATA sequence in the PSA-producing prostate cancer cell. Further studies demonstrated that GAGATA factor preferentially bound the (G/C)(A/C/T)GATA sequence. The replacement of ATA with GGG in the GAGATA sequence completely eliminated the androgen-mediated transcriptional activity of the enhancer core. By using DNA-coupled magnetic beads and the Southwestern method, a 56–60-kDa protein was identified as the putative GAGATA binding factor. EMSA and Western blotting assay suggested that AR is not involved in androgenmediated activation through PSA3.1. Therefore, we propose that binding of the GAGATA binding factor and AR to GAGATA and AREs, respectively, of the PSA enhancer core are required for the maximum transcriptional response to androgens.

PSA is routinely used for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment responses and progression in patients with prostate cancer (3Castaldo G. Cecere G. di F.V. Prezioso D. d'Armiento M.

However, once the tumor progresses and no longer responds to endocrine therapy, the expression of PSA rebounds and becomes androgen-independent (7Sadar M.D. Hussain M. Bruchovsky N. Endocr.

The elucidation of the factors involved in the regulation of PSA expression could provide further understanding of the transition from the androgen-dependent to the androgen-independent phenotype in prostate cancer. The PSA promoter and enhancer region have been intensively investigated. The DNA sequences responsible for the regulation of PSA expression have been mapped up to 6 kb from the start site of transcription (9Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. Ehren-van Eekelen C.C.

There are several putative transcription factor binding sites in this region, such as several androgen-response elements (AREs) in the region of –170 to –156 and –4148 to –4234, and an androgen-response region in the region of –395 to –376 (11Riegman P.H.

Comparison of transgenic mouse lines carrying lacZ reporter genes, driven by either the 632-bp proximal PSA promoter or by the 6-kb PSA promoter, reveals that the latter contains most of the elements required for androgen regulation and prostate specificity of the PSA gene in vivo (9Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A.

Moreover, by comparing chromatin structures from the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line grown in the presence and absence of the synthetic androgen R1881, three R1881-induced DNase I-hypersensitive sites have been identified in the region between 4.8 and 3.8 kb upstream of the PSA promoter (9Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A.

In addition, three weak affinity AREs and several GATA consensus sequences within the enhancer core are also essential for the function of androgen-mediated PSA expression (13Huang W. Shostak Y.

In the present study, we have identified a novel cis-element, (G/C)(A/C/T)GATA, that also contributes to androgen-regulated PSA expression. We have demonstrated that this sequence is a binding site for a high affinity and specific 56–60-kDa factor with a major role in the androgen-mediated function of the PSA promoter. Plasmid Constructs—pGL3-PSAc/TATA reporter plasmid containing 440-bp PSA enhancer core and minimal TATA promoter was constructed as follows. The 440-bp PSA core was amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers at both ends, followed by cloning into PCR vector (Invitrogen). A PSA core was then subcloned into a modified pGL3-basic that contained a simple TATA box. The pSEAP-PSA reporter construct containing 540-bp PSA promoter and 1500-bp enhancer region was constructed as follows. Commercial human placental genomic DNA was used to generate the fragment containing the BglII site (+1) and the HindIII site (–539) of the human prostate-specific antigen promoter by PCR (10Schuur E.R.

This fragment was subcloned into the pSEAP2/basic (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) previously digested with BglII and HindIII to generate the pSEAP2/PSA540 construct. Subsequently, a fragment bearing the fragment of human PSA upstream sequence between positions –5322 and –3873 was amplified by PCR from human placental genomic DNA. XhoI and BglII cloning sites were introduced, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into pSEAP2/PSA540 digested with XhoI and BglII, respectively, to generate the pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer construct (Fig. 6A). The mutation plasmid was generated with a QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by the replacement of GAGATA into GAGGGG of PSA3.1 in pSEAP/PSA540/Enhancer plasmid. FLAG-tagged AR expression vector was constructed as follows. A primer encoding the FLAG peptide fused to the sequences encoding the amino-terminal 5 amino acids of AR (ACC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAC GAC AAG GCC GAA GTG CAG TTA GGG C) was used in combination with an AR carboxyl-terminal primer (TCA CTG GGT GTG GAA ATA GAT GGG) to obtain a full-length of AR cDNA with an 8-amino acid FLAG tag. The PCR product of FLAG-tagged full-length AR (f-AR) cDNA was cloned into pGEM-easyT (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-easyT-f-AR. Then f-AR was excised from pGEM-easyT-fAR by NotI digestion, blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and placed into the StuI site of pIRES-EGFP to generate pIRES-EGFP-f-AR. Linker Scanning Mutagenesis—By linker scanning analysis of the PSA core, 25 pGL3-PSAc/TATA derived mutations were generated. These plasmids carry a 17-bp replacement of the GAL4-binding site (CGG AGT ACT GTC CTC CG) within the 440-bp region. The forward primers and reverse primers composed half of the GAL4-binding site, GTCCTCCG and AGTACTCCG at the 5′-end, followed by 20 bp of PSA core fragment corresponding to the sequence flanking the mutagenized bases. PCRs were carried out on a template of 100 pg of pCL3-PSAc/TATA, by using Platinum Pfx high fidelity enzyme (Invitrogen). The PCR products were purified from 0.8% agarose gel and ligated at room temperature with a rapid ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). Clones were screened by PCR with a GAL4-binding site and Glprimer2 from the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Transfection—For the pGL3-PSAc/TATA reporter system, LNCaP cells were plated at 3.3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates for 2 days before transfection. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into cells by complexing with N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts (Roche Applied Science). Two and a half micrograms of the tested construct plasmids and 0.5 μg of the internal control cytomegalovirus/β-galactosidase plasmids were mixed with 27 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then added into a tube containing 8 μl of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts in 16 μl of HEPES with gentle mixing. DNA-lipid complexes were allowed to form for 15 min at room temperature prior to their addition to each well containing 1 ml of serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. DNA lipid-containing medium was replaced with fresh serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were collected for luciferase assay after 36–48 h of additional incubation. For the pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer reporter system, 1 × 107 LNCaP cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were collected in media containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was placed into a Gene Pulser Cuvetts (Bio-Rad) with 8 μg of the reporter construct and 1 μg of pGL3-control (Promega) as internal control and electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 210 V and 960 microfarads. Following the transfections, the cells were washed and incubated with media containing charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in the absence (blank) or presence (control) of 1 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma). Duplicates were used for each sample. After 48 h, 25 μl of the supernatant was collected for SEAP activity, and the remaining cells were used for luciferase assay. To establish f-AR overexpressing cell lines, LNCaP cells were transfected with 3 μg of pIRES2-EGFP-f-AR by electroporation as described above. Following the transfection, the cells were washed and incubated with media containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 450 μg geneticin/ml. The stable transfectant, LNCaP-f-AR, was obtained through a 4-round selection. Luciferase Assay—Cells were washed with PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (Promega), and collected. Cell debris was removed by microcentrifugation for 3 min. Twenty microliters of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and measured by a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). Each luciferase reading was normalized by the A 405 value derived from the β-galactosidase assay. Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) Assay—Twenty five microliters of supernatant were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min and cooled down at 4 °C for 5 min. This supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer and chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) for 20 min and measured by a TopCount (Packard Instrument Co.) in the chemiluminescent mode. Each chemiluminescent reading was normalized by luciferase activity derived from the pGL3-control. Cell Culture and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Nuclear extracts were prepared by high salt extraction according to standard procedures (15Abmayr S. Workman J. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 12.1-12.19Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown at ∼90% confluence were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and homogenized in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation at 2000 × g, the nuclear pellets were incubated for 30 min on ice with continuous stirring in a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture). The extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture). The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was quantified by Bradford solution (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (16Wang C. Young W.J. Chang C. Endocrine J. 2000; 12: 69-76Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 0.014 pmol of 32P-endlabeled oligonucleotide probes with or without unlabeled DNA competitors and 2 μg of poly(dI/dC) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol). Another EMSA was carried out using the same binding conditions as the ones described above, except that 10 ng of purified AR DNA binding domain-ligand binding domain (DBD-LBD) 2C. Wang, P. Jiang, J. Geng, R. Weinmann, M. R. Attar, M. Gottardis, and G. Wang, submitted for publication. instead of nuclear extracts, and 500 ng of bovine serum albumin were included in the reactions. The samples were electrophoresed on a pre-run 6% native acrylamide-bisacrylamide (28:2) gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA at 4 °C. Gel was dried and autoradiographed. The oligonucleotides used are described in Fig. 2. Preparation of DNA-coupled Magnetic Beads—Biotin-5′-GAT CAT CCT TGC AAG ATG ATA TCT CTC T-3′ was used as the oligonucleotide. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was created by annealing this oligomer with its antisense oligomer. Twenty microliters of the double-stranded oligomer (10 μm) were incubated with 0.6 mg of streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic particles (Promega) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1 m NaCl for 20 min to prepare DNA-coupled magnetic beads. Then DNA-coupled magnetic beads were washed by 500 μl of the same buffer three times. Coupling efficiency was evaluated by comparing the DNA content before and after incubation by using 1.5% agarose gel and EtBr staining. DNA Binding Assay—Before use, DNA-coupled magnetic beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). After collecting the beads with a MagneSphere Magnetic Separation Stand (Promega), supernatant was carefully removed. Binding reactions were carried out with 3 mg of LNCaP nuclear extract and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Then beads were collected with a magnet stand; unbound protein in supernatant was removed and subjected to further analysis, and beads were washed three times in 500 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Afterward, beads were collected with a magnet stand, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol to extract the proteins that bound to DNA. These bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Southwestern blotting assay. SDS-PAGE Analysis and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts (30 μg), and unbound supernatants were heated at 100 °C for 3 min in 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, and then were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. In the Western blotting assay, the proteins on the SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). Then the membrane was treated by anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). The proteins that interacted with anti-FLAG mAb were detected by using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. Southwestern Analysis—Nuclear extracts (30 μg), the unbound proteins (30 μg) in supernatant, and the bound proteins extracted from DNA-coupling magnetic beads were heated 90 °C for 3 min in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, blocked 4 h at room temperature with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 3% nonfat milk, and then incubated overnight at room temperature in 2 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol plus 107 cpm of radiolabeled PSA3.1 or PSA3.1 mutant probes. Afterward, membranes were subjected to three washes of 15 min each at room temperature in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40, prior to drying and autoradiography. Identification of a Cluster of Cis-elements Involved in the Regulation and Expression of PSA Gene—As reported previously by Huang et al. (13Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the enhancer core of the PSA promoter contains four AR-binding sites responsible for androgenmediated transcriptional activity. In order to identify new cis-elements other than the AREs that are involved in the regulation of PSA expression, linker scanning mutagenesis was performed using 25 sets of oligonucleotides in the enhancer core region (Fig. 1A). The resulting mutation enhancers were tested for activity in the transactivation assays in the absence or presence of DHT. All the mutations did not affect the basal transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Several regions were identified as essential components for the androgen-mediated transcription activity of the PSA enhancer core (Fig. 1C). L6, LO, and R5 were reported previously as weak AR-binding sites, L4 as a strong AR-binding site (13Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and L1 and L7 as GATA transcription factor-binding sites (14Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the region that extends from R1 to R3 was also identified as the essential region for androgen-mediated PSA expression (Fig. 1C). We next examined if the region extending from R1 to R3 (referred to as PSA3 in this study) could interact with AR. PSA3 was used as a probe in EMSA with Escherichia coli purified AR DBD-LBD (Fig. 2A). We then compared this site to the C3 (I) fragment, a strong ARE (17Tan J.A. Marschke K.B. Ho K.C. Perry S.T.

As Fig. 2B shows, only C3 (I) ARE and PSA1 ARE interacted with AR DBD-LBD. To elucidate further the binding affinity of proteins to these sites, we used LNCaP nuclear extracts to perform another set of EMSA in the absence or presence of competitor oligonucleotides. The results revealed the same binding pattern for C3 (I) ARE, PSA1, and PSA2 (Fig. 2C). In addition, PSA1 and PSA2 AREs can be competed by 200-fold of C3 (I) ARE and by their own sequences (Fig. 2C). However, PSA3 not only demonstrated a different binding pattern when compared with the other three oligonucleotides, it could only be competed by its own sequence (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that both PSA1 and PSA2 could interact with AR, and PSA1 ARE had a stronger binding affinity for AR than PSA2. In addition, these results suggest that a different factor could interact with PSA3. The First 24 Nucleotides of PSA3 Are Essential for Protein-DNA Interaction—To locate the interaction motif of PSA3 with an unknown binding factor(s), three oligonucleotides, PSA3.1, PSA3.2 and PSA3.3, were synthesized. PSA3.1 represented the first 24 nucleotides, PSA3.2 represented the last 24 nucleotides, and PSA3.3 represented the 13th to the 36th nucleotide (data not shown). Only PSA3.1 exhibited specific interaction in EMSAs using LNCaP nuclear extracts (data not shown). This result suggested that the interaction motif of PSA3 was located in the PSA3.1 oligonucleotide. The PSA3.1 fragment contained two putative transcription factor-binding sites. The first binding sequence, GAGAGA, a potential binding site of the GAGA factor, has been reported to be a chromatin-remodeling factor isolated from Drosophila (19Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The second binding sequence, AGATAT, is a putative binding site of the GATA transcriptional factor family (20Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 22Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Identification of the GAGATA-binding Site—To exactly locate the binding site of this unknown factor, we sequentially replaced the first 12 nucleotides of PSA3.1 with mutated sequences. Every 3 nucleotides were used as a unit to generate four PSA3.1 mutants, designated as follows: m1 (AGA to CCC), m2 (GAG to TTT), m3 (ATA to GGG), and m4 (TCA to AAA) (Fig. 3A). The interaction of WT 32P-labeled PSA3.1 with unknown factors cannot be abolished by mutating GAG to TTT (m2) and ATA to GGG (m3) in the EMSA (Fig. 3B). The conclusion is that GAGATA is the essential motif for this unknown factor to bind. We excluded the possibility that the PSA3.1 binding factor is a GAGA-binding protein, because the m1 mutant (AGA to CCC) with mutation at the center binding sequence of the GAGA-binding protein was able to compete with WT PSA3.1 oligonucleotide in the EMSA (Fig. 3B). GAGATA Is the Novel Cis-element Responsible for Binding the Transcription Factors—Comparing the PSA3.1 sequence with the consensus sequence (T/A)GATA(A/G) of GATA transcription factors (20Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 24Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) revealed that the PSA3.1 sequence lacks the A or G in the base position immediately 3′ to the GATA core. PSA3.1 contains a T at this position. Moreover, the first G nucleotide of the GAGATA sequence in PSA3.1 is not included in the consensus sequence (T/A)GATA(A/G) of GATA transcription factors. Thus, we examined if the first G nucleotide of the GAGATA sequence was required for the binding of GAGATA binding factor. The result showed that replacing the first nucleotide of the GAGATA sequence with A or T decreased the binding capacity of GAGATA binding factor to about 2 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Substituting the first nucleotide with C had a relatively low effect, losing 50% of its original binding capacity (Fig. 4A). Together the results indicate that the first nucleotide of the GAGATA sequence is essential for the binding of GAGATA binding factor. Furthermore, we analyzed the preference of the GAGATA binding factor for the second nucleotide of the GAGATA sequence. Replacing the second nucleotide of the GAGATA with G abolished the interaction between GAGATA binding factor and PSA3.1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, changing the second nucleotide of GAGATA sequence to C and T decreased the GAGATA binding factor-PSA3.1 interaction by about 30 and 37%, respectively (Fig. 4A). This result indicated that GAGATA binding factor has stronger interaction with the second nucleotide being replaced by A, C or T, G(A/C/T)GATA, whereas GATA transcription factors have stronger interaction with the first nucleotide being replaced by A or T, (T/A)GATA(A/G). These binding patterns were consistent in relative cold competition in EMSA (Fig. 4B). Together, the results suggested that GAGATA is a novel cis-element essential for the binding of the GAGATA-binding factor. EMSA was performed to determine whether the GAGATA sequence is the recognition site of a known GATA transcription factor. After examining whether the consensus sequence of GATA transcription factors could compete with the specific binding site of PSA3.1, and also if the binding pattern of the consensus sequence in GATA was identical with that of PSA3.1, our results revealed that the consensus sequence of GATA could not compete with PSA3.1 for the binding of the GAGATA factor (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the binding patterns of PSA3.1 and the binding patterns of the consensus sequence of GATA were different, and as a probe, the GATA consensus sequence failed to have any specific binding in EMSA (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the results indicated that GAGATA binding factor is a novel specific DNA-binding protein, and known GATA transcription factors are undetectable in LNCaP nuclear extracts by EMSA. Mutation of GAGATA and PSA1 ARE in the PSA Enhancer Core Completely Inhibited DHT-mediated Expression of Reporter Gene—To examine whether the binding of GAGATA factor to PSA3.1 is essential for PSA enhancer core function, we replaced the ATA sequence in PSA3.1 with GGG on the pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer plasmid (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, this mutation and PSA1 ARE mutation were compared in a transient transfection assay. The PSA1 ARE mutation has been shown to lose its androgen-mediated transcription activity (13Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As with the PSA1 ARE mutation, the substitution of ATA with GGG has completely inhibited the DHT-mediated expression of reporter gene in the presence of 1 nm DHT (Fig. 6B). This result indicated that GAGATA binding factor not only interacts physically with PSA enhancer core but also plays an essential role in DHT-mediated enhancer core function, suggesting that the AR-mediated enhancer function of the PSA promoter is not dependent on a single factor but requires the cooperation of different transcription factors. The Putative GAGATA Binding Factor Is an ∼56–60-kDa Protein—To characterize further this GAGATA binding factor, we incubated nuclear extracts of LNCaP-f-AR stable cell line with magnetic beads coupled with double-stranded biotin-PSA3.1. This immobilized DNA magnetic bead demonstrated nearly 100% binding capacity for the GAGATA binding factor (Fig. 7A). Southwestern blotting was performed to identify the proteins that specifically interact with GAGATA cis-element. Significantly, an approximate 56–60-kDa protein that bound to PSA3.1 sequence was detected in the DNA-coupling magnetic bead-bound fraction, and mutations that alternated GAGATA motif eliminated binding in Southwestern blotting analysis (Fig. 7B). The concentration of this protein in crude nuclear extracts might be too low to be detected by Southwestern blotting assay (Fig. 7B). Taken together with reporter gene assay (Fig. 6), the evidence suggested that this 56–60-kDa protein might be the GAGATA binding factor and is a positive transcription regulator of PSA expression. Moreover, the molecular mass of this GAGATA binding factor is inconsistent with known GATA transcription factors. The known molecular masses of GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, GATA-4, GATA-5, and GATA-6 are 46, 46, 50, 50, <43, and <50 kDa, respectively. This confirms that GAGATA binding factor is a novel transcription factor. AR Does Not Interact with PSA3.1—To investigate the involvement of AR interaction with PSA3.1, we performed EMSA to examine whether the antibodies against f-AR could super-shift PSA3.1-protein complex into higher position. Antibodies against f-AR efficiently abolished interaction of f-AR with ARE, suggesting that these antibodies can interact with the native form of f-AR (Fig. 8B). However, they did not supershift and did not abolish PSA3.1-DNA interaction (Fig. 8A). These results suggested that AR might not interact with PSA3.1 either directly or indirectly. To validate this conclusion further, we performed Western blotting to check whether f-AR could be pulled down by PSA3.1-coupling magnetic beads efficiently. Comparison of crude nuclear extract with the unbound supernatant indicated that most f-AR did not bind to DNA-coupled magnetic beads with GAGATA binding factor (Fig. 8C). This result was consistent with EMSA observation, suggesting that AR is not involved in androgen-mediated activation through PSA3.1. The cooperation of specific sets of transcription factors unique to each cell lineage at different stages of differentiation can achieve tissue-specific gene expression. Multiple transcription factors, some prostate-specific, might be involved in the regulation of the PSA gene. Previous studies have indicated that the 6-kb promoter region, but not the 632-bp proximal PSA promoter, is responsible for prostate-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic mice (9Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. Ehren-van Eekelen C.C. Sikes R.A. Fasciana C. Chung L.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Within this 6-kb region, a 492-bp enhancer core, –4366 to –3874, and a promoter region, –564 to +1, contribute to most of the PSA expression (9Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. Ehren-van Eekelen C.C. Sikes R.A. Fasciana C. Chung L.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A recent report (13Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggested that multiple low affinity AREs and a strong ARE in the enhancer core integrate with the high expression of AR in the prostate, contributing to the specificity and activity of PSA gene expression. In addition, six respective consensus GATA sites within this enhancer core, located on L7, L1, and R1 of the PSA enhancer core, have been proven to be essential for PSA gene expression (14Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cis-element responsible for the transcription activity of PSA enhancer core in the R1 region was GAGATA, instead of AGATAT, and the L7 region did not seem to contribute much to the PSA enhancer core activity (Fig. 1C). The L1 region consists of two perfect GATA consensus sequences (14Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), like the L4 and R1, essential for the androgen-mediated transcriptional activity of the PSA enhancer core (Fig. 1C). However, we questioned whether the known GATA transcription factors contribute to the transcriptional activity of the L1 region, because none of the known GATA transcriptional factors were detected using the known GATA consensus sequence in the nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells in EMSA (Fig. 5, A and B). More likely, the cis-elements responsible for the transcriptional activity of the L1 region might be GAAATA (antisense), rather than the initially proposed GATA consensus sequence (14Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We speculated that the GAGATA binding factors might bind to the GAAATA sequence, which is only one nucleotide different from GAGATA. These findings suggest that both the GAGATA binding factor, which binds to GAGATA or putative GAGATA binding sequence, and AR, which interacts with the high affinity ARE and low affinity ARE in PSA enhancer core, are the determining factors in androgen-regulated PSA expression in prostate tissue. Several androgen-regulated target genes have been demonstrated to undergo complicated regulation mechanisms mediated by AR alone or in combination with other transcription factors. Kasper et al. (25Kasper S. Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Sheppard P.C. Cheng H. Lin L. Shiu R.P. Snoek R. Matusik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31763-31769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that the androgen-specific regulation of probasin gene transcription requires two AR-binding sites, where the binding of AR to both sites occurs in a cooperative, mutually dependent manner. Lin et al. (26Lin C.S. Lau A. Yeh C.C. Chang C.H. Lue T.F. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the three L-plastin AREs could cooperate with each other to become a potent testosterone/AR-responsive unit, which was likely responsible for the inducibility of the L-plastin gene by testosterone. In addition, two genes have been shown to require additional DNA-binding proteins for complete regulation by androgens, the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) (27Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Ning Y.M. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and p21 (29Lu S. Jenster G. Epner D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two AML/CBFα-binding sites within the enhancer of the mouse Slp gene are necessary for the androgen-mediated activation of Slp gene. Both AML/CBFα-binding sites are proximal to the ARE in the Slp gene, and AML/CBFα can interact with AR. The binding of androgens to AR may induce a conformation change that allows AR to interact with AML/CBFα resulting in the activation of Slp gene. The study of androgen induction of p21 gene suggested that AR and Sp1 not only bind to their respective consensus sites within the p21 promoter but also complex with one another, thereby recruiting coactivators and general transcription factors, thus inducing p21 transcription. In contrast to previous studies, our results do not seem to support an interaction of AR with GAGATA binding factor, because the GAGATA binding factor-DNA complex did not shift position in the presence of a high concentration of C3 (I) ARE. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that AR interacts directly with GAGATA binding factors in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanisms by which AR and GAGATA binding factor cooperate in the androgen-mediated regulation of PSA gene expression still require further elucidation. But this cooperation seems to have neither a synergistic nor an additive effect, because the mutation of either binding site completely abolishes the transcriptional activity induced by androgens. Therefore, it is more likely that the simultaneous binding of GAGATA binding factor and AR to their respective DNA-binding sites results in the maximum effect for the recruitment of general transcriptional machinery ensuring the transcriptional response induced by androgens. The combination of different transcription factors to regulate gene expression has been widely observed in nature. In most cases, the regulatory region of genes containing different response elements requires a combination of various transcription factors to determine the expression of the genes in an efficient and specific manner (30Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In the PSA 455-bp enhancer core region, integration of different transcription factors such as GAGATA binding factors and AR might ensure the expression of PSA gene exclusively in prostate tissue. Different signal transduction pathways may also contribute to the activation of different transcriptional factors in the regulation of a specific gene expression. Whether other signal transduction pathways are involved in the activation of GAGATA binding factors still remains to be investigated. However, a previous study (31Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) has indicated that the cross-talk between AR and protein kinase A signal transduction pathways contributes to the androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression. Further cloning and study of GAGATA binding factors may allow us to explore the regulating mechanism of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PSA gene expression. In sum, our experiments show that AR and GAGATA binding factors are the most important regulators of PSA expression. Mutation of either AR or GAGATA factor binding sites almost completely abolishes androgen-mediated PSA enhancer activity. We proposed that the binding of the GAGATA binding factor and AR to their respective regulatory DNA sequences on the PSA gene is required for the maximum transcription response to androgens. Further investigation of the possible involvement of the GAGATA binding factor to the androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression is underway.

The topogenic structure common to all lysosomal enzymes essential for this recognition is still not well defined, except that lysine residues seem to play a critical role. Here we have substituted surface-located lysine residues of lysosomal arylsulfatases A and B. In lysosomal arylsulfatase A only substitution of lysine residue 457 caused a reduction of phosphorylation to 33% and increased secretion of the mutant enzyme.

Despite the high degree of structural homology between these two sulfatases substitution of lysines 497 and 507 in arylsulfatase B has no effect on the sorting and phosphorylation of this sulfatase.

Soluble lysosomal enzymes are synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; M6P, mannose-6-phosphate; ASA, arylsulfatase A; ASB, Arylsulfatase B; ASE, arylsulfatase E; ASU, sea urchin arylsulfatase; BHK, baby hamster kidney; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; M6P, mannose-6-phosphate; ASA, arylsulfatase A; ASB, Arylsulfatase B; ASE, arylsulfatase E; ASU, sea urchin arylsulfatase; BHK, baby hamster kidney; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. They are glycoproteins carrying N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. From the ER they are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they acquire mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on their high mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains. In the trans-Golgi compartment the M6P-bearing enzymes bind to M6P receptors, which mediate the vesicular transport from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes (for review see Ref. 1Kornfeld S. Melman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar).The synthesis of M6P residues on the oligosaccharide side chains is a two-step process. The initial event is the recognition of soluble lysosomal enzymes by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (briefly phosphotransferase). This enzyme transfers N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate to mannose residues of the α1,6 and α1,3 branches of the N-linked oligosaccharide side chains, creating N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phospho-6-mannose residues. Subsequently, the terminal GlcNAc residue is removed by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase generating a M6P residue on the oligosaccharide side chains (1Kornfeld S. Melman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Via these M6P residues the enzymes bind to M6P receptors, which mediate the further vesicular transport from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes.Thus, the critical step in the sorting of soluble lysosomal enzymes is the recognition by the phosphotransferase. This enzyme is able to distinguish lysosomal enzymes from secretory proteins. Various efforts have been made to define the structure of the topogenic signal of lysosomal enzymes, which is recognized by the phosphotransferase. No apparent sequence similarities where found when different lysosomal enzymes were compared, instead it was shown the topogenic signal is defined within the three-dimensional structure of soluble lysosomal enzymes (2Lang L. Reitman M.L. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial experiments with the lysosomal protease cathepsin D identified lysine 203 and amino acids 265–292 in the C-terminal lobe of the enzyme as minimal lysosomal targetting elements (3Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but other amino acids also contribute to the phosphotransferase recognition of cathepsin D (4Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the amino acids involved cover a rather large region of about 1630 Å2 on the surface of cathepsin D. Further experiments demonstrated an additional independent phosphotransferase recognition domain in the N-terminal lobe of the enzyme (5Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, however, could not confirm a phosphotransferase recognition domain in the C-terminal lobe of cathepsin D (6Schorey J.S. Fortenberry S.C. Chirgwin J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2007-20015PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, despite numerous efforts the topogenic determinants of lysosomal enzymes are still not satisfyingly defined.Lysine residues, however, seem to play a critical role in the phosphotransferase recognition of various lysosomal enzymes, like cathepsin L (7Cuozzo J.W.

Comparisons of three-dimensional structures of non-homologous cathepsins A, B, and D in combination with peptide inhibition experiments of in vitro phosphorylation indicated that a β-hairpin loop structure containing the relevant lysines may be an important common recognition determinant in the cathepsins and in β-glucuronidase (12Lukong K.E.

It is synthesized as a 64-kDa precursor, which is proteolytically processed to yield the mature 47-kDa enzyme. ASB bears five N-linked oligosaccharide side chains (17Peters C. Schmidt B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3374-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their degree of phosphorylation has not yet been determined. Chemical modification of lysine residues on ASA and ASB abolish the in vitro phosphorylation of these enzymes by the phosphotransferase completely (9Schierau A. Dietz F. Lange H. Schestag F. Parastar A. Gieselmann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3651-3658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and for ASA it was shown that large surface areas interact with the phosphotransferase (9Schierau A.

Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).ASA and ASB are highly homologous enzymes. Comparison of amino acid sequence reveals 29% identity of residues. Both enzymes also share a similar three-dimensional structure (19Lukatela G. Krauβ N. Theis K. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 20Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Both consist of a central β-pleated sheet of ten strands, which is decorated by helices on both sides. They also share an intramolecular salt bridge and a more peripheral four-stranded β-pleated sheet. Therefore, they may also share a conserved phosphotransferase recognition domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen. DNA digesting and modifying enzymes were from Invitrogen, New England BioLabs, and MBI Fermentas. [35S]Methionine (specific activity > 39 TBq/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity > 111 TBq/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Isolation of plasmids was performed with a kit from Qiagen and sequencing with a kit from ABI Biosystems, according to the protocols provided by the manufacturers.In Vitro Mutagenesis—The in vitro mutagenesis protocol was based on the pALTER-1 vector obtained from Promega. To facilitate the process of in vitro mutagenesis and expression of the mutants via transfection experiments, all elements necessary for expression of ASA cDNA were cloned into the polylinker of the pALTER plasmid. A fragment encompassing these elements was obtained from the previously described pBEH ASA expression plasmid (21Stein C. Gieselmann V. Kreysing J. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. Meyer H.E. O'Brien J.S. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Artelt P. Morelle C. Ausmeier M. Fitzek M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This fragment contains the SV40 early promoter, the ASA cDNA, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The pALTER-1/pBEH ASA fusion plasmid was prepared from bacteria grown in the presence of tetracycline, and single-stranded DNA was prepared using the f1 origin of replication present on the pALTER-1 plasmid and helper phage R408. Generation of single-stranded DNA and in vitro mutagenesis was performed following the protocol provided by Promega. Oligonucleotides used for the in vitro mutagenesis introduced the codons for the substitution of the respective lysines and concomitantly without a further change of the amino acids introduced unique restriction sites to facilitate identification of mutants via restriction enzyme digestion. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.DNA Transfection and ASA and ASB Activity Determinations— Transfection of expression plasmids into BHK cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours prior to transfection 3.5 × 105 BHK cells were seeded on a 3-cm cell culture dish. For transfection, 5 μl of LipofectAMINE was mixed with 1 μg of DNA and 750 μl of medium. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature DNA was added to cells in serum-free medium. Six hours later the DNA/LipofectAMINE-containing medium was removed and replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% of fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested 48 h later.To determine ASA activity 50–100 μl of cell lysate corresponding to about 50–100 μg of protein was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min with 200 μl of substrate (10 mm para-nitrocatecholsulfate in 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0/10% w/v sodium chloride and 0.3% Triton X-100). The incubation was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 1 n sodium hydroxide. Absorption was read at 515 nm. ASB activity was measured similarly, however, ASB was immunoprecipitated prior to activity measurements, and activity was directly determined in the immunoprecipitates (17Peters C. Schmidt B. Rommerskirch W. Rupp K. Zuhlsdorf M. Vingron M. Meyer H.E. Pohlmann R. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3374-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined with the DC assay protein determination kit from Bio-Rad following the protocol provided by the manufacturer.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—The protocols for metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and [32P]orthophosphate and the protocol for subsequent immunoprecipitation of ASA and ASB have been described in detail previously (23Gieselmann V. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13262-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate quantification of ASA-associated radioactivity with a Fuji Bioimager, in the experiments performed in this study, cells were labeled separately with either [35S]methionine and in parallel under identical conditions with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitations were done from each of the labeled cells under identical conditions. After SDS-PAGE the radioactivity incorporated in ASA or ASB was quantified using a Fuji Bioimager. Pixels of the corresponding polypeptide band were integrated. After subtraction of background values the numbers obtained were taken as arbitrary values for 32P and 35S incorporation.To calculate the extent of phosphorylation, the values for [32P]orthophosphate and [35S]methionine incorporation obtained from the phosphorimaging data were divided ([32P]orthophosphate/[35S]methionine). The quotient obtained for the wild-type enzyme was taken as 100%. ASA bears no phosphate in the polypeptide backbone.Analysis of Phosphorylation of Individual Glycosylation Sites—For each sample four 28-cm2 plates of transiently transfected BHK cells were labeled with 500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate each. After lysis of the cells, 40 μg of unlabeled purified recombinant ASA was added. Subsequently, ASA was immunopurified (16Sommerlade H.J. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Neifer K.

J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and subjected to reductive carboxymethylation, desalting, and digestion with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C8 column (0–60% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Radioactivity in the chromatographic fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a high energy channel (156–1700 keV), which reduced background radioactivity to 2–3 cpm per sample. The glycopeptides P9 and P18 containing the relevant phosphorylated oligosaccharide side chains were identified by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The entire procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (16Sommerlade H.J. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Neifer K. Schmidt B. J. Biol.

Five of these residues (Lys-367, Lys-393, Lys-433, Lys-457, and Lys-463) are located on the surface of the enzyme, two are partially accessible (Lys-302 and Lys-395), and one is not accessible from the solvent (Lys-123). Lys-123 and Lys-302 have been shown to be part of the active center (19Lukatela G. Krauβ N. Theis K. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In an initial in vitro mutagenesis experiment all lysines except for Lys-123 were replaced by alanine.Expression plasmids containing the wild-type and lysine by alanine-substituted ASA cDNAs were transiently transfected into BHK cells in up to eight independent experiments. Fortyeight hours after transfection ASA activity was measured in the cells (see Fig. 1, bottom line). The K302A, K367A, K393A, and K433A substituted ASAs yielded 34–102% of the activity of wild-type ASA-expressing cells. Little or no ASA activity could be expressed from ASA cDNAs coding for K395A, K457A, and K463A-substituted enzymes (data not shown). Because the amount of enzyme activity expressed by a mutated ASA cDNA can be considered as an indicator for structural integrity, additional amino acid substitutions were introduced at positions 395, 457, and 463 to obtain expression of higher enzyme activities. Because of the close proximity of residues 393 and 395, we introduced various amino acid substitutions at position 395 on the background of the cDNA coding for the K393A-substituted enzyme to obtain an enzymatically active 393/395 double-substituted enzyme. An ASA cDNA coding for a double-substituted K393A/K395G or K393A/K395H enzyme expressed about 35 and 30% of enzyme activity compared with wild-type ASA, respectively. Four different amino acid substitutions (Arg, Ser, His, and Gly) were introduced at position 457, of which only the K457R- and K457S-substituted enzymes yielded satisfying enzyme activities of 45 and 25%, respectively. Thirteen different amino acid substitutions were introduced at position 463, of which only the K463R- and K463Q-substituted enzymes displayed residual enzyme activity of 39 and 14%, respectively.To reveal whether the secretion of any of the enzymatically active lysine-substituted enzymes is enhanced, ASA activities in cells and in the media of transiently transfected BHK cells were compared (Fig. 1, A and B). Substitutions at positions 302, 367, 393, 395, and 433 had no effect on the distribution of enzyme activities; values were comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme of which an average of 35% of activity was found in the media. Secretion rates of K463Q- and K463R-substituted ASA were consistently lower (25%) than the wild-type enzyme.In contrast, all amino acid substitutions introduced at position 457 lead to an increase of ASA activity in the media to about 60% of total activity. Fig. 1A shows the absolute values for the amounts of ASA in cells and media, whereas Fig. 1B shows the same data expressed as percentage of total ASA activity found in the media. The latter presentation makes it more obvious that even mutant enzymes with low residual enzyme activity (K457G) show enhanced secretion.As a control we have used an ASA (N158Q/N350Q) in which the two attachments sites for phosphorylated N-linked oligosaccharide side chains at Asn-158 and Asn-350 were mutated. The remaining oligosaccharide side chain at Asn-184 is poorly phosphorylated (16Sommerlade H.J. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Neifer K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20977-20981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutant is hypersecreted (23Gieselmann V. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13262-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the data demonstrate that only mutations at position 457 lead to enhanced accumulation of ASA activity in the medium.Immunoprecipitation of Lysine-substituted ASA in Cells and Media of Metabolically Labeled Cells—To verify the results obtained by ASA activity determination, BHK cells which were transiently transfected with ASA cDNAs coding for the wild-type or the lysine-substituted ASA were metabolically labeled for 1.5 h with [35S]methionine and chased for 6 h. ASA was immunoprecipitated from cells and media. Fig. 2A summarizes data of a number of independent experiments; Fig. 2B shows one example of these experiments. The results of this single experiment suggest also that the K433A and K367A ASA show an increase in secretion. However, in a number of independent experiments (Fig. 2A) only the K457S and K457R amino acid-substituted enzymes on average yielded an amount of ASA cross-reacting material in the media comparable to the nonphosphorylated, hypersecreted N158Q/N350Q ASA. Thus, these results are in accordance with enzyme activity determinations shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of ASA from cells and media of cells expressing lysine-substituted enzymes. A, summary of results from a number of pulse-chase experiments. Transiently transfected BHK cells expressing the lysine-substituted ASAs were labeled metabolically with [35S]methionine for 1.5 h and chased for 6 h. ASA was immunoprecipitated from cells and media. Bars indicate the average of ASA cross-reacting material in the media. Incorporation of radioactivity was determined with a Fuji Bioimager. n indicates the number of independent experiments.

To determine the degree of mannose-phosphorylation, BHK cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing the wild-type and various lysine-substituted ASAs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate. ASA was immunoprecipitated from cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity incorporated into ASA polypeptides was determined by quantification with a Fuji bioimager. The values (total pixel) obtained for [32P]orthophosphate and [35S]methionine incorporation in ASA were divided to obtain an arbitrary value for ASA phosphorylation. The value obtained for the wild-type enzyme was taken as 100%. Fig. 3 shows an example of such an experiment, the table at the bottom of Fig. 3 summarizes results of several independent experiments. Whereas most lysine-substituted ASAs show a degree of phosphorylation that was comparable to the wild-type ASA, the K457R-substituted ASA showed only 33% of phosphorylation when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Because the replacement of lysine 457 by arginine conserves the positive charge, we also investigated the extent of phosphorylation of the K457S- and K457G-substituted ASAs. Compared with the wild-type enzyme these mutants showed residual phosphorylation of 50 and 31%, respectively.Fig. 3Phosphorylation of ASA and ASB. BHK cells were transiently transfected with ASA or ASB cDNAs substituted as indicated at the top. Cells were either labeled with [35S]methionine ([35S]) or [32P]orthophosphate ([32P]), and ASA or ASB were immunoprecipitated. The amount of 32P and 35S incorporated into ASA and ASB was quantified with a bioimager (Fuji). These arbitrary values for 32P and 35S incorporation were divided. The quotient for the wild-type was taken as 100%. The values for single experiments were obtained by comparison of the substituted enzymes to the respective wild-type controls and expressed as percent of wild-type incorporation for every experiment. The table at the bottom summarizes these values for a number of experiments performed with ASA. n.d., non-detectable. The N158Q/N350Q-substituted enzyme has been shown to bear no M6P (16Sommerlade H.J. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Neifer K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20977-20981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and served as a negative control. In contrast to ASA, ASB is synthesized as a 64-kDa precursor and processed intralysosomally to a mature 47-kDa form (20Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that in BHK cells mannose 6-phosphate residues are rapidly dephosphorylated upon arrival in the lysosome (30Bresciani R. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the mature 47-kDa form is not visible in the panel showing the 32P labeling. Phosphorylation rates for ASB were obtained by using the 35S and 32P incorporation of the 64-kDa ASB precursor only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Individual N-Linked Oligosaccharides— Wild-type ASA has three N-glycosylation sites. It was shown previously that only oligosaccharides at the first (Asn-158) and the third (Asn-350) glycosylation site are phosphorylated, whereas the second (Asn-184) is not (16Sommerlade H.J.

To examine how the K457R substitution affects the phosphorylation of the first and the third oligosaccharide side chain we analyzed the 32P incorporation into individual oligosaccharide side chains.

https://openalex.org/W2160454987,"We previously reported that the GTS1 product, Gts1p, plays an important role in the regulation of heat tolerance of yeast under glucose-limited conditions in either batch or continuous culture. Here we show that heat tolerance was decreased in GTS1-deleted and increased in GTS1-overexpressing cells under glucose-derepressed conditions during the batch culture and that the disruption of SNF1, a transcriptional activator of glucose-repressible genes, diminished this effect of GTS1. Intracellular levels of Hsp104 and trehalose, which were reportedly required for the acquisition of heat tolerance in the stationary phase of cell growth, were affected in both GTS1 mutants roughly in proportion to the gene dosage of GTS1, whereas those of other Hsps were less affected. The mRNA levels of genes for Hsp104 and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 changed as a function of GTS1 gene dosage. The Q-rich domain of Gts1p fused with the DNA-binding domain of LexA activated the transcription of the reporter gene LacZ, and Gts1p lacking the Q-rich domain lost the activation activity of HSP104 and TPS1. Furthermore, Gts1p bound to subunits of Snf1 kinase, whereas it did not bind to DNA. Therefore, we suggested that GTS1 increases heat tolerance by mainly activating Snf1 kinase-dependent derepression of HSP104 and TPS1 in the stationary phase of yeast growth. We previously reported that the GTS1 product, Gts1p, plays an important role in the regulation of heat tolerance of yeast under glucose-limited conditions in either batch or continuous culture.

Furthermore, Gts1p bound to subunits of Snf1 kinase, whereas it did not bind to DNA. Therefore, we suggested that GTS1 increases heat tolerance by mainly activating Snf1 kinase-dependent derepression of HSP104 and TPS1 in the stationary phase of yeast growth. We reported that the GTS1 gene shows pleiotropic effects on yeast in batch cultures, including the effect on heat tolerance as a function of gene dosage (1Yaguchi S. Mitsui K. Kawabata K. Xu Z. Tsurugi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); overexpression of GTS1 increases and deletion of GTS1 decreases the heat tolerance of yeast in the stationary phase of growth, whereas no such effects were found in exponentially growing cells. Independently, Bossier et al. (2Bossier P. Goethals P. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Yeast. 1997; 13: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) isolated GTS1 from cDNA library-transformed yeast which re-grow after lethal heat shock and found that overexpression of GTS1 results in an unchanged growth rate at 37 °C compared with 28 °C. On the other hand, we reported that GTS1 is involved in regulating ultradian oscillations of energy metabolism in continuous cultures under aerobic and glucose-limited conditions and in the coupling of oscillations of cellular responses to various stress conditions, including heat with the energy metabolism oscillation (3Wang J. Liu W. Uno T. Tonozuka H. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 9-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K.

These results suggested that the gene product Gts1p plays an important role in the regulation of heat and other stress responses under glucose-limited or -depleted conditions in either batch or continuous culture. Gts1p contains a zinc finger motif similar to that of GATA-transcription factors (7Ireland L.S. Johnston G.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in the amino-terminal region and a glutamine-rich strand in the carboxyl-terminal region, and thus Gts1p has been conventionally classified as a transcription factor in a yeast genome data base (8Mewes H.W. Albermann K. Bahr M. Fishman D. Gleissner A. Hani J. Heumann K. Kleine K. Maierl A. Oliver S.G. Pfeiffer F. Zollner A. Nature. 1997; 387: 7-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The zinc finger is now shown to be similar in structure to that contained in GTPase-activating proteins of ADP-ribosylation factors, which are considered to play a role in protein interaction rather than DNA binding (9Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Blader I.J.

Recently, we reported that the zinc finger is involved in the binding to the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and that disruption of the zinc finger causes loss of interaction between the proteins and affects the maintenance of ultradian oscillations of energy metabolism in yeast (11Liu W. Wang J. Mitsui K. Shen H. Tsurugi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3560-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the DNA binding activity of the zinc finger has not been tested. On the other hand, although Q-rich sequences have been known as one of the protein sequences common in transcriptional activators in higher organisms and known to work as an activator domain in yeast (12Xiao H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Escher D. Bodmer-Glavas M. Barberis A. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the function of the Q-rich domain in Gts1p remains to be elucidated. In yeast, heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsps, heat shock proteins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; SC, synthetic medium; ORF, open reading frame. and trehalose are known to participate in the acquisition of heat tolerance (for review see Refs. 14Piper P. Yeast Stress Responses. Landes, Austin1996: 75-99Google Scholar and 15Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Trehalose is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules bound by the first carbons and known to confer heat tolerance to cells by stabilizing their membrane (15Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). During the batch culture of yeast, trehalose begins to accumulate at the diauxic shift (after overnight culture) when glucose levels decline and continues until the end of the post-diauxic phase (after several days culture) (16Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, some Hsps like Hsp70 and Hsp90, which comprise large protein families, are expressed in exponentially growing cells and increase in terms of their protein levels in stationary phase cells, although their specific roles are not well known (17Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of Hsp104, although it is strongly heat-inducible in exponentially growing cells (18Sanchez Y. Lindquist S. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), begins right after the diauxic shift and continues to increase in the stationary phase (19Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The expression of Hsp104 in stationary phase cells is crucial for the high tolerance to heat and other stresses (19Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Lindquist S. Kim G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Further, Elliott et al. (21Elliott B. Haltiwanger R.S. Futcher B. Genetics. 1996; 144: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a mutant unable to acquire heat tolerance in the stationary phase contains two mutations, one at the TPS2 locus encoding trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, another regulatory enzyme of trehalose synthesis along with TPS1, and the other at the HSP104 locus. They concluded that both trehalose and Hsp104 synergistically contribute to the acquisition of heat tolerance in the stationary phase cells, because a double mutant for TPS1 and HSP104 showed severe heat sensitivity in the stationary phase (21Elliott B. Haltiwanger R.S. Futcher B. Genetics. 1996; 144: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the mechanism by which Gts1p modulates the acquisition of heat tolerance in yeast during the stationary phase of cell growth. We found that heat tolerance was affected depending on the GTS1 gene dosage under derepressed conditions and that Gts1p acts as a transcriptional activator for HSP104 and TPS1 depending on Snf1 kinase. We further showed that the carboxyl-terminal Q-rich domain of Gts1p is essential for the transcriptional activation, whereas the protein lacks DNA binding activity. Yeast Strains and Media—All of the mutants and transformants used in this report were derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1A (MAT a SUC2 ade2 can1 his3 trp1 lue2 ura3). Cells were cultured at 30 °C in a synthetic (SC) medium containing 2% or 0.2% glucose and required amino acids (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The glucose-repressed cells were collected after culture for 8 h on 2% glucose. To collect the glucose-derepressed cells in most experiments, cells pre-cultured overnight on 2% glucose were diluted 50-fold with the synthetic medium containing 0.2% glucose and cultured for 18 h. Production of snf1Δ and the Mutants for GTS1 Dosage—An SNF1-disrupted mutant, snf1Δ (SNF1::LEU2), was made using the recombinant plasmid pJH80 (23Hubbard E.J. Yang X.L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 130: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was a gift from Dr. M. Carlson (Columbia University, New York, NY). The GTS1-disrupted mutant, gts1Δ (GTS1::URA3), was obtained by transforming W303-1A with the recombinant plasmid pUCΔGTS1-2, which was derived from pUCΔGTS1 (24Mitsui K. Yaguchi S. Tsurugi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) after deleting the BamHI-KpnI fragment spanning nucleotide positions –426 to +883, with respect to the A of the initiation codon of GTS1, from the plasmid. The GTS1-overexpressing mutant, named TMpGTS1, was obtained as described previously (25Yaguchi S. Mitsui K. Iha H. Tsurugi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 187: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce a GTS1-overexpressing transformant in the culture on galactose, the PCR-amplified SalI-HindIII fragment carrying the GTS1 ORF was inserted into the cognate sites of the multicopy vector YEp51 downstream of the GAL10 promoter. The resulted recombinant plasmid was inserted with the BamHI-SpeI fragment from pPER119 containing the GTS1 terminator at the BamHI-BclI sites. The plasmid named pGALGTS1 was transformed into gts1Δ. Construction of Plasmids to Produce HSP104- and TPS1-deleted Mutants—To produce the HSP104-deleted mutant, named hsp104Δ, the PCR-amplified SmaI-KpnI fragment containing nucleotides –385 to +580 with respect to the first residue A of HSP104 was inserted into the cognate sites of pBluescript SK(+), and HSP104 in the recombinant plasmid was disrupted by replacing the 436-bp ApaI-EcoRI fragment with the ApaLI-NsiI fragment carrying HIS3 from pRS413 (Stratagene, Kirkland, WA). To obtain the TPS1-deleted mutant, named tps1Δ, the PCR-amplified SmaI-KpnI fragment containing nucleotides –500 to +1485 with respect to the first residue A of TPS1 was inserted into the cognate sites of pBluescript SK(+), and TPS1 was disrupted by replacing the 1146-bp NcoI-NcoI fragment with the NaeI-PvuII fragment carrying TRPI from pGBD9 (Clontech). Construction of Recombinant Plasmid Carrying GTS1 Fused to DNA-binding Domain of LexA—To construct plexA-GTS1, for expression of Gts1p fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA, the PCR-amplified EcoRI-SalI fragment directed on pPER119 (24Mitsui K. Yaguchi S. Tsurugi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was cloned into the same sites of pSH2-1 (26Hanes S.D. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1275-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), which was a gift from Dr. M. Carlson (Columbia University). To construct plexA-Q, for expression of the Q-rich domain of Gts1p (the sequence from nucleotide positions 948 to 1188 with respect to the A of the initiation codon of GTS1), which was fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA, the EcoRI-NcoI fragment of plexA-GTS1 was deleted. The plasmid pJK1621 carrying lacZ as a reporter gene (27Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. M. Carlson (Columbia University). Construction of a Plasmid Carrying GTS1 Lacking the Q-rich Domain—To obtain a mutant expressing Gts1p lacking the carboxyl-terminal sequence, which contains the Q-rich sequence from amino acid positions 316 to 396, named Gts1p-ΔQ, the SalI-PvuII fragment from pGBT9 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), carrying TRP1 followed by the ADH1 terminator, was inserted into the NcoI site of placZ-GTS1 (24Mitsui K. Yaguchi S. Tsurugi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were integrated into the GTS1 locus of W303-1A. Construction of Plasmids Carrying GTS1 Fused to GFP—A fusion gene encoding GTS1 and GFP in-frame under the control of the promoter of TDH3 was integrated into the GTS1 locus. For this purpose, a HindIII-EagI fragment carrying a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted into the cognate sites of pBluescript SK(+), and the HindIII-SacI fragment from the resulted plasmid was inserted into the cognate sites of pYX223 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) generating pYX223-GFP. Then, a PCR-amplified EcoRI-HindIII fragment carrying the GTS1 ORF was inserted into the cognate sites of pYX223-GFP obtaining pYX223-GTS1-GFP. To construct the integration plasmid, pTDH-GTS1-GFP, the BamHI-BamHI fragment carrying the 5′-half of GTS1 and TDH3 promoter from pKTGTS1, which had been constructed by inserting the EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the PCR-amplified GTS1 ORF into the cognate sites of pKT10 (28Tanaka K. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was inserted into the BamHI site of pUCΔGTS1–2, and then the EcoRV-SacI fragment from pYX223-GTS1-GFP, carrying the 3′-half of GTS1 and GFP in-frame, was inserted into the cognate sites of the resulted plasmid. Finally, the BamHI-SacI fragment from pUCΔGTS1-2 carrying the 1.7-kbp downstream sequence of GTS1 was inserted into the EagI-SacI sites of pTDH-GTS1-GFP, and the SphI-SacI fragment was used for integration. Construction of Plasmids for Binding Assay between Gts1p and Subunits of Snf1 Kinase—To construct a plasmid for tagging of 13 repeats of myc tag (myc13), the SalI-BglII fragment from pFA6a-13myckanMX6 (29Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) was inserted into the SalI and KpnI sites of pRS314 (30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the EcoRI-SpeI fragment from the recombinant plasmid was inserted into the EcoRI-NheI sites of pYX222 (R&D Systems), generating pYX222myc. Then, PCR-amplified ORFs of SNF1, SNF4, and GAL83 were digested with SalI and cloned into the EcoRV-SalI sites of pYX222myc, generating recombinant plasmids carrying genes encoding either subunit of Snf1 kinase tagged with myc13 at the carboxyl terminus. Determination of Heat Tolerance—Heat tolerance of yeast cells was determined as described previously (25Yaguchi S. Mitsui K. Iha H. Tsurugi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 187: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—For determination of invertase activity, cells cultured for varying time periods in SC medium containing 2% or 0.2% glucose were harvested, washed with 10 mm sodium azide four or five times, weighed, and frozen at –80 °C until use for invertase assays (31Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Invertase activity is expressed as micromoles of glucose released per minute per 1 g of cells (wet weight). β-Galactosidase was assayed after permeabilization of the cells and expressed in Miller units as described previously (32Slater M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Determination of the Levels of Hsps and Trehalose—Proteins were isolated from cell lysates with Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and Hsps levels were analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and the intracellular trehalose level was determined as described previously (33Uno T. Wang J. Mitsui K. Umetani K. Tamura K. Tsurugi K. Chronobiol. Int. 2002; 19: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated with Isogen (Nippon Gene), and 20 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on an agarose gel after denaturation with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide. Hybridization and probe labeling were performed with the PCR digitonin labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) (5Tonozuka H. Wang J. Mitsui K. Saito T. Hamada Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blotting of Gts1p was performed as described previously (24Mitsui K. Yaguchi S. Tsurugi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Northern and Western blots were visualized with a lumino-image analyzer (RAS-1000, Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). RNA was stained with CYBR green I (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Gel Shift Assay—For overexpression of Gts1p tagged with six molecules of histidine (Gts1p-His6) under the control of the TPI1 promoter in yeast, the HindIII-StyI fragment of pET21b(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was inserted into the HindIII-NheI sites of pYX222 (R&D Systems) obtaining a recombinant plasmid encoding His6 as a control. The resulted plasmid was inserted with the EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the PCR-amplified GTS1 ORF into the cognate sites to express Gts1p-His6. The expressed His6 and Gtslp-His6 in yeast were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's product manual. As DNA probes, the upstream sequences of HSP104 from –271 to –1 and from –380 to –192 with respect to the A residue of the initiation codon of HSP104 were amplified by PCR and labeled with the digitonin oligonucleotide 3′-end-labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The coding sequence of GTS1 from +6 to +162 was PCR-amplified and used as a nonspecific competitor. Gel-shift assay was performed according to Conlan et al. (34Conlan R.S. Gounalaki N. Hatzis P. Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and signals were detected as in the Northern blotting. Microscopic Observation—The nucleus was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) after fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Fluorescence of GFP and DAPI was visualized using an Olympus BX-50 microscopy. Effect of Different Gene Dosages of GTS1 on the Acquisition of Heat Tolerance in the Stationary Phase—When cells were cultured for 18 h on a synthetic medium containing 2% glucose as a sole carbon source, the heat tolerance of the GTS1-overexpressing mutant (TMpGTS1) was increased while that of the GTS1-deleted mutant (gts1Δ) was unchanged compared with that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). Although the heat tolerance of gts1Δ had not changed on the second day of the culture (data not shown), it was decreased on the third day, whereas in other cells it remained constant (Fig. 1A). Thus, the gene dosage effect of GTS1 on the acquisition of heat tolerance took 3 days to appear when cells were cultured on 2% glucose. Because we speculated that the slow acquisition of heat tolerance was caused by a delayed consumption of glucose, we determined the activity of invertase encoded by SUC2, a representative glucose-repressible gene (35Özcan S. Vallier L.G. Flick J.S. Carlson M. Johnston M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), during the culture. The time course of the invertase activity showed a slight rise after the first day of culture and a very slow increase until the third day (Fig. 1B), indicating that the culture took a long time to reach a sufficient degree of derepression due to the high glucose concentration (2%) in the medium. So, we cultured cells on 0.2% glucose and found that they showed strong invertase activity after 18 h of culture (Fig. 1B) accompanying changes of heat tolerance depending on the gene dosage of GTS1 (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we suggested that the gene dose effect of GTS1 on heat tolerance occurred under the derepressed conditions. Hereafter, we employed these culture conditions (18 h of culture on 0.2% glucose) to obtain derepressed cells. Then, we examined whether the effect of Gts1p on heat tolerance under the derepressed conditions is mediated by SNF1, a catalytic subunit of Snf1 kinase, which is known as a gene and metabolic activator under derepressed conditions (Fig. 2A). The heat tolerance of either the wild-type or GTS1-overexpressing cells derived from the SNF1-deleted mutant snf1Δ was decreased down to the level of gts1Δ, whereas that of the double mutant gts1Δ snf1Δ was unchanged. Under the repressed conditions (8 h culture on 2% glucose), on the other hand, the heat tolerance was not significantly decreased in either snf1Δ or gts1Δ compared with that in the wild-type, although it was very low (Fig. 2B). Thus, the results suggested that the effect of Gts1p on the heat tolerance was caused in combination with Snf1 kinase under the derepressed conditions. Intracellular Levels of Hsps and Trehalose under the Derepressed Conditions—In yeast, heat shock proteins and trehalose are known to participate in the acquisition of heat tolerance, and thus the intracellular levels of these molecules were compared among the wild-type and mutant cells under the glucose-repressed and derepressed conditions. The levels of major Hsps like Hsps 70, 90, and 104 were compared by onedimensional PAGE (33Uno T. Wang J. Mitsui K. Umetani K. Tamura K. Tsurugi K. Chronobiol. Int. 2002; 19: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Barnes C.A. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4352-4358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because the protein bands stained with silver were shown to predominantly consist of members of each protein family by the two-dimensional PAGE (37Garrels J.I. McLaughlin C.S. Warner J.R. Futcher B. Latter G.I. Kobayashi R. Schwender B. Volpe T. Anderson D.S. Mesquita-Fuentes R. Payne W.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The densitometric scanning of electrophoretograms revealed that the protein levels of Hsps were increased in TMpGTS1 and decreased in gts1Δ, thus in proportion to the strength of heat tolerance in the derepressed cells (Fig. 3B), whereas the Hsps levels were indistinguishable in the repressed cells. Of the three Hsps analyzed, the protein level of Hsp104 was most affected by GTS1; it was increased 4-fold in TMpGTS1 and decreased 4-fold in gts1Δ compared with that in the wild-type cell, whereas the levels of Hsp90s and Hsp70s were increased in TMpGTS1 or decreased in gts1Δ about 2-fold (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in gts1Δ, the Hsp104 level decreased to near the baseline, whereas Hsp90 and Hsp70 levels retained half the value in the wild-type cells. On the other hand, the trehalose level was most increased in the GTS1-overexpressing cells among the three, but it was also increased about 2.5-fold in gts1Δ (Fig. 3C), which is inconsistent with the levels of heat tolerance (Fig. 1A). Therefore, because the trehalose levels between gts1Δ and the wild-type were reversed, the levels of heat tolerance among the cells under the derepressed conditions can be attributed, if not totally, to the differences in the Hsps, especially Hsp104, and to a lesser extent, trehalose levels. Effect of Gts1p on Transcription of Genes of Hsps and Trehalose Synthesis in the Glucose-derepressed Cell—To investigate whether Gts1p regulates the expression of the Hsps and trehalose at the transcription level under derepressed conditions, the mRNA levels of HSP104 and TPS1 were determined by Northern blotting. We also determined the mRNA levels of HSP26 and HSP12, instead of HSP70s and HPS90s, because they consist of single molecules and are known to be induced in the stationary phase like HSP104 (38Kurtz S. Rossi J. Petko L. Lindquist S. Science. 1986; 231: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we conventionally used the rRNA levels stained with CYBR green for the quantitative control of RNA amounts applied to SDS-PAGE in Northern blot analysis, because the mRNA levels of ACT1, PGK1, TBP1, and ADH1, which are usually used for this purpose, were all affected in the GTS1 dosage transformants, especially in TMpGTS1. The mRNA levels of Hsps 104, 26, 12, and Tps1p were increased in the derepressed cells compared with the repressed cells in a GTS1 gene dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The effect of GTS1 on the mRNA levels disappeared in snf1Δ suggesting a dependence on Snf1 kinase. It should be pointed out that the mRNA levels of Hsps 26 and 12 were much higher in gts1Δ than in snf1Δ, whereas those of Hsp104 and Tps1p in gts1Δ were as low as in snf1Δ (Fig. 4B). To verify the differential effect of GTS1 on the SNF1-dependent expression of the four genes, we compared the mRNA levels in gts1Δ with those in snf1Δ using ACT1 for the quantitative control instead of rRNA (Fig. 4C). The result suggested that Gts1p is partially involved in the SNF1-dependent activation of HSP26 and HSP12, whereas it is fully involved in that of HSP104 and TPS1. To further determine the effect of GTS1 on the expression of HSP104 and TPS1, we examined whether deletion of the genes abrogates the increased heat tolerance associated with GTS1 overexpression. In this experiment, cells were cultured on galactose as a carbon source (40Hazell B.W. Kletsas S. Nevalainen H. Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), because the growth rate of tps1Δ was severely inhibited in the culture on glucose. When the wild-type cells were grown on galactose for 24 h, the heat tolerance was increased about 2-fold compared with that of the glucose-repressed cells (compare the second lane in Fig. 5 with the second lane in Fig. 1), and the heat tolerance was further increased about 2-fold by overexpression of Gts1p (Fig. 5). The heat tolerance was decreased in tps1Δ, hsp104Δ, and tps1Δ hsp104Δ in this order compared with the wild-type, and the effect of GTS1 overexpression on the heat tolerance was decreased in the mutants in proportion to the strength of heat tolerance (Fig. 5). In the double mutant tps1Δ hsp104Δ, the heat tolerance was only a little increased by overexpression of GTS1 suggesting that the two genes are predominantly involved in the acquisition of heat tolerance in derepressed cells. It should be added that a similar result was obtained concerning HSP104 using hsp104Δ cultured on glucose into the derepressed conditions (data not shown). Recently, Grably et al. (41Grably M.R. Stanhill A. Tell O. Engelberg D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that transcriptional control of HSP104 is achieved exclusively or cooperatively through activation of heat shock elements and stress response elements. So, we examined the effect of GTS1 gene dosage on the transcription of HSP104 and other genes tested above in response to heat shock. The heat shock responses of the genes were not affected by the different gene dosage of GTS1 (data not shown) suggesting that the transcriptional activation of the genes by GTS1 under the derepressed conditions was not caused through heat shock factors and stress response elements.

https://openalex.org/W2035034398,"T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V), a thymine dimer-specific DNA repair enzyme, and its interaction with DNA were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Backbone resonance assignment, chemical shift mapping, and 15N relaxation measurements were employed to the free and DNA-bound enzymes. The secondary structure and the tertiary fold of T4 endo V in solution were consistent with those from the crystallographic study. The backbone 1H and 15N chemical shift perturbation upon the addition of DNA without a lesion revealed that the residues including Arg3, Arg22–Arg26, Lys45–Phe60, and Lys86–Thr88 participate in DNA binding. However, when DNA with a lesion was added to the enzyme and concomitantly the catalytic reaction was completed, the resonances of Arg22, Glu23, and Arg26, which constitute the catalytic active site, and the resonance of Thr88, were perturbed in a different manner. The region around Lys45–Ser47 was found to be involved in DNA binding, which have not been reported elsewhere. The backbone relaxation measurements of the free and DNA-bound enzymes indicated that two loop regions, Lys45–Phe60 and Lys86–Asp92, show the high degree of backbone flexibility. These results imply that two flexible loop regions may play an important role in DNA binding and in scanning along DNA duplex to search the thymine dimer sites in UV-damaged DNA.

The exposure of DNA to ultraviolet radiation produces various lesions in DNA bases including a cis-syn-cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimer, which is the most typical lesion within DNA duplex and lethal and mutagenic for organisms.

T4 endo V can scan a non-target sequence along a DNA duplex by nonspecific electrostatic interaction and search the UV light-induced thymine dimer (3Grunskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Once the enzyme is located at the target site, it cleaves the glycosylic bond on the 5′-thymine of thymine dimer (glycosylase activity) and subsequently incises the phosphodiester bond at the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (AP-endonuclease activity) (4Dobson M.L.

The crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme was determined at 1.6 Å resolutions (9Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Ohtsuka E. Science. 1992; 256: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the enzyme was then refined at 1.45 Å, and the structures of three active site mutants were also determined (10Morikawa K. Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Matsumoto O. Katayanagi K. Ohtsuka E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of a single compact domain with three α-helices and resembles the shallow dish-like shape. The concave surface covered with many positive charges implied an interface for DNA binding. The crystal structure of a mutant enzyme, in which glutamic acid 23 was replaced to glutamine (T4 endo V E23Q), complexed with a DNA duplex containing a thymine dimer, was also determined (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme, T4 endo V E23Q, retains the binding specificity for thymine dimer site in DNA duplex, but lacks the catalytic activity. The atomic structure of the complex revealed the unique conformation of the DNA duplex, which exhibits a sharp kink with a 60° inclination at the central thymine dimer. The adenine base complementary to the 5′ side of the thymine dimer is completely flipped out from the DNA duplex and trapped in a cavity on the protein surface. However, the conformation of the protein complexed with DNA coincides well with that of the free enzyme. Interestingly, the solution structure of the free dodecamer DNA duplex containing a thymine dimer has revealed only a subtle distortion of the phosphodiester backbone, and there were no large conformational differences from B-type DNA structure, such as the sharp kink and base flip-out shown in the T4 endo V E23Q-DNA complex structure (12McAteer K. Jing Y. Kao J. Taylor J.-S. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It implies that the formation of thymine dimer could not affect the conformation of DNA duplex, and the conformational changes of DNA only occurred when the binding of T4 endo V to DNA contained a thymine dimer. In combination with x-ray crystallographic studies, many genetic and biochemical approaches were extensively performed. These studies were focused on several sites in the enzyme, including the positively charged basic cluster and Glu23 (3Grunskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2696-2710Google Scholar, 13Doi T. Recktenwald A. Karaki Y. Kikuchi M. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Hori N. Ohtsuka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3817-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With these studies, it has been suggested that Thr2, Arg3, Arg22, Glu23, and Arg26 would play a critical role in glycosylase activity of the enzyme. These residues are conserved in the homolog enzymes of T4 endo V from Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 and Micrococcus luteus and have been suggested to play a similar functional role in the catalysis (17Shiota S. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S.

NMR study on the interaction between T4 endo V and DNA with or without a lesion were performed previously. Using five DNA substrates having different sequences with or without a thymine dimer, Lee et al. (20Lee B.J. Sakashita H. Ohkubo T. Ikehara M. Doi T. Morikawa K. Kyogoku Y. Osafune T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that only DNA containing a thymine dimer or a -TT- sequence could bind specifically to the enzyme. However, the precise interaction between T4 endo V and DNA could not be fully understood, because the complete resonance assignment of T4 endo V had not be achieved. Furthermore, even in the presence of the crystal structure of T4 endo V E23Q with DNA containing a thymine dimer, the nonspecific interaction between the enzyme and DNA, especially the DNA scanning and the damaged site searching of the enzyme, is still unclear, since the crystallographic and biochemical studies have been focused on the specific enzyme-DNA interaction. Here, we describe the nonspecific interaction between T4 endo V and DNA. Recently, we have accomplished the full backbone and Cβ resonance assignment of T4 endo V (21Ahn H.-C. Lee S.-Y. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Based on the resonance assignment of the free protein, we investigated the interaction of T4 endo V with DNA by using the chemical shift perturbation experiments and the backbone relaxation measurements. Two DNA duplexes with or without a thymine dimer were prepared. The chemical shift perturbation of the enzyme upon the binding of two types of DNA enabled to map the DNA binding surface of T4 endo V and showed the meaningful different aspect of DNA interaction between two complexes. 15N backbone relaxation analyses for the free and DNA-bound enzymes have revealed that two loop regions, which are important in DNA binding, have flexible features. Based on our findings, DNA binding and scanning along a DNA duplex of T4 endo V are discussed and the specific interaction of the enzyme with DNA containing thymine dimer is implicated. Preparation of T4 Endo V and Substrate DNA—U-70% 2H, U-15N- and U-90% 2H, U-15N, U-13C-labeled T4 endo V were prepared as described previously (21Ahn H.-C. Lee S.-Y. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Two synthesized DNA oligonucleotides contain the sequence of 5′-GCGGTTGGCG-3′, designated as the wild-type DNA, and the sequence of 5′-GCGGTTGGCG-3′ (where TT represents a thymine dimer), designated as the damaged DNA, respectively. The oligonucleotide containing a thymine dimer was synthesized by using a protected thymine dimer derivative (22Taylor J.S. Brockie I.R. O'Day C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6735-6742Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Taylor J.S. Garrett D.S. Brockie I.R. Svoboda D.L. Telser J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8858-8866Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which was prepared by a modified procedure (24Murata T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 24: 7279-7286Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both complementary sequences, 3′-CGCCAACCGC-5′, were synthesized by using standard procedures. The DNA duplexes were produced by mixing the strands containing -TT- or -TT- with the complementary strands at an equimolar ratio and subjected to an annealing procedure in a PCR machine. The formation of Watson-Crick base pair was confirmed by the observation of the imino proton resonances of each DNA in respective 1H NMR spectrum, as reported by Lee et al. (20Lee B.J. Sakashita H. Ohkubo T. Ikehara M. Doi T. Morikawa K. Kyogoku Y. Osafune T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (data not shown). DNA with or without a lesion was added to about 0.5 mm U-90% 2H, U-15N, U-13C-labeled T4 endo V at a slight molar excess. Finally, the free and DNA-bound enzymes were dissolved in the 90% H2O/10% D2O NMR buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaN3, pH 6.5, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignments of DNA-bound T4 Endo V—NMR data were collected at 20 °C on Bruker DRX 500 and 600 spectrometers equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probe and a triple xyz-gradient unit. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected for the free and DNA-bound proteins. U-70% 2H, U-15N-labeled T4 endo V was used for the free protein, while U-90% 2H, U-15N, U-13C-labeled T4 endo V was used for the DNA-bound proteins. The resonance assignment of free protein was reported previously (21Ahn H.-C. Lee S.-Y. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and the backbone amide and nitrogen resonances of DNA-bound proteins were assigned by using the respective three-dimensional HNCA spectra (25Yamazaki T. Lee W. Revington M. Mattiello D.L. Dahlquist F.W. Arrowsmith C.H. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6464-6465Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For the free T4 endo V, three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra with a 150 ms mixing time were recorded to obtain the NOEs between the backbone amide protons of T4 endo V with 70% deuterated and uniformly 15N-labeled sample. All spectra were zerofilled and adapted to 90° shifted sine-squared apodization and followed by Fourier transformation. All NMR spectra were processed by using the program NMRPipe/NMRDraw (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed by using NMRView program (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Secondary Structure and the Overall Fold of T4 Endo V—The information of the secondary structure of T4 endo V was collected by two independent methods: NOE connectivity of HN(i)-HN(i+1) and HN(i)-HN(i+2) (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) and Chemical shift index (CSI) (29Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 30Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 2: 171-180Google Scholar). The NOEs obtained from three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectrum of T4 endo V were assigned and classified into strong, medium, and weak intensities. The CSI of Cα, Cβ, and C′ were derived from the deviations between the observed value and the random coil values, Δδ (chemical shift deviation) = δobserved (the observed chemical shift) – δrandom coil (the chemical shift of random coil), for the respective atom. Δδ > 0.7 ppm for Cα and Cβ was set to +1 CSI value and Δδ < –0.7 was set to –1. The CSI value was set to 0 for –0.7 < Δδ < 0.7. The threshold for C′ was ±0.5 ppm. In Fig. 1, the NOE connectivities between the backbone amide protons of T4 endo V and CSI were summarized along the sequence of the enzyme. For the determination of the overall folding of T4 endo V, additional long range HN-HN NOEs were collected from three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum of T4 endo V. The long range NOE cross-peaks obtained between Asp62–Phe66 and Gly102–Tyr104 were shown in Fig. 2. Chemical Shift Mapping—Chemical shifts of T4 endo V complexed with DNA were compared with those of the free protein. Normalized weight average chemical shift differences, Δave, for T4 endo V amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts upon DNA binding were calculated using Δave = [(ΔH2 + (ΔN/5)2)/2]1/2, where ΔH and ΔN are the amide proton and nitrogen chemical shift differences between the free and bound enzymes, respectively (31Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky P. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 26: 4393-4398Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Backbone 15N Relaxation Measurements and Analyses— 15N T 1 (longitudinal relaxation time), T 2 (transverse relaxation time), and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE spectra were recorded by using pulse sequences with gradients (32Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 33Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson P. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). T 1 values were calculated by using the spectra recorded with eight different delay times of 5, 65 (×2), 145, 246 (×2), 366, 527, 757, and 1148 ms for the free protein and with six delay times of 10, 120, 300, 500, 800, and 1200 ms for DNA-bound enzymes. T 2 values were obtained with eight different delay times of 16.7 (×2), 33.4, 50.1, 66.8 (×2), 83.5, 116.9, 150.3, and 167.0 ms for the free and DNA-bound protein. 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values were measured from the spectra recorded in the presence and absence of a proton presaturation period of 3 s. 1H saturation was achieved with the use of 120° 1H pulses applied every 5 ms. In the case of the NONOE spectra, a net relaxation delay of 5 s was employed, while a relaxation delay of 2 s prior to a 3-s proton presaturation period was employed for the NOE spectra. The spectra were processed with the same procedures as mentioned above. T 1 and T 2 values were determined by fitting the measured peak heights to a two-parameter function, I(t) =I 0 exp(–T/T 1,2), where I(t) is the intensity after a delay of time t, and I 0 is the intensity of at time t = 0. The 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values were determined from the ratios of the intensities of the peaks with and without proton saturation: NOE = I sat/I unsat, where I sat and I unsat represent the measured intensities of a resonance in the presence and absence of proton saturation, respectively. The relaxations of the free and DNA-bound proteins were analyzed using the protocol in NMRView software package (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Estimation of the overall correlation time (τm) of the free T4 endo V and two DNA-bound enzymes were determined from the T 1/T 2 ratios for each residue (32Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 35Clore G.M. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7387-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The residues showing T 1/T 2 values greater than ±1 S.D. were excluded from the calculation. Secondary Structure and the Overall Fold of T4 Endo V—The secondary structure and the overall fold of T4 endo V in solution were examined and compared with those of the crystal structure. Fig. 1 shows the summary of the sequential NOEs and the CSI results of T4 endo V. The strong HN(i)-HN(i+1) and medium or weak HN(i)-HN(i+2) NOEs were found in the residues spanning from Asp14 to Asn37, from Phe59 to Phe83, and from Ala112 to Arg125. The consecutively appeared +1 values in the Cα and C′ CSI, and –1 of Cβ CSI indicate that the corresponding regions have α-helical conformations, which coincide well with the result from NOE connectivities. The helical regions identified in this work highly correspond to the helical regions designated as helix 1 (Asp14–Gly38), helix 2 (Leu64–Gly82), and helix 3 (Glu111–Arg125) in the crystal structure of the enzyme (9Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Ohtsuka E. Science. 1992; 256: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Morikawa K. Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Matsumoto O. Katayanagi K. Ohtsuka E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In some other regions, evidence on the existence of a short α-helical conformation appeared (Fig. 1). There were the sequential NOEs in short patches right before and after helix 1 (Val9–Leu12 and Arg40–Phe44, respectively), before helix 2 and in the regions Gln98–Gly102. In the crystal structure of T4 endo V, short helices or helical turns are also shown in these regions (9Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Ohtsuka E. Science. 1992; 256: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Morikawa K. Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Matsumoto O. Katayanagi K. Ohtsuka E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the tertiary structure was not determined in this work, it is likely that the solution structure of the enzyme would resemble the crystal structure. In Fig. 2, the long range HN-HN NOEs between residues from Asp62 to Phe66 and residues from Gly102 to Tyr104 were shown, suggesting these two regions are located in a near position in tertiary structure of T4 endo V. In the crystal structure of T4 endo V, the distance between these regions is close. Therefore, these findings suggest that the secondary structure and the overall fold of T4 endo V in solution are similar to those of the crystal structure. Binding of T4 Endo V to the Wild-type DNA—DNA binding of T4 endo V was investigated by the comparison of 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks between the free and DNA-bound proteins. The resonance assignments of 1H and 15N cross-peaks in HSQC spectra of T4 endo V in the presence of two DNA substrates were accomplished using the respective HNCA spectra. Fig. 3A shows a superposition of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of T4 endo V in the absence (black) and presence (red) of the wild-type DNA. The overall line broadening occurred upon binding of a wild-type DNA to the enzyme, suggesting that the protein-DNA complex was formed (36Walther A.P. Gomes X.V. Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although most cross-peaks of T4 endo V were unchanged upon the addition of the wild-type DNA, some resonances were completely disappeared or showed a significant chemical shift changes. The disappeared resonances correspond to the residues, Arg3, Arg22, Glu23, Arg26, Ile52, Gly53, Gly55, His56, Val57, Thr58, and Thr88 and are indicated by the square box in Fig. 3A. The cross-peaks that have undergone the significant chemical shift differences are from residues Tyr21, Leu24, Gly29, Lys33, Arg40, Asp43, Lys45, Ile46, Ser47, Thr49, Phe50, Ala51, Tyr60, Asp62, Lys86, Gly102, Arg117, and Glu120, which are also indicated in Fig. 3A. The averaged chemical shift changes upon the addition of the wild-type DNA were plotted in Fig. 4A. The relatively large chemical shift changes were found for the resonances from Lys45 to Ser47 of T4 endo V. Thus, the most intensive changes upon the wild-type DNA binding to T4 endo V occurred in the regions of Arg22–Arg26 and Lys45–Phe60, suggesting that these regions play a critical role in the protein-DNA interaction. However, the region Lys45–Ser47 has been found to be far apart from DNA duplex in the cocrystal structure of T4 endo V E23Q and DNA containing a thymine dimer, and there was no evidence of the involvement of this region in DNA binding (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The disagreement of the result in this work and in the crystallographic study would be caused by the conformational changes in the damaged DNA, especially the kink of DNA backbone induced by the enzyme. Therefore, the region around Lys45–Ser47 seems to be only involved in nonspecific DNA interaction. In Fig. 5, the residues affected upon the addition of the wild-type DNA are indicated in the crystal structure of T4 endo V. These residues lie on the concave surface of the enzyme and are mainly composed of the positively charged amino acids, such as Arg, Lys, and His, and the amino acids with the side chain -OH, such as Tyr, Ser, and Thr. Therefore it is likely that the positively charged amino acids on the concave surface of T4 endo V would be involved in the electrostatic protein-DNA interaction with nonspecific manner. DNA Binding of T4 Endo V after the Catalytic Reaction— When DNA containing a thymine dimer is added to T4 endo V, the enzyme incises the 5′-glycosylic bond of thymine dimer and subsequently nicks 3′-phosphate backbone of thymine dimer (4Dobson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Macmillan S. Edenberg H.J. Radany E.H. Friedberg R.C. Friedberg E.C. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 211-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2742-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, the different aspect of DNA binding was expected in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the protein complexed with DNA containing a thymine dimer. Fig. 3B shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the free and the damaged DNA-bound T4 endo V. The spectrum of the T4 endo V complexed with the damaged DNA showed relatively small line broadening compared with that of the enzyme with the wild-type DNA. The 1H-15N cross-peaks of the residues, Arg3, Ile52, Gly53, Gly55, His56, Val57, and Thr58 also disappeared. However, the resonances of Arg22, Glu23, Arg26, and Thr88 apparently remained with slight chemical shift changes and the reduced intensities compared with those of the wild-type DNA-bound T4 endo V. The different pattern of the spectrum would be attributed to the release of a 5′-thymine base from thymine dimer (glycosylase activity) and the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond (AP endonuclease activity) upon the binding of T4 endo V to DNA (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the slight chemical shift changes and the decrease of the intensities of the resonances of Arg22, Glu23, Arg26, and Thr88 suggest that these residues still participate in the interaction with DNA even after the enzymatic catalysis. The residues Lys45–Ser47 also showed relatively large chemical shift differences, suggesting the involvement of this region in DNA interaction. Fig. 4B shows the averaged chemical shift changes upon the addition of the damaged DNA. Dynamic Property of the Free and DNA-bound T4 Endo V— 15N relaxation measurements were performed to investigate the dynamic feature of the enzyme. Fig. 6 shows the T 1, T 2, and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values of the free and DNA-bound T4 endo V. Totally 118 backbone 1H-15N cross-peaks were observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of T4 endo V, due to resonance overlap and 5 proline residues. Since residues showing the spectral overlap and showing the unusual deviation from the average value were excluded, the complete quantitative relaxation measurements were made for 97 residues of T4 endo V. For the enzyme in the presence of the wild-type DNA and the damaged DNA, additional several residues were excluded from the calculation of the relaxation parameters due to the large line width and the overlap of the 1H-15N cross-peaks upon the addition of DNA. Fig. 6 shows the T 1 and T 2 and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE for the backbone 15N nuclei of the free and DNA-bound enzymes. Most of T 1 values lie between 0.8 and 1.0 s with an overall average value of 0.84 ± 0.19 s for the free T4 endo V. The majority of the T 2 values of the free enzyme lie around 45 ms with an overall average value of 46.3 ± 6.9 ms. The residues significantly deviated from the average T 1 and T 2 value of the free T4 endo V are clustered in the regions Lys45–Phe60 and Lys86–Asp92, suggesting that these regions are more dynamic than the rest of the enzyme. Most of the 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values of the free protein are concentrated between 0.78 and 0.88 with an average value of 0.82 ± 0.06. The exceptions are at the regions Lys45–Phe60 and Lys86–Asp92, which have greater flexibility as suggested by the T 1 and T 2 data. In the crystal structure of T4 endo V, these regions correspond to the two loop regions and have larger B-factors than any other region in the enzyme (9Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M.
