Among a few cell strains obtained, one clone contains S-100 protein, which is unique to brain in vertebrates. Stationary-phase cultures contain approximately ten times more S-100 protein per cell than exponentially growing cells. When injected into newborn rats, cells producing S-100 grew as a glial tumor, which contained S-100 protein."

The dose required is at or below threshold for gross behavioral effects. An inhibition of neurons containing serotonin after administration of d-lysergic acid diethylamide could account for the decreased metabolism of serotonin produced by this drug.

https://openalex.org/W1548625092,"Abstract The phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system provides a mechanism for the passage of certain sugars through the bacterial cell membrane and their accumulation as phosphorylated derivatives. These conclusions are based on the following observations. 1. Isolated bacterial membrane preparations specifically require P-enolpyruvate for uptake of certain sugars which accumulate almost completely as phosphorylated derivatives. 2. Membranes prepared from Escherichia coli GN-2, a mutant lacking Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system, are unable to take up significant quantities of α-methylglucoside. 3. 3H-Glucose added to the incubation medium is phosphorylated more rapidly than free 14C-glucose in the intramembranal pool, suggesting that the P-transferase system is a mechanism by which sugars penetrate the membrane. 4. There is a stoichiometric relation between 32P loss from P-enolpyruvate and appearance of 32P in α-methylglucoside-P. 5. The uptake and phosphorylation of α-methylglucoside exhibit saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of about 4 x 10-6 m, whereas the appearance of free α-methylglucoside in the intramembranal pool shows no saturation. The initial rate of uptake of free α-methylglucoside is independent of the presence of P-enolpyruvate. 6. Under steady state conditions, intramembranal free α-methylglucoside and the external pool do not equilibrate regardless of the presence of P-enolpyruvate. Furthermore, α-methylglucoside in the external pool does not exchange with the α-methylglucoside previously taken up by the membranes. Membranes prepared from glucose-grown cells take up and phosphorylate α- and β-methylglucoside, glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, fructose, galactose, and 3-O-methylglucose in the presence of P-enolpyruvate. Ribose, arabinose, mannitol and sorbitol are not taken up or phosphorylated."

https://openalex.org/W1552834733,"Abstract Acyl carrier protein holoprotein (holo-ACP) synthetase, an enzyme which transfers 4'-phosphopantetheine from reduced coenzyme A to acyl carrier protein apoprotein (apo-ACP) to form holo-ACP and 3',5'-adenosine diphosphate, has been shown in Escherichia coli B. At 780-fold purification the enzyme is free of apo-ACP, holo-ACP, and ACP hydrolase. The apparent Km value is 4 x 10-7 m for apo-ACP and 1.5 x 10-4 m for CoA. Dephospho-CoA and oxidized CoA are inactive as substrates. The enzyme requires Mg++ or Mn++ for activity. Both cations give complex saturation curves, with Mg++ showing substrate activation between 10-2 and 10-1 m. The holo-ACP formed in the synthetase reaction has full coenzymatic activity as measured in the malonyl-CoA-CO2 exchange reaction. Quantitative conversion of apo-ACP to holo-ACP is readily achieved with an excess of synthetase. Thus this enzyme can be utilized in an assay for apo-ACP in biological material. The reverse reaction, formation of CoA from holo-ACP and 3',5'-adenosine diphosphate, has been shown."

https://openalex.org/W2127434990,"Abstract The enzyme β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase, a requisite component of the fatty acid synthetase system of Escherichia coli, catalyzes the reversible interconversion of the thioesters of β-hydroxydecanoic acid, trans-α,β-decenoic acid, and cis-β, γ-decenoic acid. All activities of the dehydrase are strongly inhibited by 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine. A marked preference for C10 substrates has previously been noted. For further elucidation of dehydrase specificity, kinetic parameters for the enzymatic dehydration and isomerization were determined with a series of substrates varying in chain length from eight to 12 carbon atoms in the acyl moiety. Inhibition constants for β,γ-acetylenic thioesters of the same series were also measured. The data show a remarkable parallelism between the relative activities of substrates and inhibitors as a function of carbon chain length. The inhibitor 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine appears to be irreversibly bound to the dehydrase."

https://openalex.org/W1587929517,"Abstract A lysine auxotroph of Escherichia coli W can use lysine oligopeptides as a source of the required amino acid. A mutant, defective in oligopeptide transport, was isolated from this strain with the use of resistance to the bactericidal action of triornithine as a selection procedure. The triornithine-resistant mutant could no longer grow upon lysine oligopeptides. In an analogous manner a triornithine-resistant mutant of a glycine auxotroph lost the ability to grow upon glycine oligopeptides. It is concluded that lysine, ornithine, and glycine oligopeptides use a common transport system, which is lost in the triornithine-resistant strain. This conclusion is substantiated by studies that show competition among these oligopeptides for entry into the cell. Tyrosine oligopeptides can also compete, and they are presumed to use the same transport system. This lack of specificity with respect to side chain is taken as an indication that a single system may be used for oligopeptide transport and therefore is in marked contrast to the transport of the free amino acids, for which several distinct systems are required. It is shown that dipeptides use predominantly a separate system, although they possess limited ability to enter by the oligopeptide mechanism. In contrast, oligopeptides cannot be transported by the specific dipeptide system or systems."
https://openalex.org/W1597846549,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is an allosteric enzyme known to be activated by acetyl coenzyme A or dioxane and inhibited by aspartate. A study of the experimental parameters affecting the allosteric nature of the enzyme has been made to establish optimal conditions for the enzyme and to understand certain abnormalities in its saturation kinetics. Although the requirement for a metal can be satisfied by either Mg2+ or Mn2+, the latter is more stimulatory except at pH 8.5 or higher. That Mn2+ and acetyl-CoA may act at the same site is indicated by the reduction in the activity of the acetyl-CoA-activated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase with the substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+. Malate has been shown to be as powerful an inhibitor as aspartate. The effect of dioxane is strongly dependent on substrate as well as inhibitor concentrations. In the presence of acetyl-CoA or Mn2+, the saturation curve for phosphoenolpyruvate exhibits a plateau at half-maximal velocity. This phenomenon has been predicted by Koshland's model as being characteristic of a stabilized intermediate conformation of allosteric enzymes in which only half of the available sites are saturated. Thus our evidence points to a sequential alteration of the subunits of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase by the substrate, rather than an effect in shifting the equilibrium between two symmetrical conformations of the whole enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1988580033,"The movement of carbachol, norepinephrine, and dopamine from cannula sites in caudate nucleus and septal area of freely moving rats was traced by means of biogenic amine fluorescence. Fluorescent patterns seen after application of carbachol and norepinephrine to brain tissue did not appear to differ from controls. Three types of movement from the cannula site after administration of dopamine were observed. There was a spherical distribution approximately 2 millimeters in diameter. Fluorescence also followed axonal pathways in the orthodromic direction, suggesting that dopamine may have been transported by "" axonal streaming "" or by some other unknown mechanism in periaxonal spaces. Because fluorescence was present in both the ependymal lining and the choroid plexus, it was inferred that the cerebral ventricles were also involved in the movement of chemical. Any attempt to ascribe anatomical localization to behavioral effects resulting from chemical stimulation of the brain should take into account the widespread movement of chemicals after their local application to brain tissue."

These antibodies were absent in all serums before the patients became ill, appeared during the early phases of illness, and persisted for long periods of time. These antibodies are distinct from heterophile antibodies. None of the patients developed immune responses to herpes simplex, cytomegalo-, or reoviruses in the course of their illness. The data suggest that the development of complement-fixing antibodies to this herpes-like virus in these patients may be linked to infectious mononucleosis."

https://openalex.org/W1581818288,"Abstract 1. Potassium cyanate, a reagent that carbamylates proteins, reacts both with pepsinogen and pepsin. 2. When allowed to react with pepsinogen, nine of the 10 e-NH2 groups of the lysine residues are carbamylated and homocitrulline is formed. In addition, reaction occurs with 4 tyrosine residues but not with the α-NH2-terminal leucine. 3. Carbamylation of pepsinogen is accompanied by a decreased susceptibility to activation. The enzymically active product that can be obtained is, in its amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid, indistinguishable from pepsin prepared from the untreated zymogen. 4. Carbamylation results in a change of the molecular conformation of the protein as reflected by a decrease of λc from 236 to 220 mµ, an increase of the levorotation, [α]366, from -212 to -297, and a change of [m'] from -4086 to -3802. 5. Pepsinogen in which 3 lysines are carbamylated retains its native conformation and full potential pepsin activity. On further reaction with potassium cyanate, the loss of potential pepsin activity parallels the percentage change of the specific optical rotation, [α]366. 6. When pepsin is carbamylated, the proteolytic activity of the enzyme toward hemoglobin decreases, whereas the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate, N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanyldiiodotyrosine, increases 2.8-fold. These changes can be reversed by decarbamylation with hydroxylamine. 7. With the aid of differences in the absorbance and in the incorporation of K14CNO it was established that 6 tyrosine residues were carbamylated in pepsin. Although the NH2-terminal isoleucine had reacted, the 1 lysine residue of the protein was not carbamylated."

https://openalex.org/W47870504,"Abstract The selectivity of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide for tryptophan, as demonstrated by Koshland and his coworkers, has been used to study some of the properties of the residues of this amino acid in pepsin. The aromaticity and absorbance of the alkylated tryptophan facilitate the isolation of peptides containing the modified residues. Pepsin freshly prepared from pepsinogen was reduced, carboxymethylated, and treated with 2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzyl bromide. The total incorporation of reagent corresponded to 4 residues of tryptophan per molecule. Hydrolysis of pepsin with alkali or with enzymes, followed by ion exchange chromatography, gave the same result. Reduced and carboxymethylated pepsinogen, when treated with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, also was found to contain 4 tryptophan residues per molecule. The zymogen derivative was hydrolyzed by chymotrypsin and a group separation of peptides was made by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. Each of four groups containing alkylated tryptophan residues was further hydrolyzed by thermolysin. The mixtures of small peptides were fractionated on columns of Sephadex G-25 and G-15. The peptides containing alkylated tryptophan were retarded by adsorption on the gel and their elution could be followed by measurement of the color of the hydroxynitrobenzyl group. The amino acid compositions and sequences of all of the peptides isolated were consistent with the presence of the following four sequences in pepsin and pepsinogen: I, Val-Phe-Asp-Asn-Leu-Trp-Asp-Gln-Gly; II, Leu-Trp-Val-Pro-Ser; III, Val-Glu-Gly(Trp,Gln); IV, Leu-Asn-Trp-Val-Pro. Each of the above sequences in the protein gave rise to several peptides which were separable on the gel columns but showed identical amino acid compositions. The multiplicity of peaks is probably related to the chemistry of the alkylation, which Koshland and associates have shown may yield several isomeric, monosubstituted derivatives of the indole ring of tryptophan. When active pepsin (with the disulfide bonds intact) was treated with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide at pH 3.5, only 2 residues of the reagent were incorporated; one has been shown to be in Sequence I, above, the second in Sequence IV. The loss in specific activity against both hemoglobin and acetyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-diiodotyrosine resulting from this incorporation is only 25 to 30%, indicating that the reagent is not reacting with groups that are essential for catalytic activity. In alkali-denatured pepsin, 3 residues of tryptophan were accessible, whereas the 4th became reactive only after cleavage of the disulfide bonds of the protein by reduction and carboxymethylation. In the course of these experiments it was also observed that all 4 of the methionine residues of pepsin are unavailable to alkylation by iodoacetate or iodoacetamide at pH 2.2."
https://openalex.org/W1493431301,"Abstract Aminoacyl transfer RNA bound to 70 S ribosomes in the presence of a template was resistant to digestion by pancreatic ribonuclease. On the basis of this observation, a convenient sensitive assay for codon recognition and aminoacyl-tRNA binding to ribosomes was described. The protection occurred as a result of the association of aminoacyl-tRNA with the 50 S subribosomal particle; thus, the assay provided a sensitive functional test involving the specific interaction of tRNA with the 50 S subunit of Escherichia coli ribosomes. The kinetics of attachment of 50 S subunits to 30 S ribosome-polyribonucleotide template-aminoacyl-tRNA complexes was studied by the assay. Furthermore, the assay provides an additional parameter for evaluating the site of action of antibiotics and other substances interfering with protein biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1561821592,"Abstract The substrate and allosteric site specificities of partially purified ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli are reported. The pyrrolopyrimidine antibiotics, tubercidin 5-'diphosphate and toyocamycin 5'-diphosphate, were enzymatically reduced to their corresponding 2'-deoxyribonucleotides. Sangivamycin 5'-diphosphate was not a substrate. The reduction of tubercidin 5'-diphosphate and toyocamycin 5'-diphosphate was stimulated by the dGTP. TTP, which stimulates the reduction of the purine and pyrimidine nucleoside diphosphates, did not stimulate the reduction of the nucleotide antibiotics. This is in contrast to the observation that the reduction of the nucleotide antibiotics was stimulated when the prime effector, dGTP, was added to the ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii. The results indicate that nitrogen atom 7 of the imidazole ring of ADP does not play a significant role in binding at the catalytic site since tubercidin 5'-diphosphate and toyocamycin 5'-diphosphate were substrates. However, replacement of the cyano- group with a carboxamide group (sangivamycin 5'-diphosphate) is sufficient to prevent reduction of the nucleoside diphosphate to the 2'-deoxyribonucleotide. 3'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate interacted at the allosteric site and modified the reductase such that the reductions of ADP and GDP were both inhibited. 3'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate was not as good an allosteric modifier as was 2'-dATP. The presence of a hydroxyl group in position 3' of the ribonucleoside 5'-di- or ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates does not appear to be an important structural requirement for interaction at the regulatory site of the ribonucleotide reductases from E. coli and L. leichmannii. The three pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate antibiotics inhibited the reduction of CDP and UDP. The inhibition of reduction of ADP and GDP by 2'-dATP was potentiated when the 5'-triphosphates of tubercidin, toyocamycin, and sangivamycin were added. The substrate activity and allosteric modification observed with the nucleotide antibiotics may be important in evaluating the biological activity of these compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1522589810,"Abstract Evidence has been presented in this investigation to show that the synthesis of aspartate kinase in Escherichia coli B is regulated by the ratio of the intracellular concentrations of the end products, methionine, threonine, and lysine. l-Lysine and l-threonine at a concentration of 5 mm repress the enzyme to the extent of 60 to 70% and 15 to 25%, respectively. On the other hand, methionine at a concentration of 5 mm stimulates the synthesis of aspartate kinase to the extent of 2- to 4-fold. The increased aspartate kinase activity observed when the bacteria is grown in the presence of methionine is not due to the presence of an activator of the enzyme in the cell-free extract. The increased enzyme activity is sensitive to the presence of chloramphenicol in the growth media, along with methionine. This suggests that the observed increased aspartate kinase activity in extracts obtained from cells grown in the presence of methionine is due to an additional synthesis of enzyme protein. It also appears that, under conditions in which protein synthesis is completely abolished by chloramphenicol, there is a methionine-dependent formation of a substance which subsequently promotes the synthesis of aspartate kinase upon removal of both chloramphenicol and methionine. From the heat stability data and from the results with respect to sensitivity toward lysine, it seems that the newly synthesized enzyme is a lysine-sensitive aspartate kinase. When added in vitro, methionine does not inhibit or stimulate aspartate kinase activity in the cell-free extract obtained from E. coli B grown either in minimal media or in the presence of methionine. When amino acids are used in combinations in the growth media, they seem to have an effect on the synthesis of aspartate kinase which depends upon the ratio of the intracellular concentration of the amino acids. Increased specific activity of aspartate kinase in the cell-free extract has been observed when the ratio of methionine to lysine and threonine concentrations increases beyond a certain value; decreased specific activity of the enzyme has been observed when this ratio goes below a certain value."

https://openalex.org/W1536919476,"During synthesis of long chain fatty acids by an Escherichia coli fatty acid synthetase preparation in the presence of acyl carrier protein (ACP), fatty acyl-ACP is cleaved. The cleavage in H18OH resulted in the incorporation of about 1.7 atoms of water oxygen into each molecule of fatty acid synthesized. A portion of these water oxygens entered the fatty acid as a result of an exchange reaction. Addition of acetate and malonate decreased the number of water oxygens incorporated per fatty acid synthesized to 1.2 and inhibited the exchange of oxygen between the fatty acid carboxyl group and water. Free acetate and to a much lesser extent free malonate were incorporated into fatty acid. The synthesis of fatty acid and the incorporation of acetate were differentially inhibited by high levels of ACP fraction. No transfer of oxygen from the carboxyl group of acetate to the carboxyl group of long chain fatty acids was noted. These data support the proposal that fatty acyl-ACP is hydrolytically cleaved by the E. coli fatty acid synthetase preparation. The hydrolysis reaction was not rate-limiting as shown by the lack of detectable fatty acyl-ACP levels at any time during the course of the incubation."
