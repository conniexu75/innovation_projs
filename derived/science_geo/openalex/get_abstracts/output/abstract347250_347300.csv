https://openalex.org/W2040157483,"Autophagy is a bulk degradation process in eukaryotic cells; autophagosomes enclose cytoplasmic components for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole. Autophagosome formation requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12 and Atg8 systems, which are tightly associated with expansion of autophagosomal membrane. Previous studies have suggested that there is a hierarchy between these systems; the Atg12 system is located upstream of the Atg8 system in the context of Atg protein organization. However, the concrete molecular relationship is unclear. Here, we show using an in vitro Atg8 conjugation system that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, but not unconjugated Atg12 or Atg5, strongly enhances the formation of the other conjugate, Atg8-PE. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate promotes the transfer of Atg8 from Atg3 to the substrate, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by stimulating the activity of Atg3. We also show that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate interacts with both Atg3 and PE-containing liposomes. These results indicate that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)-like enzyme for Atg8-PE conjugation reaction, distinctively promoting protein-lipid conjugation.

Autophagy is a bulk degradation process conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. In macro-autophagy, a double membrane-bound structure, the autophagosome, engulfs a portion of cytoplasmic components and fuses with the lysosome/vacuole for degradation of the contents (1Noda T.

About half of Atg proteins comprise two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12 and Atg8 systems (6Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I.

The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate further forms a ∼350-kDa multimeric complex with Atg16 (11Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Kuma A.

Here, we show that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate directly facilitates the formation of Atg8-PE as an E3-like enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Lipids, POPC (850475), DOPE (850725), dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (840035), NBD-PE (810156), NBD-sphingosine (810205), and NBD-PS (810195) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Anti-His antibody (H-5) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Atg12, Atg3, Atg8, and Atg16 antisera have been described previously (6Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y.

The cross-linker, AMAS, was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology.Plasmid Construction—We cloned every ATG gene from S. cerevisiae for the expression of recombinant proteins. For expression of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate in Escherichia coli, Atg7 and Atg10 were cloned into the pET-11a vector, and Atg12 and Atg5 were cloned into the pACYC184 vector. Briefly, an Atg7 fragment including the Shine-Dalgarno sequence was amplified from pHT1-Atg7 by PCR using primers having an NdeI site (5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCGTCAGAAAGGGTCT-3′) and a BamHI site (5′-GGGGATCCGCTAGCTTAAGCAATCTCATCAGATTC-3′). PCR product digested with NdeI and BamHI was ligated into pET-11a. An Atg10 fragment was prepared from pET-11a-Atg10 by XbaI and BamHI digestion and was ligated into the above pET-11a-Atg7 construct. In a similar fashion, an Atg5 fragment including the Shine-Dalgarno sequence was amplified from pHT1-Atg5 by PCR using primers having an NdeI site (5′-GGGGGCGCATATGAATGACATTAAACAATT-3′) and a PstI site (5′-GGCTGCAGACTAGTTTAGAGCTCAGAGGAAGCTT-3′). PCR product digested with NdeI and PstI was ligated into pACYC184. An Atg12 fragment was prepared from pHT1-Atg12 by XbaI and PstI digest and ligated into the above pACYC184-Atg5 construct. Expression plasmids encoding Atg7Myc (C-terminal Myc3-tagged Atg7), Atg3 (thrombincleavage from GST), and Atg8Gly-116 (C-terminal glycine-exposed form of Atg8) were used as described previously (18Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Atg5 was cloned into the pHT1 vector, and Atg16 and Atg10 were cloned into the pGEX6p vectors. Atg12 was cloned into the pYNGHisB vector for expression in the superworm system (Katakura industries). DNA sequences were confirmed using an automated DNA sequencer.Protein Preparation—Atg proteins were expressed in E. coli cells except for Atg12 that expressed within silkworm. Plasmids encoding Atg proteins were transformed into the E. coli BL21 or BL21 (DE3) strains (Stratagene), and cells were cultured in LB medium. Expression of each protein was induced by the addition of 50 μm (Atg7Myc, Atg3, and Atg8), 100 μm (Atg16), or 500 μm (Atg12-Atg5 and Atg5) isopropyl β-D(-)-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium. After induction, cells were disrupted by sonication in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) with 2 mm dithiothreitol for Atg7Myc, Atg3, and Atg8 or high salt buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl for Atg12-Atg5 or 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl for Atg5). Phosphate-buffered saline buffer was used for Atg16. Atg8, Atg7Myc, Atg3, and Atg16 were purified by a single step purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and cleaved from GST by the appropriate protease. For purification of Atg12-Atg5, lysates were first subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Resins were washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tri/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl 10 mm imidazole)) several times, and proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl 200 mm imidazole). After concentration, samples were subjected to gel filtration (HiLoad Superdex 75 pg 16/60) followed by a weak cation exchange chromatography (carboxy methyl (CM) Sepharose FF). Finally, samples were subjected to a second gel filtration. For purification of Atg5, lysates were first subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tri/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl 10 mm imidazole), and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl 200 mm imidazole). Eluates were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration (HiLoad Superdex 75 pg 16/60). Atg12 expressed in silkworm was recovered in a pellet fraction. Atg12 denatured by 6 m guanidine chloride was subjected to HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) and refolded on the column. All proteins were stored in buffer containing 50% glycerol at –80 or –20 °C until use.In Vitro Atg8-PE Conjugation Reaction—Atg8 lipidation reactions were carried out as described previously (18Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with the modification that the ATP regeneration system (phosphocreatine and creatine kinase) is omitted (see the exception in Fig. 1A). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer.Pull-down Assay—The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (36 pmol) was incubated with 190 pmol of GST-Atg3, GST-Atg8, and GST at 30°C for 1 h in 100 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.4) and 150 mm NaCl and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h after the addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (20 μl of slurry, GE Healthcare). Sepharose beads were washed four times in high salt buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.4), 1 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100).Cross-linking Experiment—Liposomes consisting of 50% NBD-PE/50% POPC, 20% NBD-PE/80% POPC, or 50% NBD-sphingosine/50% POPC (50 μm lipids), and cross-linker AMAS (2 mm) dissolved in Me2SO were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl) and further incubated for 15 min after the addition of 1 m glycine (final concentration: 48 mm). Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (36 pmol) were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 1 m cysteine (final concentration: 36 mm). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by LAS image analyzer (Fujifilm) for detection of NBD-fluorescence (excitation 460 nm/emission 515 nm) followed by CBB staining.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Atg12-Atg5 Conjugate Directly Accelerates the Lipidation of Atg8—We have reported that Atg8-PE can be formed in an in vitro reaction containing yeast Atg8 (a processed form), Atg7, Atg3, ATP, and liposomes containing PE (18Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Atg3 is competent for Atg8-PE formation without an E3-like enzyme unlike ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like protein conjugation reaction. However, efficient formation of Atg8-PE in vitro required high PE content within liposomes (optimal PE content is 70%), which is much higher than PE content in yeast organelle membranes (15–30%) (19Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Very little Atg8-PE is formed in reactions with low PE-containing liposomes (10–40%). This observation, in addition to the significance of the Atg12 system for the formation of Atg8-PE in vivo (15Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 20Hanada T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), prompted us to directly examine the molecular function of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate in Atg8-PE formation using an in vitro system.Recombinant Atg12-Atg5 conjugate was formed in E. coli co-expressing four components of the yeast Atg12 system (Atg12, Atg7, Atg10, and Atg5) and was purified by successive chromatography to near homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, as reported, little Atg8-PE was formed in the reaction containing 20% DOPE/80% POPC liposomes (Fig. 1A, lane 2), whereas most Atg8 was conjugated to PE in the reaction containing 70% DOPE/30% POPC liposomes (Fig. 1A, lane 4). However, in the presence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, the level of Atg8-PE formed in the reaction containing 20% DOPE/80% POPC liposomes was strikingly enhanced (Fig. 1A, lane 1), and Atg8 was completely converted to Atg8-PE in the reaction containing 70% DOPE/30% POPC liposomes (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In contrast, individually prepared components of the Atg12 system, Atg12, Atg5, or Atg10 alone, or a mixture of Atg12 and Atg5 were unable to enhance Atg8-PE formation (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8), indicating that the conjugation between Atg12 and Atg5 is essential for the function. Additionally, we confirmed that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate had neither E1 nor E2 activities for Atg8 lipidation (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2).We also examined the rate of Atg8-PE formation in reactions containing 20% DOPE/80% POPC liposomes in the presence or absence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. The rate of Atg8-PE formation increased in an Atg12-Atg5 dose-dependent manner and reached maximum at 0.5 μm (Fig. 1C). The clear enhancement of Atg8-PE formation was still observed in the presence of 110 of the amount of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate when compared with the E1 and E2 enzymes (0.1 μm). These results show that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate repeatedly functions in the acceleration of Atg8-PE formation.The Atg12-Atg5 Conjugate Functions as an E3-like Enzyme—To further define the function of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate in Atg8 lipidation, first we examined the rate of the Atg8-Atg3 complex formation with or without the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. For this experiment, we used the Atg3C234S mutant, in which the active-site cysteine at position 234 is replaced by serine, which forms a stable Atg8-Atg3C234S complex linked through an ester bond with the C-terminal glycine of Atg8 (supplemental Fig. S1) because the wild-type Atg8-Atg3 intermediate is unstable in SDS-PAGE even under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2A, the rates of Atg8-Atg3 complex formation with or without the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate were indistinguishable. Thus, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate acts on the step after the Atg8-Atg3 intermediate formation.FIGURE 2The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate facilitates the transfer of Atg8 from Atg3 to PE. A, Atg7 (1 μm), Atg3C234S mutant (1 μm), Atg8 (5 μm), and ATP (1 mm) were incubated in the presence or absence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (0.3 μm). At the indicated time points, ⅛ of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The graph shows the average amounts of Atg8-Atg3C234S (□, without Atg12-Atg5; ▪, with Atg12-Atg5) and Atg3C234S (○, without Atg12-Atg5; •, with Atg12-Atg5) at time points in triplicate experiments, and error bars indicate standard deviation. B, after formation of the Atg8-Atg3C234S complex, apyrase was added to deplete ATP, and the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and liposomes (70% DOPE, 30% POPC) were added. At the indicated time point, ⅙ of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Proteins were visualized using anti-Atg12 antiserum (upper), anti-Atg3 antiserum (middle), or anti-Atg8 antiserum (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We previously reported that Atg8-PE is not formed from the Atg8-Atg3C234S complex by itself (18Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This would be reasonable considering that Atg8 is stably linked with Atg3C234S mutant through an ester bond in the Atg8-Atg3C234S complex. Unexpectedly, however, a significant amount of Atg8 was transferred from Atg3C234S to PE by the addition of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (supplemental Fig. S2). We performed time course experiments of Atg8 lipidation after ATP depletion to observe single round reaction from the Atg8-Atg3C234S complex. It was shown that Atg8-PE was gradually formed in the presence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, accompanied by a decrease of Atg8-Atg3C234S as well as an increase of free Atg3C234S (Fig. 2B). These results clearly show that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate accelerates the step of Atg8 transfer from the E2 enzyme Atg3 to the substrate molecule PE, which corresponds to that catalyzed by E3 enzyme in ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like protein conjugation reactions (21Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar).It is suggested that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate stimulates the conjugating activity of Atg3. This result provides an explanation for the observation that the C terminus of Atg8 was covalently bound to the N terminus of Atg3 upon the addition of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (Fig. 1, A and B, asterisk); 4T. Hanada, Y. Satomi, T. Takao, and Y. Ohsumi, unpublished results. Atg3 stimulated by the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate mis-transfers Atg8 to its own N terminus when insufficient PE is present.It has not been reported that ubiquitin linked with the E2 enzyme through the ester bond is transferred to the substrate. The core structure of Atg3 resembles the canonical E2 enzymes but lacks the conserved residues around the active cysteine (22Yamada Y. Suzuki N.N. Hanada T. Ichimura Y. Kumeta H. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8036-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Atg3 may take the characteristic mechanism in conjugation differed from other E2 enzymes.The Atg12-Atg5 Conjugate Associates with Both Atg3 and PE-containing Liposomes—Further, we assessed the interaction among proteins and liposomes. First, we examined the interaction between the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and Atg3 or Atg8 using a pull-down assay. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate firmly associated with GST-Atg3 but not with GST-Atg8 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate works on Atg8 lipidation via an interaction with Atg3.FIGURE 3The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate associates with both Atg3 and PE-containing liposomes. A, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (36 pmol) were incubated with 190 pmol of GST-Atg3, GST-Atg8, and GST at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 100 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.4) and 150 mm NaCl and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h after the addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (20 μl slurry, GE Healthcare). Sepharose beads were washed four times by high salt buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.4), 1 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100). Since Atg12-Atg5 and GST-Atg3 migrate in close proximity at 75 kDa, a sample of Atg12-Atg5 with GST-Atg3 was treated by PreScission protease, which cleaves GST-Atg3 into Atg3 and GST. Sepharose bead-precipitated fractions were visualized by CBB staining (upper result) or Western blotting with anti-His antibodies (lower result). B, liposomes consisting of 50% NBD-PE/50% POPC, 20% NBD-PE/80% POPC or 50% NBD-sphingosine/50% POPC (50 μm lipids) and cross-linker AMAS (2 mm) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and further incubated for 15 min after the addition of 1 m glycine. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugates (36 pmol) were added to the reaction mixtures containing liposomes modified with cross-linker and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 1 m cysteine. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by LAS image analyzer to detect NBD fluorescence (upper) followed by CBB staining (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we tested whether the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate binds to PE-containing liposomes. We were not able to demonstrate an interaction using sedimentation analysis. 5K. Obara and Y. Ohsumi, unpublished results. Therefore, we utilized a cross-linker that reacts with amino and sulfhydryl groups (the head group in PE and cysteine residues in proteins, respectively). The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate was incubated with liposomes containing PE modified at the fatty acid moiety with the fluorescent dye NBD. We used NBD-sphingosine having a free amine group at the lipid head as a negative control. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate showed NBD fluorescence depending on the PE content of the liposomes and no fluorescence signal with NBD-sphingosine (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate promotes Atg8-PE conjugation by interacting with both Atg3 and PE-containing liposomes.Effect of Atg16 on the Stimulation of Atg8 Lipidation by the Atg12-Atg5 Conjugate—In yeast, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate forms a multimeric complex with Atg16, which is essential for autophagosome formation (12Kuma A.

Recombinant Atg12-Atg5 conjugate incubated with recombinant Atg16 formed an ∼350-kDa complex, similar in size to the complex observed in yeast lysates (Fig. 4A) (12Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This suggests that the ∼350-kDa complex formed in vivo consists of only the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and Atg16. We tested whether Atg16 is involved in the facilitation of Atg8-PE formation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the coexistence of Atg16 with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate only slightly increased the rate of Atg8-PE formation. Atg16 alone had no effect on Atg8 lipidation (data not shown). Therefore, Atg16 is not essentially required for the effective formation of Atg8-PE in vitro.FIGURE 4Atg16 is not required for acceleration of Atg8 lipidation. A, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (3.2 μg) and Atg16 (4.5 μg) were incubated and subjected toÁKTAexplorer with Superdex 200. Eluate fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Atg12 and anti-Atg16 antiserum. B, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate at the indicated concentrations was preincubated with double amount of Atg16 (for example, 0.05 μm Atg12-Atg5 with 0.1 μm Atg16) and added to reaction mixtures for Atg8 lipidation containing 1μm Atg7, 1μm Atg3, 5 μm Atg8, and 20% DOPE/80% POPC liposomes (350 μm lipids).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, Atg16 is required for Atg8-PE formation in vivo. Microscopic studies have shown that both Atg5 and Atg16 locate to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) or isolation membranes, where Atg8-PE is suggested to exist (14Mizushima N. Yamamoto A.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These localizations of Atg5 and Atg16 require the interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 (15Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 23Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Obara K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol.

Thus, we propose that interaction with Atg16 regulates the localization of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, which is required for the formation of Atg8-PE in vivo. Since the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate seems to be irreversible, interaction with Atg16 would be important for the control of its E3-like activity for Atg8 lipidation.As reported for a mammalian homolog of Atg8, LC3 (25Sou Y.S. Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3017-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we have independently found that yeast Atg8 can also form a conjugate with phosphatidylserine (PS) in vitro, although only PE-conjugated Atg8 is detected in yeast lysates (6Ichimura Y.

It is possible that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate or the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex might provide specificity toward PE against PS; however, this hypothesis was not supported by in vitro experiments (supplemental Fig. S3). Instead, local lipid composition of membranes to which the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex is targeted might provide substrate specificity for Atg8 lipidation in vivo.We have shown that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate has an E3-like activity for Atg8 lipidation. Intriguingly, one conjugate facilitates the other conjugation. It has been suggested that Atg8, probably in the form of Atg8-PE, functions in autophagosome formation (17Kirisako T. Baba M.

https://openalex.org/W3124472081,"Human beings routinely help strangers at costs to themselves. Sometimes the help offered is generous-offering more than the other expects. The proximate mechanisms supporting generosity are not well-understood, but several lines of research suggest a role for empathy. In this study, participants were infused with 40 IU oxytocin (OT) or placebo and engaged in a blinded, one-shot decision on how to split a sum of money with a stranger that could be rejected. Those on OT were 80% more generous than those given a placebo. OT had no effect on a unilateral monetary transfer task dissociating generosity from altruism. OT and altruism together predicted almost half the interpersonal variation in generosity. Notably, OT had twofold larger impact on generosity compared to altruism. This indicates that generosity is associated with both altruism as well as an emotional identification with another person."
https://openalex.org/W2104261628,"Previous work has identified alterations in histone acetylation in animal models of drug addiction and depression. However, the mechanisms which integrate drugs and stress with changes in chromatin structure remain unclear. Here, we identify the activity-dependent class II histone deacetylase, HDAC5, as a central integrator of these stimuli with changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. Chronic, but not acute, exposure to cocaine or stress decreases HDAC5 function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, which allows for increased histone acetylation and transcription of HDAC5 target genes. This regulation is behaviorally important, as loss of HDAC5 causes hypersensitive responses to chronic, not acute, cocaine or stress. These findings suggest that proper balance of histone acetylation is a crucial factor in the saliency of a given stimulus and that disruption of this balance is involved in the transition from an acute adaptive response to a chronic psychiatric illness."

We define the response spectrum, concentration dependence, and temporal dynamics of sugar-sensing neurons. Using in situ hybridization and reporter gene expression, we identify members of the Gr5a-related taste receptor subfamily that are coexpressed in sugar neurons. Neurons expressing reporters of different Gr5a-related genes send overlapping but distinct projections to the brain and thoracic ganglia. Genetic analysis of receptor genes shows that Gr5a is required for response to one subset of sugars and Gr64a for response to a complementary subset. A Gr5a;Gr64a double mutant shows no physiological or behavioral responses to any tested sugar. The simplest interpretation of our results is that Gr5a and Gr64a are each capable of functioning independently of each other within individual sugar neurons and that they are the primary receptors used in the labellum to detect sugars."
https://openalex.org/W2067761057,The hippocampus is thought to contribute to episodic memory in part by binding stimuli to their spatiotemporal context. The present study examined how hippocampal neuronal populations encode spatial and temporal context as rats performed a task in which they were required to remember the order of trial-unique sequences of odors. The results suggest that a gradual change in the pattern of hippocampal activity served as a temporal context for odor-sampling events and was important for successful subsequent memory of the order of those odors.
https://openalex.org/W2035791470,"There is a concerted global effort to digitize biodiversity occurrence data from herbarium and museum collections that together offer an unparalleled archive of life on Earth over the past few centuries. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility provides the largest single gateway to these data. Since 2004 it has provided a single point of access to specimen data from databases of biological surveys and collections. Biologists now have rapid access to more than 120 million observations, for use in many biological analyses. We investigate the quality and coverage of data digitally available, from the perspective of a biologist seeking distribution data for spatial analysis on a global scale. We present an example of automatic verification of geographic data using distributions from the International Legume Database and Information Service to test empirically, issues of geographic coverage and accuracy. There are over 1/2 million records covering 31% of all Legume species, and 84% of these records pass geographic validation. These data are not yet a global biodiversity resource for all species, or all countries. A user will encounter many biases and gaps in these data which should be understood before data are used or analyzed. The data are notably deficient in many of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The deficiencies in data coverage can be resolved by an increased application of resources to digitize and publish data throughout these most diverse regions. But in the push to provide ever more data online, we should not forget that consistent data quality is of paramount importance if the data are to be useful in capturing a meaningful picture of life on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2144251503,"Imaging studies are consistent with the existence of brain regions specialized for color, but electrophysiological studies have produced conflicting results. Here we address the neural basis for color, using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call ""globs,"" each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in ""interglob"" regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain."
https://openalex.org/W2003931473,"The scaffold protein PSD-95 promotes the maturation and strengthening of excitatory synapses, functions that require proper localization of PSD-95 in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here we report that phosphorylation of ser-295 enhances the synaptic accumulation of PSD-95 and the ability of PSD-95 to recruit surface AMPA receptors and potentiate excitatory postsynaptic currents. We present evidence that a Rac1-JNK1 signaling pathway mediates ser-295 phosphorylation and regulates synaptic content of PSD-95. Ser-295 phosphorylation is suppressed by chronic elevation, and increased by chronic silencing, of synaptic activity. Rapid dephosphorylation of ser-295 occurs in response to NMDA treatment that causes chemical long-term depression (LTD). Overexpression of a phosphomimicking mutant (S295D) of PSD-95 inhibited NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization and blocked the induction of LTD. The data suggest that synaptic strength can be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of ser-295 of PSD-95 and that synaptic depression requires the dephosphorylation of ser-295."
https://openalex.org/W2013419733,"Barcodes are short segments of DNA that can be used to uniquely identify an unknown specimen to species, particularly when diagnostic morphological features are absent. These sequences could offer a new forensic tool in plant and animal conservation-especially for endangered species such as members of the Cycadales. Ideally, barcodes could be used to positively identify illegally obtained material even in cases where diagnostic features have been purposefully removed or to release confiscated organisms into the proper breeding population. In order to be useful, a DNA barcode sequence must not only easily PCR amplify with universal or near-universal reaction conditions and primers, but also contain enough variation to generate unique identifiers at either the species or population levels. Chloroplast regions suggested by the Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBoL), and two alternatives, the chloroplast psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS), were tested for their utility in generating unique identifiers for members of the Cycadales. Ease of amplification and sequence generation with universal primers and reaction conditions was determined for each of the seven proposed markers. While none of the proposed markers provided unique identifiers for all species tested, nrITS showed the most promise in terms of variability, although sequencing difficulties remain a drawback. We suggest a workflow for DNA barcoding, including database generation and management, which will ultimately be necessary if we are to succeed in establishing a universal DNA barcode for plants."

Elucidating the pathways that regulate the cytoskeleton to drive these processes is fundamental to our understanding of cortical development.

Cortical fiber tract defects in the absence of Ena/VASP arise from a failure in neurite initiation, a prerequisite for axon formation.

The intricate structure of the mammalian forebrain is formed through orchestrated movement of neurons and their processes. Neurons born in internal germinal regions migrate tangentially and radially to occupy more superficial layers and establish the architectonic framework of the forebrain (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003Marin O. Rubenstein J.L. Cell migration in the forebrain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Migrating neurons possess leading and trailing processes morphologically similar to growth cones (Lambert de Rouvroit and Goffinet, 2001Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Neuronal migration.Mech.

Subsequent guided outgrowth of axons forms the fiber tracts essential for cortical function (Sur and Rubenstein, 2005Sur M. Rubenstein J.L. Patterning and plasticity of the cerebral cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Similar guidance molecules are used by both the leading processes of migrating neurons and axonal growth cones, suggesting there could be functional similarities between these two structures (Lambert de Rouvroit and Goffinet, 2001Lambert de Rouvroit C.

Little is known, however, about the mechanisms underlying the initial emergence of axons from the neuronal cell body (Luo, 2002Luo L. Actin cytoskeleton regulation in neuronal morphogenesis and structural plasticity.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 601-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Neurons are born as spherical cells, yet their biology requires a highly polarized morphology. Sprouting of neurites—cylindrical extensions tipped by growth cones that lack the defining features of an axon or dendrite—from spherical neurons breaks their symmetry (da Silva and Dotti, 2002da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Breaking the neuronal sphere: regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in neuritogenesis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro, cortical neurons form neurites after 1 day in culture, followed by rapid elongation of one neurite to form an axon (de Lima et al., 1997de Lima A.D. Merten M.D. Voigt T. Neuritic differentiation and synaptogenesis in serum-free neuronal cultures of the rat cerebral cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 382: 230-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vivo, neuritogenesis is believed to occur shortly after neuronal commitment in the germinal layer; axon formation only occurs after migration has commenced (Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C. Martinez-Cerdeno V. Ivic L. Kriegstein A.R. Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that fundamental events in neurite formation are similar in vitro and in vivo (da Silva and Dotti, 2002da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Breaking the neuronal sphere: regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in neuritogenesis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar); however, little evidence exists to support this, and the molecular mechanisms underlying neurite formation remain largely unknown. Actin regulatory proteins play a key role in neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth and guidance. Ena/VASP proteins bind actin and regulate the assembly and geometry of F-actin networks by antagonizing capping proteins and bundling actin filaments (Krause et al., 2003Krause M. Dent E.W. Bear J.E.

Here we report the first examination of cortical development in the complete absence of Ena/VASP. We show that loss of Ena/VASP causes two defects in neuronal migration during corticogenesis: a defect in cortical positioning and a non-cell-autonomous defect in pial membrane integrity that causes neuronal ectopias. Unexpectedly, we find that loss of Ena/VASP blocks axon fiber tract formation in the cortex, and we demonstrate that this defect results from the failure of cortical neurons to produce neurites. We offer further evidence to suggest that the defect in neurite formation results from the inability of Ena/VASP-deficient neurons to make filopodia. Finally, we demonstrate that neurite formation can be uncoupled from neuronal migration. Our results define new roles for Ena/VASP in corticogenesis and offer new insights into the relationship between axon formation and neuronal migration. Vertebrates possess three Ena/VASP proteins: Mena (mammalian enabled), VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein), and EVL (Ena-VASP like) (Gertler et al., 1996Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M.

Mena is required for neurulation and commissure formation.Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and VASP (Aszodi et al., 1999Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.H. Ny L. Andersson K.E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fässler R. The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is involved in cGMP- and cAMP-mediated inhibition of agonist-induced platelet aggregation, but is dispensable for smooth muscle function.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) mutant lines, and viable Ena/VASP triple mutant combinations intercrossed. Results from these crosses are shown in Figure 1D. Triple null (mmvvee) progeny were never observed at P10 (0 of 11 expected). Interestingly, a single allele of Mena was sufficient to produce viable and fertile mice, albeit at a significantly reduced frequency. In contrast, neither two alleles of EVL (mmvvEE; Menzies et al., 2004Menzies A.S. Aszodi A. Williams S.E. Pfeifer A. Wehman A.M. Goh K.L. Mason C.A. Fässler R. Gertler F.B. Mena and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein are required for multiple actin-dependent processes that shape the vertebrate nervous system.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8029-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) nor two alleles of VASP (mmVVee, this study, data not shown) were sufficient for viability. Thus, Mena was the most critical Ena/VASP protein for development and survival, though whether this reflected a unique expression pattern, level, and/or indispensable function of Mena remains unclear. Mice possessing one allele of Mena and a second Ena/VASP allele (MMvvee, MmVvee, MmvvEe) were viable with no obvious defects in brain morphology (data not shown) and were used as controls for histological and cell biological experiments. To determine how far mmvvee mutants progressed through development, timed matings between triple mutant combinations were established and embryos isolated at E10.5 and E16.5. Interestingly, 93% (28/30) of expected mmvvee embryos were collected at E10.5, and 89% (34/38) were recovered at E16.5 (Figure 1E). Therefore, Ena/VASP proteins were not required for cell migration during early developmental events such as gastrulation. Lethality of mmvvee mice occurred between E16.5 and P0 and resulted from a number of defects, including intraamniotic hemorrhage, hydrops fetalis, and frequent exencephaly. Extraneuronal phenotypes will be described elsewhere (Furman et al., 2007Furman C. Sieminski A.L. Kwiatkowski A.V. Rubinson D.A. Vasile E. Bronson R.T. Fässler R. Gertler F.B. Ena/VASP is required for endothelial barrier function in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar); here we focus on phenotypes affecting cortical development. The majority of mmvvee embryos (86%) were exencephalic, precluding analysis of brain development. Since nonexencephalic mmvvee embryos were limiting, we employed MRI to assay for structural lesions noninvasively. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed hydrocephalus ex vacuo in the mmvvee embryo (Figure 2B, compare to 2A). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of brain sections confirmed defects in ventricle size and total brain matter in mmvvee brains (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) with no evidence of increased apoptosis, confirmed by TUNEL assay (data not shown). Diffusion tensor microimaging (μDTI) permits visualization of brain organization, including cortical layering and individual fiber tracts (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang J. Miller M.I. Plachez C. Richards L.J. Yarowsky P. van Zijl P. Mori S. Mapping postnatal mouse brain development with diffusion tensor microimaging.Neuroimage. 2005; 26: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Strikingly, μDTI revealed an additional cortical layer outside the cortical plate (CP) in the mmvvee cortex (Figure 2D, blue arrow, compare to control in 2C). Subsequent histological analysis revealed that this additional cortical layer corresponded to neuronal ectopias (Figure 2E, black arrows; Figure S1), hallmarks of the human congenital malformation cobblestone cortex (Olson and Walsh, 2002Olson E.C. Walsh C.A. Smooth, rough and upside-down neocortical development.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ectopias were observed in 5 of 7 nonexencephalic mmvvee brains studied, but never in brains from embryos expressing one or more Ena/VASP allele. Ectopias appeared as stochastic and infrequent (0–10 per brain) intrusions beyond the pial membrane (PM) with marked tangential spread of ectopic neurons within the subarachnoid space (Figures 2E and 2I; Figure S1). β3-tubulin staining confirmed that ectopias were comprised largely of differentiated neurons (Figure 2F). Known human syndromes—Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, muscle-eye-brain disease, Walker-Warburg syndrome—and mouse models of cobblestone cortex are associated with defects in PM formation and integrity (Olson and Walsh, 2002Olson E.C. Walsh C.A. Smooth, rough and upside-down neocortical development.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Laminin is the predominant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein of the PM and is produced and organized by meningeal fibroblasts (Miner and Yurchenco, 2004Miner J.H. Yurchenco P.D. Laminin functions in tissue morphogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 255-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, Sievers et al., 1994Sievers J. Pehlemann F.W. Gude S. Berry M. Meningeal cells organize the superficial glia limitans of the cerebellum and produce components of both the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane.J. Neurocytol. 1994; 23: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Failure of meningeal fibroblasts to produce and organize laminin properly has been linked to ectopia formation in mouse models of cobblestone cortex (Beggs et al., 2003Beggs H.E. Schahin-Reed D. Zang K. Goebbels S. Nave K.A. Gorski J. Jones K.R. Sretavan D. Reichardt L.F. FAK deficiency in cells contributing to the basal lamina results in cortical abnormalities resembling congenital muscular dystrophies.Neuron. 2003; 40: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We cultured meningeal fibroblasts from mmvvee mutants and found that, similar to controls (Figure 2G), mmvvee cells secreted and organized laminin into fibrillar structures (Figure 2H). Consistent with this, laminin staining in mmvvee brains lacking ectopias appeared similar to controls (Figures 4G and 4H). Although breaks in the laminin matrix were observed at sites of ectopic neuron exit, laminin staining surrounding ectopias appeared normal (Figures 2I and 2L). Radial glia processes span the cortex and their endfeet contact with, and promote organization of, the basement membrane (Halfter et al., 2002Halfter W. Dong S. Yip Y.P. Willem M. Mayer U. A critical function of the pial basement membrane in cortical histogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6029-6040PubMed Google Scholar). Disruptions in endfeet attachment to the PM are observed in multiple mouse models of cobblestone cortex (Beggs et al., 2003Beggs H.E. Schahin-Reed D. Zang K. Goebbels S. Nave K.A. Gorski J. Jones K.R. Sretavan D. Reichardt L.F.

Integrin-linked kinase deletion from mouse cortex results in cortical lamination defects resembling cobblestone lissencephaly.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7022-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To assess radial glia morphology, we stained control and mmvvee cortices for the radial glia marker nestin. Well-organized, nestin-positive glia were observed making contact with the PM in control cortices (Figure 2J). Along the PM, the tufted endfeet of radial glia were conspicuous (Figure 2J, white arrow and inset). In mmvvee cortices lacking ectopias, nestin staining was reduced in areas along the PM (Figure 2K, white arrow and inset), reflecting a possible defect in endfoot formation and/or attachment. Interestingly, aberrant extension of radial processes into ectopic growths was noted (Figure 2L, white arrows). We speculate that loss of Ena/VASP disrupts radial glia endfoot morphology and/or function, compromising barrier integrity and permitting ectopia formation. The extent of neuronal tangential spread within mmvvee ectopias is distinct from other models of cobblestone cortex and may represent a defect in neuronal migration. During corticogenesis, neurons born in the ventricular zone (VZ) migrate radially outward to form the CP. The CP is generated with an inside-out topology, with later-born neurons migrating beyond earlier-born neurons to form the superficial layers of the cortex (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003Marin O. Rubenstein J.L. Cell migration in the forebrain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether loss of Ena/VASP disrupted CP topology; however, nonexencephalic mmvvee embryos were severely limited in number. Furthermore, neuronal ectopias in mmvvee embryos altered CP topology drastically (Figures 2E and 2I; Figure S1), making it difficult to discern a primary defect in neuronal migration. Therefore, we generated chimeric embryos composed of Ena/VASP null (mmvvee) and wild-type (WT) cells to overcome these obstacles and permit analysis of cell-autonomous defects in neuronal migration. To construct chimeric embryos, we isolated and cultured mmvvee embryonic stem (ES) cells, and infected these cells with lentivirus expressing EGFP. Stable, EGFP-expressing (GFP+) mmvvee ES cell clones were isolated, expanded, and then injected into WT blastocysts (Figure 3A). Chimeric embryos were harvested from E16.5 to E18.5. As hoped, mid to high percentage chimeras (>50% GFP+ mmvvee cells) were not exencephalic, permitting analysis of forebrain structure and composition. Gross cortical architecture appeared unperturbed in chimeric brains, with GFP+ mmvvee cells distributed broadly (Figure S2). Interestingly, neuronal ectopias were never observed in chimeric embryos, even in those in which the vast majority of cortical neurons were mmvvee in origin (Figure S2), indicating that the underlying cause of neuronal ectopia formation was likely nonautonomous. To determine if loss of Ena/VASP affected neuronal migration and cortical layering, we stained E18.5 chimeric cortices for the layer-specific transcription factors Tbr1 (layer VI) (Hevner et al., 2001Hevner R.F. Shi L. Justice N. Hsueh Y. Sheng M. Smiga S. Bulfone A. Goffinet A.M. Campagnoni A.T. Rubenstein J.L. Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6.Neuron. 2001; 29: 353-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and Foxp1 (layers III-V) (Ferland et al., 2003Ferland R.J. Cherry T.J. Preware P.O. Morrisey E.E. Walsh C.A. Characterization of Foxp2 and Foxp1 mRNA and protein in the developing and mature brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 460: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). For each layer marker, the distribution of WT (GFP−) and mmvvee (GFP+) nuclei was examined. Nearly all Tbr1-positive nuclei were located within a 450–500 nm thick band above the intermediate zone (IZ), the expected location of layer VI (Figure 3B). Interestingly, GFP+/Tbr1+ mmvvee nuclei were shifted outward significantly within the band, occupying a more superficial region of layer IV compared to WT nuclei (Figure 3C). A similar trend was observed in Foxp1+ nuclei: GFP+ mmvvee nuclei were shifted outward significantly within, but not outside of, layers III-V (Figures 3D and 3E). Thus, while Ena/VASP was dispensable for neuronal migration and CP formation, intralayer neuronal positioning was altered. μDTI revealed that, in regions without ectopias, the gross architecture of the CP was preserved in the mmvvee embryo (Figures 4B and 4D) compared to the control (Figures 4A and 4C). However, the mmvvee embryo IZ lacked μDTI signal, indicating absence of organized axon tracts (Figures 4C and 4D; orange arrow points to IZ). Further μDTI analysis revealed that all cortical fiber tracts were absent in the mmvvee brain, including all major forebrain commissures and the internal capsule (IC; data not shown). Histological examination confirmed that cortical architecture, ectopias aside, was largely normal in mmvvee cortices (Figure 2E; Figure S1). However, DAPI staining revealed that the relatively cell-free IZ in mmvvee cortices was significantly thinner than in littermate controls (Figure 4F, compare to 4E). The IZ is comprised largely of axons from migrating and established CP neurons; thus, the observed defects could result from a failure either to form or elongate axons in vivo. To establish if loss of Ena/VASP perturbed fiber tract formation, cortical sections were stained for mid-sized neurofilament protein (NF). NF proteins are abundant intermediate filament proteins concentrated in mature axons and serve as a marker for axonal outgrowth and maturation (Elder et al., 1998Elder G.A. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Bosco P. Kang C. Gourov A. Tu P.H. Lee V.M. Lazzarini R.A. Absence of the mid-sized neurofilament subunit decreases axonal calibers, levels of light neurofilament (NF-L), and neurofilament content.J.

Axon caliber related to neurofilaments and microtubules in sciatic nerve fibers of rats and mice.Anat. Rec. 1970; 167: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In controls, the NF antibody decorated mature axons in the IZ and IC (Figure 4G). In striking contrast, the IZ of mmvvee cortices was nearly devoid of NF+ axons (Figure 4H), with only a few NF+ fibers near where the IC should be found. The lack of NF labeling suggested that mature axons were not formed in mmvvee cortices, resulting in a thin and disorganized IZ and preventing cortical fiber tract assembly. To determine if axons were formed, sections from control and mmvvee cortices were stained with an antibody to dephospho-Tau (Tau-1), a specific marker for axons in situ. In control sections, Tau-1 labeling was strongest in the axon-rich IZ (Figure 4I). Staining was also observed in the CP and subventricular zone (SVZ), where individual fibers were observed. In mmvvee cortices, Tau-1 staining was observed in the rudimentary IZ, where it labeled disorganized and snarled fiber-like structures (Figure 4J, white asterisk). Reduced staining was also noted in areas of the SVZ, possibly reflecting a failure of radially migrating cortical neu"
https://openalex.org/W2026153973,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of rhesus monkeys has been found to encode the behavioral meaning of categories of sensory stimuli. When animals are instructed with sensory cues to make either eye or hand movements to a target, PPC cells also show specificity depending on which effector (eye or hand) is instructed for the movement. To determine whether this selectivity retrospectively reflects the behavioral meaning of the cue or prospectively encodes the movement plan, we trained monkeys to autonomously choose to acquire a target in the absence of direct instructions specifying which effector to use. Activity in PPC showed strong specificity for effector choice, with cells in the lateral intraparietal area selective for saccades and cells in the parietal reach region selective for reaches. Such differential activity associated with effector choice under identical stimulus conditions provides definitive evidence that the PPC is prospectively involved in action selection and movement preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1989123634,"Background Although early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered a potentially curable disease following complete resection, patients have a wide spectrum of survival according to stage (IB, II, IIIA). Within each stage, gene expression profiles can identify patients with a higher risk of recurrence. We hypothesized that altered mRNA expression in nine genes could help to predict disease outcome: excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) and Twist1 (which regulate N-cadherin expression), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), BRCA1, and the human homolog of yeast budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (BubR1). Methodology and Principal Findings We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) in frozen lung cancer tissue specimens from 126 chemonaive NSCLC patients who had undergone surgical resection and evaluated the association between gene expression levels and survival. For validation, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from 58 other NSCLC patients. A strong inter-gene correlation was observed between expression levels of all genes except NFAT. A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that along with disease stage, BRCA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-6]; P = 0.02). In the independent cohort of 58 patients, BRCA1 mRNA expression also significantly correlated with survival (HR, 2.4 [95%CI, 1.01-5.92]; P = 0.04). Conclusions Overexpression of BRCA1 mRNA was strongly associated with poor survival in NSCLC patients, and the validation of this finding in an independent data set further strengthened this association. Since BRCA1 mRNA expression has previously been linked to differential sensitivity to cisplatin and antimicrotubule drugs, BRCA1 mRNA expression may provide additional information for customizing adjuvant antimicrotubule-based chemotherapy, especially in stage IB, where the role of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2099736392,"Immature stages of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae experience high mortality, but its cause is poorly understood. Here we study the impact of rainfall, one of the abiotic factors to which the immatures are frequently exposed, on their mortality.We show that rainfall significantly affected larval mosquitoes by flushing them out of their aquatic habitat and killing them. Outdoor experiments under natural conditions in Kenya revealed that the additional nightly loss of larvae caused by rainfall was on average 17.5% for the youngest (L1) larvae and 4.8% for the oldest (L4) larvae; an additional 10.5% (increase from 0.9 to 11.4%) of the L1 larvae and 3.3% (from 0.1 to 3.4%) of the L4 larvae were flushed away and larval mortality increased by 6.9% (from 4.6 to 11.5%) and 1.5% (from 4.1 to 5.6%) for L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, compared to nights without rain. On rainy nights, 1.3% and 0.7% of L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, were lost due to ejection from the breeding site.This study demonstrates that immature populations of malaria mosquitoes suffer high losses during rainfall events. As these populations are likely to experience several rain showers during their lifespan, rainfall will have a profound effect on the productivity of mosquito breeding sites and, as a result, on the transmission of malaria. These findings are discussed in the light of malaria risk and changing rainfall patterns in response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1993020997,"Synaptic activity induces changes in the number of dendritic spines. Here, we report a pathway of regulated endocytosis triggered by arcadlin, a protocadherin induced by electroconvulsive and other excitatory stimuli in hippocampal neurons. The homophilic binding of extracellular arcadlin domains activates TAO2β, a splice variant of the thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 2, cloned here by virtue of its binding to the arcadlin intracellular domain. TAO2β is a MAPKKK that activates the MEK3 MAPKK, which phosphorylates the p38 MAPK. Activation of p38 feeds-back on TAO2β, phosphorylating a key serine required for triggering endocytosis of N-cadherin at the synapse. Arcadlin knockout increases the number of dendritic spines, and the phenotype is rescued by siRNA knockdown of N-cadherin. This pathway of regulated endocytosis of N-cadherin via protocadherin/TAO2β/MEK3/p38 provides a molecular mechanism for transducing neuronal activity into changes in synaptic morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W2062113263,"Dynamic mechanical allodynia is a widespread and intractable symptom of neuropathic pain for which there is a lack of effective therapy. During tactile allodynia, activation of the sensory fibers which normally detect touch elicits pain. Here we provide a new behavioral investigation into the dynamic component of tactile allodynia that developed in rats after segmental removal of glycine inhibition. Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings, we show that in this condition innocuous mechanical stimuli could activate superficial dorsal horn nociceptive specific neurons. These neurons do not normally respond to touch. We anatomically show that the activation was mediated through a local circuit involving neurons expressing the gamma isoform of protein kinase C (PKCγ). Selective inhibition of PKCγ as well as selective blockade of glutamate NMDA receptors in the superficial dorsal horn prevented both activation of the circuit and allodynia. Thus, our data demonstrates that a normally inactive circuit in the dorsal horn can be recruited to convert touch into pain. It also provides evidence that glycine inhibitory dysfunction gates tactile input to nociceptive specific neurons through PKCγ-dependent activation of a local, excitatory, NMDA receptor-dependent, circuit. As a consequence of these findings, we suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PKCγ might provide a new tool for alleviating allodynia in the clinical setting."

The study aimed to investigate the effect of a flaxseed-derived lignan supplement on glycemic control, lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients. Methodology/Principal Findings This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial and it was conducted between April and December 2006 in Shanghai, China. Seventy-three type 2 diabetic patients with mild hypercholesterolemia were enrolled into the study. Patients were randomized to supplementation with flaxseed-derived lignan capsules (360 mg lignan per day) or placebo for 12 weeks, separated by an 8-week wash-out period. HbA1c, lipid profiles, insulin resistance index and inflammatory factors were measured. Sixty-eight completed the study and were included in the analyses. The lignan supplement significantly improved glycemic control as measured by HbA1c (-0.10±0.65 % vs. 0.09±0.52 %, P = 0.001) compared to placebo; however, no significant changes were observed in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance and blood lipid profiles. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites (enterodiol and enterolactone) was significantly higher after the lignan supplement intervention compared to baseline (14.2±18.1 vs. 1.2±2.4 µg/mL, P<0.001). Data also suggested minimal competition between lignan and isoflavones for bioavailability when measured by the excretion concentrations. Conclusions/Significance Daily lignan supplementation resulted in modest, yet statistically significant improvements in glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients without apparently affecting fasting glucose, lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the efficacy of lignans on type 2 diabetes. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00363233"
https://openalex.org/W2046793599,"Despite a typically good response to first-line combination chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with advanced ovarian cancer remains poor because of acquired chemoresistance. The use of targeted therapies such as trastuzumab may potentially improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer. HER2 overexpression/amplification has been reported in ovarian cancer, but the exact percentage of HER2-positive tumors varies widely in the literature. In this study, HER2 gene status was evaluated in a large, multicentric series of 320 patients with advanced ovarian cancer, including 243 patients enrolled in a multicenter prospective clinical trial of paclitaxel/carboplatin-based chemotherapy.The HER2 status of primary tumors and metastases was evaluated by both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue on conventional slides. The prognostic impact of HER2 expression was analyzed. HER2 gene was overexpressed and amplified in 6.6% of analyzed tumors. Despite frequent intratumoral heterogeneity, no statistically significant difference was detected between primary tumors and corresponding metastases.Our results show that the decision algorithm usually used in breast cancer (IHC as a screening test, with equivocal results confirmed by FISH) is appropriate in ovarian cancer. In contrast to previous series, HER2-positive status did not influence outcome in the present study, possibly due to the fact that patients in our study received paclitaxel/carboplatin-based chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2052035616,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is important during bone development and repair. Because matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13, collagenase-3) plays a role in long bone development, we have examined its role during adult skeletal repair. In this study we find that MMP13 is expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the fracture callus. We demonstrate that MMP13 is required for proper resorption of hypertrophic cartilage and for normal bone remodeling during non-stabilized fracture healing, which occurs via endochondral ossification. However, no difference in callus strength was detected in the absence of MMP13. Transplant of wild-type bone marrow, which reconstitutes cells only of the hematopoietic lineage, did not rescue the endochondral repair defect, indicating that impaired healing in Mmp13-/- mice is intrinsic to cartilage and bone. Mmp13-/- mice also exhibited altered bone remodeling during healing of stabilized fractures and cortical defects via intramembranous ossification. This indicates that the bone phenotype occurs independently from the cartilage phenotype. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MMP13 is involved in normal remodeling of bone and cartilage during adult skeletal repair, and that MMP13 may act directly in the initial stages of ECM degradation in these tissues prior to invasion of blood vessels and osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W1990639604,"The epidermis (containing primarily keratinocytes and melanocytes) overlies the dermis (containing primarily fibroblasts) of human skin. We previously reported that dickkopf 1 (DKK1) secreted by fibroblasts in the dermis elicits the hypopigmented phenotype of palmoplantar skin due to suppression of melanocyte function and growth via the regulation of two important signaling factors, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and beta-catenin. We now report that treatment of keratinocytes with DKK1 increases their proliferation and decreases their uptake of melanin and that treatment of reconstructed skin with DKK1 induces a thicker and less pigmented epidermis. DNA microarray analysis revealed many genes regulated by DKK1, and several with critical expression patterns were validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. DKK1 induced the expression of keratin 9 and alpha-Kelch-like ECT2 interacting protein (alphaKLEIP) but down-regulated the expression of beta-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, protein kinase C, and proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), which is consistent with the expression patterns of those proteins in human palmoplantar skin. Treatment of reconstructed skin with DKK1 reproduced the expression patterns of those key proteins observed in palmoplantar skin. These findings further elucidate why human skin is thicker and paler on the palms and soles than on the trunk through topographical and site-specific differences in the secretion of DKK1 by dermal fibroblasts that affects the overlying epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2034160470,"Background The pathogenesis of sepsis is mediated in part by bacterial endotoxin, which stimulates macrophages/monocytes to sequentially release early (e.g., TNF, IL-1, and IFN-γ) and late (e.g., HMGB1) pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our recent discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal sepsis has prompted investigation for development of new experimental therapeutics. We previously reported that green tea brewed from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis is effective in inhibiting endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release. Methods and Findings Here we demonstrate that its major component, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), but not catechin or ethyl gallate, dose-dependently abrogated HMGB1 release in macrophage/monocyte cultures, even when given 2–6 hours post LPS stimulation. Intraperitoneal administration of EGCG protected mice against lethal endotoxemia, and rescued mice from lethal sepsis even when the first dose was given 24 hours after cecal ligation and puncture. The therapeutic effects were partly attributable to: 1) attenuation of systemic accumulation of proinflammatory mediator (e.g., HMGB1) and surrogate marker (e.g., IL-6 and KC) of lethal sepsis; and 2) suppression of HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses by preventing clustering of exogenous HMGB1 on macrophage cell surface. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest a novel mechanism by which the major green tea component, EGCG, protects against lethal endotoxemia and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2066476513,"Neural crest cells (NCC) have the particularity to invade the environment where they differentiate after separation from the neuroepithelium. This process, called delamination, is strikingly different between cranial and trunk NCCs. If signalings controlling slow trunk delamination start being deciphered, mechanisms leading to massive and rapid cranial outflow are poorly documented. Here, we show that the chick cranial NCCs delamination is the result of two events: a substantial cell mobilization and an epithelium to mesenchyme transition (EMT). We demonstrate that ets-1, a transcription factor specifically expressed in cranial NCCs, is responsible for the former event by recruiting massively cranial premigratory NCCs independently of the S-phase of the cell cycle and by leading the gathered cells to straddle the basal lamina. However, it does not promote the EMT process alone but can cooperate with snail-2 (previously called slug) to this event. Altogether, these data lead us to propose that ets-1 plays a pivotal role in conferring specific cephalic characteristics on NCC delamination."

This region has particularly high levels of MDR-TB, with 13% and 40% among new and previously treated cases, respectively.This study describes the treatment process and outcomes for the first cohort of patients enrolled in the programme, between October 2003 and January 2005. Confirmed MDR-TB cases were treated with an individualised, second-line drug regimen based on drug susceptibility test results, while suspected MDR-TB cases were treated with a standardised regimen pending susceptibility results.Of 108 MDR-TB patients, 87 were started on treatment during the study period. Of these, 33 (38%) were infected with strains resistant to at least one second-line drug at baseline, but none had initial ofloxacin resistance. Treatment was successful for 54 (62%) patients, with 13 (15%) dying during treatment, 12 (14%) defaulting and 8 (8%) failing treatment. Poor clinical condition and baseline second-line resistance contributed to treatment failure or death. Treatment regimens were changed in 71 (82%) patients due to severe adverse events or drug resistance. Adverse events were most commonly attributed to cycloserine, ethionamide and p-aminosalicylic acid. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) was found among 4 of the 6 patients who failed treatment and were still alive in November 2006.While acceptable treatment success was achieved, the complexity of treatment and the development of XDR-TB among treatment failures are important issues to be addressed when considering scaling up MDR-TB treatment."

In order to assess whether defects of EBV-specific immunity may contribute to the tumor, the phenotype and function of circulating T-cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were investigated in untreated NPC patients. Circulating naïve CD3+CD45RA+ and CD4+CD25- cells were decreased, while activated CD4+CD25+ T-cells and CD3-CD16+ NK-cells were increased in patients compared to healthy donors. The frequency of T-cells recognizing seven HLA-A2 restricted epitopes in LMP1 and LMP2 was lower in the patients and remained low after stimulation with autologous EBV-carrying cells. TILs expanded in low doses of IL-2 exhibited an increase of CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD45RO+ and CD4+CD25+ cells and 2 to 5 fold higher frequency of LMP1 and LMP2 tetramer positive cells compared to peripheral blood. EBV-specific cytotoxicity could be reactivated from the blood of most patients, whereas the TILs lacked cytotoxic activity and failed to produce IFNgamma upon specific stimulation. Thus, EBV-specific rejection responses appear to be functionally inactivated at the tumor site in NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2068194172,"While the motor and attentional roles of the frontal eye field (FEF) are well documented, the relationship between them is unknown. We exploited the known influence of visual motion on the apparent positions of targets, and measured how this illusion affects saccadic eye movements during FEF microstimulation. Without microstimulation, saccades to a moving grating are biased in the direction of motion, consistent with the apparent position illusion. Here we show that microstimulation of spatially aligned FEF representations increases the influence of this illusion on saccades. Rather than simply impose a fixed-vector signal, subthreshold stimulation directed saccades away from the FEF movement field, and instead more strongly in the direction of visual motion. These results demonstrate that the attentional effects of FEF stimulation govern visually guided saccades, and suggest that the two roles of the FEF work together to select both the features of a target and the appropriate movement to foveate it."

CF ascending branches innervate Purkinje cells while CF transverse branches show a near complete failure to form conventional synapses. Time-lapse imaging over hours or days revealed that ascending branches were very stable. However, transverse branches were highly dynamic, exhibiting rapid elongation and retraction and varicosity turnover. Thus, different branches of the same axon, with different innervation patterns, display branch type-specific motility in the adult cerebellum. Furthermore, dynamic changes in transverse branch length were almost completely suppressed by pharmacological stimulation of olivary firing."
https://openalex.org/W2122123816,"The ability to encode rules and to detect rule-violating events outside the focus of attention is vital for adaptive behavior. Our brain recordings reveal that violations of abstract auditory rules are processed even when the sounds are unattended. When subjects performed a task related to the sounds but not to the rule, rule violations impaired task performance and activated a network involving supratemporal, parietal and frontal areas although none of the subjects acquired explicit knowledge of the rule or became aware of rule violations. When subjects tried to behaviorally detect rule violations, the brain's automatic violation detection facilitated intentional detection. This shows the brain's capacity for abstraction - an important cognitive function necessary to model the world. Our study provides the first evidence for the task-independence (i.e. automaticity) of this ability to encode abstract rules and for its immediate consequences for subsequent mental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2124977648,"Through T cell receptors (TCRs), T cells can detect and respond to very small numbers of foreign peptides among a huge number of self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). How T cells achieve such remarkable sensitivity and specificity through pMHC-TCR binding is an intensively pursued issue in immunology today; the key question is how pMHC-TCR binding initiates, or triggers, a signal from TCRs. Multiple competing models have been proposed, none of which fully explains the sensitivity and specificity of TCR triggering. What has been omitted from existing theories is that the pMHC-TCR interaction at the T cell/APC interface must be under constant mechanical stress, due to the dynamic nature of cell-cell interaction. Taking this condition into consideration, we propose the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering. In this model, TCR signaling is initiated by conformational changes of the TCR/CD3 complex, induced by a pulling force originating from the cytoskeleton and transmitted through pMHC-TCR binding interactions with enough strength to resist rupture. By introducing mechanical force into a model of T cell signal initiation, the receptor deformation model provides potential mechanistic solutions to the sensitivity and specificity of TCR triggering."
https://openalex.org/W2049346740,"Background Malathion 0.5% has been the most prescribed pediculicide in the United Kingdom for around 10 years, and is widely used in Europe and North America. Anecdotal reports suggest malathion treatments are less effective than formerly, but this has not been confirmed clinically. This study was designed to determine whether malathion is still effective and if 4% dimeticone lotion is a more effective treatment for head louse infestation. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed this study as an assessor blinded, randomised, controlled, parallel group trial involving 58 children and 15 adults with active head louse infestation. Each participant received two applications 7 days apart of either 4% dimeticone lotion, applied for 8 hours or overnight, or 0.5% malathion liquid applied for 12 hours or overnight. All treatment and check-up visits were conducted in participants' homes. Cure of infestation was defined as no evidence of head lice after the second treatment. Some people were found free from lice but later reinfested. Worst case, intention to treat, analysis found dimeticone was significantly more effective than malathion, with 30/43 (69.8%) participants cured using dimeticone compared with 10/30 (33.3%) using malathion (p<0.01, difference 36.4%, 95% confidence interval 14.7% to 58.2%). Per protocol analysis showed cure rates of 30/39 (76.9%) and 10/29 (34.5%) respectively. Irritant reactions were observed in only two participants, both treated with malathion. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that, although malathion liquid is still effective for some people, dimeticone lotion offers a significantly more effective alternative treatment for most people.

https://openalex.org/W2057579697,"Nucleolar dominance is an epigenetic phenomenon in plant and animal genetic hybrids that describes the expression of 45S ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA genes) inherited from only one progenitor due to the silencing of the other progenitor's rRNA genes. rRNA genes are tandemly arrayed at nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) that span millions of basepairs, thus gene silencing in nucleolar dominance occurs on a scale second only to X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals. In Arabidopsis suecica, the allotetraploid hybrid of A. thaliana and A. arenosa, the A. thaliana -derived rRNA genes are subjected to nucleolar dominance and are silenced via repressive chromatin modifications. However, the developmental stage at which nucleolar dominance is established in A. suecica is currently unknown. We show that nucleolar dominance is not apparent in seedling cotyledons formed during embryogenesis but becomes progressively established during early postembryonic development in tissues derived from both the shoot and root apical meristems. The progressive silencing of A. thaliana rRNA genes correlates with the transition of A. thaliana NORs from a decondensed euchromatic state associated with histone H3 that is trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) to a highly condensed heterochromatic state in which the NORs are associated with H3K9me2 and 5-methylcytosine-enriched chromocenters. In RNAi-lines in which the histone deacetylases HDA6 and HDT1 are knocked down, the developmentally regulated condensation and inactivation of A. thaliana NORs is disrupted. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HDA6 and HDT1 function in the postembryonic establishment of nucleolar dominance, a process which recurs in each generation."

DNA replication is a fundamental event of life. Studies on the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication in a variety of organisms from the three biological domains, bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea, are frequently published (for review, see Refs. 1Mott M.L. Berger J.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 2Fujita M. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Barry E.R. Bell S.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Among the phenomena associated with DNA replication, the regulation of DNA replication initiation is the most popular subject because the initiation of DNA replication is the major target for cell cycle control. The archaeal DNA replication machinery is most likely a simplified version of the eukaryotic system. Therefore, in addition to their intrinsic importance for understanding the evolution of the DNA replication apparatus, studies of archaeal DNA replication should help to elucidate the mechanisms common to both the archaeal and eukaryotic systems.DNA replication begins with activation of the replication origin. In bacteria (eubacteria), the initiator protein, DnaA, binds to the single replication origin on the circular chromosome and recruits helicase to start replication. In contrast, in the eukaryotic replication system the replicative helicase is recruited to the origin recognition complex (ORC) 3The abbreviations used are: ORCorigin recognition complexMCMminichromosome maintenanceDTTdithiothreitol. 3The abbreviations used are: ORCorigin recognition complexMCMminichromosome maintenanceDTTdithiothreitol. at the origin by the functions of Cdc6 and Cdt1 to assemble the pre-replication complex during G1 phase. The replication helicase then starts to unwind the DNA bidirectionally from the origin to allow the replication forks to progress. Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) is a hexameric complex (Mcm2-7) that is similar to the bacterial DnaB helicase. The Mcm complex (MCM) is thought to be the core of the replicative helicase based on evidence that the Mcm4-6-7 subcomplex isolated from HeLa cell extracts displayed an oligonucleotide displacement activity (4Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, the Mcm2-7 purified from the extract lacks helicase activity in vitro, and thus, the activation of the MCM helicase is likely to involve posttranslational modification as well as associations with other factors. Actually, the MCM from a Xenopus egg extract exerted a weak helicase activity in the complex with the Cdc45 protein in a cyclin-dependent kinase-dependent manner (5Masuda T. Mimura S. Takisawa H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, a yeast mutational analysis demonstrated that Cdc45 is required for the progression of replication forks (6Tercero J.A. Labib K. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2082-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the machinery accomplishing the DNA unwinding function during the DNA replication process have not yet been clearly identified. Recently, some progress toward understanding the molecular machinery in more detail has been made with the proposal of a replisome progression complex. Immunoprecipitation experiments using Xenopus egg extracts detected a physical interaction between MCM, Cdc45, and the GINS complex proteins earlier (7Kubota K. Takase Y. Komori Y. Hashimoto Y. Arata T. Kamikura Y. Araki H. Takisawa H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1141-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, three reports demonstrated the isolation of replisome progression complexes including these three components from yeast (8Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F.

The archaeal MCMs have a distinct DNA helicase activity by themselves in vitro, and therefore, these MCMs may function as the replicative helicase in the archaeal cells. However, in our studies of the MCM helicase from Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic Euryarchaea, we have detected only a very weak helicase activity in vitro from the protein.The eukaryotic GINS complex consists of four different proteins, Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3, originally identified in Saccha-romyces cerevisiae as essential protein factors for the initiation of DNA replication (24Takayama Y. Kamimura Y. Okawa M. Muramatsu S. Sugino A. Araki H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the four subunits in the GINS complex share some conservation, suggesting that they are ancestral paralogs (25Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Mekhedov S.L. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Finely detailed bioinformatics analyses revealed the Gins protein homologs in archaeal genomes, although most of the Archaea have a single gene of this family (25Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Mekhedov S.L. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison showed that the crenarchaeal homologs are more similar to Psf2 and Psf3, and, in contrast, the euryarcheal homologs are more similar to Sld5 and Psf1 (Ref. 25Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Mekhedov S.L. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; also see Table 1 of this study). Furthermore, a GINS homolog, designated as Gins23, was detected in the Crenarchaea, S. solfataricus, in a yeast two-hybrid screening for interaction partners of MCM, and another subunit, designated as Gins15, was identified by the mass spectroscopic analysis of an immunoaffinity-purified native GINS complex from S. solfataricus cell extract using an anti-GINS23 antibody (26Marinsek N.

This is the first report describing the euryarchaeal GINS. It is especially interesting that the DNA helicase activity of P. furiosus MCM is clearly stimulated by the addition of the P. furiosus GINS complex. The molecular mechanism of the MCM helicase stimulation by the GINS complex is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the mcm Gene—The sequence encoding the mcm gene, corresponding to PF0482 in the data base, was amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA. The PF0482 open reading frame contains an intervening sequence (an intein coded by 1101 nucleotides (∼60 kDa)). Therefore, four primers were designed to fuse the two exteins via PCR to obtain the entire mcm gene. These primer sequences are available on request.The DNAs encoding the N-terminal (1083 nucleotide) and C-terminal (963 nucleotide) exteins were amplified, and a second PCR was performed using the mixture of the two amplified fragments as DNA templates and the two primers corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the mcm gene. The amplified DNA containing the entire region of the mcm gene was inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed. The cloned mcm gene was transferred into pET28a (Novagen) for expression in Escherichia coli cells (pET28s-MCM).Cloning of the Genes Encoding GINS Homologs—The genes encoding the two GINS homologs, PF0483 (Gins23) and PF0982 (Gins51), were amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCCATATGTTCACGGGTAAGGTATTGAT-3′ and 5′-ACAGCGGCCGCCTAATCACCTATCCACTCT-3′ as the forward and reverse primers for PF0483 and 5′-GCGCCATATGGGGATAACAATGGATATTGA-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTTACAATTGTATCAATACC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers for PF0982, respectively. The amplified genes were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, and their nucleotide sequences were confirmed. The cloned genes were digested by NdeI-NotI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pET21a or pET28a (Novagen). The resultant plasmids were designated as pET21a-G23 and pET28a-G51, respectively.Overproduction and Purification of PfuMCM—To obtain recombinant PfuMCM, E. coli BL21 CodonPlus™ (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) carrying pET28a-MCM were grown in 1.3 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The cells were cultured to an A600 = 0.50, and the expression of the mcm gene was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 4 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole). The soluble cell extract, obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, was heated at 70 °C for 15 min. The heat-resistant fraction, obtained by centrifugation, was subjected to chromatography on a HisTrap™ HP column (GE Healthcare). The proteins that eluted at 0.2 m imidazole were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was loaded onto a HiTrap™ Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare), which was developed with a 0.1-0.8 M NaCl gradient in buffer B. The proteins that eluted at 0.35 m NaCl were dialyzed against buffer B. The dialysate was loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare), which was developed with a 0.1-0.6 m NaCl gradient in buffer B. The proteins that eluted at 0.35 m NaCl were pooled and fractionated on a HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The fractions that eluted at about 50 ml of retention volume were pooled and were stored at 4 °C.Overproduction and Purification of Gins23 and the PfuGINS Complex—To obtain recombinant Gins23, E. coli BL21 Codon-Plus™(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) carrying pET21a-G23 were grown at 37 °C in 1.3 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were cultured to an A600 = 0.6, and the expression of the gene encoding Gins23 was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 3.5 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The soluble cell extract, obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, was heated at 80 °C for 25 min. The heat-resistant fraction, obtained by centrifugation, was treated with 0.15% polyethyleneimine to remove the nucleic acids. The soluble proteins were dialyzed against buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 m ammonium sulfate, and 10% glycerol). The precipitate was resuspended in buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol). For the preparation of the PfuGINS complex, the recombinant E. coli strain producing the GINS complex was obtained by cotransformation of the E. coli BL21 CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells with the two plasmids, pET21a-G23 and pET28a-G51. Both of the pET vectors have the colE1 ori and were incompatible for cotransformation in general. However, transformants containing both pET21a-G23 and pET28a-G51 were obtained by selection for Ampr and Kmr colonies, although the efficiency was quite low. The transformed cells carrying pET21a-G23 and pET28a-G51 were grown in 1.3 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The cells were cultured to an A600 = 0.50, and the expression of the GINS genes was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 4 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A. The soluble cell extract, obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, was heated at 80 °C for 15 min. The heat-resistant fraction, obtained by centrifugation, was treated with 0.15% polyethyleneimine to remove the nucleic acids. The soluble proteins were precipitated by 80%-saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer A and subjected to chromatography on a HisTrap™ HP column. The proteins that eluted at 0.2 m imidazole were dialyzed against buffer G (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (CHT-II; Bio-Rad), which was developed with a 0.01-1 m potassium phosphate gradient. The proteins were eluted at 0.15 m potassium phosphate, pooled, and stored at 4 °C. The purity of each protein used in this study was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were calculated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The theoretical molar absorption coefficients of the molecules were calculated based on the numbers of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The molar extinction coefficients of Gins23 and PfuGINS are 31,720 and 38,120 m-1 cm-1, respectively.Gel Filtration and Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Gel filtration chromatography for the estimation of the molecular sizes of the Gins23 and PfuGINS components was performed with the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The purified Gins23 and PfuGINS proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The molecular masses of the proteins were estimated from the elution profiles of standard marker proteins (Bio-Rad), including thyroglobulin (670,000), γ-globulin (158,000), ovalbumin 44,000), and myoglobin (17,000). Pfu-GINS was also subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation. The purified GINS complex (50 μg) was sedimented through a 10-35% (v/v) glycerol gradient at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 24 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The standard marker proteins, as described above, were sedimented under identical conditions.Helicase Assay—For the preparation of the substrate for helicase assays, a 63-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGT-3′) was annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (Takara Bio) after labeling the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The partial DNA duplex was separated from the free oligonucleotides with a spin column (Microspin™ S-400 HR, GE Healthcare). The purified PfuMCM (500 nm) and PfuGINS proteins (various concentrations) were incubated with the 5′-32P-labeled substrate DNA (2.5 nm) in helicase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm ATP) for 30 min at 75 °C. After phenol extraction, the products were detected by 6% PAGE in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) followed by autoradiography.ATPase Assay—The purified PfuMCM protein (500 nm) was incubated with 1 mm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP (25 pCi/μl) in a buffer in the presence or absence of DNA (25 nm d49-mer, dAGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAATTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT, or the duplex DNA with its complementary sequence) at 75 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of the reactions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The amounts of ATP and Pi were quantified from the autoradiograms with an image analyzer (FLA5000, Fuji Film). The amount of Pi in the reaction without the enzyme was deducted from that of each reaction as the spontaneous hydrolysis at the high temperature.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assay procedure was performed as described previously (27Matsunaga F. Forterre P. Ishino Y. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11152-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Pyrococcus abyssi cells, instead of P. furiosus, obtained as described previously (28Uemori T. Ishino Y. Toh H. Asada K. Kato I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), were quickly cooled down to room temperature and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min under aerobic conditions with gentle agitation. Samples for immunoprecipitation were prepared by sonication in an extraction buffer. Aliquots of the supernatant (0.5 ml) were incubated with 5 μl of anti-Cdc6, anti-MCM, and anti-Gins23 (prepared by using the purified Gins23 in this study), which were pretreated with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 4 h with gentle shaking to collect the immunocomplexes. The precipitated DNA was extracted from the immunocomplexes as described (29Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The obtained DNA was directly used as a template in PCR reactions with 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Takara Bio) for 20 cycles. Eleven different primer sets, corresponding to the region within 20 kb around the oriC of the P. abyssi genome were used (primer sequences are available on request; also see Fig. 4) with three different template dilutions to ensure the results of the assays. The intensities of each PCR product stained by ethidium bromide were quantified from digitized gel images, with the image analyzer (LAS-3000, Fuji Film) software accounting for differences in the amplification efficiency observed for different primer sets with the use of the input DNA. All results shown are the averages of three independent experiments.Western Blot Analysis—P. furiosus cells (1 g) were disrupted by sonication in 15 ml of buffer B containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science), and the extract was obtained by centrifugation. The P. furiosus cell extract (800 ng) and the purified Gins23 protein (1 ng) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with the anti-Gins23 antiserum. The bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Gel-retardation Assay—Purified PfuMCM (100-800 nm) and PfuGINS proteins (100-2000 nm) were incubated with a 5′-32P-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide (d49-mer (see above)) or a duplex DNA with its complementary sequence in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP, and 25 nm DNA) at 60 °C for 10 min. The products were separated by 1% AGE (for MCM) or 6% PAGE (for GINS) in 1× TAE buffer and visualized by autoradiography.Two-hybrid Analysis—A yeast two-hybrid detection system (MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3, Clontech) was used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with the appropriate plasmids (see the Fig. 3 legend) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech Matchmaker manual). The cells were streaked on either SD-Trp-Leu-His or SD-Trp-Leu-His-Ade agar plates and incubated at 30 °C.FIGURE 3Protein-protein interactions shown by a yeast two-hybrid analysis and an immunoprecipitation analysis. A, yeast AH109 cells were transformed with plasmids containing the DNA binding domain (DBD) or the activation domain (AD) fused to the open reading frame for Mcm, Gins23, or Gins51. V indicates empty vector. Results from two different incubation times (48 and 84 h) are shown. B, immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to confirm the formation of a complex including MCM and GINS in the P. furiosus cell extract. The immunocomplexes were captured with anti-MCM antiserum, as shown on the top, and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses using anti-Gins23 antiserum. The extracts from the P. furiosus cells at the exponential phase (left panel) and the stationary phase (right panel) were analyzed. Precipitates without anti-MCM antiserum are loaded at the center (-) in each panel as negative controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSConservation of the Genes for GINS in Archaea—As shown in the previous report of the S. solfataricus GINS proteins, one gene for each, encoding the sequences homologous to Gins23 and Gins15, was found in the P. furiosus genome (26Marinsek N. Barry E.R. Makarova K.S. Dionne I. Koonin E.V. Bell S. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The open reading frame numbers, PF0982 and PF0483, encode the homologs of Sld5/Psf1 and Psf2/Psf3, respectively. A comprehensive search for the Gins protein homologs in the archaeal genomes revealed that only thermococcal organisms in Euryarchaeota, in contrast to all of the crenarchaeal genomes, except for Thermofilum pendes, have two genes encoding Gins homologs, as shown in Table 1. We cloned the two genes to characterize these gene products, which we designated as Gins51 (we prefer the name Gins51, rather than Gins15 because of the order G(5)-I(1)-N(2)-S(3)) and Gins23, respectively, as the P. furiosus GINS components.Expression and Purification of the PfuMcm and PfuGINS Complex—The His-tagged PfuMcm protein (Mr 76805.57) was purified without difficulty by the process described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). A band corresponding to the same size as the recombinant PfuMcm was detected in the total cell extract of P. furiosus by a Western blot analysis using anti-PfuMcm antiserum. A semiquantitative Western blot analysis showed that the mcm gene was expressed constitutively from the early exponential phase to the late stationary phase (data not shown), as we previously reported for the P. abyssi mcm gene (27Matsunaga F. Forterre P. Ishino Y. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11152-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The predicted genes for Gins51 and Gins23 encode proteins of 190 and 162 amino acids, with calculated masses of 21965.37 and 19201.58, respectively. The expression of the gins23 gene using the pET21a vector and the purification of the protein without any tag were performed in a straightforward manner. Starting from a 1-liter culture, 2.5 mg of homogeneous Gins23 protein were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1B. Furthermore, we detected a protein band with the same size as the recombinant Gins23 in cell extracts prepared from exponential and stationary"
https://openalex.org/W2022062469,"Loss of connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction channels in the heart results in a marked increase in the incidence of spontaneous and inducible polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (PVTs). The mechanisms resulting in this phenotype remain unclear. We hypothesized that uncoupling promotes regional ion channel remodeling, thereby increasing electrical heterogeneity and facilitating the development of PVT. In isolated-perfused control hearts, programmed electrical stimulation elicited infrequent monomorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (MVT), and dominant frequencies (DFs) during MVT were similar in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Moreover, conduction properties, action potential durations (APDs), and repolarizing current densities were similar in RV and LV myocytes. In contrast, PVT was common in Cx43 conditional knockout (OCKO) hearts, and arrhythmias were characterized by significantly higher DFs in the RV compared to the LV. APDs in OCKO myocytes were significantly shorter than those from chamber-matched controls, with RV OCKO myocytes being most affected. APD shortening was associated with higher levels of sustained current in myocytes from both chambers as well as higher levels of the inward rectifier current only in RV myocytes. Thus, alterations in cell-cell coupling lead to regional changes in potassium current expression, which in this case facilitates the development of reentrant arrhythmias. We propose a new mechanistic link between electrical uncoupling and ion channel remodeling. These findings may be relevant not only in cardiac tissue but also to other organ systems where gap junction remodeling is known to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1995215255,"Polysialic acid (polySia), an α2,8-linked polymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid, represents an essential regulator of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) functions. Two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV, account for polySia synthesis, but their individual roles in vivo are still not fully understood. Previous in vitro studies defined differences between the two enzymes in their usage of the two NCAM N-glycosylation sites affected and suggested a synergistic effect. Using mutant mice, lacking either enzyme, we now assessed in vivo the contribution of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV to polysialylation of NCAM. PolySia-NCAM was isolated from mouse brains and trypsinized, and polysialylated glycopeptides as well as glycans were analyzed in detail. Our results revealed an identical glycosylation and almost complete polysialylation of N-glycosylation sites 5 and 6 in polySia-NCAM irrespective of the enzyme present. The same sets of glycans were substituted by identical numbers of polySia chains in vivo, the length distribution of which, however, differed with the enzyme setting. Expression of ST8SiaIV alone led to higher amounts of short polySia chains and gradual decrease with length, whereas exclusive action of ST8SiaII evoked a slight reduction in long polySia chains only. These variations were most pronounced at N-glycosylation site 5, whereas the polysialylation pattern at N-glycosylation site 6 did not differ between NCAM from wild-type and ST8SiaII- or ST8SiaIV-deficient mice. Thus, our fine structure analyses suggest a comparable quality of polysialylation by ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV and a distinct synergistic action of the two enzymes in the synthesis of long polySia chains at N-glycosylation site 5 in vivo.

In vertebrates, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is the major acceptor of this unique carbohydrate, which is, intriguingly, attached post-translationally with high selectivity to glycans at the fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites in the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of NCAM (3Nelson R.W.

Attachment of polySia to NCAM greatly influences its properties, because the bulky and highly negatively charged carbohydrate moiety increases intermembrane space, impedes the close approach and adhesion between adjacent cells and, therefore, facilitates cell motility and promotes neurogenesis, axon outgrowth as well as synaptic plasticity (1Bruses J.L.

Studies to define distinct roles for each enzyme have been performed in vitro using soluble forms of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV. In these studies, evidence could be provided that both polysialyltransferases were able to add polysialic acid to a variety of oligosaccharide acceptor structures with a slight preference for glycans at the sixth N-glycosylation site in the case of ST8SiaII, whereas ST8SiaIV strongly preferred glycans at this site. In addition, ST8SiaII was found to synthesize shorter polySia polymers than ST8SiaIV, and both enzymes together were described to act synergistically yielding higher numbers of polySia chains and a higher degree of polymerization (37Angata K.

Using mutant mice differing in the number of functional polysialyltransferase genes we could demonstrate that both enzymes have the capacity to synthesize long polySia chains in the in vivo situation (18Galuska S.P. Oltmann-Norden I. Geyer H. Weinhold B. Kuchelmeister K. Hildebrandt H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Geyer R. Mühlenhoff M. J. Biol.

In ST8SiaII knock-out mice, ∼45% of the total NCAM remained non-polysialylated, whereas a single functional allele of ST8SiaII was sufficient to add polySia to almost the complete NCAM pool. This marked reduction in NCAM polysialylation was not associated with the loss of polySia in distinct brain regions, but resulted from a general decrease of polySia synthesis in the case of ST8SiaII deficiency (18Galuska S.P.

Thus, it is an interesting issue as to whether differences in NCAM may be detected with respect to the respective acceptor structures and preference of N-glycosylation sites, when it is polysialylated by only one or a combination of both enzymes. In the present study, we have isolated polySia-NCAM from brains of newborn wild-type, ST8SiaII-deficient, and ST8SiaIV-deficient mutant mice and analyzed polysialylated glycopeptides and glycans to evaluate potential differences and polysialylation preferences of the two enzymes for glycans at the fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites. Our study reveals the first in vivo picture of the complex NCAM polysialylation machinery and dissects the individual impacts of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV.

For immunoaffinity chromatography, mAb 735 was coupled to protein A-Sepharose (2 mg/ml beads) (47Simanis V. Lane D.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Endosialidase N (EndoN) from bacteriophage K1F was purified as described previously (48Stummeyer K. Dickmanns A. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Colominic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany), 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) from Dojindo (Tokyo, Japan) and PNGase F from Roche Applied Science. All reagents used were of analytical grade.

The lysates were shaken overnight at 4 °C and after ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min), supernatants were loaded onto an mAb 735 immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with ten column volumes of washing buffer 1a (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and ten volumes washing buffer 2a (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). PolySia-NCAM was eluted under alkaline conditions using 100 mm triethylamine buffer (pH 11.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The eluate was neutralized by addition of 500 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.9, and dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The flow-through was reloaded three times onto the immunoaffinity column until no more polysialylated NCAM was detectable. SDS-PAGE—PolySia-NCAM and EndoN-treated NCAM (2 ng/μl for 2 h at 37 °C) were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions, loading 100 ng of protein per lane. Proteins were detected by silver staining. For Western blotting proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunostaining using either 5 μg/ml anti-polySia antibody 735 or anti-NCAM antibody H28, together with enhanced chemiluminescence for detection. Isolation of PolySia-glycopeptides—PolySia-NCAM was carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) overnight at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resulting peptides were applied to an mAb 735 immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with ten column volumes of washing buffer 1b (20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) and ten volumes washing buffer 2b (20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). PolySia peptides were eluted using 100 mm triethylamine buffer, pH 11.5. The eluate was neutralized by addition of 1 n acetic acid and lyophilized. The flow-through and washing buffer of the immunoaffinity column was collected, reloaded onto the column once, and the second flow-through, containing peptides and non-polysialylated glycopeptides, was lyophilized. Isolation of N-Glycans and Deglycosylated Peptides—Poly-Sia-glycopeptides were treated with EndoN (2 ng/μl) and PNGase F (10 units) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 37 °C, and reaction products were applied to reversed phase (RP)-cartridges (1 ml, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Glycans present in the flow-through were collected and desalted by Hypercarb cartridges (1 ml, Thermo, Dreieich, Germany). Deglycosylated peptides were recovered by eluting the RP-cartridges with 40%, 60, and 80% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Anion Exchange HPLC—PolySia-glycopeptides, oligosialylated N-glycans, free polySia chains as well as deglycosylated, non-polysialylated peptides were dissolved in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and fractionated on a DNA-Pac PA-100 column (Dionex, Idstein, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using the following gradient: T0min = 0% (v/v) E2; T15min = 16% (v/v) E2; T40min = 23% (v/v) E2; T160min = 45% (v/v) E2; T200min = 48% (v/v) E2 with 2 m ammonium acetate in MilliQ water (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) as E2 (50Nakata D. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38305-38316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). DMB-labeled colominic acid was used as standard for counting the number of acid residues present. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and lyophilized. RP-HPLC—Peptides were separated using a C18 column (Acclaim™, 3 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Dionex) with a linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 60% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peptides were monitored by absorption at 214 nm, collected and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). For identification of non-polysialylated glycopeptides of glycosylation sites 5 and 6, two additional RP columns had to be used. Peptide 5-positive fractions were additionally separated on a Nucleosil C-18 column (5 μm, 3 × 125 mm, Macherey-Nagel) using a linear gradient from 10% to 30% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 25 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, whereas peptide 6-positive fractions were separated in addition on a PepMap C-18 column (3 μm, 1 × 150 mm, Dionex) using a linear gradient from 10% to 40% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 35 min at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Authentic deglycosylated glycosylation sites 5 and 6 were used as standards for localization and quantification. Desialylation—PolySia-glycopeptides were desialylated by mild hydrolysis in 200 μl 1 n acetic acid for 30 min at 80 °C, and desialylated glycopeptides were desalted on RP-cartridges. OligoSia-glycans were desialylated enzymatically by 50 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 15 h. Samples were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, redissolved two times in methanol and dried again. Analysis of N-Acetylneuraminic Acid and PolySia—For quantification of N-acetylneuraminic acid, samples were hydrolyzed in 100 μl of 0.2 n trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 80 °C, dried, redissolved twice in methanol, and dried again. The hydrolysates were dissolved in 80 μl of DMB reaction buffer and incubated for 2 h at 56 °C (51Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. Samples were analyzed on a Superspher 100 C-8 column (250 × 40 mm, Merck-Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany) at 40 °C. Mobile phases methanol/acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (4:4:92:0.1) and methanol/acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (45:45:10:0.1) (M2) were used. A linear gradient was applied from 0% to 20% M2 in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A fluorescent detector was set at 372 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission. To analyze the degree of polymerization of polySia, samples were dissolved in 200 μl of DMB reaction buffer and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 m NaOH (52Inoue S. Inoue Y. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 543-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Inoue S. Lin S.L. Lee Y.C. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For separation of polySia chains a DNAPac PA-100 column (Dionex) was used as detailed previously (18Galuska S.P. Oltmann-Norden I. Geyer H. Weinhold B. Kuchelmeister K. Hildebrandt H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Geyer R. Mühlenhoff M. J. Biol.

Alternatively, polySia was first lactonized in 100 μl of 1 n HCl for 2 h at room temperature (54Zhang Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HCl was evaporated in a SpeedVac concentrator and lactonized polySia was released by 1 n acetic acid for 30 min at 80 °C. The obtained free polySia chains were de-lactonized with 0.2 n NaOH for 1 h at room temperature and fractionated on a DNA-PacPA-100 column as described above. Analysis of Monosaccharide Constituents—Monosaccharides were obtained by hydrolysis in 200 μl of 4 n trifluoroacetic acid and labeled with anthranilic acid as reported by Anumula and co-workers (55Anumula K.R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Anthranilylated monosaccharides were separated on a reversed-phased column (Superspher 100 RP18, Merck). Nano-liquid Chromatography/ESI-MS—Desialylated glycopeptides were separated on an RP column (PepMap, 3 μm, 75 μm × 100 mm, Dionex) using an Ultimate nanoLC system (Dionex), which was directly coupled to an Esquire 3000 ESI-ion trap-MS (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), as described by Wuhrer et al. (6Wuhrer M. Geyer H. von der Ohe M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Schachner M. Geyer R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, desialylated and oligosialylated glycopeptides were spotted by a Probot (Dionex) onto an MALDI target. Interpretation of mass spectra was assisted by using “Glyco-Peakfinder,” a software application developed and available as part of the EUROCarbDB project. MALDI-TOF-MS—MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were performed on an Ultraflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik) equipped with a nitrogen laser and a LIFT-MS/MS facility and controlled by FlexControl 2.0 software as described previously (56Geyer H. Wuhrer M. Resemann A. Geyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40731-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The instrument was operated in negative-ion reflector mode for negatively charged N-glycans as well as glycopeptides and in positive-ion reflector mode for neutral N-glycans, peptides, and glycopeptides. Samples were loaded onto a MALDI-TOF-MS target in 1 μl of water and mixed with 1 μl of matrix. Matrices used were: 5 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in water for neutral glycans, 2.5 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 10 mm ammonium citrate/ethanol (50/50) for negatively charged glycans, saturated cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic-acid solution in ethanol/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (2/1/0.001, v/v) for peptides and 10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 1% o-phosphoric acid for glycopeptides (57Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). External calibration of mass spectra was carried out using peptide calibration standard for MS (Bruker-Daltonik), anthranilyl derivatives of dextran, or pyridylaminated dextran (55Anumula K.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2115211402,"Understanding the mechanisms that control rates of disease progression in humans and other species is an important area of research relevant to epidemiology and to translating studies in small laboratory animals to humans. Body size and metabolic rate influence a great number of biological rates and times. We hypothesize that body size and metabolic rate affect rates of pathogenesis, specifically the times between infection and first symptoms or death.We conducted a literature search to find estimates of the time from infection to first symptoms (t(S)) and to death (t(D)) for five pathogens infecting a variety of bird and mammal hosts. A broad sampling of diseases (1 bacterial, 1 prion, 3 viruses) indicates that pathogenesis is controlled by the scaling of host metabolism. We find that the time for symptoms to appear is a constant fraction of time to death in all but one disease. Our findings also predict that many population-level attributes of disease dynamics are likely to be expressed as dimensionless quantities that are independent of host body size.Our results show that much variability in host pathogenesis can be described by simple power functions consistent with the scaling of host metabolic rate. Assessing how disease progression is controlled by geometric relationships will be important for future research. To our knowledge this is the first study to report the allometric scaling of host/pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2144470999,"The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk is mainly expressed in the hematopoietic system and plays an essential role in beta(2) integrin-mediated leukocyte activation. To elucidate the signaling pathway downstream of Syk during beta2 integrin (CD11/CD18)-mediated migration and extravasation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), we generated neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells expressing a fluorescently tagged Syk mutant lacking the tyrosine residue at the position 323 (Syk-Tyr323) that is known to be required for the binding of the regulatory subunit p85 of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) class I(A). Syk-Tyr323 was found to be critical for the enrichment of the catalytic subunit p110delta of PI3K class I(A) as well as for the generation of PI3K products at the leading edge of the majority of polarized cells. In accordance, the translocation of PI3K p110delta to the leading edge was diminished in Syk deficient murine PMN. Moreover, the expression of EGFP-Syk Y323F interfered with proper cell polarization and it impaired efficient migration of dHL-60 cells. In agreement with a major role of beta2 integrins in the recruitment of phagocytic cells to sites of lesion, mice with a Syk-deficient hematopoietic system demonstrated impaired PMN infiltration into the wounded tissue that was associated with prolonged cutaneous wound healing. These data imply a novel role of Syk via PI3K p110delta signaling for beta2 integrin-mediated migration which is a prerequisite for efficient PMN recruitment in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2075150128,"Small ubiquitin-related protein modifiers (SUMO) modification is an important mechanism for posttranslational regulation of protein function. However, it is largely unknown how the sumoylation pathway is regulated. Here, we report that nitric oxide (NO) causes global hyposumoylation in mammalian cells. Both SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (Pias3) were targets for S-nitrosation. S-nitrosation did not interfere with the SUMO conjugating activity of Ubc9, but promoted Pias3 degradation by facilitating its interaction with tripartite motif-containing 32 (Trim32), a ubiquitin E3 ligase. On the one hand, NO promoted Trim32-mediated Pias3 ubiquitination. On the other hand, NO enhanced the stimulatory effect of Pias3 on Trim32 autoubiquitination. The residue Cys459 of Pias3 was identified as a target site for S-nitrosation. Mutation of Cys459 abolished the stimulatory effect of NO on the Pias3-Trim32 interaction, indicating a requirement of S-nitrosation at Cys459 for positive regulation of the Pias3-Trim32 interplay. This study reveals a novel crosstalk between S-nitrosation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, which may be crucial for NO-related physiological and pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2150098932,"Inducible costimulator (ICOS) expression is critical for T cell-mediated immunity. We showed previously that T cell receptor and CD28 coengagement up-regulate ICOS expression in activated T cells via the induction of NFATc2. Here, we examined the regulation of ICOS expression by Th-specific transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3. Overexpression of T-bet or GATA-3 alone could enhance, and NFATc2 could further synergize with either of them to increase, icos transcription. Although T-bet acted on the icos promoter, GATA-3 operated via an icos 3′-un-translated region element. Interestingly, NFATc2 was found to bind promiscuously the icos promoter in developing Th0, Th1, and Th2 cells but became selectively associated with T-bet at the promoter and with GATA-3 at the 3′-untranslated region in fully differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Collectively, our results reveal a temporally evolving circuit in which the non-selectively expressed NFATc2 cooperates with Th-restricted T-bet or GATA-3 to direct transcription of a costimulatory gene via distinct regulatory elements in different Th cells undergoing differentiation.

In the absence of either, T-B cell interactions were compromised, resulting in impaired germinal center formation and humoral immunity. inducible costimulator nuclear factor of activated T cells luciferase phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate untranslated region interleukin interferon signal transducers and activators of transcription antibody reverse transcription relative light unit(s) small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein phycoerythrin inducible costimulator nuclear factor of activated T cells luciferase phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate untranslated region interleukin interferon signal transducers and activators of transcription antibody reverse transcription relative light unit(s) small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein phycoerythrin After T cell receptor engagement, naïve T cells could polarize into T helper type 1 (Th1) or 2 (Th2) cells, depending on the antigenic stimulus and cytokine milieu (10Murphy K.M.

ICOS-deficient T cells exhibited defects in Th2 cytokine secretion, being selectively impaired in IL-4 but not IFN-γ expression after in vitro differentiation or in vivo priming by protein antigen (5Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In agreement with a role for ICOS in Th2 responses, IL-4-dependent IgE production was defective in asthma-contracting mice lacking ICOS (5Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P.

Recently, in vitro Th polarization experiments suggested that ICOS costimulated Th2 cell differentiation by an IL-4-driven mechanism involving NFATc1 and c-Maf (13Nurieva R.I. Duong J. Kishikawa H. Dianzani U. Rojo J.M. Ho I. Flavell R.A. Dong C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, ICOS participated not only in Th2 costimulation but was also involved in Th1-mediated pathologies (14Sperling A.I. Bluestone J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 573-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For example, anti-ICOS therapy was shown to profoundly reduce both chronic and Th1-dependent acute allograft rejection (15Ozkaynak E. Gao W. Shemmeri N. Wang C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Amaral J. Qin S. Rottman J.B. Coyle A.J. Hancock W.W. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ICOS blockade increased susceptibility of CD28-deficient mice to Th1-type Toxoplasma gondii infection (16Villegas E.N. Lieberman L.A. Mason N. Blass S.L. Zediak V.P. Peach R. Horan T. Yoshinaga S. Hunter C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and produced reciprocal disease outcomes in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, depending on the timing of blockade (17Rottman J.B. Smith T. Tonra J.R. Ganley K. Bloom T. Silva R. Pierce B. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Ozkaynak E. Coyle A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, ICOS regulates both Th1- and Th2-associated immune responses. The cytokines and transcriptional machinery responsible for Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation have been well studied (18Rao A. Avni O. Br. Med. Bull. 2000; 56: 969-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dong C. Flavell R.A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The signature cytokines IL-12 and IL-4 are known to promote respectively, the development of Th1 and Th2 cells by inducing STAT4 and STAT6 activation and leading to lineage-specific gene expression (21Ho I.C. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2002; 109: S109-S120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, the T-box transcription factor T-bet has been shown to direct Th1 lineage commitment (22Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar), inducing both transcriptional proficiency of the ifn-γ locus and responsiveness to IL-12-transduced growth signal (23Mullen A.C. High F.A. Hutchins A.S. Lee H.W. Villarino A.V. Livingston D.M. Kung A.L. Cereb N. Yao T.P. Yang S.Y. Reiner S.L. Science. 2001; 292: 1907-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-3 is a master regulator of Th2 differentiation (24Zheng W. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), although the basic region leucine zipper transcription factor c-Maf plays an early role in this process by skewing naïve CD4+ T cells toward a Th2 phenotype via the initial induction of IL-4 (25Ho I.C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In addition, GATA-3 also specifies the transcriptional competence of the Th2 cytokine gene cluster, which encodes IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (26Lee G.R. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 447-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Lee H.J. Takemoto N. Kurata H. Kamogawa Y. Miyatake S. O'Garra A. Arai N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Despite the extensively characterized role of ICOS in Th-specific immune responses, it is currently unclear how icos expression is being regulated during Th cell development. In particular, it is not known whether T-bet and GATA-3 play direct roles in regulating ICOS expression and whether ICOS regulation is subjected to different transcriptional mechanisms in different Th cells. We previously reported that the Fyn-calcineurin-NFATc2 and MEK2-ERK1/2 signaling axes acted cooperatively to drive icos transcription in recently activated CD4+ T cells (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been established that upon T cell receptor stimulation, NFAT proteins undergo calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and translocate to the nucleus where they cooperate with members of the AP-1 complex to activate target genes such as IL-2. Without their transcriptional partners, the binding of NFAT to gene promoters alone results in T cell anergy (29Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). Of relevance, NFAT proteins had been shown to partner T-bet or GATA-3 to drive IFN-γ (30Lee D.U. Avni O. Chen L. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4802-4810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or IL-4 expression (31Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) respectively. Hence, we sought to determine whether the same partnership is invoked to regulate ICOS expression in Th cells. In this study, we examined the roles of T-bet, GATA-3, and NFATc2 in regulating ICOS expression in Th1 and Th2 cells. We present evidence that the lineage-restricted T-bet and GATA-3 cooperated with the more broadly expressed NFATc2 to regulate icos transcription in a temporally dynamic and Th-specific manner through binding of distinct icos regulatory regions during Th cell development. Mouse Strains and Cell Lines—8–12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in the Biopolis animal facilities according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations. The EL4 thymoma T cell line was maintained as described (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The AE7 Th1 and CDC35 Th2 cell clones were kind gifts of Dr. I.-C. Ho (Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and cultured as described (32Hecht T.T. Longo D.L. Matis L.A.

Briefly, AKR/J splenocytes were treated with 50 μg/ml of mitomycin C (Sigma) at 37 °C for 45 min and washed before incubation with 1–2 × 106 AE7 cells and 5 μm of pigeon cytochrome C in complete medium for 48 h. The cells were then passaged 1:5 into medium with 10% rat concanavalin A and expanded every 3–4 days. The CDC35 cells were cultured similarly with Balb/c splenocytes and 100 μg/ml of rabbit γ-globulin. CD4+ T Cell Purification and in Vitro Differentiation of Th Cells—CD4+ T cells were isolated as described (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to >95% purity as assessed by flow cytometry. Purified T cells (2 × 106/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 2 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 Abs under Th0 (3 μg/ml anti-IL-12, 5 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ, and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4), Th1 (5 ng/ml IL-12 and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4), or Th2 (10 ng/ml IL-4, 3 μg/ml anti-IL-12, and 5 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ) skewing conditions. 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-2 was added after 24 h, and the cells were expanded in complete medium containing IL-2 for 2 or 8 days. Recombinant mouse IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 were purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). NA/LE-grade anti-CD3 (145–2C11), anti-CD28 (37.51), anti-IL-12 (C17.8), anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2), and anti-IL-4 (11B11) Abs were from BD Biosciences. Western Blot Analyses—Equal amounts of whole cell lysates from 2–5 × 106 cells, quantified using Bradford assay, were electrophoresced in a 7–10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with Abs against T-bet (4B10), GATA-3 (HG3–31), and ERK2 (C-14), all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated and cDNA was prepared as described (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each reaction was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) in a Mx3005P QPCR system (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The primers used for real time RT-PCR were: ICOS, 5′-TGA CCC ACC TCC TTT TCA AG-3′ and 5′-TTA GGG TCA TGC ACA CTG GA-3′; β-actin, 5′-GAT CTG GCA CCA CAC CTT CT-3′ and 5′-ACC AGA GGC ATA CAG GGA CA-3′. The mRNA levels of ICOS were normalized to those of β-actin, and those in activated CD4+ T or differentiated Th cells were expressed as a fold change relative to the levels in naïve cells. Plasmid Constructs, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—The icos promoter, encompassing –288 to –1 bp relative to the first nucleotide of the mouse cDNA, was cloned upstream of a luc reporter as described (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The icos 259-bp 3′-UTR fragment (NCBI GenBank™ accession number AK030827) was generated by PCR from C57BL/6 mouse genomic DNA using primers 5′-GAT GTT CCC ATA TTC TCC-3′ and 5′-CCA GGA GAA TGT TTG CCC-3′ and cloned into BamHI/SalI sites downstream of a luc reporter driven by the minimal icos promoter spanning –52 to –1 bp. Transient transfection experiments were performed as described previously (28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Relative light units (RLU) from firefly luciferase was normalized for transfection efficiency to the Renilla luciferase RLU in each lysate (normalized RLU = RLUfirefly luciferase/RLURenilla luciferase). For effect of overexpressed proteins on icos promoter and 3′-UTR activities, the fold induction was calculated as Fold Induction = normalized RLUprotein expressing vector, unstimulated or stimulated/normalized RLUnull vector, unstimulated. The pBJ5-NFATc2 (pSH210) vector (34Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19898-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. G. R. Crabtree (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The T-bet vector pcDNAHis-T-bet (22Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. L. H. Glimcher (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA). The pcDNAHis-GATA-3 vector was constructed by cloning full-length murine GATA-3 cDNA, generated using primers 5′-GGA ATT CGA CAT GGA GGT GAC TGC G-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAC TAA CCC ATG GCG GTG A-3′, into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pcDNAHis vector. All of the DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. siRNA Knockdown of T-bet and GATA-3 in Th Cell Lines—AE7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with 100 nm of tbx21 siRNA identification number 181595 (T-bet siRNA 1), siRNA identification number 181596 (T-bet siRNA 2), or Silencer® GFP siRNA (catalog number AM4626) as negative control. CDC35 cells were transfected with 1 μm of gata-3 siRNA identification number 61725 (GATA-3 siRNA 1), siRNA ID identification number 61780 (GATA-3 siRNA 2) or GFP siRNA as negative control. Following transfection, the cells were rested for 24 h before being stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 16 h, and RNA and cell lysates were prepared from them. All of the siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were from Ambion, Inc. (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). Retroviral Constructs and Transduction—The bicistronic vectors GFP-RV and T-bet-RV (22Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar) were gifts of Dr. Glimcher (Harvard). The Phoenix-Eco packaging cell line (35Hofmann A. Nolan G.P. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. G. P. Nolan (Stanford). Generation of the GATA-3-RV vector, transfection of packaging cell line and retroviral transduction of primary CD4+ T cells were as described (36Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of surface CD4 and ICOS expression on GFP+ cells was performed 48 h after infection. For RNA or protein extraction, the cells were first sorted to >98% GFP+ on a FACS-Vantage Flow Cytometer/Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Intracellular Cytokine Staining—Intracellular cytokine staining was performed with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Plus fixation/permeabilization solution kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ∼2 × 106 Th cells were treated with BD GolgiStop™, PMA (50 ng/ml), and ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C. After harvesting and staining with anti-CD4 Ab, they were washed and permeabilized before being incubated with anti-IFN-γ fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-IL-4 PE Abs or their isotype controls and finally visualized on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using CellQuest Pro software. The following antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA): fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin-conjugated anti-CD4 (GK1.5), PE-conjugated anti-CD8 (53–6.7), PE-conjugated anti-ICOS (7E.17G9), PE-Cy5-conjugated streptavidin, anti-IFN-γ fluorescein isothiocyanate (XMG1.2), and anti-IL-4 PE (11B11). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The Abs used were anti-NFATc2 (G1-D10), anti-T-bet (4B10), and anti-GATA3 (HG3–31) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The following primers were used for PCR: ICOS P, 5′-CCG CTC GAG CAT GCA TGC ATC CAT C-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT AGT GCT CAA AAG TGT CAG-3′ (288-bp product); ICOS 3′-UTR, 5′-GAT GTT CCC ATA TTC TCC-3′ and 5′-CCA GGA GAA TGT TTG CCC-3′ (259-bp product). ICOS Is Differentially Expressed in Different Th Cell Subsets—To assess whether ICOS is differentially expressed in various Th cells, we activated primary CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs and differentiated them for 8 days under three types of polarizing conditions: Th0, Th1, or Th2 (37Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These treatment regimes yielded substantial fractions of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing cells, indicating that the Th1- and Th2-polarizing conditions were optimal (Fig. 1A, bottom right panels). Interestingly, we found the level of surface ICOS expression to vary in the different Th cell subsets: Th2 cells, consistent with earlier reports (1Coyle A.J. Lehar S. Lloyd C. Tian J. Delaney T. Manning S. Nguyen T. Burwell T. Schneider H. Gonzalo J.A. Gosselin M. Owen L.R. Rudd C.E. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 38McAdam A.J. Chang T.T. Lumelsky A.E. Greenfield E.A. Boussiotis V.A. Duke-Cohan J.S. Chernova T. Malenkovich N. Jabs C. Kuchroo V.K. Ling V. Collins M. Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5035-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), expressed the highest level of ICOS, followed by Th1 and Th0 cells (Fig. 1A, left panels). To determine whether this variation in surface expression of ICOS could in part be attributed to variation in icos transcript levels, we quantified ICOS mRNA levels in the Th subsets and found that these indeed correlated with levels of surface expression, with the highest amount of ICOS mRNA found in Th2, followed by Th1 and Th0 cells (Fig. 1B). The data suggest that the expression of ICOS may be under transcriptional control in different Th cells. T-bet or GATA-3 Enhances ICOS Expression in T Cells—Because icos transcripts were expressed differently in different Th cell subsets and, in particular, at higher levels in Th1 and Th2 cells compared with Th0 cells, we asked whether there was a role for Th1-specific T-bet and Th2-specific GATA-3 transcription factors in driving ICOS expression. It was shown previously that the Th1-polarizing cytokines IL-12 and/or IL-23 could enhance ICOS expression in activated human T cells independent of their predefined differentiation status (39Wassink L. Vieira P.L. Smits H.H. Kingsbury G.A. Coyle A.J. Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1779-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Th2-polarizing cytokine IL-4 and growth factor IL-2 were shown to regulate ICOS expression in activated CD4+ T cells. Although retroviral transduction of GATA-3 was shown to increase surface ICOS expression in stimulated murine CD4+ T cells (40Yagi J. Arimura Y. Dianzani U. Uede T. Okamoto T. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it was not clear whether this was a direct effect of GATA-3 on icos gene regulation. We therefore ascertained whether T-bet or GATA-3 per se may directly enhance ICOS expression in the respective Th cells. To test the individual roles of T-bet and GATA-3 in regulating ICOS expression, we first overexpressed these transcription factors in EL4 T cells and measured the level of icos transcripts after overnight culture. Real time RT-PCR analyses indicated that the ectopic expression of T-bet (Fig. 2A, left panel) or GATA-3 (right panel) could increase the level of icos transcripts in EL4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. To control for the functionality of T-bet and GATA-3, we also observed concomitant increases in ifn-γ and il-5 transcripts, respectively, in the transfected EL4 cells (data not shown and Refs. 22Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar and 41Siegel M.D. Zhang D.H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether the up-regulation of ICOS by T-bet or GATA-3 in EL4 cells was reproducible in primary CD4+ T cells. We infected CD4+ T cells activated by anti-CD3/CD28 Abs with retroviruses that expressed GFP alone or together with T-bet or GATA-3 and examined ICOS expression in these cells 48 h after infection. Retroviral transduction of T-bet (Fig. 2B, left panel) or GATA-3 (right panel) in activated, nonpolarized CD4+ T cells also resulted in the higher expression of ICOS protein as well as mRNA in these cells when compared with control cells transduced with vector expressing GFP alone. Finally, to establish that T-bet and GATA-3 play a direct role in driving icos transcription in committed Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, we used siRNA against T-bet and GATA-3 to knock down their protein expression in AE7 Th1 and CDC35 Th2 cell lines, respectively. Knockdown of tbx21 and gata-3 transcripts led to the efficient abrogation of their protein expression in AE7 (Fig. 3A) and CDC35 (Fig. 3B) cells, whereas knockdown of the irrelevant gfp gene hardly affected T-bet expression in AE7 or GATA-3 expression in CDC35 cells. More importantly and in agreement with data obtained so far, the knockdown of T-bet significantly reduced the amount of icos transcripts in activated AE7 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas knockdown of GATA-3 profoundly diminished ICOS mRNA in CDC35 cells (Fig. 3B). However, the reduction in ICOS mRNA was not absolute, suggesting that other transcription factors are likely involved in regulating ICOS expression. Taken together, our overexpression and siRNA knockdown data indicate that T-bet and GATA-3 play enhancing roles in driving icos transcription in Th cells. T-bet Enhances NFATc2-induced Transactivation of the icos Promoter—Because T-bet and GATA-3 are transcription factors shown to transactivate the promoters of ifn-γ (22Szabo S.J. Kim S.T. Costa G.L. Zhang X. Fathman C.G. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar) and il-5 (42Zhang D.H. Cohn L. Ray P. Bottomly K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) genes, respectively, we were interested to determine whether they would also regulate icos gene expression via binding to its promoter region. Initial algorithmic searches using the TRANSFAC data base did not reveal any putative binding sites for T-bet or GATA-3 in the icos promoter. We had previously shown that NFATc2 enhanced ICOS expression by acting within a 288-bp promoter region upstream of the icos transcription start site (Fig. 4A and Ref. 28Tan A.H. Wong S.C. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28666-28678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, to find out whether this region could respond to T-bet and/or GATA-3, we introduced a luc reporter plasmid driven by the 288-bp icos promoter, with or without accompanying plasmids encoding T-bet, NFATc2, or both, into EL4 cells by transient transfection. Ectopic expression of NFATc2 led to an increase in icos promoter activity as reflected by the fold induction of luc activity in PMA/ionomycin-activated EL4 cells (Fig. 4B), concordant with our earlier work demonstrating that NFATc2 regulates ICOS expression. The introduction of T-bet also resulted in the up-regulation of luc activity in stimulated EL4 cells, suggesting that T-bet acted via the icos promoter to activate gene expressio"
https://openalex.org/W1991948602,"Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3'-unstranslated region of the DMPK gene, which encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase. One of the common clinical features of DM1 patients is insulin resistance, which has been associated with a pathogenic effect of the repeat expansions. Here we show that DMPK itself is a positive modulator of insulin action. DMPK-deficient (dmpk-/-) mice exhibit impaired insulin signaling in muscle tissues but not in adipocytes and liver, tissues in which DMPK is not expressed. Dmpk-/- mice display metabolic derangements such as abnormal glucose tolerance, reduced glucose uptake and impaired insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking in muscle. Using DMPK mutants, we show that DMPK is required for a correct intracellular trafficking of insulin and IGF-1 receptors, providing a mechanism to explain the molecular and metabolic phenotype of dmpk-/- mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that reduced DMPK expression may directly influence the onset of insulin-resistance in DM1 patients and point to dmpk as a new candidate gene for susceptibility to type 2-diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2166734465,"Background The analysis of gene expression for tissue homogenates is of limited value because of the considerable cell heterogeneity in tissues. However, several methods are available to isolate a cell type of interest from a complex tissue, the most reliable one being Laser Microdissection (LMD). Cells may be distinguished by their morphology or by specific antigens, but the obligatory staining often results in RNA degradation. Alternatively, particular cell types can be detected in vivo by expression of fluorescent proteins from cell type-specific promoters. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a technique for fixing in vivo fluorescence in brain cells and isolating them by LMD followed by an optimized RNA isolation procedure. RNA isolated from these cells was of equal quality as from unfixed frozen tissue, with clear 28S and 18S rRNA bands of a mass ratio of ∼2∶1. We confirmed the specificity of the amplified RNA from the microdissected fluorescent cells as well as its usefulness and reproducibility for microarray hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Conclusions/Significance Our technique guarantees the isolation of sufficient high quality RNA obtained from specific cell populations of the brain expressing soluble fluorescent marker, which is a critical prerequisite for subsequent gene expression studies by microarray analysis or qRT-PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2063718621,"Oleic acid (OA) stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. The precise mechanism is still unclear. We sought to investigate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) on OA-induced VSMC proliferation and migration.Oleate and palmitate, the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid and saturated fatty acid in plasma, respectively, differently affect the mRNA and protein levels of PGC-1alpha in VSMCs. OA treatment resulted in a reduction of PGC-1alpha expression, which may be responsible for the increase in VSMC proliferation and migration caused by this fatty acid. In fact, overexpression of PGC-1alpha prevented OA-induced VSMC proliferation and migration while suppression of PGC-1alpha by siRNA enhanced the effects of OA. In contrast, palmitic acid (PA) treatment led to opposite effects. This saturated fatty acid induced PGC-1alpha expression and prevented OA-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Mechanistic study demonstrated that the effects of PGC-1alpha on VSMC proliferation and migration result from its capacity to prevent ERK phosphorylation.OA and PA regulate PGC-1alpha expression in VSMCs differentially. OA stimulates VSMC proliferation and migration via suppression of PGC-1alpha expression while PA reverses the effects of OA by inducing PGC-1alpha expression. Upregulation of PGC-1alpha in VSMCs provides a potential novel strategy in preventing atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2043743047,"The prion protein (PrP) is crucially involved in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), but neither its exact role in disease nor its physiological function are known. Here we show for mice, using histological, immunochemical and PCR-based methods, that stimulation of innate resistance was followed by appearance of numerous endogenous retroviruses and ensuing PrP up-regulation in germinal centers of the spleen. Subsequently, the activated retroviruses disappeared in a PrP-dependent manner. Our results reveal the regular involvement of endogenous retroviruses in murine immune responses and provide evidence for an essential function of PrP in the control of the retroviral activity. The interaction between PrP and ubiquitous endogenous retroviruses may allow new interpretations of TSE pathophysiology and explain the evolutionary conservation of PrP."
https://openalex.org/W1986701195,"Background Small GTPases of the Rab family can cycle between a GTP- and a GDP-bound state and also between membrane and cytosol. The latter cycle is mediated by the Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor GDI, which can selectively extract GDP-bound Rab proteins from donor membranes, and then reload them on target membranes. In previous studies, we found that capture of the small GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of endocytic membrane traffic, by GDI is stimulated by oxidative stress via p38MAPK, resulting in increased fluid phase endocytosis. Methodology/Principal Findings When purifying the GDI stimulating activity we found that that it copurified with a high MW protein complex, which included p38MAPK. Here we report the identification and characterization of another component of this complex as the thioredoxin-like protein TXNL1. Our observations indicate that TXNL1 play a selective role in the regulation of fluid phase endocytosis, by controlling GDI capacity to capture Rab5. Conclusions/Significance Oxidants, which are known to cause cellular damage, can also trigger signaling pathways, in particular via members of the thioredoxin family. We propose that TXNL1 acts as an effector of oxidants or a redox sensor by converting redox changes into changes of GDI capacity to capture Rab5, which in turn modulates fluid phase endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2108148253,"The fire ant Solenopsis invicta and its close relatives display an important social polymorphism involving differences in colony queen number. Colonies are headed by either a single reproductive queen (monogyne form) or multiple queens (polygyne form). This variation in social organization is associated with variation at the gene Gp-9, with monogyne colonies harboring only B-like allelic variants and polygyne colonies always containing b-like variants as well. We describe naturally occurring variation at Gp-9 in fire ants based on 185 full-length sequences, 136 of which were obtained from S. invicta collected over much of its native range. While there is little overall differentiation between most of the numerous alleles observed, a surprising amount is found in the coding regions of the gene, with such substitutions usually causing amino acid replacements. This elevated coding-region variation may result from a lack of negative selection acting to constrain amino acid replacements over much of the protein, different mutation rates or biases in coding and non-coding sequences, negative selection acting with greater strength on non-coding than coding regions, and/or positive selection acting on the protein. Formal selection analyses provide evidence that the latter force played an important role in the basal b-like lineages coincident with the emergence of polygyny. While our data set reveals considerable paraphyly and polyphyly of S. invicta sequences with respect to those of other fire ant species, the b-like alleles of the socially polymorphic species are monophyletic. An expanded analysis of colonies containing alleles of this clade confirmed the invariant link between their presence and expression of polygyny. Finally, our discovery of several unique alleles bearing various combinations of b-like and B-like codons allows us to conclude that no single b-like residue is completely predictive of polygyne behavior and, thus, potentially causally involved in its expression. Rather, all three typical b-like residues appear to be necessary."

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the process whereby proteins and lipids destined for internalization from the plasma membrane are packaged into vesicles with the aid of a clathrin coat. Purified coated vesicles from brain contain three major components as follows: clathrin, AP180, and AP2 complexes (1Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S.

Because oligomeric clathrin presents an array of binding sites for these motifs, it serves as a network hub, organizing binding partners within the lattice. The AP complexes, as well as many accessory proteins and alternative cargo adaptors such as AP180, Dab2, epsin, and amphiphysin, recruit clathrin to PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich areas in the membrane and promote its polymerization into a lattice. Because of its significant number of interaction partners, another key hub in the endocytic interactome is the AP2 complex (7Praefcke G.J. Ford M.G. Schmid E.M. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Peak-Chew S.Y.

For example, rat epsin1 has nine DPW motifs, and the majority of these are found in a proline-rich stretch of 105 amino acids, a region that by CD spectroscopy has no obvious structure (19Kalthoff C.

Human Eps15 contains 15 DPF and two other DXF motifs in a stretch of 230 amino acids. These motifs may allow clustering of the AP2 complexes at the endocytic assembly zones and enhance the binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes (8Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A. Praefcke G.J.

DX(F/W) motifs bind to sites on the platform subdomains of the appendages, centered around a hydrophobic pocket (Trp-840 in α; Trp-841 in β2) (12Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B.

Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the study by Brett et al. (18Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the authors also found a secondary binding site for DPW motifs on the β-sandwich subdomain of the α-appendage. More importantly, they found that an FEDNF peptide from amphiphysin binds to the top of the α-appendage using the site around Trp-840 but in a different conformation by inserting the first Phe residue into the hydrophobic pocket. It was therefore proposed that FXDXF is a general high affinity binding motif for the α-adaptin appendage. Recently, a fourth binding motif for the α-adaptin appendage has been identified in the proteins NECAP, stonin, synaptojanin, connecdenn, and others (15Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C.

The binding motif consensus WXX(F/W) resembles the second clathrin-binding motif PWXXW, but the proline residue seems to mediate the discrimination between the binding partners. Recently, we showed how multiple adaptin-binding motifs provide an avidity effect where the overall apparent affinities for AP2 complexes will depend on the type, number, and spacing of binding motifs as well as the clustering of available appendage domains (7Praefcke G.J. Ford M.G. Schmid E.M. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Peak-Chew S.Y. Vallis Y. Babu M.M. Mills I.G. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4371-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Schmid E.M. Ford M.G.

The unclustered cytoplasmic AP2 complex has single α- and β2-appendage domains, whereas in the coated pit there will be many such domains from clustered AP2 complexes. However, when AP2 complexes are bound to polymerized clathrin, the β2-adaptin appendage domain is predicted to be largely occupied by clathrin, and steric hindrance is thought to exclude most accessory proteins. AP2 complexes at the edge of coated pits, where there is a lower concentration of clathrin, are predicted to still be free to bind the full complement of accessory proteins. The complement of accessory proteins bound to AP2 complexes in the cytosol is again proposed to be different (8Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A. Praefcke G.J. Peak-Chew S.Y. Mills I.G. Benmerah A. McMahon H.T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e262Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, Eps15 has been shown to be restricted to the edges of a nascent coated pit as its interaction with AP2 adaptors is displaced by clathrin (24Edeling M.A. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Steinhauser A.L.

A similar scenario applies for amphiphysin1, which contains an FXDXF, a DPF, and a DLW motif, the latter two of which overlap with two clathrin-binding motifs (Fig. 1A). As a result, amphiphysin would also be primarily localized to the edges of the invaginating pit, ending up at the neck of the nascent vesicle. This would be a convenient way for amphiphysin to ensure that its C-terminal SH3 domain delivers dynamin to the neck of a coated pit, whereas the N-terminal BAR domain of amphiphysin binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and generates vesicle curvature in the membrane (26Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The BAR domain is also responsible for the dimerization of amphiphysin, which increases the efficiency of binding to the proline-rich domain in dynamin. Mammals have two isoforms of amphiphysin (27Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.A. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), amphiphysin1 and -2 (Amph1 and -2). There is low sequence conservation of the domain in which these motifs occur. However, only the FEDNF motif is well conserved (as an FEDAF in Amph2), whereas the DPF motif is EPL in Amph2. The muscle form of Amph2 (bridging integrator-1/Bin1) and amphiphysin in Drosophila have no DXF motifs in this region. In muscle, the protein is associated with T-tubule formation and not with clathrin/adaptor endocytosis. Accordingly, in Drosophila deletion of the protein gives a muscle weakness phenotype and a defect in T-tubule formation (28Razzaq A. Robinson I.M. McMahon H.T. Skepper J.N. Su Y. Zelhof A.C.

De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of a clathrin/adaptor-binding domain targets amphiphysin for function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The selection of amphiphysin1 to study the individual contributions of different binding motifs for α-adaptin offers several advantages over other accessory proteins such as epsin1, Eps15, or AP180. First, amphiphysin is highly specific for the α-adaptin appendage and binds to other adaptins weakly (17Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby avoiding avidity effects from interactions with other AP components. Second, amphiphysin contains single copies of the possible adaptin-binding motifs, which limits interference by avidity effects and makes mutagenesis straightforward. These motifs are separated by 20-30 residues, which should be distant enough to avoid steric hindrance. Finally, despite the low number of motifs, the binding has a high affinity and amphiphysin is a major AP2-binding partner with an essential biological function. Using a combination of thermodynamic, biochemical, and structural observations, we show that the FXDXF motif is the main determinant for the high affinity binding to the α-adaptin appendage. Moreover, we define the optimal FXDXF motif and use these data to explain the observed binding characteristics of other FXDXF- and DX(F/W)-containing accessory proteins. Constructs and Protein Expression–The α-adaptin appendage domain (residues 701-938) and the appendage-plus hinge domain (residues 653-938), the human β2-adaptin appendage domain (residues 701-937), rat amphiphysin1AB (Amph1AB; residues 1-378), and rat amphiphysin2AB (Amph2AB; residues 1-422) were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (in pGex4T2) in BL21 cells following overnight isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction at 22 °C. All GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by extensive washing with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The fusion proteins were cleaved by incubation for 2 h with thrombin and further purified by passage over a Q-Sepharose column. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, the protein was additionally passed down a Superdex 75 gel filtration column and dialyzed into 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. GST-Amph1AB was not cleaved to prevent degradation of the protein. Myc-tagged proteins (in pCMV-myc) were used for expression in COS-7 fibroblasts. The appendage domain of human β2-adaptin (residues 701-937) was expressed in BL21 cells as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein (in pET-15b) and purified by passage over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, followed by Q-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography.

Overexpressed Amph1AB was detected using a polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling, green in merged images). The endogenous AP2 complex was detected using a Sigma monoclonal antibody (red in merged images). Cells were imaged using a Bio-Rad Radiance confocal system. For extracts, two 70-mm dishes of COS cells were scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton X-100, or one rat brain was homogenized in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton X-100 and cleared by centrifugation. Pull Downs from COS-7 Cell or Rat Brain Extracts with GST Appendages–For interaction experiments, the extracts described above were incubated with 30-50 μg of GST fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and then the bead-bound proteins were washed four times with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Interaction partners were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. All experiments were repeated three to five times. The α- and δ-adaptin and amphiphysin1 were detected using monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences, and β1,2- and γ-adaptin were detected with monoclonal antibodies from Sigma. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry–Binding of peptides and proteins to α- and β2-adaptin appendage domains was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) using a VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc.). All experiments were performed in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT at 10 °C unless otherwise stated. The peptides or proteins were injected from a syringe in 40-50 steps up to a 3-4-fold molar excess. The cell contained 1.36 ml of protein solution, and typically the ligand was added in steps of 4-8 μl every 3.5 min. Concentrations were chosen so that the binding partners in the cell were at least 5-fold higher than the estimated dissociation constant, if possible. The ligands in the syringe were again at least 10-fold more concentrated. Titration curves were fitted to the data using ORIGIN (supplied by the manufacturer) yielding the stoichiometry N, the binary equilibrium constant Ka (= Kd-1), and the enthalpy of binding ΔH. The entropy of binding ΔS was calculated from the relationship ΔG =-RT·lnKa and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The values were averaged from two to three titrations. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the A280. Peptides were purchased at >95% purity from the Institute of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Southampton, UK, and weighed on an analytical balance. Where possible, peptide concentrations were verified by measuring A280 or A257. The resulting errors on the concentrations are estimated to be <10% for the proteins and the peptides. Unless otherwise stated, the values for the stoichiometry N were within this error region around N = 1. Crystallography and Structure Determination–Co-crystals of α-adaptin appendage and the synaptojanin WVXF peptide were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing conditions centered around 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 3% isopropyl alcohol, and 0.05 m sodium citrate. Hanging drops were 2 μl and contained 222 μm α-adaptin appendage and 277.5 μm synaptojanin WVXF peptide (sequence NPKG-WVTFEEEE). Crystals were obtained after incubation for ∼1 week at 18 °C. To obtain crystals containing peptides bound to the top side, α-adaptin appendage-WVXF co-crystals were soaked in a solution of mother liquor containing amphyphysin1 FEDNFVP peptide. Crystals were cryo-protected by transfer to Paretone-N (Hampton Research) and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data to 1.6 Å were collected at 100 K at Station 9.6 SRS Daresbury, UK. Crystals were monoclinic and belonged to space group C2 (a = 146.6 Å, b = 67.3 Å, c = 39.7 Å, β = 94.53°). Data collection statistics are shown insupplemental Table 1. Reflections were integrated using MOSFLM (31Leslie A.W.G. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and were scaled using the CCP4 suite of crystallographic software (32Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The validated coordinates and structure factors for the crystal structure containing the synaptojanin WVXF and the amphyphysin1 FEDNFVP have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (36Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar) (PDB code 2vj0). Figures were generated using Aesop, 9M. Noble, personal communication. and the peptide interaction map was generated using the output from LIGPLOT (37Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4368) Google Scholar) as a starting point. The region in amphiphysin1 necessary for binding to the AP2 complex has been mapped to residues 322-340, and binding is enhanced if the region is extended to 322-363 (38Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17583-17589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This includes the FEDNF328 and the DPF359 motifs (Fig. 1A). A further extension to include the PWXXW had no additional effect on binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that a construct from residues 1-378, which forms a dimer because of its N-terminal BAR domain (26Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), binds to the α-adaptin appendage with an affinity of 1.6 μm but does not interact with the β2-adaptin appendage (Fig. 1B). This affinity is very similar to the one measured for the 12-mer DNF-peptide INFFEDNFVPEI (7Praefcke G.J. Ford M.G. Schmid E.M. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Peak-Chew S.Y. Vallis Y. Babu M.M. Mills I.G. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4371-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, the stoichiometry of the interaction between the α-adaptin appendage and the amphiphysin protein, as well as the DNF 12-mer, is 1:1. A longer construct, residues 1-390, comprising the FXDXF, DPF, and the PWXXW motifs, had a similar affinity, although a contribution of a second very weak binding site becomes visible (data not shown). Thus, the FEDNF in amphiphysin1 is the major determinant for the binding to the α-adaptin appendage. Adaptor Binding by Amphiphysin via FXDNF and DPF Motifs–We extended these observations by mutagenesis of both motifs sequentially and simultaneously and show that AP2 binding to the DNF motif at residue 326 is stronger than binding to the DPF at residue 357 (Fig. 2A). Mutations of both DNF and DPF motifs to SGA are even more effective than the single mutants in disrupting binding. In pulldown experiments from brain and COS-7 cell extracts, α- and β-adaptins follow the same pattern, because they are part of the same complex (AP2). We already know from Fig. 1 that amphiphysin is specific for α-adaptin. There is also no interaction of γ- and δ-adaptins with amphiphysin, showing that AP1 and AP3 complexes in COS-7 extracts do not bind to amphiphysin (Fig. 2A). From this it is clear that both motifs contribute to AP2 binding, but there is a clear difference in affinity for the α-adaptin appendage. In Amph2 the FEDAF motif is the major binding sequence for AP2 adaptors (Fig. 2C). Given the strong effect of mutagenesis of the FXDXF motifs in amphiphysin1 and -2, we tested how well other residues might substitute (Fig. 2, B and C). The initial surprise was that FXDPF does not substitute for FXDNF but that FXDPW does. The structural basis for this is not clear, but different peptides can bind in different conformations. The FEDNF peptide from amphiphysin and the FKDSF from synaptojanin bind in an extended conformation where the first F in this binds into the pocket formed by Phe-836, Phe-837, and Trp-840 (7Praefcke G.J. Ford M.G. Schmid E.M. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Peak-Chew S.Y. Vallis Y. Babu M.M. Mills I.G. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4371-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This cannot be the case for most DX(F/W) peptides that do not have an equivalent Phe residue, and the proline residue in the DP(F/W) motifs forces the peptide into a loop structure. Binding is also possible when the Asn residue in the FEDNF motif of amphiphysin1 is replaced by Ser, Ala, Asp, or Ile, whereas Gly and Leu abolish the interaction. For amphiphysin2, we looked at a more limited set of substitutions (Fig. 2C), but again the change of FXDAF to FXDPF weakens the interaction. The FXDXFis the major binding motif of amphiphysins; however, we should be very cautious in extending this observation to other proteins that have other nonconserve"
https://openalex.org/W2105590935,"Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation modulates myocardial contractility and relaxation during beta-adrenergic stimulation. cTnI differs from the skeletal isoform in that it has a cardiac specific N' extension of 32 residues (N' extension). The role of the acidic N' region in modulating cardiac contractility has not been fully defined. To test the hypothesis that the acidic N' region of cTnI helps regulate myocardial function, we generated cardiac-specific transgenic mice in which residues 2-11 (cTnI(Delta2-11)) were deleted. The hearts displayed significantly decreased contraction and relaxation under basal and beta-adrenergic stress compared to nontransgenic hearts, with a reduction in maximal Ca(2+)-dependent force and maximal Ca(2+)-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity. However, Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development and cTnI-Ser(23/24) phosphorylation were not affected. Chemical shift mapping shows that both cTnI and cTnI(Delta2-11) interact with the N lobe of cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and that phosphorylation at Ser(23/24) weakens these interactions. These observations suggest that residues 2-11 of cTnI, comprising the acidic N' region, do not play a direct role in the calcium-induced transition in the cardiac regulatory or N lobe of cTnC. We hypothesized that phosphorylation at Ser(23/24) induces a large conformational change positioning the conserved acidic N region to compete with actin for the inhibitory region of cTnI. Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of the conserved acidic N' region results in a decrease in myocardial contractility in the cTnI(Delta2-11) mice demonstrating the importance of acidic N' region in regulating myocardial contractility and mediating the response of the heart to beta-AR stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2055671926,"Mutations in virtually all of the proteins comprising the cardiac muscle sarcomere have been implicated in causing Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC). Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) remain among the most common causes of FHC, with the widely studied R403Q mutation resulting in an especially severe clinical prognosis. In vitro functional studies of cardiac myosin containing the R403Q mutation have revealed significant changes in enzymatic and mechanical properties compared to wild-type myosin. It has been proposed that these molecular changes must trigger events that ultimately lead to the clinical phenotype.Here we examine the structural consequences of the R403Q mutation in a recombinant smooth muscle myosin subfragment (S1), whose kinetic features have much in common with slow beta-MHC. We obtained three-dimensional reconstructions of wild-type and R403Q smooth muscle S1 bound to actin filaments in the presence (ADP) and absence (apo) of nucleotide by electron cryomicroscopy and image analysis. We observed that the mutant S1 was attached to actin at highly variable angles compared to wild-type reconstructions, suggesting a severe disruption of the actin-myosin interaction at the interface.These results provide structural evidence that disarray at the molecular level may be linked to the histopathological myocyte disarray characteristic of the diseased state."

https://openalex.org/W2075995390,"Regulated ubiquitination and degradation of signaling proteins have emerged as key mechanisms for modulating the strength and duration of signaling pathways. The reversible nature of the ubiquitination process as well as the large number and diversity of the deubiquitinating enzymes raise the possibility that signaling pathways might be modulated by specific deubiquitinating enzyme(s). Here we provide evidence that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Pkc1-mediated signaling pathway that controls the cell wall integrity is negatively regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3. Disruption of the UBP3 gene leads to an enhanced activation of the cell wall integrity pathway MAPK Slt2 when cells are challenged with a variety of pathway activation agents such as pheromone and Congo red. The ubp3 deletion mutants accumulate high levels of Pkc1, suggesting potential regulation of Pkc1 by Ubp3. Consistent with this, Pkc1 and Ubp3 interact in vivo, and the stability of Pkc1 is markedly increased in the ubp3 deletion mutants. Moreover, disruption of the PKC1 gene, but not the genes that encode components downstream of Pkc1, completely suppresses other phenotypes displayed by the ubp3 deletion mutants such as hyperactivation of the pheromone-responsive MAPK Fus3 (Wang, Y., and Dohlman, H. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15766–15772). These findings demonstrate that Ubp3 can regulate Pkc1 by facilitating its destruction and provide the initial evidence that Pkc1 plays a positive role in modulating the parallel pheromone-signaling pathway.

All cells have the capacity to sense various environmental stimuli and then generate an appropriate intracellular response. One common mechanism for detecting and transmitting extracellular signals uses cell surface receptors coupled to intracellular heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). In this signaling system, a receptor captures an extracellular stimulus and switches on its coupled G proteins, which in turn activate the downstream effector proteins, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMAPKKMAPK kinaseMAPKKKMAPK kinase kinase.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs go on and activate many of their cellular targets, including nuclear transcription factors, cytoskeleton proteins, and other enzymes, to enable the cells to generate appropriate responses to the perceived stimulus (3Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase. Studies in signaling regulation typically focused on the behavior of individual signaling pathways. However, the cellular responses to a given stimulus often involve the actions of multiple parallel signaling pathways, and the mechanisms underlying their coordination are largely unknown (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pheromone stimulation primarily activates a signaling cascade that includes a heterotrimeric G protein (Gpa1/Ste4/Ste18) and a MAPK complex (Ste11/Ste7/Fus3) (Fig. 1), which is responsible for most of the cellular responses such as growth arrest and new gene transcription that are triggered by pheromone (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 4Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Science. 2004; 306: 1508-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Pheromone stimulation also activates a parallel signaling pathway that primarily controls the cell wall synthesis and thereby maintains the cell integrity (5Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The key components of the cell wall integrity pathway include the upstream kinase Pkc1, which is the sole protein kinase C homolog in yeast, and a MAPK cascade composed of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) Bck1, the two redundant MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) Mkk1 and Mkk2, and the MAPK Mpk1/Slt2 (6Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Signaling from the pheromone pathway to Mpk1/Slt2 is achieved via two distinct routes: one via Ste20-induced morphological change and the other via Ste12-mediated new gene transcription (5Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Whether activation of the cell wall integrity pathway may in turn contribute to modulation of the activity of the pheromone-responsive MAPK Fus3 is unclear. Post-translational modification is one of the most widely used mechanisms for regulating the activities of signaling proteins. With regards to MAPK components, much of the effort has focused on phosphorylation. Recent studies indicate that MAPK components also undergo ubiquitination, a modification typically leading to protein degradation (8Laine A. Ronai Z. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar to phosphorylation, the ubiquitination process is reversible. Removal of conjugated ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains from substrates is facilitated by deubiquitinating enzymes (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are a total of 17 deubiquitinating enzymes; in human, genome analysis revealed the existence of 95 such enzymes (11Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). One remarkable characteristic of deubiquitinating enzymes is their diversity. Outside their catalytic domains, there are very few structural similarities (12Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The large number and the diversity of those enzymes suggest that each might have a specific function in regulating biological processes (13Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, several deubiquitinating enzymes with specific substrates and regulatory functions have been identified. The most notable examples are HAUSP in mammals, which specifically regulates the stability of both p53 and Mdm2 (14Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W.

Here we provide evidence that the yeast Pkc1-mediated signaling is modulated by the specific deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3. Ubp3 interacts with Pkc1 and facilitates its destruction. We also demonstrate that a functional Pkc1 is required for maintaining the optimal activation of the parallel pheromone signaling pathway and thus reveal a previously unknown level of cross-talk between the cell wall integrity and pheromone response pathways. Strains and Plasmids—Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout. The yeast S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ), BY4741-derived mutants lacking MPK1 (SLT2), UBP1, UBP2, UBP3, DOA4 (UBP4, SSV7, NPI2, ASI7), UBP5, UBP6, UBP7, UBP8, UBP9, UBP11, UBP12, UBP13, UBP14, UBP15, and UBP16 (LPF12) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL); BY4741-derived mutants lacking both MPK1 (SLT2) and UBP3 (mpk1::KanMX ubp3::HIS3, this work); YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801am ade2-101oc trp1-Δ 63 his3-Δ 200 leu2-Δ 1); YPH499-derived mutants lacking UBP3 (ubp3::KanMX), and PKC1 (pkc1::LEU2, from J. Thorner, University of California, Berkeley, CA), and both UBP3 and PKC1 (ubp3::KanMX pkc1::LEU2, this work). Expression plasmids used in this study that have been described previously are pRS316-GAL-STE4 and YCp50-STE11-4 (from George Sprague, University of Oregon), pYES-GAL-UBP3C469S (18Wang Y. Ge Q.

Overexpression of His6-tagged PKC1 was achieved by PCR amplification and subcloning into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (2 μm, URA3, GAL1 promoter, CYC1 terminator) (Invitrogen). PCR primers were 5′-CCA GAA TGA GTT TTT CAC AAT TGG AGC-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TAA ATC CAA ATC ATC TGG C-3′. The PKC1 allele encoding a constitutively active form of Pkc1 (Pkc1R398A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PKC1 in pYES2.1 as the template (Qiagen).

Growth, Transcription, Phosphorylation, and Degradation Bioassays—Growth and reporter transcription assays in response to pheromone was conducted as described previously (19Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Fus3, Kss1, and Mpk1/Slt2 was monitored by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts following the same procedures described previously (20Slessareva J.E. Routt S.M. Temple B. Bankaitis V.A. Dohlman H.G. Cell. 2006; 126: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To monitor the stability of Pkc1, mid-log cell cultures grown on galactose-containing medium (PKC1 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1) were switched to glucose-containing medium for up to 120 min. Growth was stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaN3 and transfer to an ice bath. Cells were washed and resuspended directly in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min, subjected to glass bead homogenization, and clarified by microcentrifugation. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with antibodies to phospho-p44/42 at 1:1000 (from Cell Signaling), Pgk1 at 1:75,000 (from J. Thorner), ubiquitin at 1:100 (Sigma), penta-His at 1:1000 (Qiagen), and Mpk1 (yC-20) at 1:500 and Pkc1 (yC-20) at 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The anti-Pkc1 antibody was precleared by incubating it with membranes containing yeast cell extracts from the pkc1Δ cells. Immunoreactive species were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Specificity of detection was established using mpk1Δ, fus3Δ, kss1Δ, and pkc1Δ cell extracts as negative controls. Immunoprecipitation—The association of Pkc1 and Ubp3 was examined by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Ubp3 and immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies for the detection of His-tagged Pkc1. Cells (50 ml) cotransformed with plasmids pYES-PKC1-His6 and pAD4M-UBP3-FLAG were grown to A600 nm ∼ 1, harvested, and resuspended in 550 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one pellet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). This and all subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were subjected to glass bead vortex homogenization for 30 s, repeated 8 times, and centrifuged twice at 6000 × g for 5 and 25 min. Lysates were incubated for 2 h with a bead volume of 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 s, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 3 min, repeated four times before final resuspension in 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each sample was resolved by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-His monoclonal antibodies at 1:1000 or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies at 1:2000. Data Quantification and Statistical Analysis—Band intensities of Western blot analysis were quantified using the Image J software from the National Institutes of Health. Where indicated, the data were statistically analyzed by t test with a p value of <0.050 considered significant. Regulated ubiquitination and degradation have emerged as important mechanisms to modulate the strength and duration of cell signaling (8Laine A. Ronai Z. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar to phosphorylation, the ubiquitination process is reversible. Removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains from conjugated substrates is catalyzed by a family of deubiquitinating enzymes (21Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). Genome analysis in humans revealed the existence of more than 90 deubiquitinating enzymes (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar); in yeast, a total of 17 such enzymes have been identified (11Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). Remarkably, other than the catalytic regions, there are limited similarities among all these enzymes. An appealing hypothesis to explain the large number and diversity of the deubiquitinating enzymes is that each of them might have a specific function in regulating a certain biological process. To test this hypothesis and to identify additional mechanisms for MAPK regulation, we examined the regulatory role of the specific deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3 on MAPK signaling. We chose Ubp3 because our previous work demonstrated that disruption of UBP3, but not any other UBP genes, led to hyperactivation of pheromone signaling in yeast as measured by growth arrest and reporter transcription assays (19Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The signaling phenotypes displayed by the ubp3Δ mutants suggest that the activity of the pheromone-responsive MAPK Fus3 might be up-regulated in the mutants. Therefore we examined first whether this is indeed the case. For this purpose, we monitored the activation status of Fus3 in wild-type cells versus the ubp3Δ mutants treated with the mating pheromone α factor over time. The activation status of Fus3 can be conveniently monitored by immunoblotting with a phosphor-specific antibody directed against dually phosphorylated (Thr202/ Tyr204) p44/42 MAPK (22Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As expected, phosphorylation and thus activation of both Fus3 and Kss1, a redundant pheromone-responsive MAPK, in the ubp3Δ mutants were substantially increased, especially in the later time points of pheromone treatment (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous work (5Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Errede B. Cade R.M. Yashar B.M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), pheromone stimulation also induced phosphorylation of Mpk1/Slt2, a MAPK primarily responsible for maintaining cell wall integrity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, pheromone-induced phosphorylation of Mpk1/Slt2 occurred much faster and to a greater extent in the ubp3Δ mutants compared with wild type. These effects did not appear to be caused by an alteration of Mpk1 stability, as the abundance of Mpk1 were essentially the same in both wild-type and ubp3Δ mutant cells, with or without pheromone treatment (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The rapid and enhanced activation of Mpk1/Slt2 with no change in its expression observed in the ubp3Δ mutants suggests that a certain component upstream of Mpk1/Slt2 might be negatively regulated by Ubp3. An expectation of this model would be that the ubp3Δ mutants should similarly augment the activation of Mpk1/Slt2 when treated with other stimuli that can activate the cell wall integrity pathway. To test this, we treated the mutant and wild-type cells with the commonly used cell wall-stressing agent Congo red (24Roncero C. Duran A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Flandez M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martin H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and monitored the activation status of Mpk1/Slt2 using the same phospho-specific antibody. Once again, we observed an increase of Mpk1 phosphorylation in the ubp3Δ mutants compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). The ubp3Δ cells showed a growth defect in the presence of Congo red (Fig. 2C) similar to the phenotype displayed by the msg5Δ mutants, which lack a functional phosphatase for Mpk1/Slt2 (25Flandez M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martin H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine whether any other ubp deletion mutants display a similar phenotype, we monitored the Congo red sensitivity of the following available ubp deletion mutants from the systematic yeast deletion collection: ubp1Δ, ubp2Δ, ubp4Δ, ubp5Δ, ubp6Δ, ubp7Δ, ubp8Δ, ubp9Δ, ubp11Δ, ubp12Δ, ubp13Δ, ubp14Δ, and ubp15Δ. None of these mutants displayed an abnormal sensitivity to Congo red (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicate that Ubp3 negatively regulates the activation of Mpk1/Slt2, possibly at a step upstream of Mpk1/Slt2, and that this regulatory effect appears to be specific to Ubp3. Both pheromone- and Congo red-induced phosphorylation of Mpk1/Slt2 requires Pkc1, the sole homolog of mammalian protein kinase C in yeast. Previous work showed that compared with wild type, a constitutively active mutant of Pkc1, i.e. Pkc1R380A, was underproduced by a factor of 4 (26Watanabe M. Chen C.Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16829-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that activated Pkc1 might be unstable and that the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3 may facilitate its degradation. To test this idea, we initially compared the stability of Pkc1 and Pkc1R380A. For this purpose, we expressed both alleles under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1. Upon induction with galactose for 6–8 h, we turned off the expression of both alleles by switching the cells to noninducing glucose-containing medium and tracked the presence of the proteins over time. This method has been commonly used in estimating the half-life of proteins (27Esch R.K. Errede B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Verma R. Oania R. Graumann J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). By this assay, Pkc1 appears to be a fairly unstable protein with an estimated half-life of 70 min; as expected, the constitutively active Pkc1R380A was significantly less stable (Fig. 3A). To examine whether Ubp3 facilitates the destruction of Pkc1, we compared the stability of Pkc1 in wild-type versus ubp3Δ mutant cells using the same approaches described above. As shown in Fig. 3B, disruption of UBP3 gene dramatically stabilized Pkc1. To determine whether an increase in Pkc1 stability would lead to an accumulation of the protein, we compared the steady-state levels of Pkc1 in wild type versus ubp3Δ mutants by immunoblotting. Indeed, compared with wild type, the level of Pkc1 was significantly increased in the ubp3Δ mutants (Fig. 3C). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of Ubp3 resulted in the copurification of Pkc1 (Fig. 3D), further suggesting direct regulation of Pkc1 by Ubp3. These findings indicate that the stability of Pkc1 is affected by its activation status and that proteolysis of Pkc1 is facilitated by Ubp3. Regulation of Pkc1 stability by Ubp3 suggests that Pkc1 might be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To test this possibility, we measured the abundance of Pkc1 in temperature-sensitive cim3-1 and cim5-1 mutants, which at the restrictive temperature have severely impaired proteasomal protease activity. Cim3 (also known as Rpt6) and Cim5 (also called Rpt1) are subunits of the proteasome 19 S regulatory particle, which confers specificity for ubiquitinated proteins for presentation to the proteasome proteolytic subunits. As expected, Pkc1 expression was significantly enriched in both cim3-1 and cim5-1 mutants in the pheromone treated cells, confirming that the abundance of Pkc1 protein is controlled by the proteasome (Fig. 4). We reasoned that if Pkc1 is a functionally relevant target of Ubp3 in the cell wall integrity pathway, constitutive signaling achieved via overexpression of pathway components upstream or downstream of Pkc1 might be differentially affected by loss of Ubp3 activity. Specifically, constitutive signaling from upstream but not downstream components of Pkc1 would be further augmented in the ubp3Δ mutants. To test this predication, we first screened for the components in the pathway whose overexpression would lead to activation of Mpk1/Slt2. From this analysis, we found that overexpression of ROM1 or BCK1 activated Mpk1/Slt2 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). ROM1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G protein Rho1, which acts upstream of Pkc1, whereas BCK1 encodes the MAPKK Bck1, which is a direct target of Pkc1 (Fig. 1). Consistent with our model that Pkc1 is a functional target of Ubp3, constitutive signaling from upstream of Pkc1 (by overexpression of ROM1) but not from downstream of Pkc1 (by overexpression of BCK1) was further increased in the ubp3Δ mutants (Fig. 5, A and B). An increase in the abundance of either Rom1 or Rho1, two components immediately upstream of Pkc1, would give the same outcome in the ubp3Δ mutants. However, this was not the case, as the level of neither protein was increased in the ubp3Δ mutants (data not shown). Having established a regulatory role of Ubp3 in Pkc1 proteolysis, we next sought to examine whether up-regulation of Pkc1 in the ubp3Δ mutant could account for its phenotype of hyperactivation of pheromone-responsive MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 (Fig. 2A). For this purpose, we constructed a yeast strain that lacks both PKC1 and UBP3 and monitored the kinetics of Fus3 and Kss1 activation in response to pheromone treatment. Remarkably, the enhancement of Fus3 activation observed in the ubp3Δ mutants upon pheromone treatment was completely suppressed by an additional disruption of PKC1 (Figs. 2A and 6A). An obvious interpretation of this result is that abnormal up-regulation of Pkc1 itself is responsible for the persistent activation of Fus3 in the ubp3Δ mutant cells. Alternatively, as Pkc1 is required for transmitting basal signaling to its downstream components, including Bck1 and Mpk1/Slt2, up-regulation of any of these proteins by Ubp3, which in turn regulates the activation status of Fus3, would potentially give the same outcome. To dissect these possibilities, we further analyzed the activation status of Fus3 in the UBP3 defective mutant cells that also lack BCK1 or MPK1. For these purposes, we made use of a dominant-negative allele of UBP3 (i.e. UBP3C459S (18Wang Y. Ge Q. Houston D. Thorner J. Errede B. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22284-22289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) to disrupt Ubp3 function in wild-type versus mutant cells that lack PKC1, BCK1, or MPK1. As expected, expression of UBP3C459S in wild-type cells, but not in pkc1Δ mutant cells, significantly increased Fus3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, B and C). However, phosphorylation of Fus3 in bck1Δ or mpk1Δ mutant cells was enhanced when the dominant-negative allele of UBP3 was expressed (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the effect of Ubp3 on the activation status of Fus3 requires Pkc1 but not its downstream component Bck1 or Mpk1. The above data support a model in which an enhancement of Pkc1 activity in the ubp3Δ mutants leads to the persistent and augmented activation of Fus3 in response to pheromone stimulation. A logical implication of this model is that Pkc1 might have a previously unappreciated role in pheromone signaling, such as the maintenance of optimal activation of Fus3. To test this, we analyzed the status of pheromone-induced activation of Fus3 in cells lacking PKC1. As shown in Fig. 7A, disruption of PKC1 significantly diminished the strength of Fus3 activation, indicating that Fus3 or certain components upstream of Fus3 might be regulated by Pkc1. To determine where in the pheromone pathway Pkc1 operates, we compared signaling in wild-type and pkc1Δ cells activated at different points downstream of the pheromone receptor. For this analysis, the pathway was activated in two distinctive ways. In the first case, we overexpressed STE4, which leads to an increase in cellular Gβγ beyond that which can bind to Gα and as a consequence leads to constitutive signaling. In the second case, we used an activated allele of the MAPKKK STE11 (STE11-4) containing a single amino acid substitution (T596I) within the catalytic domain. Constitutive activation by STE11-4 is unaffected by mutations in the receptor (Ste2) or Gβ (Ste4) but is blocked by mutations in the downstream MAPKK (Ste7), or MAPK (Fus3, Kss1). Thus STE11-4 activates signaling at a well defined step in the pathway between Ste20 and Ste7. The pkc1Δ mutant can diminish signaling by overexpression of STE4 (Fig. 7, B, left panel, and C) but not of STE11-4 (B, right panel, and C). These data indicate that Pkc1 regulates pheromone signaling at the step(s) between the Gβ Ste4 and the MAPKKK Ste11. Many biological processes are regulated by protein kinase-mediated signaling pathways. A clear understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of these signaling pathways is essential in revealing new disease mechanisms and designing novel approaches for pharmaceutical intervention. Studies of the signaling regulation typically focused on phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of signaling components. Recent studies indicate that an alteration of the abundance of many of the same components also plays an important role in modulating signaling strength and duration (8Laine A. Ronai Z. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Examples can be found in both yeast and mammalian cells and include cell surface receptors, G proteins, MAPKKKs, a MAPKK, and numerous transcription factors (9Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we provided evidence that the abundance of Pkc1, the sole protein kinase C homolog in yeast, is negatively regulated by the specific deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3. Disruption of UBP3 dramatically stabilizes Pkc1 and consequently leads to a significant increase in its abundance. As a result, signaling mediated by Pkc1 is up-regulated in the ubp3Δ mutants. Pkc1 and Ubp3 physically interact, suggesting a direct regulation of Pkc1 by Ubp3. In mammalian cells, protein kinase C is known to be regulated by ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis. It has been shown that activation leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of protein kinase C in renal epithelial cells as well as in 3Y1 rat fibroblasts (29Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus it is not surprising that the stability of Pkc1 is dependent on its activation status. Our data further suggest that the degradation of activated Pkc1 is facilitated by a specific deubiquitinating enzyme, raising the possibility that such an additional layer of regulation might exist in mammalian cells. Genomic analysis indicates Usp10 as a Ubp3 homolog in humans; thus it would be interesting to examine whether disruption of USP10 would result in a similar up-regulation of protein kinase C-mediated signaling in mammalian cells. Identification of a specific deubiquitinating enzyme as a regulator for protein kinase C will provide a new avenue to pharmacologically modulate signaling mediated by protein kinase C, as specific inhibition of a deubiquitinating enzyme is fairly easy to achieve. A remaining challenge is to understand the mechanism by which Ubp3 destabilizes Pkc1. Our analysis clearly indicates that Pkc1 is a substrate of the proteasome, as its abundance is significantly increased in proteasome-deficient cim3-1 and cim5-1 mutants. Certain proteasome-associating deubiquitinating enzymes such as Rpn11 have been demonstrated to facilitate substrate proteolysis by removing the conjugated ubiquitin chain from the substrates that have been delivered to the proteasome (31Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. II I Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). It is appealing to speculate that Ubp3 might play a similar role in facilitating selected substrates, including Pkc1, for degradation in the proteasome. Pheromone-induced activation of the cell wall integrity pathway has been studied extensively (5Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, whether the activated cell wall integrity pathway in turn regulates pheromone response has not been investigated fully. Here we provided evidence that a functional Pkc1 is required for maximal activation of the mating pathway-specific MAPK Fus3. Epistasis analysis using multiple well characterized strategies revealed that in the pheromone pathway the step(s) that integrate input from Pkc1 lies between the Gβ Ste4 and the MAPKK Ste11. One exciting possibility is that Pkc1 directly phosphorylates components in the pheromone pathway and as such to enhance the activation of such components. Based on the data of epistasis analysis, such a component could either be the MAPKKK Ste11 or its upstream component such as Ste50. Another possibility that may explain the phenotype is the competition of a common phosphatase by pheromone and cell wall integrity pathways. Although it is purely speculative, it is possible that there is a common phosphatase that inactivates both Ste11, the MAPKKK in the pheromone pathway, and Bck1, the corresponding kinase in the cell wall integrity pathway. Activation of Bck1 by Pkc1 might diminish the negative effect of such a phosphatase on the activated Ste11; conversely, lack of Pkc1 would favor the action of such a phosphatase on Ste11. Consequently, the pkc1Δ mutants would display a diminished activation of Fus3, as we have observed here. Regardless of the mechanism, our data clearly suggest a new connection between the pheromone and cell wall integrity pathways, which reinforces the idea that any biological process is a result of the coordination of parallel signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2034785581,"The envelope protein domain III (ED3) of West Nile virus is the major virus-specific neutralization domain and harbors most of the critical mutations that induce resistance against antibody-mediated neutralization. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of neutralization resistance by studying the biophysical perturbations of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-resistant mutations on ED3 wild type. Our results showed that although the solution structure between ED3 wild type and mutants was preserved, the mutations that confer the highest degree of resistance to mAbs showed low protein stability and high local dynamic motions. Interestingly, the latter was observed in regions outside the mutation sites, indicating long range communications within ED3. Thus, we hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in resistance to mAb neutralization may include, in addition to mutations in the epitope, long range effects among distant structural elements. This hypothesis is consistent with reported mutations in other flaviviruses whose surfaces are not exposed for the interaction with other macromolecules, yet they confer mAb neutralization resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2016035695,"Background The FFAR1 receptor is expressed mainly in pancreatic beta cells and is activated by medium to long chain free fatty acids (FFAs), as well as by thiazolidinediones, resulting in elevated Ca2+ concentrations and promotion of insulin secretion. These properties suggest that FFAR1 could be a mediator of lipotoxicity and a potential candidate gene for Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore investigated whether variations at the FFAR1 locus are associated with T2D and beta cell function. Methodology/Principal Findings We re-sequenced the FFAR1 region in 96 subjects (48 healthy and 48 T2D individuals) and found 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 8 of which were not previously described. Two SNPs located in the upstream region of the FFAR1 gene (rs1978013 and rs1978014) were chosen and genotyped in 1929 patients with T2D and 1405 healthy control subjects. We observed an association of rs1978013 and rs1978014 with insulinogenic index in males (p = 0.024) and females (p = 0.032), respectively. After Bonferroni corrections, no association with T2D was found in the case-control material, however a haplotype consisting of the T-G alleles conferred protection against T2D (p = 0.0010). Conclusions/Significance Variation in the FFAR1 gene may contribute to impaired beta cell function in T2D."
